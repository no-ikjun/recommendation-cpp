 The easiest method to perform this technique is the needle cricothyrotomy ( also referred to as a percutaneous <unk> cricothyrotomy ) , in which a large @-@ bore ( 12 – 14 gauge ) intravenous catheter is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane . Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation . However , while needle cricothyrotomy may be life @-@ saving in extreme circumstances , this technique is only intended to be a <unk> measure until a definitive airway can be established . While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation , the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide ( ventilation ) . After one hour of <unk> oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy , one can expect a PaCO2 of greater than 250 mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6 @.@ 72 , despite an oxygen saturation of 98 % or greater . A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy , in which a 5 to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 to 0 @.@ 24 in ) endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision . 
 Several manufacturers market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits , which enable one to use either a wire @-@ guided percutaneous <unk> ( Seldinger ) technique , or the classic surgical technique to insert a <unk> catheter through the cricothyroid membrane . The kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites , as well as ambulances and other selected pre @-@ hospital settings . 
 = = = Tracheotomy = = = 
 Tracheotomy consists of making an incision on the front of the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea . The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted ; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth . The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle ( referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively ) and both techniques are widely used in current practice . In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves ( the nerves that control the voicebox ) , the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible . If only one of these nerves is damaged , the patient 's voice may be impaired ( dysphonia ) ; if both of the nerves are damaged , the patient will be unable to speak ( aphonia ) . In the acute setting , indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy . In the chronic setting , indications for tracheotomy include the need for long @-@ term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions ( e.g. , comatose patients , or extensive surgery involving the head and neck ) . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 There are significant differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults , and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient . The differences , which are quite significant in infants , gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index . 
 For infants and young children , orotracheal intubation is easier than the nasotracheal route . <unk> intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding . Despite the greater difficulty , nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube . As with adults , there are a number of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children . Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients . 
 Because the airway of a child is narrow , a small amount of <unk> or tracheal swelling can produce critical obstruction . Inserting a tube that is too large relative to the diameter of the trachea can cause swelling . Conversely , inserting a tube that is too small can result in inability to achieve effective positive pressure ventilation due to retrograde escape of gas through the glottis and out the mouth and nose ( often referred to as a " leak " around the tube ) . An excessive leak can usually be corrected by inserting a larger tube or a cuffed tube . 
 The tip of a correctly positioned tracheal tube will be in the mid @-@ trachea , between the <unk> on an <unk> chest radiograph . The correct diameter of the tube is that which results in a small leak at a pressure of about 25 cm ( 10 in ) of water . The appropriate inner diameter for the endotracheal tube is estimated to be roughly the same diameter as the child 's little finger . The appropriate length for the endotracheal tube can be estimated by doubling the distance from the corner of the child 's mouth to the ear canal . For premature infants 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 in ) internal diameter is an appropriate size for the tracheal tube . For infants of normal gestational age , 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) internal diameter is an appropriate size . For normally nourished children 1 year of age and older , two formulae are used to estimate the appropriate diameter and depth for tracheal intubation . The internal diameter of the tube in mm is ( patient 's age in years + 16 ) / 4 , while the appropriate depth of insertion cm is 12 + ( patient 's age in years / 2 ) .

 = = Predicting difficulty = = 
 Tracheal intubation is not a simple procedure and the consequences of failure are grave . Therefore , the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand . This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination , the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems . The proposed surgical procedure ( e.g. , surgery involving the head and neck , or bariatric surgery ) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation . Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy , such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw , or those who have tumors , deep swelling due to injury or to allergy , developmental abnormalities of the jaw , or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck . Using conventional <unk> techniques , intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients . This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway . Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases . However , these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase , maintain and repair . 
 When taking the patient 's medical history , the subject is questioned about any significant signs or symptoms , such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing . These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway , larynx , or tracheobronchial tree . A history of previous surgery ( e.g. , previous cervical fusion ) , injury , radiation therapy , or tumors involving the head , neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation . Previous experiences with tracheal intubation , especially difficult intubation , intubation for prolonged duration ( e.g. , intensive care unit ) or prior tracheotomy are also noted . 
 A detailed physical examination of the airway is important , particularly : 
 the range of motion of the cervical spine : the subject should be able to tilt the head back and then forward so that the chin touches the chest . 
 the range of motion of the jaw ( the temporomandibular joint ) : three of the subject 's fingers should be able to fit between the upper and lower incisors . 
 the size and shape of the upper jaw and lower jaw , looking especially for problems such as maxillary hypoplasia ( an underdeveloped upper jaw ) , micrognathia ( an abnormally small jaw ) , or <unk> ( misalignment of the upper and lower jaw ) . 
 the <unk> distance : three of the subject 's fingers should be able to fit between the Adam 's apple and the chin . 
 the size and shape of the tongue and palate relative to the size of the mouth . 
 the teeth , especially noting the presence of prominent maxillary incisors , any loose or damaged teeth , or crowns . 
 Many classification systems have been developed in an effort to predict difficulty of tracheal intubation , including the Cormack @-@ Lehane classification system , the Intubation Difficulty Scale ( IDS ) , and the <unk> score . The <unk> score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation . It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth , and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula , <unk> pillars and the soft palate . Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients , no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate . Furthermore , one study of experienced anesthesiologists , on the widely used Cormack – Lehane classification system , found they did not score the same patients consistently over time , and that only 25 % could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack – Lehane classification system . Under certain emergency circumstances ( e.g. , severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury ) , it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation . In such cases , alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available . 
 = = Complications = = 
 Tracheal intubation is generally considered the best method for airway management under a wide variety of circumstances , as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration . However , tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed . 
 Four anatomic features must be present for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward : adequate mouth opening ( full range of motion of the temporomandibular joint ) , sufficient pharyngeal space ( determined by examining the back of the mouth ) , sufficient submandibular space ( distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin , the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the <unk> to view the glottis ) , and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the <unk> @-@ occipital joint . If any of these variables is in any way compromised , intubation should be expected to be difficult . 
 Minor complications are common after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube . These are typically of short duration , such as sore throat , lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway , chipped , fractured or dislodged teeth , and nasal injury . Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat , high blood pressure , elevated intracranial and <unk> pressure , and bronchospasm . 
 More serious complications include <unk> , perforation of the trachea or esophagus , pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents or other foreign bodies , fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine , temporomandibular joint or <unk> cartilages , decreased oxygen content , elevated arterial carbon dioxide , and vocal cord weakness . In addition to these complications , tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding . Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence of some of these complications , though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill on the part of the laryngoscopist . 
 Complications may also be severe and long @-@ lasting or permanent , such as vocal cord damage , esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess , bronchial intubation , or nerve injury . They may even be immediately life @-@ threatening , such as <unk> and negative pressure pulmonary edema ( fluid in the lungs ) , aspiration , unrecognized esophageal intubation , or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube . Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and / or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery ( <unk> fistula ) or esophagus ( <unk> fistula ) . Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity , ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea . The cuff pressure is monitored carefully in order to avoid complications from over @-@ inflation , many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa . A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10 – 15 % and procedural mortality of 0 % , which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States . 
 Inability to secure the airway , with subsequent failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life @-@ threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content , brain damage , cardiovascular collapse , and death . When performed improperly , the associated complications ( e.g. , unrecognized esophageal intubation ) may be rapidly fatal . Without adequate training and experience , the incidence of such complications is high . The case of Andrew Davis Hughes , from Emerald Isle , NC is a widely known case in which the patient was improperly intubated and , due to the lack of oxygen , suffered severe brain damage and died . For example , among paramedics in several United States urban communities , unrecognized esophageal or <unk> intubation has been reported to be 6 % to 25 % . Although not common , where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate , reported success rates are as low as 51 % . In one study , nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room . Because of this , recent editions of the American Heart Association 's Guidelines for <unk> Resuscitation have de @-@ emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag @-@ valve @-@ mask ventilation , the laryngeal mask airway and the <unk> . 
 One complication — unintentional and unrecognized intubation of the esophagus — is both common ( as frequent as 25 % in the hands of inexperienced personnel ) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome . In such cases , oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach , from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system , instead of the lungs . If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected , death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia . 
 Of 4 @,@ 460 claims in the American Society of <unk> ( ASA ) Closed Claims Project database , 266 ( approximately 6 % ) were for airway injury . Of these 266 cases , 87 % of the injuries were temporary , 5 % were permanent or disabling , and 8 % resulted in death . Difficult intubation , age older than 60 years , and female gender were associated with claims for perforation of the esophagus or pharynx . Early signs of perforation were present in only 51 % of perforation claims , whereas late sequelae occurred in 65 % . 
 = = Alternatives = = 
 Although it offers the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration , tracheal intubation is not the only means to maintain a patent airway . Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen , volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask airway , i @-@ gel , cuffed oropharyngeal airway , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP mask ) , nasal <unk> mask , simple face mask , and nasal cannula . 
 General anesthesia is often administered without tracheal intubation in selected cases where the procedure is brief in duration , or procedures where the depth of anesthesia is not sufficient to cause significant compromise in ventilatory function . Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures , a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea , provided that patients are carefully selected , and the risk @-@ benefit ratio is favorable ( i.e. , the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea ) .

 Tracheotomy 
 The earliest known depiction of a tracheotomy is found on two Egyptian tablets dating back to around 3600 BC . The 110 @-@ page Ebers Papyrus , an Egyptian medical papyrus which dates to roughly 1550 BC , also makes reference to the tracheotomy . Tracheotomy was described in the Rigveda , a Sanskrit text of ayurvedic medicine written around 2000 BC in ancient India . The Sushruta Samhita from around 400 BC is another text from the Indian subcontinent on ayurvedic medicine and surgery that mentions tracheotomy . <unk> of Bithynia ( c . 124 – 40 BC ) is often credited as being the first physician to perform a non @-@ emergency tracheotomy . Galen of Pergamon ( AD 129 – 199 ) clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice . In one of his experiments , Galen used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal . Ibn <unk> ( 980 – 1037 ) described the use of tracheal intubation to facilitate breathing in 1025 in his 14 @-@ volume medical encyclopedia , The Canon of Medicine . In the 12th century medical textbook Al @-@ <unk> , Ibn <unk> ( 1092 – 1162 ) — also known as <unk> — of Al @-@ Andalus provided a correct description of the tracheotomy operation . 
 The first detailed descriptions of tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from Andreas Vesalius ( 1514 – 1564 ) of Brussels . In his landmark book published in 1543 , De humani corporis fabrica , he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into the trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently . Antonio Musa <unk> ( 1490 – 1554 ) of Ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy . <unk> published his account in 1546 ; this operation has been identified as the first recorded successful tracheotomy , despite the many previous references to this operation . Towards the end of the 16th century , Hieronymus Fabricius ( 1533 – 1619 ) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings , although he had never actually performed the operation himself . Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube . In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas <unk> ( 1550 – 1624 ) published a report of four successful tracheotomies . In 1714 , anatomist Georg <unk> ( 1671 – 1747 ) of the University of Rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim . 
 Despite the many recorded instances of its use since antiquity , it was not until the early 19th century that the tracheotomy finally began to be recognized as a legitimate means of treating severe airway obstruction . In 1852 , French physician Armand Trousseau ( 1801 – 1867 ) presented a series of 169 tracheotomies to the Académie Impériale de Médecine . 158 of these were performed for the treatment of croup , and 11 were performed for " chronic maladies of the larynx " . Between 1830 and 1855 , more than 350 tracheotomies were performed in Paris , most of them at the Hôpital des Enfants <unk> , a public hospital , with an overall survival rate of only 20 – 25 % . This compares with 58 % of the 24 patients in Trousseau 's private practice , who fared better due to greater postoperative care . 
 In 1871 , the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg ( 1844 – 1924 ) published a paper describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia . In 1888 , Sir Morell Mackenzie ( 1837 – 1892 ) published a book discussing the indications for tracheotomy . In the early 20th century , tracheotomy became a life @-@ saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation . In 1909 , Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson ( 1865 – 1958 ) described a technique for tracheotomy that is used to this day . 
 <unk> and non @-@ surgical techniques 
 In 1854 , a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García ( 1805 – 1906 ) became the first man to view the functioning glottis in a living human . In 1858 , French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut ( 1818 – 1891 ) developed a new technique for non @-@ surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria @-@ related <unk> . In 1880 , Scottish surgeon William <unk> ( 1848 – 1924 ) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with <unk> edema to breathe , as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with chloroform . In 1895 , Alfred Kirstein ( 1863 – 1922 ) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords , using an <unk> he had modified for this purpose ; he called this device an <unk> . 
 In 1913 , Chevalier Jackson was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea . Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope . Also in 1913 , New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway ( 1873 – 1921 ) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed . Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill ( 1888 – 1986 ) , who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation , the Magill forceps , the Magill laryngoscope blade , and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents . The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill . Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh ( 1897 – 1989 ) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943 ; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation . 
 Between 1945 and 1952 , optical engineers built upon the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler ( 1888 – 1968 ) , developing the first <unk> . In 1964 , optical fiber technology was applied to one of these early <unk> to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope . Initially used in upper GI endoscopy , this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy , an English anesthetist , in 1967 . The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and <unk> in 1978 , using a central venous catheter . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the <unk> and anesthesia communities . The digital revolution of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation . Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor ( CMOS APS ) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated . 
 = Maryland Route 704 = 
 Maryland Route 704 ( MD 704 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known as Martin Luther King Jr . Highway , the highway runs 6 @.@ 53 miles ( 10 @.@ 51 km ) from Eastern Avenue at the District of Columbia boundary in Seat Pleasant east to MD 450 in Lanham . MD 704 is a four- to six @-@ lane divided highway that connects the northern Prince George 's County communities of Seat Pleasant , Landover , Glenarden , and Lanham . The highway was constructed along the right of way of the abandoned Washington , Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway ( WB & A ) in the early 1940s . In the late 1950s and early 1960s , MD 704 served as a temporary routing of U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) while the U.S. Highway 's freeway was under construction from Washington to Lanham . The route was expanded to a divided highway between Seat Pleasant and US 50 in the late 1960s and early 1970s . MD 704 was completed as a divided highway when the portion east of US 50 was expanded in the late 1990s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 704 begins at an intersection with Eastern Avenue near the eastern corner of the District of Columbia . The highway continues south as 63rd Street , which heads south toward Southern Avenue and East Capitol Street . MD 704 heads northeast as a six @-@ lane divided highway through the city of Seat Pleasant , where the highway intersects Addison Road at staggered intersections . Addison Road leads to St. Matthew 's Church , which is also known as the Addison Chapel . After leaving the city , the state highway crosses Cabin Branch and intersects Sheriff Road at an oblique angle . MD 704 passes through Landover , where the highway traverses <unk> Branch and meets MD 202 ( Landover Road ) at a full cloverleaf interchange . The highway continues through the city of Glenarden , where the highway intersects Ardwick Ardmore Road and crosses over Interstate 95 and I @-@ 495 ( Capital Beltway ) without access . MD 704 drops to four lanes again between Ardwick Ardmore Road and the five @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at US 50 ( John Hanson Highway ) , which is also unsigned I @-@ 595 . The interchange includes a direct ramp to northbound I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 toward Baltimore ; the ramp to westbound US 50 is used to access southbound I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 toward Richmond . MD 704 continues northeast as a six @-@ lane highway across Bald Hill Branch and veers east before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 450 ( Annapolis Road ) in Lanham . 
 MD 704 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from US 50 to MD 450 in Lanham . 
 = = History = = 
 MD 704 follows the abandoned right of way of the defunct WB & A Railway , an interurban railroad that included a north – south line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton . Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908 . The WB & A went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935 . The Maryland State Roads Commission converted the abandoned railroad right of way into a two @-@ lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 ( now MD 450 ) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944 . The WB & A had a pair of timber bridges across its right of way . The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant , which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad , was removed ; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway . In 1944 , the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202 's bridge across the abandoned railroad as one of the few non – war @-@ effort highway projects federally funded during World War II . Construction on the new steel @-@ and @-@ concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946 . Access between the grade @-@ separated highways at the MD 202 – MD 704 junction was via a pair of two @-@ way ramps . 
 MD 704 was named for George N. Palmer , a banker and community leader in Seat Pleasant , by 1951 . John Hanson Highway was constructed from US 301 in Bowie west to MD 704 between 1954 and 1957 . MD 704 was expanded to a divided highway through the highway 's interchange with the freeway as part of the construction . In addition to the current set of ramps , the interchange included loop ramps from westbound MD 704 to the eastbound freeway and from the westbound freeway to westbound MD 704 . By 1958 , the portion of MD 704 south of the freeway was marked as Temporary US 50 . This temporary route extended west into Washington along newly completed East Capitol Street and the pair of Independence Avenue and Constitution Avenue to reconnect with US 50 at 2nd Street in Capitol Hill . US 50 remained along Defense Highway ( now MD 450 ) from Bowie to Bladensburg and on Bladensburg Road and Maryland Avenue within the city until 1962 , when the U.S. Highway was placed along the newly completed John Hanson Highway from Bowie to Washington and Temporary US 50 was removed from MD 704 . 
 MD 704 was expanded to a divided highway from the District of Columbia boundary to Addison Road in Seat Pleasant in 1962 . The segment of divided highway at the US 50 interchange was extended west to Ardwick Ardmore Road in Glenarden in 1969 . MD 704 's modern cloverleaf interchange with MD 202 was completed in 1971 , the same year the former highway was expanded to a divided highway from Seat Pleasant to just north of the latter highway . The divided highway was extended southwest through Glenarden from Ardwick Ardmore Road to Glenarden Parkway in 1972 and to MD 202 in 1973 . MD 704 was renamed for Martin Luther King , Jr . , in 1987 . The highway 's interchange with US 50 was rebuilt in 1991 in conjunction with the overhaul of the US 50 – Capital Beltway interchange immediately to the west ; two of the interchange 's loop ramps with westbound MD 704 were removed . The MD 704 divided highway was extended east from the US 50 interchange to Forbes Boulevard in 1997 and <unk> Vista Road in 1999 . MD 704 and MD 450 were relocated at their junction to make MD 704 part of the east – west axis of a more orthogonal intersection in 2000 . This project was part of the expansion of the final segment of MD 704 and the adjacent portion of MD 450 to a divided highway .

 = Geet Ramayan = 
 Geet Ramayan ( Marathi : <unk> <unk> , English : The Ramayana in Songs ) is a collection of 56 Marathi language songs chronologically describing events from the Indian Hindu epic , the Ramayana . It was broadcast by All India Radio , Pune in 1955 – 1956 , four years before television was introduced in India . Written by G. D. Madgulkar and the songs being composed by Sudhir Phadke , Geet Ramayan was acclaimed for its lyrics , music and singing . It is considered a " milestone of Marathi light music " and the " most popular " Marathi version of Ramayana . 
 The team of Madgulkar and Phadke presented a new song every week for a year with every song being aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday morning , between 8 : 45 AM and 9 : 00 AM IST . The program 's first song " <unk> Lava <unk> <unk> " was aired on 1 April 1955 . Though Geet Ramayan is based on sage Valmiki 's epic Ramayana , Madgulkar chose a different narrative format and was praised for the lyrics , and was called <unk> Valmiki ( the modern Valmiki ) . The Geet Ramayan is considered as " the crescendo of Madgulkar 's literary vigour " . Phadke mainly used ragas of Hindustani classical music to compose the songs . He also selected the raga and the <unk> of a song to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood . The poet and composer were praised for their contribution to the series . 
 The series showcased a total of 32 various characters from Ramayana . Rama ( avatar of Vishnu and hero of the Ramayana ) being the lead character of the series was given maximum number of songs ( 10 ) , followed by eight songs for Sita ( Rama 's wife and avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi ) . Madgulkar expressed their various moods , ranging from their divinity to the human weaknesses . Incidentally , the central antagonist of the Ramayana and Geet Ramayan , the demon @-@ king Ravana , was not given any song . The series is narrated by Kusha and Lava , twin sons of Rama and Sita , and the writer of Ramayana ( Valmiki ) was also given one song in the series . 
 With increasing popularity since its release , Geet Ramayan has been translated into nine other languages : five Hindi translations and one each in Bengali , English , Gujarati , Kannada , Konkani , Sanskrit , Sindhi and Telugu . It has also been transliterated into Braille .

 Geet Ramayan was conceptualized in 1955 , four years before the introduction of television in India in 1959 . During the early days of All India Radio , Pune ( also known as <unk> Pune ) , station director <unk> Lad wanted to begin a radio programme which would be entertaining and provide moral education . He hence outlined his plan to poet and writer G. D. Madgulkar ( popularly known as " Ga @-@ Di @-@ Ma " ) . Since the Ramayana ( written by Valmiki ) is an Indian epic , Lad and Madgulkar came up with an idea of a version in singable verse . Madgulkar accepted the challenge , enlisting his music @-@ director friend Sudhir Phadke ( popularly known as " <unk> " ) for the collaboration . 
 The team of Madgulkar and Phadke would present a new song every week for a year . Every song would be aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday morning , between 8 : 45 am and 9 : 00am IST . The programme was initially planned for a year ( with 52 songs ) with the concluding song <unk> <unk> <unk> where Rama becomes the King , but 1955 in the Hindu calendar had an extra month ( <unk> ) ; therefore , four songs were added to extend the series to a total of fifty @-@ six . The series ended with the song " Gā Bāḷāno , Shrīrāmāyaṇ " where the part post crown ceremony was added . Apart from the number of songs , Madgulkar and Phadke left music , lyrics and choice of singers ad libitum . Madgulkar was given artistic liberty for the choice of the meters for the song , execution of the story line , and the message he could convey through it . 
 Initially , the programme was scheduled to begin on the occasion of Gudi Padwa , beginning of the New year according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar but later finalized to be Rama Navami , traditional birthday of Rama . The program 's first song " <unk> Lava <unk> <unk> " was aired on 1 April 1955 at 8 : 45 am IST . Vidya Madgulkar , the poet 's wife , recalled in an interview that Madgulkar wrote the first song and gave it to Phadke the day before the recording ; however , Phadke lost the lyrics . With the broadcast already scheduled , station director <unk> Lad requested Madgulkar to re @-@ write the song which was readily declined by an angered poet . Lad then decided to lock the poet in one of recording rooms equipped with all the required writing material and agreed to unlock the door only when Madgulkar is ready with the lyrics . Madgulkar then rewrote the lyrics from memory in fifteen minutes so Phadke could compose the music . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Though Valmiki was the main inspiration for the Geet Ramayan , Madgulkar chose a different narrative format . He used a simple lyrical format with a flexible number of stanzas ( from five to eleven stanzas , with three or four lines of varying length ) . The metre used was similar to <unk> , with roughly the same number of <unk> in each line . The metre was also suited to the narration and the characters who sang the song . Madgulkar used various formats , including narrative , descriptive and communal songs . He was praised for his lyrics , and was called " <unk> Valmiki " ( the modern Valmiki ) ; and the Geet Ramayan is considered " the crescendo of Madgulkar 's literary vigour " . 
 Madgulkar 's narrative format was different from that of Valmiki 's where he did not end the series with the coronation of Rama and Sita , but included Sita 's abandonment by Rama , and her giving birth to the twins , Lava and Kusha . However , he chose not to include the last episode of Sita 's final confrontation in Rama 's court and her entering the earth . Madgulkar ended the series with the song " Gā Bāḷāno , Shrīrāmāyaṇ " which was voiced by Valmiki where he tells his disciples , Lava and Kusha , how they should recite the Ramayana in front of Rama . Evidently , this also completes the cycle of songs where it had begun , with Lava and Kusha singing in Rama 's court . 
 Madgulkar did not make any attempt to provide new interpretation or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format . With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari , he included the sentiments of religious devotion ( Bhakti ) and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman . He composed songs on all seven chapters or <unk> of Ramayana . Out of 56 songs , poet composed twelve songs on <unk> , seven on Ayodhya Kanda , fourteen on Aranya Kanda , three on Kishkindha Kanda , four on Sundara Kanda , twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda . 
 As the series became popular , the daily newspapers in Pune began to print the text of the new song every week after its first airing . The first official edition of the text of these fifty @-@ six poems and their prose narrations came out on the occasion of Vijayadashami , 3 October 1957 , published for <unk> by the director of the Publications Division , Delhi , in pocketbook size . 
 = = Music and singing = = 
 Musical director Sudhir Phadke composed the songs based on the ragas of Hindustani classical music , including Bhopali , Bhimpalasi and <unk> . The raga and <unk> of a song was selected to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood . For example , the song " Calā <unk> Calā " is composed as a <unk> ( morning ) raga , and the song describes an event taking place in the morning . The songs " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " and " <unk> , <unk> Nako <unk> " are not based on a specific raga , but include several ragas in each song . 
 The singers , which included <unk> Deshpande , Manik Varma , Suresh <unk> , Ram <unk> and Lata Mangeshkar , were familiar with the vocal style of Indian classical music . Phadke voiced all the songs for Rama , and well @-@ known Kirana gharana singer Manik Varma voiced the character of Sita . Lata Mangeshkar sang one song for Sita , " Maj <unk> <unk> " , in which Sita questions Rama about her abandonment but her question remains unanswered . 
 = = Characters = = 
 A total of 32 characters from the Ramayana were voiced in the Geet Ramayan . Madgulkar expressed the emotions of characters such as Rama , Sita , Hanuman – the monkey ( vanara ) god and devotee of Rama – and Lakshmana ( Rama 's brother ) ; he also attempted to give voice to the humblest characters in the epic . The vanara are given a song ( " <unk> <unk> Re <unk> " ) describing a bridge forming over the ocean so Rama and his army could cross to Lanka . The poet noted that the song described the sacrifice of joint labour and was an example of the principle , " Union is strength " . <unk> Guha ( King of <unk> , kingdom located by the banks of Ganges river ) and the boatmen who helped Rama in crossing the Ganges river expressed themselves in " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " . The author of the Ramayana , Valmiki , was also given a song ( the final song , " Gā Bāḷāno , Shrīrāmāyaṇ " ) with his advice to Rama 's sons Kusha and Lava before they appear before Rama . 
 Being hero of the Ramayana and Geet Ramayan , Madgulkar expressed the varied moods of Rama ; he was the most @-@ voiced character in the Geet Ramayan with ten songs , followed by Sita with eight . He portrayed Rama as a complex character full of emotions and passions , with some of the questionable deeds , yet bound by a traditional virtue and the sanctity of a promise . Madgulkar voiced Rama 's personal ethical dilemmas ( in " <unk> Nā , <unk> " and " Līnate , Cārūte , Sīte " ) along with his courage ( in " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) , and steadfastness ( in " Līnate , Cārūte , Sīte " ) . He was shown to be patient with his brothers and mothers ( in " <unk> <unk> <unk> Putra <unk> " ) , obedient of father and sages ( in " Calā <unk> Calā " ) , heroic on the battlefield , and diplomatic when dealing with the monkey king , Vali ( in " <unk> Nā , <unk> " ) . Madgulkar is said to have successfully shown Rama 's divinity alongside his human weaknesses . He was shown to be distracted at the loss Sita ( in " <unk> Sītā <unk> ? " ) , and wailed in Lakshmana 's presence ( in " <unk> <unk> <unk> Phule " ) . In another situation , he uttered some heart @-@ wrenching words to Sita , in front of his army with blaming her for all the happenings ( in " Līnate , Cārūte , Sīte " ) , and then he was also shown to explain his behavior with oaths and confessions of loyalty to Sita ( in " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . 
 Rama 's mother , Kausalya , sang three songs ; his brother Bharata , his father Dasharatha , Hanuman , Lakshmana , the demon <unk> ( sister of Ravana ) , Rama 's guru @-@ sage Vishvamitra and Kusha @-@ Lava have two songs each . The central antagonist of the Ramayana , the demon @-@ king Ravana , was not given a song ; his oppressive presence was expressed in prose narration , poetic descriptions and songs sung by the other characters ( such as Ravana 's demon brother Kumbhakarna in " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) .

 = Scarborough Day School = 
 The Scarborough Day School was a private school in Scarborough @-@ on @-@ Hudson , in Briarcliff Manor , New York . Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip established the school in 1913 at their estate , Beechwood . The school , a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school , taught students at pre @-@ kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small class sizes , with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students . Since 1980 , the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School , which runs a day treatment program for 83 students . The current school still uses the Scarborough School 's theater , which was opened in 1917 . The school campus is a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District . 
 The Scarborough Day School was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York . The school also was a member of the Cum Laude Society and the National Association of Independent Schools . Its seal copies that of Scarborough , North Yorkshire ; Scarborough @-@ on @-@ Hudson 's namesake . 
 = = History = = 
 The Scarborough School was founded in 1913 by Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip for their six children and the children of friends and neighbors . Having met educator Maria Montessori during their European travels , the Vanderlips pioneered the Montessori method at the Edward Harden Mansion in nearby Sleepy Hollow by creating the first Montessori school in the United States , in 1912 . Frank Vanderlip 's sister Ruth was married to Harden ; the families maintained close ties . After a year existing in two rooms of the Harden residence , the school moved to the River Gate House at the north end of River Road and the Beechwood estate . 
 The school moved to its final location in 1917 , at Vanderlip Hall , a building Vanderlip constructed in 1916 bordering Albany Post Road ( current U.S. Route 9 ) . The building was designed for classes of ten , to accommodate 120 children total . It was situated on Beechwood 's 80 @-@ acre ( 320 @,@ 000 m2 ) parkland designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for the Vanderlips . Throughout the school 's history , students were open to wander the woodlands and gardens , utilize the lawns and tennis courts , and swim in the Olympic @-@ sized pool . There were always farm animals nearby for the children to see and play with and a circus carousel to ride on . The school had a gymnasium class , amateur theater group , folk singing , a swimming pool , and an economic forum . Frank Vanderlip had spent about $ 500 @,@ 000 on the school ( $ 9 @,@ 235 @,@ 100 in 2015 ) . Regular art exhibits were held at the Scarborough School , including a sculpture exhibition in the Italian garden at Beechwood , which included works by Jose de <unk> , Jason <unk> ( a longtime professor of sculpture at Cornell ) , and Richard <unk> . 
 Early on in the school 's history , the Vanderlips decided to change the school 's system from the Montessori method to a more formal approach with more discipline , although students still had more freedom than the average school . In the 1930s , the school was considered progressive : students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed . As enrollment grew , another building was built for younger children , which burnt down in 1959 . In addition , a lunchroom , shop , and studio were built early in the school 's history . Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school ; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism . Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom , and it is recorded that she served good simple food . She named some of her foods artistically ( rice pudding with raisins was called <unk> Noire a la Bolshevik ) . 
 Members of the Vanderlip family , particularly Virginia Vanderlip <unk> , continued to administer the school for sixty years . A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961 , new science facilities in 1962 , expansion of the library in 1963 , and the creation of an organization for alumni , of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977 . The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978 . In 1980 , the buildings and property were taken over by The Clear View School , which opened in September 1981 after major renovations . The school runs a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 , and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester ; its program involves education , treatment , and crisis intervention and parent involvement . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The main Scarborough School building , Vanderlip Hall , was designed by William W. Bosworth , known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles . The school building was constructed in a severe , all @-@ white Neoclassical style , and was completed early in 1917 . In addition to a grand porticoed entry , there were two wings that housed classes , a library , cafeteria and gymnasium , basement science labs , and an art room measuring 1 @,@ 000 square feet ( 93 m2 ) , ringed on three sides with French windows . In the 1960s , an additional Modernist structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school 's lower grades . 
 Rosemont , an estate and the birthplace of John Worden , was later used by Vanderlip as a dormitory for Scarborough School boarding students . Rosemont stood opposite the Beechwood estate , at the corner of Route 9 and Scarborough Road . Another campus building was Marie <unk> Hall , which was originally <unk> House , home to Dr. Percy Norman <unk> . Vanderlip built the house for him and his wife ; the house was later given to the Scarborough School and served as a girls ' dormitory in the 1940s and as a headmaster 's residence about thirty years later . 
 = = = Theater = = = 
 Beechwood Theater , a replica of the Little Theater on Broadway , was included in Wells Bosworth 's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater . Beechwood Theater , with 256 gold velvet seats , was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917 . Details were closely examined upon construction ; the lighting equipment , the scene lofts and fly gallery , and the dressing rooms were well @-@ designed and state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art . The stage floor was designed especially for dancing , and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible . 
 The theater was used for assemblies , plays , concerts , and lectures . It was also home to the Beechwood Players , an adult performing arts group which had its origins in 1919 . The Players put on several plays a year , summer and winter , six plays a year and three @-@ night runs . They had started with three one @-@ act plays but had graduated to full @-@ length dramas . From its first years , Broadway actors used the theater when not otherwise engaged . Among them were Sylvia Sidney , Laurette Taylor , Lynn Fontanne , James Dean , Judson <unk> , and Parker <unk> . Lecturers and performers in the Beechwood Theater included Sarah Bernhardt , Robert Frost , John Masefield , Vachel Lindsay , Eleanor Roosevelt , H. G. Wells , Stephen Vincent Benét , and a King of Siam . Other notable appearances at the theater included Charles Coburn and Isadora Duncan . Audiences have included Franklin D. Roosevelt , John D. Rockefeller Jr . , Henry Ford and the last King of Poland . 
 The theater was opened and dedicated on January 2 , 1917 . The first concert took place on July 30 , 1916 , and was by Ignacy Jan Paderewski . During his performance , the Black Tom explosion took place at a munitions works in New Jersey , more than 30 miles ( 48 km ) from Scarborough . Frank Vanderlip Jr . , ten years old at the time , later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building , and that Paderewski had played on as if nothing had happened . The automatic fire doors at the top of the theater had sprung open , and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room . 
 Following the Scarborough School 's closing , the Beechwood Theater had stood empty for many years , and was restored in 1983 by the Greater Ossining Area Community Theater . On March 17 , 1984 , The Clear View School presented a solo performance of Currier Bell , Esquire ( a dramatization of Charlotte Brontë 's life ) performed by Julie Harris . The performance was a $ 100 @-@ a @-@ ticket benefit for the school . Also on that day , the theater was rededicated as the Julie Harris Theater . Briarcliff High School used the theater until its own was constructed in 1998 .

 = Edward Said = 
 Edward Wadie Said ( Arabic pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ; 1 November 1935 – 25 September 2003 ) was a Palestinian @-@ American literary theoretician , professor of English , history and comparative literature at Columbia University , and a public intellectual who was a founder of post @-@ colonial studies . A Palestinian Arab born in Jerusalem in the days of Mandatory Palestine , Edward W. Said was an American citizen by way of his father , Wadir Said , a U.S. Army veteran of the First World War ; having moved from Jerusalem as a young boy , Said would later advocate for the political and human rights of the Palestinian people . 
 As a cultural critic , Said is known for his 1978 book Orientalism , a critical analysis of what he believed to be the culturally inaccurate representations that are the bases of Orientalism — the Western study of the Eastern world that presents how Westerners perceive and represent Orientals . Said argued that because Orientalist scholarship was and remains inextricably tied to the imperialist societies that produced it , much of the work is inherently political and servile to power , and so is intellectually suspect . The thesis of Orientalism is that Orientalism is defined by the presuppositions of the political culture out of which it arises , and that it shapes that political culture in its turn . In his book , Said shows how European imperialists thought about people in their colony , and by doing so , he shows how the political culture of imperialists shapes that of the colony . 
 The analytical model of Orientalism much influenced the humanities ( e.g. , literary theory and literary criticism ) and especially the field of Middle Eastern studies , where it transformed the academic discourse of the researchers — how they examine , describe and define the cultures of the Middle East . Some academic historians disagreed with his thesis , especially the Anglo – American Orientalist and historian Bernard Lewis . Orientalism derived from Said 's knowledge of colonial literature ( such as that of Joseph Conrad ) , the literary theories of R. P. Blackmur and Raymond Williams , the post @-@ structuralist theories of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida , and the critical works of Giambattista Vico , Antonio Gramsci and Theodor Adorno . Educated in the Western canon at a British school in Egypt and in the U.S. , Said wrote in his autobiography Out of Place ( 1999 ) that he applied his education and cultural heritages to narrowing the perceptual gaps of political and cultural understanding between the West and the Middle East , improving Western understanding of the Israeli – Palestinian conflict and telling of how a decade @-@ long membership in the Palestinian National Council made him a controversial public intellectual . 
 Drawing from the experiences of his family as Palestinian Christians in the Middle East at the time of the establishment of the State of Israel , Said argued for the establishment of a Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel , including the right of return , by way of U.S. political pressure upon Israel to recognize , grant and respect human rights . In that vein , Said also criticized the political and cultural policies of the Arab and Muslim regimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples . Said remained intellectually active late in life , before dying of leukemia in September 2003 . In a 2001 interview , Said summarized his oppositional role to the status quo , the remit of which is " to sift , to judge , to criticize , to choose , so that choice and agency return to the individual . " He stated his ideal community does not exalt " commodified interests and profitable commercial goals " , but values " survivability and sustainability in a human and decent way " , while acknowledging that " those are difficult goals to achieve . But I think they are achievable . " 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Edward W. Said was born on 1 November 1935 , to Hilda Said and Wadir Said , a businessman , in Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine . Wadir Said , a native Palestinian , was an Arab Christian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces ( 1917 – 19 ) , commanded by General John J. Pershing , in the First World War ; that war @-@ time military service granted Said père U.S. citizenship to him and to family . His mother Hilda was born to a Lebanese mother and raised in Nazareth . 
 In 1919 , after the war had ended , Wadir Said established a stationery business in Cairo , in partnership with a cousin . Like her husband , Hilda Said was an Arab Christian . Although the Said family practiced the Jerusalemite variety of Greek Orthodox Christianity , Edward was agnostic ; his sister Rosemarie Saïd <unk> ( 1937 – 2006 ) pursued an academic career , much like her brother . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Said described his early life as a boy 's life lived " between worlds " , in Cairo and in Jerusalem , until he was a young man of twelve years . In 1947 , Said enrolled in the Anglican St. George 's School , Jerusalem ; he would later describe the experience : 
 With an <unk> Arab family name like " Saïd " , connected to an improbably British first name ( my mother much admired [ Edward VIII ] the Prince of Wales in 1935 , the year of my birth ) , I was an uncomfortably anomalous student all through my early years : a Palestinian going to school in Egypt , with an English first name , an American passport , and no certain identity , at all . To make matters worse , Arabic , my native language , and English , my school language , were inextricably mixed : I have never known which was my first language , and have felt fully at home in neither , although I dream in both . Every time I speak an English sentence , I find myself echoing it in Arabic , and vice versa . 
 In the late 1940s , his latter school days included the Egyptian branch of Victoria College ( VC ) , where one classmate was Michel Shaloub ( later the actor Omar Sharif ) whom he remembered as a sadistic and physically abusive Head Boy ; other classmates included King Hussein of Jordan , and Egyptian , Syrian , Jordanian , and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers progressed to their becoming ministers , prime ministers , and leading businessmen in their respective countries . In that colonial time , the VC school educated a selection of Arab and Levantine young men to become the Anglicized ruling @-@ class who , in due course of their careers , were to rule their respective countries , upon British decolonization . VC would be the last school Edward Said attended before being sent to school in the U.S. : 
 The moment one became a student at [ Victoria College ] , one was given the student handbook , a series of regulations governing every aspect of school life — the kind of uniform we were to wear , what equipment was needed for sports , the dates of school holidays , bus schedules , and so on . But the school 's first rule , emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook , read : " English is the language of the school ; students caught speaking any other language will be punished . " Yet , there were no native speakers of English among the students . Whereas the masters were all British , we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds , Armenians , Greeks , Italians , Jews , and Turks , each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed . Yet all , or nearly all , of us spoke Arabic — many spoke Arabic and French — and so we were able to take refuge in a common language , in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial stricture . 
 Despite high intelligence and academic achievements , Said proved a troublesome student and was expelled from Victoria College in 1951 , and was sent from Egypt to the eastern U.S. , where he attended Northfield Mount Hermon School , Massachusetts , an elite college @-@ prep boarding @-@ school where he endured a psychologically difficult year of social alienation . Nonetheless , Said excelled academically , and achieved the rank of either first ( valedictorian ) or second ( salutatorian ) in a class of one hundred sixty students . 
 He would later say that , in retrospect , his parents ' decision to send him so far from the Middle East was much influenced by " the prospects of <unk> people , like us , being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible " . The realities of a peripatetic life — of interwoven cultures , of feeling out of place , and of being far from home — affected the schoolboy Said to the degree that , in adult life , the themes of dissonance continually arose in the academic , political , and intellectual works wrote . Said matured as an intellectual — a polyglot young man , fluent in English , French and Arabic , earning his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees from Princeton University in 1957 and 1960 respectively , followed by a Doctor of Philosophy in English Literature from Harvard University in 1964 . Despite his many intellectual achievements , Said 's battle with his identity as it related to language ( Arabic and English specifically ) continued throughout his adult life . He discusses the battle with language in both Out of Place ( 1999 ) and Reflections on Exile ( 2002 ) by it describing as something he had to carry with him throughout his life and career . Many of his peers also examined this particular aspect of his identity as intellectual porter ( of language , briefcases , among other things ) .

 In 1963 , Said joined Columbia University , as a member of the English and Comparative Literature faculties , where he taught and worked until 2003 . In 1974 , he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard ; during 1975 – 76 , he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science , at Stanford University . In 1977 , he became the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University , and subsequently was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities , and then in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University . Said also worked as a visiting professor at Yale University , and lectured at other universities . Said lectured at over 200 universities in the Middle East , Canada , United States , and Europe . He has published more twenty books in his lifetime . In 1992 , Said was promoted to " Professor " , the highest @-@ rank academic job at Columbia University . <unk> , Prof. Said served as president of the Modern Language Association , editor of the Arab Studies Quarterly in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , on the executive board of International PEN , and was a member in the American Academy of Arts and Letters , the Royal Society of Literature , the Council of Foreign Relations the American Philosophical Society . In 1993 , Said presented the BBC 's annual Reith Lectures , a six @-@ lecture series titled Representation of the Intellectual , wherein he examined the role of the public intellectual in contemporary society , which the BBC published in 2011 . 
 = = Literary production = = 
 Said 's first published book , Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography ( 1966 ) , was an expansion of the dissertation he presented to earn his PhD ; later , in Edward Saïd : Criticism and Society ( 2010 ) , <unk> Hussein would remark that Conrad 's novella Heart of Darkness ( 1899 ) was " foundational to Said 's entire career and project " . Afterwards , Said redacted ideas gleaned from the works of the 17th @-@ century philosopher Giambattista Vico , and other intellectuals , in the book Beginnings : Intention and Method ( 1974 ) , about the theoretical bases of literary criticism . Said 's later works include The World , the Text , and the Critic ( 1983 ) , Nationalism , Colonialism , and Literature : Yeats and Decolonization ( 1988 ) , Culture and Imperialism ( 1993 ) , Representations of the Intellectual : The 1993 Reith Lectures ( 1994 ) , Humanism and Democratic Criticism ( 2004 ) , and On Late Style ( 2006 ) . 
 Like his post @-@ modern intellectual mentors , the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault , Said was fascinated by how the people of the Western world perceive the peoples of and the things from a different culture , as well as the effects of society , politics , and power upon literature ; these preoccupations led him to become a founding intellectual of post @-@ colonial criticism . While Orientalism remains his principal cultural contribution , Said 's influential critical interpretations of the works of Joseph Conrad , Jane Austen , Rudyard Kipling , William Butler Yeats and others further bolstered his intellectual reputation . 
 = = = Orientalism = = = 
 Edward Said 's notability as cultural critic was established with his critique ( description and analyses ) of Orientalism as the source of the inaccurate cultural representations that are the foundation of Western thought towards the Middle East , of how The West perceives and represents The East . The thesis of Orientalism ( 1978 ) proposes the existence of a " subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo – Islamic peoples and their culture " , which derives from Western culture 's long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia , in general , and the Middle East , in particular . Said argued that such perceptions and consequent cultural representations have served , and continue to serve , as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperialist ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise , Said also criticized and denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the regimes of the ruling Arab elites who have internalized the false , romanticized representations of Arabic culture that were created by Anglo – American Orientalists . 
 So far as the United States seems to be concerned , it is only a slight overstatement to say that Moslems and Arabs are essentially seen as either oil suppliers or potential terrorists . Very little of the detail , the human density , the passion of Arab – Moslem life has entered the awareness of even those people whose profession it is to report the Arab world . What we have , instead , is a series of crude , <unk> caricatures of the Islamic world , presented in such a way as to make that world vulnerable to military aggression . 
 In Orientalism , Said contended that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism meant for self @-@ affirmation , rather than for objective intellectual inquiry and academic study . Thus , Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination ; i.e. , the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals . As such , Orientalism has exerted much impact upon the fields of literary theory and cultural studies , human geography and history , and Oriental studies . Parting from the philosophical works of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault , and the works of the early Western critics of Orientalism — such as Abdul Latif <unk> , <unk> Abdel @-@ Malek , Maxime Rodinson , and Richard William Southern ( Western Views of Islam in the Middle Ages , 1978 ) — Said argued that " Orientalism " and the derived perceptions of " The East " by " the West " purveyed in them are intellectually suspect , and cannot be accepted at their face value as faithful , true , and accurate representations of Oriental peoples and things . Said proposed that the history of European colonial rule , and its consequent political domination of the Eastern civilizations , distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable , well @-@ meaning , and culturally sympathetic Western Orientalists , transforming " Orientalism " into a pejorative term . 
 I doubt if it is controversial , for example , to say that an Englishman in India , or Egypt , in the later nineteenth century , took an interest in those countries , which was never far from their status , in his mind , as British colonies . To say this may seem quite different from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow tinged and impressed with , violated by , the gross political fact — and yet that is what I am saying in this study of Orientalism . 
 For Said , " the Orient " has been represented since Antiquity in the Western literature , painting and sculpture in the form of stereotypes . As an example , he cites the Greek tragedy The Persians ( 472 BC ) , by Aeschylus , where the protagonist fails and falls because he <unk> the true nature of The East . Contemporarily , Europe has politically dominated Asia to the degree that even the most outwardly objective Western texts about " The Orient " are culturally biased to a degree unrecognized by Western scholars , who appropriated for themselves the intellectual tasks of studying , exploring and interpreting the languages , histories and cultures of the Orient ; thereby implying that such ( subaltern ) peoples were incapable of speaking for themselves , and much less capable of composing their own cultural and historical narratives . Western Orientalists have written Asia 's past — therein constructing the modern identities of Asia — from a perspective that establishes " The West " as the cultural norm to emulate , from which the " exotic and inscrutable " Orientals deviate . 
 Orientalism concluded that Western writing about " The Orient " depicts the Oriental culture as an irrational , weak and feminized " Other " , an existential condition greatly contrasted with the rational , strong and masculine culture of the " West . " Said says this artificial binary @-@ relation derives from the European psychological need to create a " difference " of cultural inequality between " The West " and " The East " ; this inequality is attributed to immutable cultural " essences " inherent to " Oriental " peoples and things . In 1978 , the intellectual , cultural and commercial success of the book Orientalism assumed historical resonance in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the OPEC petroleum embargo . These recent events had surprised Western countries : Europe and the U.S. did not expect pro @-@ active , decisive and definitive actions from non – Western peoples , whom the ideology of Orientalism had defined as weak societies and impotent countries . For Said , the geopolitical reality of Israeli military and Arab economic warfare demonstrated the fictional nature of Orientalist representations and Western perceptions of the non – Western " Other " . 
 = = = Criticism of Orientalism = = = 
 Orientalism ( 1978 ) provoked much professional and personal criticism . Traditional Orientalists , such as Albert Hourani , Robert Graham Irwin , Nikki Keddie , Bernard Lewis and Kanan Makiya , incurred what the historian Nikki Keddie said were unfortunate professional consequences of Orientalism upon the public 's perception of the intellectual quality of their Orientalist scholarship . 
 Nikki Keddie has stated that Said 's work on Orientalism , drawing on critical theory , had caused : 
 some unfortunate consequences ... I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East [ studies ] field to adopt the word " Orientalism " as a generalized swear @-@ word , essentially referring to people who take the " wrong " position on the Arab – Israeli dispute , or to people who are judged " too conservative " . It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines . So , " Orientalism " , for many people , is a word that substitutes for thought , and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works . I think that is too bad . It may not have been what Edward Saïd meant , at all , but the term has become a kind of slogan . 
 = = = = Historical = = = = 
 In " The Mightier Pen ? Edward Saïd and the Double Standards of Inside @-@ out Colonialism " ( 1993 ) , the social anthropologist Ernest Gellner said that Said 's contentions that the West dominated the East for two millennia were unsupportable , because the Ottoman Empire had been a political and military threat to Europe until the late 17th century . In " Disraeli as an Orientalist : The <unk> Errors of Edward Said " ( 2005 ) , Mark Proudman reported that Said incorrectly described the British Empire as extending from Egypt to India in the late 19th century , as the Ottoman Empire and the Persian Empire were simultaneously active in that geopolitical region . 
 In Empire and Information : Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India , 1780 – 1870 ( 1996 ) , Christopher Alan Bayly said that , at the height of European imperialism , European power in the Orient was not absolute , and much depended upon local collaborators , who often subverted the geopolitical strategies of the European powers with whom they collaborated against their own peoples . In For Lust of Knowing : The Orientalists and Their Enemies ( 2006 ) , Robert Graham Irwin said that Palestine and Egypt were poor historical examples of Orientalism , because they were under European hegemonic control only for short periods in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . He believed that Said ignored better examples of Orientalism and imperialism , namely the British Raj ( 1858 – 1947 ) in India and Russia 's Asian dominions , because Said sought to score political points against the West 's actions in the Middle East . 
 = = = = Ideological = = = = 
 In the war of ideas that erupted from the book , Anglo @-@ American Orientalist Bernard Lewis became a particular intellectual nemesis of Said and his thesis in Orientalism ; Said had identified Lewis in the book as : 
 A perfect exemplification [ of an ] Establishment Orientalist [ whose work ] purports to be objective , liberal scholarship , but is , in reality , very close to being propaganda against his subject material . 
 For sheer heedless anti @-@ intellectualism , unrestrained or unencumbered by the slightest trace of critical self @-@ consciousness , no one , in my experience , has achieved the sublime confidence of Bernard Lewis , whose almost purely political exploits require more time to mention than they are worth . In a series of articles , and one particularly weak book — The Muslim Discovery of Europe ( 1982 ) — Lewis has been busy responding to my argument , insisting that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies is unique , that it is motivated by pure curiosity , and that , in contrast , Muslims neither were able nor interested in getting knowledge about Europe , as if knowledge about Europe were the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge . 
 Lewis 's arguments are presented as emanating exclusively from the scholar 's apolitical impartiality , whereas , at the same time , he has become an authority drawn on for anti – Islamic , anti – Arab , Zionist , and Cold War crusades , all of them underwritten by a zealotry , covered with a veneer of urbanity , that has very little in common with the " science " and learning Lewis purports to be upholding . 
 Bernard Lewis replied to Said 's characterizations , both of his ( Lewis 's ) works as political propaganda and of him as an anti @-@ intellectual , with essays critical of Said and his works ; Lewis later was joined by the academics Maxime Rodinson , Jacques <unk> , Malcolm H. Kerr , <unk> Ahmad and William Montgomery Watt , who said that Orientalism represents a flawed account of Orientalist scholarship . Said himself , in the " Afterword " to the 1995 edition of Orientalism , answered Bernard Lewis 's criticisms against the first edition of the book . Critics argued that Said and his followers failed to critically distinguish among the varieties of Orientalism featured in Western popular culture and mass @-@ communications media ( e.g. , Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , 1984 ) , and Oriental Studies of the languages , literatures , histories and cultures of the Eastern world . 
 In The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India 's Past , O.P. <unk> said that Said 's opposition to the monolithic Orientalism of Western discourse prompted him to create a monolithic <unk> , failing to distinguish among the paradigms of Romanticism and the secular intellectual traditions of the Age of Enlightenment . <unk> stated that Said ignored the wide range and fundamental differences of opinion among Orientalists about the nature of Oriental peoples and things , failed to acknowledge that some Orientalists , such as the philologist William Jones , sought to establish " cultural kinship " rather than " cultural difference " between The East and The West , and that these scholars often made discoveries that later provided foundations for anti @-@ imperial nationalism . 
 Robert Irwin has said in the Times Literary Supplement that the theoretical flaw of Orientalism is its failure to distinguish between the numerous Orientalist writers , who held different cultural perspectives on and experiences of the Orient — the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ( who never traveled to the East ) , the French novelist Gustave Flaubert ( who toured Egypt ) , the French geographer Joseph @-@ Ernest Renan ( who advanced racist theories of inferiority of " Semitic peoples " ) , and the British translator and lexicographer Edward William Lane ( who was fluent in Arabic ) . 
 In Defending the West : A Critique of Edward Said 's Orientalism ( 2007 ) , Ibn <unk> said that the varied origins and cultural attitudes of European Orientalists over @-@ rode factual and historical considerations , which Said ignored in order to construct a stereotype of Europeans befitting his thesis about the nature of Orientalism . In For Lust of Knowing : The Orientalists and Their Enemies , Robert Irwin said that Said ignored the domination of 19th @-@ century Oriental studies by German and Hungarian Orientalists , scholars from countries without imperial colonies in the Orient . Earlier critics said that the brief survey of German Orientalist scholarship limited the book , leading Said to counter in " Orientalism Reconsidered " ( 1985 ) that no one had demonstrated that the brief survey of German Orientalism limits the scholarly value and application of the thesis of Orientalism — the politics of discourse applied to the Eastern world in opposition to the Western world . 
 = = = = Personal = = = = 
 In the article " Who is Afraid of Edward Said ? " , <unk> Pati said that in establishing ethnicity and cultural background as tests of authority and objectivity in studying the Orient , Edward Said drew attention to his own ethnic and cultural identities as a Palestinian man and as a colonial <unk> from the Mandate of Palestine , the British Middle East . In the article " <unk> and <unk> : Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire " , D. A. Washbrook said that Said 's Anglophone education ( British and American ) disqualified him from writing about the Orient by virtue of his own arguments in Orientalism ; Said had lived most of his adult life in the U.S. as a university professor , but argued that : " any and all representations ... are embedded , first , in the language , and then in the culture , institutions , and political ambience of the <unk> ... [ and are ] interwoven with a great many other things besides ' The Truth ' , which is , itself , a representation " . That excessive cultural relativism had trapped the academic Said , and his post @-@ colonial theorist followers , in a " web of solipsism " , which limits him and them to speak only of cultural " representations " , whilst simultaneously allowing Said and cohort to deny the existence of any objective truth about the Orient . 
 = = = Influence of Orientalism = = = 
 Since Orientalism 's publication in 1978 , Said has been praised as an " intellectual superstar " for his range of inquiry , drawing on literary theory , comparative literature , history , political commentary , cultural criticism and music criticism . Orientalism became a foundational text in the field of Post @-@ colonial studies for what Terry Eagleton called its " central truth ... that demeaning images of the east and imperialist incursions into its terrain have historically gone hand in hand . " One of the most influential book in this area is Postcolonial Theory written by Leela Gandhi , where the author explains from basic introduction about Postcolonial @-@ ism to how it can be made and shaped in the real history with wider philosophical and intellectual context of it . 
 Said 's academic friends and foes acknowledged the transformative influence of Orientalism upon scholarship in the humanities ; critics argued that the thesis is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars , whilst supporters said the thesis is intellectually liberating . The fields of post @-@ colonial and cultural studies attempt to explain the " post @-@ colonial world , its peoples , and their discontents " ; for this , the investigational validity and analytical efficacy of the propositions in Orientalism continue to resonate , especially in the field of Middle Eastern studies . 
 The analytical scholarship of Orientalism is especially applicable to literary criticism and cultural studies , including reviews of the post @-@ colonial history of India by Gyan Prakash , Nicholas Dirks and Ronald Inden , modern Cambodia by Simon Springer , and the literary theories of Homi K. Bhabha , Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Hamid <unk> ( Iran : A People Interrupted , 2007 ) . 
 In Eastern Europe , Milica Bakić – Hayden developed the concept of Nesting <unk> ( 1992 ) , derived from the ideas of the historian Larry Wolff ( Inventing Eastern Europe : The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment , 1994 ) and Said 's ideas in Orientalism ( 1978 ) . The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova ( Imagining the Balkans , 1997 ) presented the <unk> concept of Nesting <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , 1997 ) , which is derived from Milica Bakić – Hayden 's concept of Nesting <unk> . 
 Lorenzo Kamel , a Middle Eastern historian , presented the concept of ' Biblical Orientalism ' through his historical analysis of the simplifications of the complex local Palestinian reality which occurred through the 1830s up to the early 20th century . He notes that selective usage and simplification of religion in approaching the ' Holy Land ' created a view that the ' Holy Land ' is devoid of any history but only Biblical richness . 
 It also impacts on theological studies . Said 's post @-@ colonial discourse impact on appearance of post @-@ colonial theology and post @-@ colonial biblical criticism , in which the reader approach the scripture with a perspective of colonial reader . For more information , see the book named " The Bible and Zionism : invented traditions , archaeology and post @-@ colonialism in Palestine @-@ Israel " 
 = = Politics = = 
 After the 1967 Six Day War , Said entered the public sphere to counter what he perceived as the stereotyped misrepresentations in which the U.S. news media explained the Arab – Israeli wars ; he claimed this reportage was divorced from the historical realities of the Middle East , in general , and Palestine and Israel , in particular . To address , explain , and correct the issue , Said published " The Arab Portrayed " in 1968 , a descriptive essay about images of " the Arab " that are meant to evade specific discussion of the historical and cultural realities of the peoples who live in the Middle East , featured in journalism and scholarship . 
 In the essay " Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims " ( 1979 ) , Said argued in favour of the political legitimacy and philosophic authenticity of the Zionist claims and right to a Jewish homeland ; and for the inherent right of national self @-@ determination of the Palestinian people . Said 's books about Israel and Palestine include The Question of Palestine ( 1979 ) , The Politics of <unk> ( 1994 ) , and The End of the Peace Process ( 2000 ) . 
 In 1985 , Said suffered personal consequences for his political activism when the Jewish Defense League ( JDL ) traduced Said 's public statements about the state and nature of Arab – Israeli relations , and officially said that Said was a Nazi , because of his anti – Zionism statements , which the JDL viewed as anti @-@ Semitism ; an arsonist set fire to his office at Columbia University , and he and his family were continually subjected to <unk> and " innumerable death threats " . 
 = = = Palestinian National Council = = = 
 From 1977 until 1991 , Said was an independent member of the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) . In 1988 , he was a proponent of the two @-@ state solution to the Israeli – Palestinian conflict ( 1948 ) , and voted for the establishment of the State of Palestine at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council meeting in Algiers . In 1993 , Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council , to protest the internal politics that lead to the signing of the Oslo Accords ( Declaration of Principles on Interim Self @-@ Government Arrangements , 1993 ) , because he thought the accord terms unacceptable , and because they had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991 . 
 Said was displeased that the Oslo Accords would not produce an independent Palestine , and that they were politically inferior to a plan that Yasser Arafat had rejected — a plan which Said had presented to Arafat on behalf of the U.S. government in the late 1970s . Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre – 1967 Israel , and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967 . By 1995 , in response to Said 's political criticisms , the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) banned the sale of Said 's books ; however , the PA lifted the book @-@ ban when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak 's offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David ( 2000 ) in the U.S. 
 In the mid @-@ 1990s , Said wrote the Foreword to the history book Jewish History , Jewish Religion : The Weight of Three Thousand Years ( 1994 ) , by Israel <unk> , which presents the cultural proposition that Israel 's mistreatment of the Palestinians is rooted in a Judaic requirement ( of permission ) for Jews to commit crimes , including murder , against Gentiles ( non @-@ Jews ) . In his Foreword , Said said that Jewish History , Jewish Religion is " nothing less than a concise history of classic and modern Judaism , insofar as these are relevant to the understanding of modern Israel " ; and praised the historian <unk> for describing contemporary Israel as a nation subsumed in a " Judeo – Nazi " cultural ambience that allowed the dehumanization of the Palestinian Other : 
 In all my works , I remained fundamentally critical of a gloating and uncritical nationalism . . . . My view of Palestine . . . remains the same today : I expressed all sorts of reservations about the insouciant nativism , and militant militarism of the nationalist consensus ; I suggested , instead , a critical look at the Arab environment , Palestinian history , and the Israeli realities , with the explicit conclusion that only a negotiated settlement , between the two communities of suffering , Arab and Jewish , would provide respite from the unending war . 
 In 1998 , Said made In Search of Palestine ( 1998 ) , a BBC documentary film about Palestine past and Palestine present , in which he returned to the country from which he had emigrated to the U.S. in 1947 . In the company of his son , Wadie , Said revisited his places of boyhood , and confronted the Israeli injustices ( social and cultural ) meted out to ordinary Palestinians in the contemporary West Bank . Despite the social and cultural prestige usual to BBC cinema products in the U.S. , the documentary was never broadcast by any American television company . 
 = = = In Palestine = = = 
 On 3 July 2000 , whilst touring the Middle East with his son , Wadie , Said was photographed throwing a stone across the Blue Line Lebanese – Israel border , which image elicited much political criticism about his action demonstrating an inherent , personal sympathy with terrorism ; and , in Commentary magazine , the journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as The Professor of Terror , for aggression against Israel . Said explained the stone @-@ throwing as a two @-@ fold action , personal and political ; a man @-@ to @-@ man contest @-@ of @-@ skill , between a father and his son , and an Arab Man 's gesture of joy at the end of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon ( 1985 – 2000 ) : 
 It was a pebble ; there was nobody there . The guardhouse was at least half a mile away . 
 Despite having denied that he aimed the stone at an Israeli guardhouse , the Beirut newspaper As @-@ Safir ( The Ambassador ) reported that a Lebanese local resident reported that Said was at less than ten metres ( ca . 30 ft . ) distance from the Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) soldiers manning the two @-@ storey guardhouse , when Said aimed and threw the stone over the border fence ; the stone 's projectile path was thwarted when it struck the barbed wire atop the border fence . In the U.S. , despite objections by some student groups at Columbia University and the Anti @-@ Defamation League of B 'nai B 'rith International ( Sons of the Covenant ) , the university provost published a five @-@ page letter defending Said 's action as academic freedom of expression : 
 To my knowledge , the stone was directed at no @-@ one ; no law was broken ; no indictment was made ; no criminal or civil action has been taken against Professor Saïd . 
 Said still endured political repercussions , such as the cancellation of a February 2001 invitation to Austria to give a lecture to the Freud Society . The President of the Freud Society justified withdrawing the invitation by explaining to Said that " the political situation in the Middle East , and its consequences " had rendered an accusation of anti @-@ Semitism a very serious matter , and that any such accusation " has become more dangerous " in the politics of Austria ; thus , the Freud Society cancelled their invitation to Said in order to " to avoid an internal clash " of opinions , about him , that might ideologically divide the Freud Society . In Culture and Resistance : Conversations with Edward Saïd , Said likened his political situation to the situation that Noam Chomsky has endured as a public intellectual : 
 It 's very similar to his . He 's a well @-@ known , great linguist . He 's been celebrated and honored for that , but he 's also vilified as an anti – Semite and as a Hitler worshiper . . . . For anyone to deny the horrendous experience of anti @-@ Semitism and the Holocaust is unacceptable . We don 't want anybody 's history of suffering to go unrecorded and unacknowledged . On the other hand , there 's a great difference , between acknowledging Jewish oppression and using that as a cover for the oppression of another people . 
 Under surveillance 
 In 2003 , Haidar Abdel @-@ Shafi , Ibrahim <unk> , Mustafa Barghouti , and Said established Al @-@ <unk> ( The Palestinian National Initiative ) , headed by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti , a third @-@ party reformist , democratic party meant to be an alternative to the usual two @-@ party politics of Palestine . As a political party , the ideology of Al @-@ <unk> is specifically an alternative to the extremist politics of the social @-@ democratic Fatah and the Islamist Hamas ( Islamic Resistance Movement ) . Said 's founding of the group , as well as his other international political activities concerning Palestine , were noticed by the U.S. government ; in 2006 , the anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283 @-@ page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Said , begun in 1971 , four years into his career as a public intellectual active in U.S. politics . 
 = = Music = = 
 Besides having been a public intellectual , Edward Said was an accomplished pianist , worked as the music critic for The Nation magazine , and wrote four books about music : Musical <unk> ( 1991 ) ; Parallels and Paradoxes : Explorations in Music and Society ( 2002 ) , with Daniel Barenboim as co @-@ author ; On Late Style : Music and Literature Against the Grain ( 2006 ) ; and Music at the Limits ( 2007 ) in which final tome he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances . 
 Elsewhere in the musical world , the composer Mohammed Fairouz acknowledged the deep influence of Edward Said upon his works ; compositionally , Fairouz 's First Symphony thematically alludes to the essay " Homage to a Belly @-@ Dancer " ( 1990 ) , about Tahia Carioca , the Egyptian <unk> , actress , and political militant ; and a piano sonata titled Reflections on Exile ( 1984 ) , which thematically refers to the emotions inherent to being an exile . 
 In 1999 , Edward W. Said and Daniel Barenboim co @-@ founded the West @-@ Eastern Divan Orchestra , which is composed of young Israeli , Palestinian , and Arab musicians . They also established The Barenboim – Said Foundation in Seville , to develop education @-@ through @-@ music projects . Besides managing the West – Eastern Divan Orchestra , the Barenboim – Said Foundation assists with the administration of the Academy of Orchestral Studies , the Musical Education in Palestine Project , and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project , in Seville . 
 = = Awards = = 
 Besides honors , memberships , and postings to prestigious organizations world @-@ wide , Edward Said was awarded some twenty honorary university degrees in the course of his professional life as an academic , critic , and Man of Letters . Among the honors bestowed to him was the Bowdoin Prize by Harvard University . He twice received the Lionel Trilling Book Award ; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976 , for Beginnings : Intention and Method ( 1974 ) . He also received the Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association , and was awarded the inaugural Spinoza Lens Prize . In 2001 , Said was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement , and in 2002 , he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord . He was the first U.S. citizen to receive the Sultan Owais Prize ( for Cultural & Scientific Achievements , 1996 – 1997 ) . The autobiography Out of Place ( 1999 ) was bestowed three awards , the 1999 New Yorker Book Award for Non @-@ Fiction ; the 2000 Anisfield @-@ Wolf Book Award for Non @-@ Fiction ; and the Morton <unk> Zabel Award in Literature . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 On 25 September 2003 , after enduring a twelve @-@ year sickness with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , Edward W. Said died , at 67 years of age , in New York City . He was survived by his wife , Mariam C. Said , his son , Wadie Said , and his daughter , Najla Said . The <unk> included Alexander Cockburn ( " A Mighty and Passionate Heart " ) ; Seamus Deane ( " A Late Style of Humanism " ) ; Christopher Hitchens ( " A <unk> for Edward Said " ) ; Tony <unk> ( " The Rootless Cosmopolitan " ) ; Michael Wood ( " On Edward Said " ) ; and Tariq Ali ( " Remembering Edward Said , 1935 – 2003 " ) . In November 2004 , in Palestine , Birzeit University renamed their music school the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music . 
 The tributes to Edward Said include books and schools ; such as Waiting for the Barbarians : A Tribute to Edward W. Said ( 2008 ) features essays by Akeel <unk> , Rashid Khalidi , and Elias Khoury ; Edward Said : The Charisma of Criticism ( 2010 ) , by Harold Aram <unk> , a critical biography ; and Edward Said : A Legacy of Emancipation and Representations ( 2010 ) , essays by Joseph Massad , Ilan Pappé , Ella <unk> , Ghada <unk> , Noam Chomsky , Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak , and Daniel Barenboim ; and the Barenboim – Said Academy ( Berlin ) was established in 2012 .

 Holger Glinicki ( born 25 October 1952 ) is a German wheelchair basketball coach , who coached Hamburger SV . He was assistant coach of the German women 's national team from 2003 to 2005 . He has been coach of the team since 2006 , during which time it has won five European championships , a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing and a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Holger Glinicki was born in Hamburg on 25 October 1952 . He was paralysed following a motorcycle accident in 1972 that broke his fourth thoracic vertebra . He became involved in disability sports , playing wheelchair basketball for RSC Hamburg , who were the German national champions in 1983 , and played a total of 123 international games . He became assistant coach of the German women 's national wheelchair basketball team in 2003 , and then coach in 2006 . The team won five consecutive European championships , in 2003 , 2005 , 2007 , 2009 and 2011 , and a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing . 
 The German team started off slow in its games against the United States and China at the 2012 Summer Paralympics , winning these games by slim six @-@ point margins . Marina Mohnen thought that they played their best basketball only in the final minutes of a game . They defeated the Australia women 's national wheelchair basketball team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics by 44 – 58 in front of a crowd of over 12 @,@ 000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal . It was the first gold medal that Germany had won in women 's wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics since 1984 . They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012 , and were named Team of the Year for 2012 . Glinicki celebrated by plunging off Canary Wharf into London 's River Thames . He was named Hamburg 's coach of the year for 2012 . 
 Glinicki was philosophical about the win , noting in December 2012 that there were many awards and ceremonies , but that the memory of London was fading over time . He returned to coaching his club team , Hamburger SV ( now renamed BG Baskets Hamburg ) , which included national team members Mareike Adermann and Edina Müller ( and Australia 's Bridie Kean ) . It went on to win the national championship for the eighth time in 2013 . The national team was not so fortunate , losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point , 56 – 57 , before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013 . 
 In April 2014 , Glinicki coached BG Baskets Hamburg to a win in the final of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Euro League Challenge Cup , its first International title , with a 62 – 54 over the Frankfurt Mainhatten Skywheelers . The team also won the Fair Play Award of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Europe .

 = = Production and development = = 
 This episode was written by Brian Scully , older brother of long @-@ time Simpsons writer and producer Mike Scully . This was his second Family Guy episode , the first being " I Dream of Jesus " from the seventh season . Series regular Dominic Bianchi directed the episode , before the conclusion of the eighth production season . 
 " Big Man on Hippocampus " , along with the eleven other episodes from Family Guy 's eighth season , was released on a three @-@ disc DVD set in the United States on December 13 , 2011 . The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes , a collection of deleted scenes and animatics , a special mini @-@ feature which discussed the process behind animating " And Then There Were Fewer " , a mini @-@ feature entitled " The Comical Adventures of Family Guy – Brian & Stewie : The Lost Phone Call " , and footage of the Family Guy panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actor Dwayne Johnson made a brief live @-@ action appearance in the episode , appearing as himself , along with two action figures of Peter and Lois , which he proceeds to bang on top of each other in order to illustrate a censored sex scene . Commenting on his appearance in the episode , Johnson stated that he was a " big fan " of Family Guy , having quickly befriended show creator Seth MacFarlane after he had in a minor role in Johnson 's 2010 film Tooth Fairy . While filming the movie , Johnson had reached out to MacFarlane , saying that he would love to " return the favor " by appearing on Family Guy , which eventually led to his role in this episode . Actress Adrianne Palicki and voice actor Rick Pasqualone also guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge , writer Steve Callaghan , voice actor Ralph Garman , writer Mark Hentemann , writer Danny Smith , writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances . Actors Patrick Warburton and Adam West made a few appearances as well .

 The episode contains numerous in @-@ jokes and references to other events . As the episode opens , the family sees an announcement about auditions for the game show Family Feud . Deciding to try out , the family is quickly chosen , along with the family of show writer Steve Callaghan . The segment features a re @-@ creation of the game show 's original 1976 set and rules , including host Richard Dawson 's practice of kissing the female contestants . As an answer to one of the questions , Peter supplies " the flute that Captain Picard played , first in his imagination , and then in real life , in the episode " The Inner Light " from Star Trek : The Next Generation . " Then , during the Fast Money round , when Lois was asked to name a favorite holiday , Stewie answered 9 / 11 . 
 When Peter is introduced to Meg , he exclaims " D 'oh ! " , to which Lois replies " No , Peter , that 's not your catchphrase " , an allusion to Homer Simpson in The Simpsons . In a further attempt to restore Peter 's memory , Lois decides to show Peter footage of their honeymoon , which is reminiscent of the Corona commercials with its scene of a bottle of beer placed between the couple , as they are both sitting on a beach . Going on to teach Peter how to drive , Lois gives him a copy of the video game Grand Theft Auto . As a result , he kills a prostitute with a baseball bat , steals her money then steals a car , in a parody of the actions the player is allowed to perform in the game itself . Peter also rediscovers " Surfin ' Bird " by The Trashmen and sings to it while dancing , annoying the family . The Griffins had been previously tormented by it in the seventh season episode " I Dream of Jesus " , which the writer of the episode , Brian Scully , also wrote . At the end of the first act , when Brian says " Oh No " , ( in place of the commercial interlude from Night Rider ) a series of white on black text is shown , in a parody of the Cartoon Network block Adult Swim . The Adult Swim broadcast also features the Animation Domination graphics package used by Fox , but replaces Fox with Adult Swim . 
 Paul Hogan from " Crocodile " Dundee makes an appearance when Lois is teaching Peter how to use silverware . She says " this is a knife " saying his machete is a knife , referencing a famous scene from the film . 
 Returning home from a night out , Peter brings home Tiffani Thiessen from Saved by the Bell , naively thinking he is allowed to have sex with her . The reference is made clear when Peter asks her if she bought a necklace using her money from the show . Tiffani also tells Peter he need not worry about her conceiving , as she is " already pregnant . " In real life , Thiessen was expecting her first child at the time . After Lois decides to leave Peter , she is shown shopping for groceries at the Quahog Market . Quagmire <unk> approaches her from behind , saying his " giggity " catchphrase to the shark motif composed by John Williams for the 1975 film Jaws . 
 The title is a pun on the common phrase Big Man on Campus , but with campus changed to hippocampus , a reference to Peter 's amnesia in the episode . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The episode was viewed in 8 @.@ 1 million homes , and received a Nielsen rating of 3 @.@ 9 / 9 in the 18 – 49 demographic . In addition , it was also the second most viewed and second highest rated show on Fox 's Animation Domination lineup , losing slightly to The Simpsons , but continued its lead over both The Cleveland Show and American Dad ! in total viewership and ratings . 
 Reviews of the episode were negative , citing the storyline as " safe , " without any offensive jokes for the sake of being offensive . " Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the " cohesive story " as " [ succeeding ] on its simplicity , " but criticized the series for continuing to broadcast in the 4 : 3 format , as opposed to widescreen like MacFarlane 's other two shows . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode more negatively , however , criticizing the writers for using " storylines as a thin spine to hang jokes on , " giving the episode a D rating . Jason Hughes of TV Squad commended the live @-@ action sequence featuring Johnson , as well as the utilization of Meg 's personality to create an awkward situation with the family . Despite the somewhat negative criticism , the episode still ended up on the most downloaded episodes list on iTunes 2010 Rewind . 
 Australian channel 7mate received criticism for airing the episode on 12 August 2014 , 14 hours after the suicide of Robin Williams , who features in a cutaway implying that he is overrated . A spokesperson for the channel subsequently stated " it was a coincidence " . 
 = Manasa = 
 Manasā , also <unk> Devi , is a Hindu folk goddess of snakes , worshipped mainly in Bengal and other parts of North and northeastern India , chiefly for the prevention and cure of snakebite and also for fertility and prosperity . Manasa is the sister of Vasuki , king of Nāgas ( snakes ) and wife of sage Jagatkāru ( <unk> ) . She is also known as <unk> ( the destroyer of poison ) , <unk> ( eternal ) and Padmavati . 
 Her myths emphasize her bad temper and unhappiness , due to rejection by her father Shiva and her husband , and the hatred of her stepmother , Chandi ( Shiva 's wife , identified with Parvati in this context ) . In some scriptures , sage Kashyapa is considered to be her father , rather than Shiva . Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees , but harsh to people who refused to worship her . Denied full <unk> by her mixed parentage , Manasa ’ s aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Manasa first appears in the Hindu text Atharva Veda as a snake goddess . In the Puranas , she was recognized as a daughter of sage Kashyapa and <unk> , the mother of all Nāgas . By the 14th century , Manasa was identified as the goddess of fertility and marriage rites and was assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon as a relative of Shiva . Myths glorified her by describing that she saved Shiva after he drank poison , and venerated her as the " remover of poison " . Her popularity grew and spread to Southern India , and her cult began to rival Shaivism itself . As a consequence , stories attributing Manasa 's birth to Shiva emerged and ultimately Shaivism adopted this indigenous goddess into the Brahmanical tradition of mainstream Hinduism . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 Manasa is depicted as a woman covered with snakes , sitting on a lotus or standing upon a snake . She is sheltered by the canopy of the hoods of seven cobras . Sometimes , she is depicted with a child on her lap . The child is assumed to be her son , Astika . She is often called " the one @-@ eyed goddess " and among the <unk> tribe of northeastern India she is called <unk> <unk> ( Blind Goddess ) , as one of her eyes was burnt by her stepmother Chandi . 
 = = Legends = = 
 = = = Mahabharata = = = 
 The Mahabharata tells the story of Manasa 's marriage . Sage Jagatkāru practiced severe austerities and had decided to abstain from marriage . Once he came across a group of men hanging from a tree upside down . These men were his ancestors , who were doomed to misery as their children had not performed their last rites . So they advised Jagatkāru to marry and have a son who could free them of those miseries by performing the ceremonies . Vasuki offered his sister Manasa 's hand to Jagatkāru . Manasa mothered a son , <unk> , who freed his ancestors . Astika also helped in saving the Nāga race from destruction when King Janamejaya decided to exterminate them by sacrificing them in his Yajna , fire offering . 
 = = = Puranas = = = 
 Puranas are the first scriptures to speak about her birth . They declare that sage Kashyapa is her father , not Shiva as described in the Mangalkavyas . Once , when serpents and reptiles had created chaos on the earth , sage Kashyapa created goddess Manasa from his mind ( mana ) . The creator god Brahma made her the presiding deity of snakes and reptiles . Manasa gained control over the earth , by the power of mantras she chanted . Manasa then propitiated the god , Shiva , who told her to please Krishna . Upon being pleased , Krishna granted her divine Siddhi powers and ritually worshipped her , making her an established goddess . 
 Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru , who agreed to marry her on the condition that he would leave her if she disobeyed him . Once , when Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa , he became upset with her because she awakened him too late for worship , and so he deserted her . On the request of the great Hindu gods , Jaratkaru returned to Manasa and she gave birth to Astika , their son . 
 = = = Mangalkavyas = = = 
 The Mangalkavyas were devotional paeans to local deities such as Manasa , composed in Bengal between the 13th and the 18th centuries . The Manasa Mangalkavya by Bijay Gupta and Manasa Vijaya ( 1495 ) by <unk> <unk> trace the origin and myths of the goddess . 
 According to Manasa Vijaya , Manasa was born when a statue of girl that had been sculpted by Vasuki 's mother was touched by Shiva 's semen . Vasuki accepted Manasa as his sister , and granted her charge of the poison that was produced when King Prithu milked the Earth as a cow . When Shiva saw Manasa , he was sexually attracted to her , but she proved to him that he was her father . Shiva took Manasa to his home where his wife , Chandi , suspected Manasa of being Shiva 's concubine or co @-@ wife , and insulted Manasa and burnt one of her eyes , leaving Manasa half @-@ blind . Later , when Shiva was dying of poison , Manasa cured him . On one occasion , when Chandi kicked her , Manasa rendered her senseless with a glance of her poison eye . Finally , tired of quarrels between Manasa and Chandi , Shiva deserted Manasa under a tree , but created a companion for her from his tears of remorse , called Neto or <unk> . 
 Later , the sage Jaratkaru married Manasa , but Chandi ruined Manasa 's wedding night . Chandi advised Manasa to wear snake ornaments and then threw a frog in the bridal chamber which caused the snakes to run around the chamber . As a consequence , the terrified Jaratkaru ran away from the house . After few days , he returned and Astika , their son , was born . 
 Accompanied by her adviser , Neto , Manasa descended to earth to obtain human devotees . She was initially mocked by the people but then Manasa forced them to worship her by raining calamity on those who denied her power . She managed to convert people from different walks of life , including the Muslim ruler Hasan , but failed to convert Chand Sadagar . Manasa wanted to become a goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati . In order to get there she had to achieve the worship Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa . Thus to gain his fear and insecurity Manasa one by one killed his six sons . At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of <unk> Court who loved each other , <unk> and Usha . Anirudh had to take birth as <unk> , Chand and <unk> 's seventh son . Usha took birth as <unk> and married him . Manasa killed him but <unk> floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand . At last , he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without even looking at her . This gesture made Manasa so happy that she resurrected all of Chand 's sons and restored his fame and fortunes . The Mangal <unk> say that after this , the worship of Manasa was popular forever more . 
 Manasa Mangalkavya attributes Manasa 's difficulty in attracting devotees to an unjust curse she gave to Chand in his previous life . Chand then retaliated with a counter @-@ curse that worshipping her would not be popular on earth unless he worshipped her also . 
 In many renditions of the myth , Manasa is depicted as being quite dependent on Neta ( traditionally imagined as a washerwoman ) for ideas and moral support . In fact , of the two , Manasa is often the stupider one - a curious instance of anthropomorphism . 
 Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and Sister Nivedita say , " [ The ] legend of [ Chand Sadagar and ] Manasā <unk> , [ ... ] who must be as old as the <unk> stratum in Asiatic society , reflects the conflict between the religion of Shiva and that of female local deities in Bengal . Afterwards Manasā or <unk> was recognized as a form of Shakti , [ ... ] and her worship accepted by Shaivas . She is a phase of the mother @-@ divinity who for so many worshippers is nearer and dearer than the far @-@ off and impersonal Shiva ... " . 
 = = Worship = = 
 Generally , Manasa is worshipped without an image . A branch of a tree , an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshipped as the goddess , though images of Manasa are worshipped too . She is worshipped for protection from and cure of snake bites and infectious diseases like smallpox and chicken pox . 
 The cult of Manasa is most widespread in Bengal , where she is ritually worshipped in temples . The goddess is widely worshipped in the rainy season , when the snakes are most active . Manasa is also a very important fertility deity , especially among the lower castes , and her blessings are invoked during marriage or for childlessness . She is usually worshipped and mentioned along with Neto , who is called Neta , <unk> , <unk> , etc. in various parts of Bengal . 
 In North Bengal , among the <unk> , Manasa ( called <unk> , <unk> or Padmavati ) is one of the most important goddesses , and her <unk> ( shrine ) may be found in the courtyard of almost every agrarian household . Among the lower @-@ caste Hindus of East Bengal ( present @-@ day Bangladesh ) too , she is worshipped with great pomp . 
 Manasa is an especially important deity in Bengal for the mercantile castes . This is because <unk> of the <unk> was the first to initiate her worship , and <unk> , the heroine of the <unk> was a daughter of the Saha clan ( a powerful trading community ) . 
 Manasa is also worshipped extensively in Assam , and a kind of <unk> @-@ Pali ( musical folk theatre ) is dedicated entirely to her myth . 
 Manasa is ceremonially worshipped on Nag Panchami - a festival of snake worship in the Hindu month of Shravan ( July – August ) . Bengali women observe a fast ( vrata ) on this day and offer milk at snake holes .

 Winanta 's father , Raden <unk> , tells him that he should divorce his wife , <unk> , to marry his cousin Fatimah , on threat of being disowned . To spare her husband from this fate , <unk> decides to abandon him and moves from Bandung to Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , where she lives a life of poverty . Unknown to her , this decision is used by Raden <unk> as proof of her that she was not trustworthy . Winanta falls into despair , but eventually marries Fatimah . 
 Eighteen years later , Winanta and Fatimah have had a daughter named Koestini ( Boen Sofiati ) , who is studying in Batavia . Educated , graceful , and beautiful , she is popular with young men but only returns the affections of <unk> ( Rd Soekarno ) , a young assistant pharmacist who is polite and refined . One of her spurned suitors , <unk> , decides to ruin their relationship by telling Winanta that Koestini has spent all of her time chasing boys rather than studying . Believing these lies , Winanta recalls Koestini to Bandung . 
 Koestini falls ill , and her death is reported . Driven mad by the news , <unk> begins wandering aimlessly . Ultimately , as if guided by some unseen force , he discovers Koestini alive in a village called Mega Mendoeng , near Bogor . This discovery brings him back to his senses , and the two are able to live happily together .

 Mega Mendoeng was directed by Boen Kin Nam for Union Films , a production house based out of Batavia ( now Jakarta ) which was run by Tjoa Ma Tjoen and financed by Ang Hock Liem . A sound technician by training , Mega Mendoeng was Boen 's only full directorial credit . Liem served as producer . The film was announced in September 1941 and produced concurrently with Soeara Berbisa ( Venomous Voice ) , a film on which Boen acted as assistant director . Mega Mendoeng was completed by December 1941 , after Soeara Berbisa . 
 The black @-@ and @-@ white film starred Rd Soekarno , Oedjang , Boen Sofiati , and Soehaena ; it also featured Ratna Djoewita , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Moesa . Oedjang had acted for Union since its first film , Kedok Ketawa ( The Laughing Mask ; 1940 ) , while Soekarno and Soehaena had made their debuts in Soeara Berbisa . Sofiati , a stage actress who operated her own troupe , was a newcomer to cinema . This cast was of various socio @-@ economic backgrounds , including noblemen and stage actors . Although Union stated that the film was made along realist lines and aimed at educated viewers , owing to the inclusion of stage actors – people who usually entertained lower class audiences – the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that this was untrue . 
 = = Release and legacy = = 
 Mega Mendoeng was released in early 1942 , the seventh and final film completed by Union . With a Japanese invasion looming , the February 1942 edition of the film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus . Union , though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled Damar <unk> , was forced to close shop ; it never reopened . Soekarno returned to the film industry in the 1950s and was active until the 1970s , mostly credited as Rendra Karno . 
 Mega Mendoeng was screened as late as July 1942 , but may now be lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . As such , the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , J.B. Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = Taylor v. Beckham = 
 Taylor v. Beckham , 178 U.S. 548 ( 1900 ) , was a case heard before the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1 , 1900 , to decide the outcome of the disputed Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . The litigants were Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham . In the November 7 , 1899 , election , Taylor received 193 @,@ 714 votes to Democrat William Goebel 's 191 @,@ 331 . This result was certified by a 2 – 1 decision of the state 's Board of Elections . Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities , and the Democrat @-@ controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel 's claims . Goebel was shot on January 30 , 1900 , one day before the General Assembly approved the committee 's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid to swing the election to Goebel . As he lay dying of his wounds , Goebel was sworn into office on January 31 , 1900 . He died on February 3 , 1900 , and Beckham ascended to the governorship . 
 Claiming the General Assembly 's decision was invalid , Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising the authority of the governor 's office . Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor 's mansion . The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court , which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution , an outcome that favored Beckham . The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court 's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor 's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 The injection of Taylor 's claim under the Fourteenth Amendment gave him grounds to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court . In a majority opinion delivered by Chief Justice Melville Fuller , the Supreme Court also rejected Taylor 's claim to loss of property without due process and thus refused to intervene on Taylor 's behalf , claiming that no federal issues were in question and the court lacked jurisdiction . Justices Gray , White , Shiras , and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion . Justice Joseph McKenna concurred with the decision to dismiss , but expressed reservations about the determination that an elected office was not property . Justice David J. Brewer , joined by Justice Henry B. Brown , contended that the Supreme Court did have jurisdiction , but concurred with the result in favor of Beckham . Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan authored the lone dissent from the majority opinion , claiming that the court did have jurisdiction and should have found in favor of Taylor based on his claim of loss of property without due process . He further argued that elective office fell under the definition of " liberty " as used in the Fourteenth Amendment and was protected by due process . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 In 1898 , the Kentucky General Assembly enacted a law which created a Board of Election Commissioners , appointed by the General Assembly , who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky 's counties . The Board was empowered to examine election returns and certify the results . The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly under Section 153 of the state constitution . The law was commonly referred to as the Goebel Election Law , a reference to its sponsor , President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate William Goebel . Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election , the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self @-@ serving . Republicans organized a test case against the law , but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional . 
 Goebel secured the Democratic nomination for governor at a contentious nominating convention . Despite the nominations of two minor party candidates – including that of former governor John Y. Brown by a dissident faction of Democrats – the race centered on Goebel and his Republican opponent , Attorney General William S. Taylor . The results of the election were too close to call for several days . Before the official results could be announced , charges of voting irregularities began . In Nelson County , 1 @,@ 200 ballots listed the Republican candidate as " W. P. Taylor " instead of " W. S. Taylor " ; Democrats claimed these votes should be invalidated . In Knox and Johnson counties , voters complained of " thin tissue ballots " that allowed the voter 's choices to be seen through them . In the city of Louisville , Democrats charged that the militia had intimidated voters there and that the entire city 's vote should be invalidated . 
 When the official tally was announced , Taylor had won by a vote of 193 @,@ 714 to 191 @,@ 331 . Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies , it voted 2 – 1 to certify the announced vote tally . The Board 's majority opinion claimed that they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses . Taylor was inaugurated on December 12 , 1899 . Goebel announced his decision to contest the Board 's decision to the General Assembly . The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges . The members of the committee were drawn at random , though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee . ( Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans . ) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were : that the committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly , that debate be limited once the findings were presented , and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly . The rules further provided that the speaker of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor , as was customary . The Republican minority fought the provisions , but the Democratic majority passed them despite the opposition . 
 Republicans around the state expected the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor . Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital . On the morning of January 30 , 1900 , as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building , shots were fired , and Goebel fell wounded . After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men , the contest committee met in Frankfort 's city hall and , by a strict party @-@ line vote , adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices . When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee 's report , they found the doors to the state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens . On January 31 , 1900 , they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel , with no Republicans present , and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee , invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor . Still lying on his sick bed , Goebel took the oath of office . 
 Goebel died of his wounds on February 3 , 1900 . Leaders from both parties drafted an agreement whereby Taylor and his Lieutenant Governor , John Marshall , would step down from their respective offices , allowing Goebel 's lieutenant governor , J. C. W. Beckham , to assume the governorship ; in exchange , Taylor and Marshall would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel 's assassination . The militia would withdraw from Frankfort , and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer election law . Despite his allies ' insistence , Taylor refused to sign the agreement . 
 = = = Lower court decisions = = = 
 As negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the elections for governor and lieutenant governor were ongoing , the Republican candidates for the state 's minor offices filed suit in federal court in Cincinnati , Ohio , to prevent their removal from office . The case could have been filed in the federal court at Louisville , Kentucky , but Judge Walter Evans asked to be excused from adjudicating the case . The Republican officers , represented by ex @-@ Governor William O 'Connell Bradley and future governor Augustus E. Willson among others , argued that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their right to vote . The right to vote , they claimed , was inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment 's guarantee of " liberty " , and could not be taken from any citizen without due process . 
 The case was argued before Judge ( and later President ) William Howard Taft , who held that the federal court could not prevent the removal of officers by injunction . He advised the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts . Taft further opined that , should any federal question be raised in such proceedings , the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal . The Republicans were encouraged by Taft 's decision , which cleared the way for an appeal all the way to the federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised . 
 The Republican minor officeholders returned to the state courts with their case . Franklin County circuit court justice James E. Cantrill ruled against them , and the Kentucky Court of Appeals , then the state 's court of last resort , sustained Cantrill 's ruling by a vote of 4 – 3 . Republican Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term . Though Cantrill 's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville 's vote and the votes of four counties in eastern Kentucky , none of the legislators from those areas were unseated . 
 Taft 's ruling had no bearing on the cases of Governor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall except to spell out a means for them to take their cases to the federal courts , if necessary . On the same day that Taft 's ruling was issued , Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any authority due the offices they claimed . Unaware of Taylor 's suit , Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause . Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate , where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer . 
 Republicans claimed that Taylor 's suit , by virtue of having been filed two hours before Beckham 's , gave the case precedence in Louisville . By mutual consent , the parties consolidated the suits , which were heard before Judge Emmet Field in Jefferson County circuit court . Both sides knew that Field 's decision , whatever it might be , would be appealed , but both agreed to abide by the outcome of the final court 's decision . The case was heard on March 1 and 2 , 1900 . Taylor 's attorney 's contended that the General Assembly had acted in a quasi @-@ judicial manner , violating the principle of separation of powers . Further , because the contest committee 's report did not specify how many votes were invalid , Republicans argued that all 150 @,@ 000 votes cast in the contested counties had been invalidated by the General Assembly 's vote , and consequently , the voters of those counties had been illegally disenfranchised . The most the Assembly should have been able to do , they claimed , was to invalidate the entire election . Finally , they contended that the alleged illegal activities of the General Assembly had deprived Taylor and Marshall of their property rights – the " property " in question being the offices they claimed – and their liberty to hold an elected office . Attorneys for Beckham contended that legislative actions historically had not been subject to judicial review , and indeed were not subject to such under any provision of the state constitution . 
 On March 10 , 1900 , Field sided with the Democrats . In his ruling , he opined that legislative actions " must be taken as absolute " and that the court did not have the authority to circumvent the legislative record . Republicans appealed the decision to the Kentucky Court of Appeals . In their appeal , they were careful to raise a federal issue . If Judge Field 's ruling was correct , and the Board of Elections , the General Assembly , or both had the right under the state constitution to an absolute review of all elections , then the Assembly had been given absolute arbitrary power over elections , in conflict with the federal constitution . 
 On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld Judge Field 's decision by a vote of 6 – 1 . The majority opinion held that an elected office is not property and thus not subject to the protections guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment . As a creation of the Kentucky Constitution , the court held , any elective office is conferred and held only subject to the provisions of that constitution . This put the matter beyond the reach of any judicial review , according to the court . 
 The four Democratic judges concurred on the majority opinion . Two Republican judges , in a separate opinion , concurred with the majority opinion , but declared that Taylor and Marshall had been done an irreparable injustice . The lone dissent , authored by the court 's third Republican , held that the contest board had acted outside its legal authority . Republicans turned to the Supreme Court of the United States as their final option . 
 = = Supreme Court = = 
 Louisville attorney Helm Bruce opened the Republicans ' case before the Supreme Court on April 1 , 1900 . He maintained that , after Taylor 's election had been certified by the Board of Elections , he was legally the governor of Kentucky , and the attempt by the legislature to oust him from office amounted to an arbitrary and despotic use of power , not a due process , as the federal constitution required . In addressing the complaints upon which the dismissal of ballots was justified – namely , the intimidation of voters in Jefferson County by the state militia and the use of " thin ballots " in forty Kentucky counties – Bruce maintained that even if the allegations were true , both were the fault of the state , not Taylor and Marshall , and were not sufficient grounds upon which to deny them their right to the offices they claimed . 
 Bruce was followed by Lawrence N. Maxwell , counsel for Beckham . Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding the outcome of the disputed election . He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor , and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process . Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case , and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction . The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand , he concluded . Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that , even if Taylor 's claim to the governorship were legitimate , the investigation and decision by the General Assembly 's contest committee represented sufficient due process . He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law 's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states . If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional , as it had before been declared , then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered . 
 When Maxwell concluded his argument , ex @-@ Governor Bradley spoke on Taylor 's behalf . After reiterating Taylor 's legal claim to the office of governor , he answered the question of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd , a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction . He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property , using this to contend that Taylor 's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated , thus giving the court jurisdiction . Also , Bradley asserted , the election of some members of the Assembly 's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee . At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election 's outcome . These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly on the grounds that it had left some members as judges of their own cases . Finally , Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee , including insufficient time given for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall 's legal representation . Following Bradley 's argument , the court recessed until May 14 , 1900 . 
 = = = Opinion of the Court = = = 
 Chief Justice Melville Fuller delivered the opinion of the court on May 21 , 1900 . This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case , and that the court lacked jurisdiction . The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals ' assertion that an elective office was not property . Justices Gray , White , Shiras , and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion . 
 In his 1910 book , The Constitutional Law of the United States , <unk> W. Willoughby noted that the court 's ruling that an elective office was not property was at odds with previous decisions in which it had assumed jurisdiction in cases between two contestants for an office to determine if due process was granted . By assuming jurisdiction in these cases , Willoughby claimed , the court had given elective offices standing as property . Accordingly , Justice Joseph McKenna issued a separate concurring opinion in which he stated : " I agree fully with those decisions which are referred to [ in the majority opinion ] , and which hold that as between the State and the office holder there is no contract right either to the term of office or to the amount of salary , and that the legislature may , if not restrained by constitutional provisions , abolish the office or reduce the salary . But when the office is not disturbed , when the salary is not changed , and when , under the Constitution of the State , neither can be by the legislature , and the question is simply whether one shall be deprived of that office and its salary , and both given to another , a different question is presented , and in such a case to hold that the incumbent has no property in the office , with its accompanying salary , does not commend itself to my judgment . " 
 = = = Dissent of Justice Brewer = = = 
 Justice David J. Brewer issued a dissent stating that he believed that due process had been observed and that the majority opinion should have affirmed the lower court rulings rather than dismissing the case . In his opinion , Brewer stated : " [ A ] s I understand the law , this court has jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a State ousting one from his office and giving it to another , and a right to inquire whether that judgment is right or wrong in respect to any federal question such as due process of law , I think the writ of error should not be dismissed , but that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky should be affirmed . " Justice Henry B. Brown concurred with Brewer . 
 = = = Dissent of Justice Harlan = = = 
 The only dissent came from Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan . Harlan opined that not only did the court have jurisdiction , it should have sustained the writ of error on the grounds that the General Assembly 's actions had deprived Taylor and Marshall of property without due process , in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . Going beyond the claim that an elective office is property , Harlan wrote that the right to hold office fell within the definition of " liberty " as used in the Fourteenth Amendment . Justifying this claim , Harlan wrote : " What more directly involves the liberty of the citizen than to be able to enter upon the discharge of the duties of an office to which he has been lawfully elected by his fellow citizens ? " 
 Whereas the majority opinion wholly ignored the proceedings of the General Assembly as irrelevant ( the court lacking jurisdiction ) and Brewer and Brown affirmed them , Harlan excoriated the legislature in his dissent . " Looking into the record before us , I find such action taken by the body claiming to be organized as the lawful legislature of Kentucky as was discreditable in the last degree and unworthy of the free people whom it professed to represent . ... Those who composed that body seemed to have shut their eyes against the proof for fear that it would compel them to respect the popular will as expressed at the polls . " He also expressed disbelief at the majority opinion : " [ T ] he overturning of the public will , as expressed at the ballot box , without evidence or against evidence , in order to accomplish partisan ends , is a crime against free government , and deserves the execration of all lovers of liberty . ... I cannot believe that the judiciary is helpless in the presence of such a crime . "

 Taylor v. Beckham established as a judicial principle that public offices are mere agencies or trusts , and not property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2005 stated that the Supreme Court subsequently had adopted a more expansive approach to identifying " property " within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment , but that it is the Supreme Court 's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents .

 " Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts " is the second episode of the twenty @-@ third season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 2 , 2011 . The episode was the first to feature Superintendent Chalmers as the central character and Chalmers ' flashbacks references the films The Breakfast Club and Fight Club . In the episode , Principal Skinner challenges Superintendent Chalmers to take over Bart 's education after one of his pranks . Chalmers accepts and starts teaching Bart about Theodore Roosevelt and manliness . After he takes Bart and his friends on an unauthorized field trip which results in one of the children breaking an arm , Chalmers is fired . Bart and his friends then take over the school in an effort to save his job .

 Springfield Elementary School is hosting a fundraiser auction and invites all the families with children in their classes , including the Simpson family . Every item in the auction is sold to an English widow named Edith <unk> , who is bidding over the phone . When the auction is over , Bart reveals that he was the real Mrs. <unk> and that there is no money for the school . Frustrated over Bart 's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers , Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart 's education . Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan , which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt . He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt 's heroic and rebellious nature . Classmates Milhouse , Nelson , Jimbo , Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education . 
 With the success of his lessons , Chalmers plans to take them all on a field trip to Springfield Forest , in which Roosevelt left one of his spectacles . The field trip does not go well , however , as Nelson breaks his arm when he tries to reach for the spectacles . Since it was an unauthorized field trip , Nelson 's mother threatens to sue the school for medical expenses , which leads to Chalmers getting fired . In order to save Chalmers ' job , Bart and his friends , who now go by the name " The Brotherhood of the Spectacles " , take over the school in a hostage situation and stand up for the teacher who made a meaningful impact to them . They lock all of the teachers out of the school and demand that Chalmers get reinstated . A SWAT team prepares to storm the school , before Chalmers walks up to convince Bart to stop . Luckily , Chief Wiggum accidentally drops his gun , knee @-@ capping the school representative State Comptroller Atkins , who thereafter agrees to reinstate Chalmers because they can recover the money lost in the previous lawsuit with a new lawsuit against the police department .

 " Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts " was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore . The episode features former American President Theodore Roosevelt with the use of archival audio recordings . The use of Roosevelt 's voice was first announced at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in San Diego , California , on July 23 , 2011 . Showrunner Al Jean revealed to the press that " we [ the staff ] have actual audio of Roosevelt ( taken from a speech circa 1918 ) in the show . I thought , ' Finally ! We can put a president in the show . ' And a good one too . We 're going to give him a little credit at the end . " 
 Even though Superintendent Chalmers was first introduced in the season four episode " Whacking Day " , the character had never been a central part to an episode . This episode marks the first time in which the entire episode follows Chalmers . In Chalmers ' flashback from his teaching days , the scene looks like the library of Shermer High School from the film The Breakfast Club from 1985 . The students however refer to the club as Fight Club . 
 = = = Opening sequence = = = 
 Canadian animator and creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show , John Kricfalusi , guest animated the couch gag for the episode . This was the second time The Simpsons had chosen a guest director for its opening sequence , following the previous season 's episode " MoneyBART " , which was guest directed by British graffiti artist and political activist Banksy . Previously , Kricfalusi had criticized The Simpsons staff in the show 's early years by saying that " the show succeeded despite the writing " and similarly derogatory comments . The producers responded with the fourth season episode " The Front " ( 1993 ) , in which The Ren & Stimpy Show is nominated for a cartoon award . During the award ceremony , the clip from the nominated episode is merely a black screen with the text " Clip not done yet " , a comment on the slow production time of the show . The show was mentioned again in the season six episode " Another Simpsons Clip Show " ( 1994 ) , when Lisa claims that Ren & Stimpy recycles animation to make new episodes , while referencing Itchy & Scratchy 's habit of doing the same . Despite this , Kricfalusi changed his tone in an interview with Aaron Simpson in 2007 and claimed that The Simpsons made it easier to do more edgy work : " Well it started with Bakshi ’ s Mighty Mouse : The New Adventures and Pee Wee Herman . Those were kid shows , but with layers of perversion in them . Then The Simpsons came along and did edgy material in prime time cartoons . " 
 After the positive response to the opening sequence by Banksy , creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi and asked him if he could do something similar . Originally , they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it , but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself , explaining that " If we had done it that way , no one would even have known that I had anything to do with it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose " . On The Simpsons , the animators draw key poses and then let <unk> interpolate between those poses . The interpolation however , is a straight a to b animation . That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose . Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he " wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways , not just looking funny each time they come to a stop " , and further elaborated " that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work . You can ’ t write visual performance . You have to actually draw it . " 
 He showed Groening and Jean his Adult Swim shorts and Groening responded by giving him free hands to do the 35 @-@ second @-@ long segment . Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules , but Kricfalusi explains that he " tried not to break any rules in the characters ’ personalities , just in the execution of the visuals . I didn ’ t follow any models — not even my own " . The more rules he broke , the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result . Contrary to Banksy , who lives a life in secrecy , Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack . While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts , he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah <unk> and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation . 
 In an interview by Neil Bennett from Digital Arts Magazine , Kricfalusi revealed that he would have taken a different approach to the animation if he were to animate the entire episode . Primarily , the animation would be slower paced than it was in the 35 @-@ second @-@ long segment . The couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas . Kricfalusi explains that " [ if I did a whole episode ] , I would definitely keep on experimenting with the way they move and the acting . I 'm sure I would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut . I would [ also ] want to do more stuff with Marge . I loved animating her and was inspired by the way the <unk> animated Olive Oyl . I couldn 't animate a whole half hour myself , so I would hire other animators ( and designers , painters , etc . ) with strong styles and cast them according to which parts of the story would best take advantage of their individual talent .

The show received a 3 @.@ 0 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18 – 49 , which was a 23 % drop from the season premiere episode , and an eight percent audience share . The Simpsons became the second highest @-@ rated program in Fox 's Animation Domination lineup that night in terms of total viewers and in the 18 – 49 demographic , finishing with a higher rating than The Cleveland Show and American Dad ! , but a lower rating than Family Guy . These three other animated shows were part of a crossover event , called Night of the Hurricane , in which they shared the same storyline . For the week of September 26 – October 2 , 2011 , " Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts " tied for 29th place in the ratings among all network prime @-@ time broadcasts in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 Since airing , " Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts " has been well received by television critics . Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club gave this episode a " B " rating and commented that " The Simpsons episodes that strive to have a little heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than the random @-@ gag episodes , at least at this point in the storied history of The Simpsons , and ' Bart Stops To Smell The Roosevelts ' has enough wee little heart to see this episode through " , but further wrote that " there were a number of jokes that didn 't work , Milhouse 's final scene in particular , but the episode had a steady stream of gags to push through the lean times . And that 's all we can ask for . " Ology 's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten , while commenting that he " thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value , but the sincerity of Bart 's educational experience , combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice , definitely made this one a winner . " 
 The couch gag for the episode was critically acclaimed by television critics . Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called the opening revolutionary and explained that " in 35 short and sweet seconds , he liberates the animation of The Simpsons from years of graphic banality . " He continued : " The visual look of the show , which has been so carefully controlled by its producers , becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play , and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers ' room to the animators in one fell swoop . " When comparing the segment to Banksy 's , Amidi concluded that it is " in fact , far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement , relegating the show 's dominant literary elements to the back seat . " Similarly , Television Blend 's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates " The Simpsons always being willing to push the envelope in different ways " , but admitted that it would take her " some time to get the gangly @-@ legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [ her ] brain .

 = SMS Hindenburg = 
 SMS Hindenburg was a battlecruiser of the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) , the third ship of the Derfflinger class , built to a slightly modified design . She carried the same battery of eight 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , but in improved turrets that allowed them to fire further . The ship was also slightly larger and faster than her two sister ships . She was named in honor of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg , the victor of the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of the Masurian Lakes , as well as Supreme Commander of the German armies from 1916 . The ship was the last capital ship of any type built by the German navy during World War I. 
 Hindenburg was commissioned late in the war and as a result had a brief service career . The ship took part in a handful of short fleet operations as the flagship of the I Scouting Group in 1917 – 18 , though saw no major action . The proposed final sortie of the fleet in the last weeks of the war came to nothing when the crews of the capital ships mutinied . Hindenburg was subsequently interned with the rest of the German battlecruisers at Scapa Flow in November 1918 . Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the ships be scuttled on 21 June 1919 . Hindenburg was the last of the ships to sink . She was raised in 1930 and broken up for scrap over the following two years . 
 = = Design = = 
 Hindenburg 's primary armament was eight 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) guns in four twin turrets , the same as in her two sisters . However , the gun turrets were Drh LC / 1913 mounts , which were an improved version the Drh LC / 1912 type mounts on Derfflinger and Lützow — the gun houses on Hindenburg allowed gun elevation to 16 ° , as opposed to 13 @.@ 5 ° in the earlier model . This gave the guns mounted in the Drh LC / 1913 turrets an advantage of some 2 @,@ 000 m ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) over those in the older turret . Like her sister ship , the Lützow , she was armed with fourteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 45 guns and four 60 cm ( 23 @.@ 6 in ) torpedo tubes instead of the standard twelve 15 cm guns and four 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) tubes mounted on Derfflinger . While 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) longer and 300 metric tons ( 300 long tons ; 330 short tons ) heavier than her sisters , Hindenburg was also faster , capable of steaming at 26 @.@ 6 knots ( 49 @.@ 3 km / h ; 30 @.@ 6 mph ) during trials , compared with 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) for Derfflinger .

 Built by the Kaiserliche Werft at their shipyard in Wilhelmshaven , Hindenburg was the third and final ship of her class ; her sister ships were Derfflinger and Lützow . Designed as a replacement for the elderly protected cruiser Hertha , Hindenburg 's keel was laid down on 30 June 1913 . She was launched on 1 August 1915 , but due to shifting construction priorities in time of war , she was not completed until 10 May 1917 , by which time it was too late for her to see any significant operations in World War I. At the time , British naval intelligence believed the ship was commissioned so late because she had had parts removed to repair Derfflinger after the battle of Jutland in June 1916 . In actuality , construction proceeded slowly because of labor shortages . 
 SMS Hindenburg was the last battlecruiser completed for the Imperial German Navy , and as such had a very short career . She was fully operational by 20 October 1917 , but this was too late to see any major operation in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke , along with the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group , were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when the minesweepers were attacked by British warships . The British raiders included the new battlecruisers Repulse , Courageous , and Glorious . However , the raid was brief ; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene , the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn . On 23 November , Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the I Scouting Group .

 In late 1917 , light forces of the High Seas Fleet began interdicting British convoys to Norway . On 17 October the light cruisers Brummer and Bremse intercepted one of the convoys , sinking nine of the twelve cargo ships and the two escorting destroyers — Mary Rose and Strongbow — before turning back to Germany . On 12 December , four German destroyers ambushed a second British convoy of five cargo vessels and two British destroyers . All five transports were sunk , as was one of the destroyers . Following these two raids , Admiral David Beatty , the commander of the Grand Fleet , detached battleships from the battle fleet to protect the convoys . The German navy was now presented with an opportunity for which it had been waiting the entire war : a portion of the numerically stronger Grand Fleet was separated and could be isolated and destroyed . Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper planned the operation : the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group , along with light cruisers and destroyers , would attack one of the large convoys , while the rest of the High Seas Fleet would stand by , ready to attack the British dreadnought battleship squadron . 
 At 05 : 00 on 23 April 1918 , the German fleet , with Hindenburg in the lead , departed from the Schillig roadstead . Hipper ordered wireless transmissions be kept to a minimum , to prevent British intelligence from receiving radio intercepts . At 06 : 10 the German battlecruisers had reached a position approximately 60 kilometers southwest of Bergen , when Moltke lost her inner starboard propeller . Without resistance from the water , the propeller @-@ less shaft began spinning faster and faster , until one of the engine gears flew apart . Shrapnel from the broken machinery damaged several boilers and tore a hole in the hull ; the ship was dead in the water . The ship 's crew effected temporary repairs , which allowed the ship to steam at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) . However , it was decided to take the ship under tow by the battleship Oldenburg . Despite this setback , Hipper continued northward . By 14 : 00 , Hipper 's force had crossed the convoy route several times but had found nothing . At 14 : 10 , Hipper turned his ships southward . By 18 : 37 , the German fleet had made it back to the defensive minefields surrounding their bases . It was later discovered that the convoy had left port a day later than expected by the German planning staff . 
 = = = Later planned operations = = = 
 On 11 August 1918 , Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet . Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as the commander of the I Scouting Group ; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day . 
 Hindenburg was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the " death ride " of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet ; Admiral Reinhard Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany whatever the cost to the fleet . The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers , one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary ; Hindenburg and the other four battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack . After both strikes , the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast , where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle . While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven , war @-@ weary sailors began deserting en masse . As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven 's inner harbor and roadstead , some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore . 
 On 24 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on several battleships mutinied ; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchors , and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships Thüringen and Helgoland . In the face of open rebellion , the order to sail was rescinded and the planned operation was abandoned . In an attempt to suppress the mutiny , the High Seas Fleet squadrons were dispersed .

 Under the terms of the Armistice between Germany and the Allies that ended World War I , the majority of the German fleet was to be interned at Scapa Flow ; this included Hindenburg and the rest of the battlecruisers . On 21 November 1918 , the ships to be interned — 14 capital ships , seven light cruisers , and 50 of the most modern torpedo boats — departed German waters for what would prove to be the last time . Prior to the departure of the German fleet , Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , who was given command of the ships to be interned , that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships , under any conditions . The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser Cardiff , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow . The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British , American , and French warships . 
 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty that ended the war . A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919 , the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty . Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired . To prevent this , he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers ; at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Hindenburg was the last ship to sink , at 17 : 00 . Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank on an even keel to make it easier for her crew to escape . After several unsuccessful attempts , she was raised on 23 July 1930 , only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932 . Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine ( Federal Navy ) on 28 May 1959 . 
 = Junagarh Fort = 
 Junagarh Fort ( Rajasthani : <unk> ् द क ़ <unk> ) is a fort in the city of Bikaner , Rajasthan , India . The fort was originally called Chintamani and was renamed Junagarh or " Old Fort " in the early 20th century when the ruling family moved to Lalgarh Palace outside the fort limits . It is one of the few major forts in Rajasthan which is not built on a hilltop . The modern city of Bikaner has developed around the fort . 
 The fort complex was built under the supervision of Karan Chand , the Prime Minister of Raja Rai Singh , the sixth ruler of Bikaner , who ruled from 1571 to 1611 AD . Construction of the walls and associated moat commenced in 1589 and was completed in 1594 . It was built outside the original fort of the city , about 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) from the city centre . Some remnants of the old fort are preserved near the Lakshmi Narayan temple . 
 Historical records reveal that despite the repeated attacks by enemies to capture the fort , it was not taken , except for a lone one @-@ day occupation by Kamran Mirza . Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534 , which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh . 
 The 5 @.@ 28 hectares large fort precinct is studded with palaces , temples and pavilions . These buildings depict a composite culture , manifest in the mix of architectural styles . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Junagarh fort is located in the arid region of the Thar desert of Rajasthan bordered on the northwest by the Aravalli range , a range of mountains in western India . Part of the desert area is in Bikaner city , which is one of the three desert triangle cities ; the other two cities are Jaisalmer and Jodhpur . The name of the place where Bikaner city with its forts was established was then known as <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the present Junagarh Fort was built , an old stone fort existed in the city . This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who established the city of Bikaner in 1472 . Rao Bika was the second son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the <unk> clan , the founder of Jodhpur city . He conquered the large arid lands to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain . As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of inheriting his father ’ s territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja . He , therefore , reconciled and decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called " <unk> " . Bikaner , though a partly of the Thar Desert , was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast since it had adequate spring water sources . Bika ’ s name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city as well as to the then state of Bikaner ( “ the settlement of Bika ” ) that he established . The history of Bikaner and the fort within it thus start with Bika . It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner ’ s fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji , the sixth ruler of Bikaner , who ruled from 1571 to 1611 . During the Mughal Empire ’ s rule in the country , he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir . His successful war exploits by way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors . He was gifted the jagirs ( lands ) of Gujarat and Burhanpur . With the large revenue earned from these jagirs , he built the Junagarh fort on a plain land , which has an average elevation of 760 feet ( 230 m ) . The formal foundation ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594 . Raja Rai Singhji , was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh fort . Thus the fort , a composite structure , became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique centre of art , amidst the Thar desert . 
 Karan Singh who ruled from 1631 to 1639 , under the suzerainty of the Mughals , built the Karan Mahal palace . Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal . Anup Singh , who ruled from 1669 – 98 , made substantial additions to the fort complex , with new palaces and the Zenana quarter ( royal dwelling for females ) . He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan @-@ i @-@ Am ( public audience hall ) and called it the Anup Mahal . Gaj Singh who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal ( the Moon palace ) . Following him , Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and he lavishly decorated the audience hall ( see picture in info box ) with glass and lively paintwork . <unk> Singh who reigned from 1872 to 1887 built the Badal Mahal ( the weather palace ) named so in view of a painting of falling rain and clouds ( a rare event in arid Bikaner ) . Ganga Singh who ruled from 1887 to 1943 built the Ganga Niwas Palace , which has towers at the entrance patio . This palace was designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob . Ganga Singh ’ s son <unk> Singh succeeded his father in 1943 but acceded to the Union of India in 1949 . He died in 1950 . 
 Bikaner came under the suzerainty of the British Raj under a treaty of paramountcy signed in 1818 , where after the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily on refurbishing their Junagarh fort . However , during the 18th century , before this treaty was signed , there was internecine war between rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also amongst other Thakur , which was put down by the British troops . It is reported that during the attack by Jodhpur army , of the two entrances to the fort ( one in the east and the other in the west ) , the eastern entrance and the southern rampart were damaged ; marks of cannonballs fired are seen on the southern façade of the fort . 
 Ganga Singh was the best @-@ known king among the Rajasthan princes . A favourite of the British Raj , he earned the title of Knight Commander of the Star of India . He served as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet , represented the country at the Imperial First World War Conferences and the British Empire at the Versailles Peace Conference and was aware of the shift of fortunes in the World War II but died in 1943 , before the war was won by the allies . His contribution to the building activity in Junagarh involved separate halls for public and private audience in the Ganga Mahal and a durbar hall for formal functions . The hall where he held his Golden Jubilee as a ruler of Bikaner is now a museum . He also got a new palace - north of Junagarh fort - designed and built by Swinton , the third of the new palaces built in Bikaner and named it Lalgarh Palace in the name of his father and shifted his residence from Junagarh fort to this palace in 1902 . The royal family still lives in a special suite in the Lalgarh palace , which they have converted into a heritage hotel . 
 = = Structures = = 
 The structures built within the Junagarh fort are the palaces and temples , which are made of red sandstone ( <unk> ) and marble . The palaces are described as picturesque with their assortment of courtyards , balconies , kiosks and windows . The fort , the temples and the palaces are preserved as museums and provide insight into the grandiose living style of the past <unk> of Rajasthan . The fort is called “ a paradox between medieval military architecture and beautiful interior decoration ” . 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The massive fort built in the plains of Bikaner has a rectangular ( quadrangular ) layout with a peripheral length of 1 @,@ 078 yards ( 986 m ) . The fort walls are 14 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) wide and 40 feet ( 12 m ) in height . It encompasses an area of 63 @,@ 119 square yards ( 5 @.@ 28 ha ) . It was surrounded by a moat which was 20 – 25 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 6 m ) deep with a base width of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) and top width of 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . However , the moat no longer exists . The fort is well fortified with 37 bastions ( ‘ <unk> ’ in local language ) and seven gates ( two are main gates ) to counter enemy attacks . The fort was built as a “ new stronghold ” outside of the ruins of an old fort built by Rao Bika and on the periphery of the Bikaner city walls ( 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) from the city centre ) ; the old fort was demolished a century after it was built . 
 The fort with seven gates contains several palaces , pavilions and many temples of Hindu and Jain religions - the earliest dated to the 16th century . A major feature of the fort is the stone carving done in red and gold coloured sandstones . The interiors of the palaces are decorated and painted in traditional Rajasthani style . The Junagarh palaces have a large number of rooms , as every king built his own separate set of rooms , not wanting to live in his predecessors ’ rooms . These structures were considered as “ at par with those of Louis ’ s France or of Imperial Russia ” . Several types of architectural style are discerned in the fort complex and hence it is called a true depiction of composite culture . The earliest style is of Rajput architecture , defined by Gujarati and Mughal architectural influence reflecting the association with Mughal rulers , the second type is of semi @-@ western architecture reflecting British influence , and finally the revivalists Rajput architecture that evolved particularly during the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh . Only the most representative of all these architectural styles are on display for visitors . Thus , the unique monuments on display in the Junagarh Fort represent sixteen successive generations of the rulers of Bikaner , starting from the end of the 16th century . 
 Gates 
 While the main entry gate was Karan Pol or Parole , facing east , the current gate of entry is called Suraj Pol ( meaning the Sun gate ) , ' pol ' also colloquially spelt <unk> , built in gold coloured or yellow sandstone , unlike the other gates and buildings built in red sandstone . It is the east facing gate permitting the rising Sun ’ s rays to fall on the gate , which is considered a good omen . The doors of this gate are strengthened with iron spikes and studs to prevent ramming by elephants during an attack . At the entrance to the gate , two red stone statues of elephants with <unk> stand as sentinels . The gate was also the location for announcing the arrival and departure of royalty by musicians playing the trumpet from a gallery in the gate . The other gates are Karan Pol , Daulat Pol , Chand Pol ( a double gate ) and Fateh Pol ; these provided access to various monuments in the fort . The Karan Pol gate is also braced with iron spikes to prevent battering of the gate by elephants . To the right of this gate is Daulat Pol . Forty @-@ one hand imprints are seen on the Daulat Pol gate wall , in red colour , of the wives of the Maharajas of Bikaner , who committed sati ( self immolation ) on the funeral pyres of their husbands who died in battle . 
 Between the main gate and the palace , there is a quadrangle , and then another gate called the <unk> gate ( triple gateway ) before accessing the royal chambers . Next to this gate is a small temple called the Har Mandir , where the Royal family used to offer worship . In the quadrangle , which houses a large pavilion with a water pool built in Carrara Italian marble . The Karan Mahal , where public audience was held in the Diwan @-@ i @-@ Am by Karan Singh ( 1631 – 39 ) and his successors till the 20th century , can also be seen in the same quadrangle . 
 = = = Temples = = = 
 Har Mandir temple was the royal chapel - private temple of the royal family . The royal family celebrated the Hindu festival of Dussera and <unk> here , apart from celebrating other family functions such as birthdays and marriages . In the Dussera celebrations , weapons and horses were worshipped here . The main deities worshipped in this temple are the Hindu deities Lakshmi Narayan , a combined representation of god Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi . 
 The Ratan Behari temple located near the Junagarh Fort , was built in 1846 by the 18th ruler of Bikaner . It was built in Indo @-@ Mughal architectural style using white marble . The Hindu god Krishna is deified in this temple .

 Karan mahal ( Public Audience Hall ) was built by Karan Singh in <unk> to mark his victory over the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb . It is considered as one of the most exquisite palaces built with gardens , which displays the aesthetic sensibilities of the royalty of Rajasthan . It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood fluted columns . Later Rajas , Anup Singh and Surat Singh , also added lot of glitter to this palace with inlaid polychrome glass , intricate mirror patterns , and red and gold paint . In the coronation chamber , there is a shored up alcove , which was used as a throne . 
 Phool Mahal ( " Flower Palace " ) is the oldest part of the palace and was built by king Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner , who ruled between 1571 @-@ 1668 . 
 Anup Mahal is a multi @-@ storey structure , which functioned as the administrative headquarters of the kingdom . It has ornate wooden ceilings with inlaid mirrors , Italian tiles , and fine lattice windows and balconies . It has some gold leaf paintings . It is considered as one of the “ grandest construction ” . 
 Chandra Mahal has the most luxurious room in the palace , which houses gold plated deities and paintings inlaid with precious stones . In the royal bedroom , mirrors have been strategically placed so that the Maharaja could see from his bed , any intruder entering his room . 
 Ganga Mahal was built in the 20th century by Ganga Singh who reigned for 56 years from 1887 to 1943 , has a large durbar hall known as the Ganga Singh Hall that houses the Museum . The museum has exhibits of war weaponry and also a World War I aeroplane ( biplane ) , which is stated to be well maintained . 
 Badal Mahal ( The weather palace ) is part of the Anup Mahal extensions . It has paintings of <unk> <unk> chiefs paying respects to the Maharaja of Bikaner in different types of turbans . Photos of people standing on nails , wood , swords and saws are also depicted here – a display of faith and endurance . The walls in this palace depict fresco paintings of the Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha amidst the rain clouds . 
 <unk> <unk> located both within and outside the fort in the Bikaner city ’ s by lanes are also of unique architectural style in home architecture . Aldous Huxley who visited these <unk> reportedly said “ They are the pride of Bikaner . ”

 The museum within the fort called the Junagarh Fort Museum was established in 1961 by Maharaja <unk> Singhji under the control of " Maharaja Rai Singhji Trust " . The Museum exhibits Sanskrit and Persian manuscripts , miniature paintings , jewels , royal costumes , <unk> ( royal orders ) , portrait galleries , costumes , headgear and dresses of gods ’ idols , enamelware , silver , palanquins , <unk> and war drums . The museum also displays armoury that consists of one of the assorted collection of post medieval arms . 
 Maharaja Rai Singhji Trust 
 Maharaja Rai Singhji Trust has been set up by the ' Royal family of Bikaner ' with the basic objective to showcase the fort with professional inputs in various areas and to improve the experience for visitors . Another objective is to promote education and research scholarships , cultural activities , setting up of libraries and integration with other such trusts . 
 = Battle of Trois @-@ Rivières = 
 The Battle of Trois @-@ Rivières ( Three Rivers in English ) was fought on June 8 , 1776 , during the American Revolutionary War . A British army under Quebec Governor Guy Carleton defeated an attempt by units from the Continental Army under the command of Brigadier General William Thompson to stop a British advance up the Saint Lawrence River valley . The battle occurred as a part of the American colonists ' invasion of Quebec , which had begun in September 1775 with the goal of removing the province from British rule . 
 The crossing of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia , who alerted British troops at Trois @-@ Rivières . A local farmer led the Americans into a swamp , enabling the British to land additional forces in the village , and to establish positions behind the American army . After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp , the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat . As some avenues of retreat were cut off , the British took a sizable number of prisoners , including General Thompson and much of his staff . 
 This was the last major battle fought on Quebec soil . Following the defeat , the remainder of the American forces , under the command of John Sullivan , retreated , first to Fort Saint @-@ Jean , and then to Fort Ticonderoga . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Continental Army , which had invaded Quebec in September 1775 , suffered a severe blow in the disastrous attack on Quebec City on New Year 's Eve in 1775 . Following that loss , Benedict Arnold and the remnants of the army besieged Quebec until May 1776 . 
 Early on May 6 , three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour . Troops on these ships were immediately sent into the city and , not long after , General Guy Carleton formed them up and marched them out to the American siege camp . General John Thomas , then in command of the American forces , had already been making arrangements to retreat , but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic . He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18 . 
 = = = British forces at Trois @-@ Rivières = = = 
 Throughout the month of May and into early June , ships carrying troops and war supplies continued to arrive at Quebec . By June 2 , Carleton had added the 9th , 20th , 29th , 53rd and 60th Regiments of Foot , along with General John Burgoyne , to his command . Also arriving in the fleet were Hessian troops from Brunswick commanded by Baron Riedesel . 
 After the Americans ' flight early in May , Carleton took no significant offensive steps but on May 22 , he sent ships carrying elements of the 47th and 29th Foot to Trois @-@ Rivières under Allan Maclean 's command . Brigadier General Simon Fraser led more forces to Trois @-@ Rivières on June 2 . By June 7 , the forces on the ground at Trois @-@ Rivières had grown to nearly 1 @,@ 000 , and 25 ships carrying additional troops and supplies were anchored in the river near the village and for several miles upriver . 
 = = = American arrangements = = = 
 Since Thomas 's retreat was instigated by the early arrival of three ships of the fleet carrying only a few hundred troops , he was unaware of the true size of the British army . In a war council at Sorel on May 21 , which included representatives of the Second Continental Congress , a decision was reached to make a stand at Deschambault , between Trois @-@ Rivières and Quebec . This decision was reached based on sketchy reports and rumors of the British troop strengths and was dominated by the non @-@ military Congressional representatives . Thomas contracted smallpox on May 21 , from which he died on June 2 . He was briefly replaced by Brigadier General William Thompson , who relinquished command to General John Sullivan when he arrived on June 5 at Sorel with further reinforcements from Fort Ticonderoga . 
 On June 5 , just hours before Sullivan 's arrival , Thompson sent 600 troops under the command of Colonel Arthur St. Clair toward Trois @-@ Rivières with the goal of surprising and beating back the small British force believed to be there . Sullivan , on his arrival at Sorel , immediately dispatched Thompson with an additional 1 @,@ 600 men to follow . These forces caught up with St. Clair at Nicolet , where defenses against troop movements on the river were erected the next day . On the night of June 7 , Thompson , St. Clair , and about 2 @,@ 000 men crossed the river , landing at Pointe du Lac , a few miles above Trois @-@ Rivières . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The American crossing had been seen by a local militia captain , who rushed to the British camp at Trois @-@ Rivières and reported to General Fraser . Thompson left 250 men to guard the landing and headed the rest towards Trois @-@ Rivières . Unfamiliar with the local terrain , he convinced Antoine Gautier , a local farmer , to guide the men to Trois @-@ Rivières . Gautier proceeded , apparently intentionally , to lead the American army into a swampy morass from which it took them hours to extricate themselves . In the meantime , the British , having been alerted to the American presence , proceeded to land troops from the fleet and formed battle lines on the road outside the village . Ships were also sent up to Pointe du Lac , where they drove the American guards there to flee across the river with most of the boats . 
 Some of the Americans , led by Thompson , made their way out of the swamp to be confronted by HMS Martin , which drove them back into the swamp with grapeshot . A column of men under Colonel Anthony Wayne fared only a little better , arriving out of the swamp only to face Fraser 's formation . A brief exchange of fire took place : but the Americans , clearly outmatched by Fraser 's forces , broke and ran , leaving arms and supplies behind . Portions of the American force retreated to the edge of the woods , which gave them some cover , and attempted to engage some of the British troops : but fire from those troops kept them off the road and fire from some of the ships in the river kept them from the shore . St. Clair and a number of men made it back to the landing site , only to find it occupied by the British troops . Only by returning to the swampy woods and continuing to flee upriver did these men escape capture at that time . Wayne eventually managed to form a rear guard of about 800 men , which attempted an attack on the British position ; but they were driven back into the woods . Wayne then led a staggered retreat , in which companies of men slipped away , with the woods giving cover to hide their true numbers . 
 General Carleton arrived in Trois @-@ Rivières late in the action . A detachment of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière @-@ du @-@ Loup , a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence . Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw , allowing most of the Americans to escape , either because he did not want to deal with large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further . A significant number of Americans did not make it that far , and were captured . These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers . It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers . In all , 236 captives were taken . Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle , while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Scattered fragments of the American army made their way overland on the northern shore to Berthier , where they crossed over to Sorel . Some did not return until June 11 . Sullivan , who counted 2 @,@ 500 effective troops under his command , at first wanted to make a stand at Sorel , but smallpox , desertions , and word that the British fleet was again under sail to come upriver convinced him it was time to retreat . By June 17 , the Continental Army had left the province ; but not before it had attempted to burn Montreal , as well as destroying Fort Saint @-@ Jean and any boats of military value capable of navigating Lake Champlain . 
 Carleton ordered most of the British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9 , but they did not actually leave until he joined them on June 13 . A detachment of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal . The British fleet arrived at Sorel late on the 14th ; the Americans had left there just that morning . Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17 , and also arrived at Fort Saint @-@ Jean in time to see the last Americans ( the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold ) push away from its burning remnants . 
 The captives were treated quite generously by Carleton . Although the conditions of their imprisonment were not always good , he provided them with clothing , and eventually had all but the officers transported to New York and released .

A plaque honouring the American dead was placed in the Parc Champlain by the Daughters of the American Revolution in August 1985 . The third plaque honours Antoine Gauthier for his role in misleading the American troops . 
 During the American retreat from Quebec , and in this battle , wounded soldiers were treated at the Ursuline convent in Trois @-@ Rivières . Congress never authorized payment for these services and the convent has retained the bill . A bill that was about £ 26 at the time is now estimated to be between ten and twenty million dollars .

 = Tenebrae ( film ) = 
 Tenebrae ( also known as Tenebre ) is a 1982 Italian giallo film written and directed by Dario Argento . The film stars Anthony Franciosa as American author Peter Neal , who – while in Rome promoting his latest murder @-@ mystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by the novel . John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi co @-@ star as Neal 's agent and assistant ; Giuliano Gemma and Carola <unk> appear as detectives investigating the murders . John Steiner , Veronica Lario and Mirella D 'Angelo also feature . The film has been described as exploring themes of dualism and sexual aberration , and has strong metafictional elements ; some commentators consider Tenebrae to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work , most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women . 
 After Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977 's Suspiria and 1980 's Inferno , Tenebrae represented the filmmaker 's return to the giallo horror subgenre , which he had helped popularize in the 1970s . Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticise him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work . The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento , who channelled the experience into the writing of Tenebrae . The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980 , and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted " to kill for nothing " . 
 Shot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios , Tenebrae utilised mostly modern @-@ looking locations and sets to help Argento realise his intent that the film reflect a near @-@ future with a diminished population ; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome . Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli , Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark , realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time ; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere , with sharp angles and modernistic spaces . Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebrae 's music , a synth @-@ heavy score inspired by rock and disco music . 
 Tenebrae was a modest success in Italy ; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes . However , in the United Kingdom , it was added to the infamous list of " video nasties " and banned from sale until 1999 . The film 's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984 , when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane . In its cut form , Tenebrae received a mostly negative critical reception , but the original , fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal ; it is considered by some to be one of Argento 's best thrillers . The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh said that it was " in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Peter Neal , an American writer of violent horror novels , is in Italy to promote his latest work , Tenebrae . He is accompanied by his literary agent , Bullmer and his assistant , Anne . Neal is unaware that he has also been followed to Rome by his embittered ex @-@ wife , Jane . Just before Neal arrived in Rome , Elsa , a young female shoplifter , was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant . The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree . Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Giermani and his female partner , Inspector Altieri . 
 More killings take place . <unk> , a beautiful lesbian journalist , is murdered at her home along with her lover Marion . Maria , the young daughter of Neal 's landlord , is later hacked to death with a axe after discovering the killer 's lair . Neal notices that TV interviewer <unk> Berti has an unusually intense interest in his work . That night , Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni watch Berti 's house . Gianni approaches the house alone to get a better view and sees an assailant hack Berti to death with an axe . However , Gianni is unable to see the murderer 's face . He returns to Neal to find the novelist has been knocked unconscious on the lawn . 
 Giermani discovers that Berti was obsessed with Neal 's novels , and believes the killings will stop now that Berti is dead . However , Bullmer , who is having an affair with Jane , is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square . Gianni is haunted by the thought that he missed the importance of something he saw at Berti 's house . He returns to the house and suddenly remembers that he had heard Berti confessing to his attacker : " I killed them all , I killed them all ! " Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone , he is strangled to death from the back seat of his car . 
 Jane sits at her kitchen table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one of her arms . The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor . The killer continues to hack at her until she is dead , at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer . Upon learning the details of Berti 's sadistic murder spree , Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island . The memory torments Neal and <unk> his previously repressed lust for blood , driving him insane . 
 Inspector Altieri arrives at the house and Neal kills her . Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards ; when Neal sees that he cannot escape , he slits his throat in front of them . Finding the telephone out of order , Giermani and Anne go outside to report the incident from the car radio . Giermani returns to the house and is murdered by Neal , who had faked his own death . Neal waits inside for Anne to return , but when she opens the door , she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal . The horror @-@ stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Critics have identified various major themes in Tenebrae . In interviews conducted during the film 's production , the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his own views as to the thematic content of the film . As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in Broken Mirrors / Broken Minds : The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento , " ... Argento has never been more articulate and / or analytical than he was on the subject of Tenebrae . " Film scholar William Hope identifies that the film is devoid of classical narrative progression , and writes that the characters " lack a narrative function or purpose , existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion , their death hardly moving the narrative on at all . Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored " . According to James Gracey , author of a book about Argento 's work , with Tenebrae " explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations , such as Freudian psychology , sexual deviancy , repressed trauma , voyeurism , audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death . " Water is linked constantly with Neal ; in almost every scene his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water in some way . Later , this device is used over and over as a clue to the ultimate killer 's identity – Neal himself . 
 = = = Dark doubles = = = 
 According to Argento expert Thomas Rostock , Tenebrae is filled with rhyming imagery that relates to the film 's exploration of " the dual nature of [ the ] two active murderers " using doubles , inversions , reflections and " re @-@ reflections " . Every major character has at least one double , and the theme extends to objects , locations , actions and events – major and minor . The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths , aircraft , homeless men , otherwise @-@ meaningless public brawls in the background , car accidents , typewriters ( literally side @-@ by @-@ side ) , keys , handkerchief , hands caught in doors and the characters themselves . Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri . McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani : " Giermani ... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator ... the detective / writer and the writer / detective each belittles his other half , as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away . " McDonagh also observes that , in what is arguably the film 's most potent shock , Neal at one point really does make Giermani " go away " , virtually replacing him on screen " in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous . " Earlier , Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience 's surprise – was not Anne , but Altieri . Tenebrae itself is split almost exactly into two parts . The first half belongs to the murders of Berti ; the second to those of Neal . The two are set up as mirrors of one another . Berti 's killings with a razor are clinical , with " lingering sexualised aggressiveness " , whereas Neal 's ( with an axe ) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity ; they are swift and to the point . 
 Kevin Lyon observes , " The plot revolves around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer ( about whom we learn very little , itself unusual for Argento ) to the eminently likeable hero , surely the film 's boldest stroke . " While noting that the device is " striking " , McDonagh comments that this guilt transmission / transfer occurs between two dark doubles who are seriously warped individuals . She suggests that " Neal and Berti ... act as mirrors to one another , each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other . " Berti 's obsession with Neal 's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer , while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of " elaborate fiction " . When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people , Neal screams at him , " It was like a book ... a book ! " 
 = = = Metafiction = = = 
 The moment at which the first half becomes the second is punctuated by the rising score and pan to an otherwise meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament . According to Rostock , the meaning is clear : it marks the spot when Berti 's spree ends and Neal 's rampage begins . Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself , until that moment a typical , " clichéd and remote " giallo . Neal , previously passive , begins to control what happens in his own story , which is more personal with " weight and meaning " . According to Rostock , this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it , all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot . According to Kim Newman , the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film : " art that kills people " . Rostock agreed , saying that as the film is a commentary on art , the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself . 
 According to Gracey , a number of critics have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal , speculating that he serves as an alter @-@ ego of the director . Gracey refers to Tenebrae as a " reflexive commentary on [ the director 's ] earlier work . " The director himself saw the film in the same light , claiming it was a reaction to accusations that " Dario Argento was a misogynist ... a criminal ... a murderer . " Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into Tenebrae . A scene in which a woman criticises the lead character 's books as " sexist " , featuring " women as victims , <unk> , male heroes [ and ] macho bullshit " echoes criticisms of Argento 's own work . Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene " essentially autobiographical " , and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side , to " let it speak " . With Tenebrae in particular , he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics , creating a front or mystique about himself . Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception . Newman agrees that Argento used Tenebrae to address his own public image , the notion that someone who creates art as " sick and twisted " as his , must himself be sick and twisted . With Tenebrae 's reveal that the author is the killer , Newman argues that Argento is saying , " What if I were ? " 
 = = = " <unk> " sexuality = = = 
 As in many of Argento 's films , which tend to <unk> the murder of beautiful women , gender , sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film . The fictional novel within the film is described as being " about human perversion and its effects on society " . Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme , with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as " filthy , slimy perverts " . The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter , and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover . Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion . His " moral crusade " is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal 's novel . Neal 's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in " Freudian flashbacks " . As summarised by <unk> these flashbacks " expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth . " McDonagh also notes that Tenebrae expands on the themes of sexuality and <unk> found in Argento 's earlier films , The Bird with the Crystal Plumage , The Cat o ' Nine Tails , Four Flies on Grey Velvet ( 1972 ) , and Deep Red ( 1975 ) , but believes that Tenebrae 's " overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento 's other gialli . " She says that the film 's sexual content and abundant nudity make it " the first of Argento 's films to have an overtly erotic aspect " , and further notes that " Tenebrae is fraught with free @-@ floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature . " Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera , which demonstrates Argento 's " preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle " . 
 McDonagh noted that two sexually charged flashbacks are key to understanding Tenebrae . These distinct but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the film , usually immediately following a murder sequence . Although the flashbacks are never fully explained , the first reveals a beautiful young woman 's sexual humiliation ( though oral rape ) of a teenage boy , presumed to be Peter Neal . The young woman is mostly topless during this first sequence , and she humiliates the young man by jamming the heel of one of her shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held down by a group of gleeful boys on a pale @-@ white beach . The second flashback shows the vicious revenge @-@ murder of the woman some time later . McDonagh notes that all of the fetishistic imagery of these flashbacks , combined with the sadistic details of the murder sequences in the main narrative , " set the parameters of Tenebrae 's fetishistic and <unk> visual vocabulary , couched in terms both ritualistic and <unk> out of control ... Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and Tenebrae revels in them , inviting the spectator to join in ; in fact , it dares the viewer not to do so . " 
 = = = Vision impairment = = = 
 Argento 's protagonists in his giallo films almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind . It is these characters ' chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle ( the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders ) that generally provides much of the films ' narrative thrust . Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno ( Karl Malden ) in The Cat o ' Nine Tails , who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his niece to solve a mystery . In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage , Sam <unk> ( Tony <unk> ) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be " missing " ; as the film 's surprise ending makes clear , he did not " miss " anything , but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes . In Deep Red , Marcus ( David Hemmings ) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime , and does not realize his mistake until it 's almost too late . This recurring theme , according to Douglas E. Winter , creates " a world of danger and deception , where seeing is not believing " . 
 Flanagan observes that in Tenebrae , Argento offers two characters who suffer from impaired vision . Gianni ( Christian Borromeo ) is an eyewitness to an axe @-@ murder , but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue . Returning to the scene of the crime , he suddenly remembers everything , and is murdered before being able to tell anyone . Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie , Mickey Spillane , Rex Stout , and Ed McBain , but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books . He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is . 
 = = = An imaginary city = = = 
 In an interview that appeared in Cinefantastique , Argento noted that the film was intended as near @-@ science fiction , taking place " about five or more years in the future ... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded . Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers , or wants to remember ... It isn 't exactly my Blade Runner , of course , but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow . If you watch the film with this perspective in mind , it will become very apparent . " Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city , fifteen years in the future , and that the disaster the city 's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast . Despite Argento 's claim , Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science @-@ fictional concept " isn 't apparent at all " and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film . The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia , Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen . Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento 's intention did come across in these scenes , and Newman cites the on @-@ screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future . 
 While rejecting this thematic concern as unrealized by Argento , McDonagh noted that the result of the director 's experiment is a strange " architectural landscape " that becomes the " key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento 's earlier gialli . " Argento 's use of unusual architectural space and so @-@ called visual " hyper @-@ realism " results in an enormously fake looking environment . Seizing on the director 's additional comment , " ... I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen " , she notes that the film 's " fictive space couldn 't be less ' real ' " , with its " vast unpopulated boulevards , piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls , hard @-@ edged Bauhaus apartment buildings , anonymous clubs and parking garages . " The EUR district of Rome , where much of Tenebrae was filmed , was built in preparation for the 1942 World 's Fair , and intended by then @-@ Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism . Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realise his theme of an imaginary city ; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was , showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen . 
 = = Influences = = 
 According to the film historian and critic Bill Warren , Tenebrae is a typical example of the giallo film genre : " visually extremely stylish , with imaginative , sometimes stunning cinematography " , it presents " mysterious , gruesome murders , often in picturesque locations ; at the end , the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to terrify and surprise . " These narrative and stylistic clichés had been introduced years before Argento made his first thriller , 1970 's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage ; most critics point to Mario Bava 's The Girl Who Knew Too Much ( 1963 ) as the original giallo . 
 By the time Argento made Tenebrae , he had become the acknowledged master of the genre , to the point where he felt confident enough to be openly self @-@ referential to his own past , referencing the " reckless driving humor " from The Cat o ' Nine Tails ( 1971 ) and the hero from The Bird with the Crystal Plumage . The scene in which Veronica Lario 's character , Jane , returns home directly references The Bird with the Crystal Plumage with its large sculpture in the entrance hallway . 
 Warren and Alan Jones cite a scene where a character is killed in a public square as evoking the work of Alfred Hitchcock ; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein , while the lighting is more influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni . The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh argues that Argento 's influences for Tenebrae were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers . She refers to the strong narrative in the film as an example of " the most paranoid excesses of film noir . " McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang 's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt ( 1956 ) ( " in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence ... is in fact guilty of the murder " ) and Roy William Neill 's Black Angel ( 1946 ) ( " in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer " ) both use such a similar plot twist to Tenebrae that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story . 
 Kim Newman and Alan Jones suggest that the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie were both obvious influences on Tenebrae , and there are references to both authors throughout the film , as well as Rex Stout . One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle 's novel The Sign of Four ( 1890 ) : " How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth ? " A variation of this quote is used several times throughout Tenebrae . Another reference is the dog attack ; as something of a non sequitur , the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle 's The Hound of the Baskervilles ( 1901 – 1902 ) . Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene . The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly , Last Summer ( 1959 ) , especially the scene of Eva Robin 's wearing white while kneeling in the sand , which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film .

 = = = Development = = = 
 After completing Inferno ( 1980 ) , the second in his planned Three Mothers trilogy of supernatural horror films , Argento was expected to move straight into production of its concluding chapter . The first in the trilogy , Suspiria ( 1977 ) , had turned the director into what Alan Jones called " a horror superstar " , but Inferno had proven a difficult follow @-@ up . Argento had become unwell while writing the film , and his ill health continued into filming . In addition , Argento 's relationship with Inferno 's co @-@ producer 20th Century Fox had soured the director on " Hollywood politics " , so when Inferno was not well @-@ received upon release , Argento put the Three Mothers trilogy on hold . Inferno also flopped commercially . According to James Gracey , Argento – under pressure and feeling " the need to once again defy expectations " – returned to the giallo genre and began work on Tenebrae . Argento later stated that he wanted to " put on film a gory roller @-@ coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders " and that he " shouldn 't resist what [ his ] hardcore audience wanted " . He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last giallo so many other directors had made films derivative of – and inferior to – his own genre @-@ defining works . 
 Argento said that Tenebrae was influenced by two disturbing incidents he had in 1980 . After Suspiria 's surprise success , Argento was spending time in Los Angeles , where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly , to talk about Suspiria 's influence on him . According to Argento , the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent , eventually menacing . The fan claimed that he wanted " to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director 's work had affected him " , and that because the director had " ruined his life " , he in turn wanted to ruin Argento 's . Although no violence came of the threat , Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying , and felt unable to write . At the advice of his producers , Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica , where he felt safe enough to resume writing . However , after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls , issuing more threats . The director decided to return to Italy . Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan 's threats were " symptomatic of that city of broken dreams " with its " celebrity stalkers and senseless crime " . The second incident occurred during Argento 's stay at The Beverly Hilton , where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby . Later hearing of a drive @-@ by shooting outside a local cinema , Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings : " To kill for nothing , that is the true horror of today ... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it 's completely repugnant , and that 's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in Tenebrae . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Argento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken , but it eventually went to Anthony Franciosa . Kim Newman felt that Franciosa 's casting was fortunate , as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him . He also believed that if Walken had been cast , it would have been more obvious that he was the killer . According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi , the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one . In addition , Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time , but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during filming of Suspiria . Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a cameo in Tenebrae . According to Nicolodi , she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrow ( which eventually went to Veronica Lario ) . Alan Jones says that Nicolodi was cast as the woman on the beach in Neal 's flashback . However , Thomas Rostock says that Nicolodi was never intended for that role , only that of Jane . Transgender actress Eva Robin 's was later hired to play the woman on the beach . 
 When the American actress who had been hired to play Anne dropped out just before the start of principal photography , Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role . Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own , and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously , whom she said had much more personality than Anne . She said the role required little energy or imagination , but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim . Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play , as written . Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film , and that only the American characters had discernible personalities . Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough , Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright Tennessee Williams and their experience in theatre , leading the director to make sure their shared scenes " were an ordeal to endure " . The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa , " leave my woman alone ! " Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character 's last scene in the film , where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly , continuing over the film 's end credits . She had been directed to scream only a little , but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete , Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time , much to Argento 's and the crew 's surprise . Nicolodi said the scene was her " cathartic release from the whole nightmare " . 
 Although Tenebrae was an Italian production , most of the cast spoke their dialogue in English to increase the film 's chances of success in United States . For domestic audiences , the film was dubbed into Italian . The English @-@ language dub retained Franciosa 's , Saxon 's and Steiner 's natural voices . However , Nicolodi 's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell , Giuliano Gemma 's was dubbed by David Graham , and most of the female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta . Michele <unk> – frequent Argento collaborator , second assistant director on Tenebrae and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin 's in the second flashback scene . Another of Argento 's collaborators , Fulvio <unk> cameoed as a hotel porter . In common with several other Argento films , close @-@ ups of the killer 's gloved hands were Argento 's own . In the film 's Italian @-@ language dub , Argento also provided the opening voice @-@ over , reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal 's fictitious novel , Tenebrae . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks. shot mostly on location in Rome . Kim Newman described the Rome of Tenebrae as unlike the one usually shown on television and in films , with none of the usual historical landmarks . Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento , as some of his previous films had utilised so much of recognisable Italy . Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece ; Newman said it was Argento 's way of saying , " Rome is a vibrant city . It is modern . " Most of Tenebrae 's location shooting was carried out in Rome 's EUR business and residential district . The first flashback scene was filmed at the <unk> beach , south of the city near Ostia . The shoplifting scene near the beginning of Tenebrae was filmed on location at department store La <unk> , off Piazza Fiume . Bullmer 's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called " Le <unk> " in Rome 's Casal <unk> residential neighbourhood . The scene in which Neal 's landlord 's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti , switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti 's house for the confrontation with the killer . The scene at the beginning of the film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York . 
 Giuseppe <unk> – a frequent Argento collaborator – was the film 's production designer . The surroundings are given a bleached , " merciless " look , made from marble and stone façades , shiny metallic sculptures , with steel , water and glass surfaces . Some of the homes – specifically those of the lesbian couple and he first killer – are " cold , austere , brutalist " slabs of granite , and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds , with characters ' wearing pale @-@ coloured clothes against them – better , Newman felt , to contrast the blood once the violence started . The studio @-@ set scenes were filmed at Elios Studios in Rome , unlike Argento 's previous films in the city , which he had filmed at <unk> De Paolis . He could not use Elios because his idol Michelangelo Antonioni was using the studio to film Identification of a Woman ( 1982 ) at the time . The design and creation of Tenebrae 's special effects was supervised by Giovanni <unk> , who – with his brother <unk> – had a near @-@ monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time . The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times . Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had , which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the " wound " across the white wall , so the director had <unk> place an explosive squib in the prosthetic arm – a solution which apparently satisfied Argento . 
 Much of Tenebrae takes place during daytime , or in harshly over @-@ lit interiors . Except for the finale and some night scenes , the entire movie is shot with clear , cold light permeating the surroundings . The lighting and camerawork used in Andrzej <unk> 's Possession ( 1981 ) was an influence on the film 's look . Although <unk> / <unk> is a Latin / Italian word meaning " darkness " or " shadows " , Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible . The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a " cold , stark and semi @-@ futuristic look " . Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the " realistic manner of lighting " used in television police shows . The director explained that he was adopting " a modern style of photography , deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism . Today 's light is the light of neon , headlights , and omnipresent flashes ... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and , more than that , reassuring . " Argento filmed half @-@ empty streets and shops where he could , in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city . Tovoli used Kodak <unk> film stock ( 125 ASA speed rating ) for daylight scenes , and Kodak <unk> ( 250 ASA ) for night shoots . Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming , for the benefit of under @-@ developing in the lab and less colour loss . The ultimate aim was for images that were " crystal clear " , and night that was awash with light . 
 Film scholar Richard Dyer highlights several intelligent devices uses by Argento in the editing of the film , noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by " shots of pills and the sound of running water . " Steffen <unk> believes that the shock cuts in the latter part of the film are among cinema 's " most brutal and stylized " , and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism . Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it as much an example of art cinema as anything else . The initial murders are shot in a " clipped montage style " , which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene . Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set . One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor , only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera . This moment was not scripted , but resulted from Argento 's noticing the actors ' similar build while they were stood , one behind the other in front of him . 
 = = = Crane shot = = = 
 Gracey refers to the film 's cinematography as " nothing short of astounding " , and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento 's " passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals " . Influenced by the closing shot of The Passenger ( 1975 ) , on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer , one of Tenebrae 's main setpieces is the murder of the lesbian couple . To introduce the scene , Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes @-@ long tracking shot . Owing to its extreme length , the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete . It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home . Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes , but insisted on filming ten more . The scene , which lasts for two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes on @-@ screen , took three days to shoot . It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production ; the crane itself had to be imported from France . According to Gracey , the camera performs " aerial gymnastics " , scaling the victims ' house in " one seamless take , navigating walls , roofs , and peering in through windows , in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the <unk> of a seemingly secure home " . Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later , at the time it was " truly ground @-@ breaking " in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer 's viewpoint . Patrick McAllister of <unk> said the sequence should be considered " one of the most memorable moments in cinema " . According to McAllister , Tenebrae 's distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was " meaningless " . Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film 's plot , but called it " meaninglessly brilliant " . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 Some European publicity materials for the film , including posters and lobby card sets , advertised the film as Tenebre , and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title . However , on the print itself , during the opening credits , the title is clearly Tenebrae . In addition , the title of Neal 's latest book in the film is shown in closeup as being Tenebrae . In a lengthy interview with Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of Fangoria in 1983 and 1984 , the title was always referred to as " Tenebrae " . Early on in production , the film as referred to as Under the Eyes of the Assassin , which was later used as one of the poster taglines . In Japan , the film was released as Shadows , and in the United States it was released as Unsane in its initial – heavily edited – incarnation . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The Italian rock band Goblin had provided the scores for two of Argento 's previous films , Deep Red ( 1975 ) and Suspiria ( 1977 ) , but the director had employed English composer Keith Emerson for his foray outside of the giallo subgenre , 1980 's Inferno . Goblin had disbanded that year , but in 1982 Argento asked three of the band 's former members – Claudio Simonetti , Fabio Pignatelli and Massimo Morante – to work on Tenebrae . Owing to their history together , Simonetti felt it appropriate that Argento 's return to giallo films should utilise the core members of Goblin . The resulting synth @-@ driven score was credited to " Simonetti @-@ Pignatelli @-@ Morante " , as Goblin 's former drummer owned the rights to use the band 's name . 
 Tenebrae 's score is very different to those the band had produced for Argento previously . The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music , and he decided on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae . Simonetti described the score as an electronica / rock hybrid , with the main theme including disco elements . So it would not be difficult to accommodate Argento 's preference for long takes , Simonetti , Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3 – 4 minutes . Recording the score , Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter @-@ 8 , Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers , as well as a piano , electric piano , the Oberheim DMX digital drum , a Roland TR @-@ 808 drum machine , and Roland MC @-@ 4 music sequencer . Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar , while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar . 
 While the soundtrack is not as well regarded as Goblin 's earlier scores for Deep Red , Suspiria , or Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) , Tim Lucas felt it " ... so fused to the fabric of the picture that Tenebrae might be termed ... a giallo musicale ; that is , a giallo in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to occupy the same plane as the action and characters . " Writers David Kerekes and David Slater were also favorable to the score ; writing that the film " bristles with arresting imagery and a cracking musical score from ex @-@ members of Goblin " . Simonetti felt the score was good , but that it was only a " medium " -level success . However , it did enjoy a second wave of popularity being remixed in clubs . The album has had multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on the Italian <unk> label . That version consisted of only eight tracks . In 1997 , <unk> issued a greatly expanded version on CD , including eleven bonus tracks , with a running time of over an hour . In 2004 , the expanded CD was released in the US on the Armadillo Music label . In 2012 it was released again on vinyl by AMS Records ( Italy ) .

 = = = Original reception and censorship = = = 
 Tenebrae had a wide theatrical release throughout Italy and mainland Europe , something the director very much needed after having suffered major distribution problems with his previous film , Inferno . Released on 28 October 1982 , Tenebrae saw modest success at the box office in Italy and Europe , but it did not perform as well as some of Argento 's previous films . In Italy , Tenebrae had been released with a VM18 rating , meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen . Argento had desired a <unk> rating , both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film 's chances of commercial success . Tenebrae features scenes of female homosexuality ; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time , and Argento said he wanted to " recount this subject freely and in an open manner , without interference or being ashamed " . The VM18 rating upset him , as he believed it was a result of the sexual diversity on display rather than the film 's violence . 
 One of the film 's most excessively violent scenes features the death of Neal 's ex @-@ wife , Jane ( played by Veronica Lario ) . This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy . The original scene featured Jane 's arm being cut off at the elbow ; blood sprays from the wound onto white walls until the character falls to the floor . After a back @-@ and @-@ forth between Argento and Italian censors ( at the time a panel of judges ) , the scene was first trimmed from showing an " immense " spray to a small one , then a smaller one still . The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s , when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . According to Alan Jones , Berlusconi " did not want the public seeing [ Lario ] so explicitly murdered , even if it was in a film by his country 's premier horror expert " . For a few years , it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally , as prints were withdrawn altogether . A later DVD release did become available , with the scene restored . 
 Averaging a murder every ten minutes , Tenebrae ranks as one of Argento 's bloodiest films . In the United Kingdom , the film was shorn of five seconds of " sexualized violence " by the British Board of Film Classification prior to its theatrical release , on 19 May 1983 . The advertising campaign for Tenebrae featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a woman with her throat cut , blood dripping from the wound . According to Jones , who worked for Tenebrae 's distributor at the time , in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the London Underground refused to run them . New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon . A similar change was made to the soundtrack sleeve . 
 In the United States the film remained unseen in the US until 1984 , when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version under the title Unsane . It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing nearly all of the film 's violence , which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible . In addition , certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised , making the film 's narrative difficult to follow . This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews . 
 = = = Home media and " video nasty " list = = = 
 Tenebrae has been released on home media in many different versions in numerous territories . In 1983 , when the VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom , it was short by about four seconds . However , the film soon found itself included in a list of thirty @-@ nine so @-@ called " video nasties " that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK video stores under the Video Recordings Act 1984 . Deemed harmful to audiences , " video nasties " were strongly criticised for their violent content by the press , social commentators and various religious organizations . <unk> in 2011 , Thomas Rostock said that the higher @-@ than @-@ usual murder count for an Argento film was partially responsible , while James Gracey believed it was perhaps " the highly sexualised presentation of its violent content " . He went on to say , " Of all the titles placed on the video nasty list , Tenebrae is perhaps the most misunderstood and undeserving of the grimy status it gained through its association with the whole debacle . " Kim Newman agreed that Tenebrae 's reputation as a " video nasty " was unwarranted , saying that none of the on @-@ screen deaths are as gory or lingering as those in Argento 's previous films . He also believed Tenebrae would eventually be remembered on its own merits , rather than as part of the " video nasties " list . Nevertheless , the ban lasted until 1999 , when Tenebrae was legally released on videotape with one second of footage removed in addition to the previously censored five . In 2003 , the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it without any cuts . In Germany , the release was strongly cut , and reportedly seized by the authorities . 
 The film has since been released on DVD in the US , mostly uncut save for approximately twenty seconds of extraneous material . Tenebrae received an initial DVD release in March 1999 from Anchor Bay Entertainment , with a re @-@ release in May 2008 . The Anchor Bay release , though presented as " uncut " was not the fully restored version of the film . A DVD German release by Raptor was also missing about one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half seconds of material . In June 2011 , Arrow Films issued a special edition on DVD , but although the image quality was far better than in previous DVD releases , this version was " heavily lambasted " for carrying a transfer of the film that had visible noise and " distorted audio " . In 2013 , Arrow released a Blu @-@ ray edition that corrected the audio and video problems . Additional corrections were made to the transfer and released by Synapse films in 2016 , as a steelbook edition limited to 3000 copies . The Arrow & Synapse DVD and Blu @-@ ray releases are " completely uncut " .

 Tenebrae is now considered by many fans and critics to be one of Argento 's best films , with some considering it his last great one . AllMovie refers to the film " one of Dario Argento 's best thrillers " . Commenting in 1994 , Maitland McDonagh said Tenebrae was " in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made . " Richard Dyer , writing for the Directory of World Cinema : Italy , describes the film as a " tease " , one which is " perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction : being outwitted , wrong @-@ footed , led up the garden path " , and believed that the degree of lighting used in the film was unsurpassed . Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine said that Tenebrae " is a riveting defense of auteur theory , ripe with self @-@ reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts . It 's both a riveting horror film and an architect 's worst nightmare . " Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club noted " ... Argento makes some points about the intersection of art , reality , and personality , but the director 's stunning trademark setpieces , presented here in a fully restored version , provide the real reason to watch . " Almar Haflidason , in a review for BBC Online , opined , " <unk> beautiful and viciously exciting , welcome to true terror with Dario Argento 's shockingly relentless Tenebrae . " Tim Lucas in Video Watchdog said , " Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma thriller , Tenebrae contains more likeable characters , believable relationships , and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento film . " Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote , " Tenebre is a straight @-@ up giallo in the old @-@ school tradition . It may have been filmed in 1982 , but it comes straight out of the ' 70s tradition . We 've got all the usual suspects , including a writer for a main character , lots of killer @-@ cam point of view , some crazily over the top kills , and approximately seventy @-@ two twists before all is revealed ... For fans of Argento 's earlier giallo , this is a must @-@ see . " 
 Not all of the recent critical reaction to Tenebrae has been positive . Geoff Andrew of Time Out thought that the film was " unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards " . John Kenneth Muir , author of Horror Films of the 1980s , considers the film to be far inferior to Suspiria , but acknowledges that it was so " unremittingly gory " that it justified its US title of " Unsane " . John Wiley Martin , although evaluating the film as a " technically mesmeric " one , felt that thematically it was a " disappointingly retrograde step " for Argento . Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com referred to it as a " gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick " , while Dennis Schwartz dismissed it as trash . Gary Johnson , editor of Images , complained that " Not much of Tenebre makes much sense . The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences . And these are some of the bloodiest murders of Argento 's career . " In 2004 , Tim Lucas re @-@ evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably , noting that , " Tenebre is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm @-@ like softness of Luciano Tovoli 's cinematography , its sometimes over @-@ storyboarded violence ( the first two murders in particular look stilted ) , the many bewildering lapses in logic ... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Coming at the tail end of the giallo cycle , Tenebrae does not appear to have been as influential as Argento 's earlier films were on subsequent thrillers , though Douglas E. Winter said that Tenebrae 's Louma crane sequence was stylistically influential and was used in Brian De Palma 's The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . In addition , towards the end of the film , with Neal the killer supposedly dead , the camera faces Detective Giermani directly . When he stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor , Neal is revealed to be stood behind him , their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot . Alan Jones believes Tenebrae was the first film to use this specific shot , and that it was copied and referenced deliberately in many subsequent films . One such example , discussed as an unacknowledged " steal " from Tenebrae , is De Palma 's " surprise reveal " of John Lithgow standing behind a victim in Raising Cain ( 1992 ) . Robert Zemeckis 's What Lies Beneath ( 2000 ) also contains a very similar moment , although Zemeckis has denied having any familiarity at all with Italian thrillers . 
 Neal 's death scene at the end of Tenebrae – where the character is accidentally impaled by a sculpture – is directly referenced in Kenneth Branagh 's Hitchcockian mystery Dead Again ( 1991 ) . Kim Newman says that Branagh 's film imitates so entirely the sequence ( this time with Derek Jacobi as the " victim " of the sculpture ) that Branagh must have included the reference deliberately . The subsequent moment where Nicolodi screams over and over was cited by Asia Argento ( Nicolodi 's daughter with Dario Argento ) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress . 
 = Tropical Storm Gert ( 2005 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Gert was the fourth of seven tropical cyclones ( 4 hurricanes , two major hurricanes , and four tropical storms ) to make landfall in Mexico during 2005 . It formed in July in the Bay of Campeche , becoming the seventh named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . 
 As a tropical wave , Gert crossed Honduras and the Yucatán peninsula before organizing into Tropical Depression Seven on the afternoon of July 23 in the Bay of Campeche . It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert early the next day , gaining the record for the earliest formation of a seventh named storm in an Atlantic hurricane season . Gert strengthened little before making landfall south of Tampico , Tamaulipas , late on July 24 , with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 1005 mbar ( 29 @.@ 68 inHg ) . It moved inland over central Mexico before dissipating on the next day . Gert struck in approximately the same area as Hurricane Emily just four days earlier , causing fear of flooding and landslides due to saturated lands . As a precaution , some 1 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos <unk> and Tamiahua . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave entered the Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10 , and the wave developed into an area of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde . Despite the organization , the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear . However , those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave , as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18 . That day , while south of Puerto Rico , the wave split in two ; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas , and the southern half continued westward , with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing . 
 On July 22 , a new low pressure area developed while the tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras . However , this area of disturbed weather was unable to develop further , because the storm quickly moved over the Yucatán Peninsula . After its one @-@ day passage through the peninsula , the system entered the Bay of Campeche , but lacked any deep convection . This time , though , the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone . In part , this was due to the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large @-@ scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel to the mountain range , instead of through it . As a result , the National Hurricane Center in Miami , Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven , just 255 miles east @-@ southeast of Tuxpan , Mexico . Early on the July 24 , the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and received the name Gert . 
 Gert continued to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm , and reached a peak intensity of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 1005 mbar ( 29 @.@ 68 inHg ) . Gert made landfall just 6 miles ( 10 km ) to the southeast of Pánuco , still at peak intensity , at 10 : 00 p.m. CDT ( 0000 July 25 , UTC ) . However , due to its interaction with land , the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25 , and became a remnant low twelve hours after that . Six hours later , just a day after it made landfall , it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The track of Tropical Storm Gert was slightly more to the north than the National Hurricane Center 's initial predictions , giving the storm more time to develop . As a result , the NHC predicted that Gert could intensify further , but this did not occur . The primary emphasis of the forecasts was on the impact the rainfall from Gert could cause , particularly on this area of Mexico , which had been hit previously in the season by other hurricanes . 
 On July 23 , the Mexican Servicio Meteorológico Nacional ( National Weather Service ) issued a tropical storm warning for the eastern Mexican Gulf coast between Palma Sola and Cabo Rojo , as soon as Tropical Depression Seven formed . At that time , a tropical storm watch was issued from Cabo Rojo northward , until reaching La Cruz . That same day , the government of Veracruz declared a state of emergency in 24 municipalities of the state , making money from the National Disaster Fund available to those affected by the storm . As Gert came closer to the littoral , the tropical storm warning was extended northwards to La Cruz , and then to La Pesca , but it was canceled shortly after landfall . 
 Tropical Storm Gert struck just south of where Category 3 Hurricane Emily had struck , and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June . As a result , there were concerns that serious flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground . As a precaution , about 1 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos <unk> and Tamiahua in Veracruz , and about 6 @,@ 000 throughout Tamaulipas .

In Veracruz , the highest precipitation reading associated with Gert was 117 mm , ( 4 @.@ 61 in ) in El Higo . However , damage overall was minimal , amounting to $ 6 million ( 2005 USD , $ 60 million 2005 MXN ) , and there was only one reported fatality , from a man who was carried away by the La Silla River when he was pushing a stalled car across the flooded stream . 
 = = = Tamaulipas = = = 
 According to the government of Tamaulipas , most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents ' dwellings , primarily near Matamoros , Valle Hermoso , Reynosa and San Fernando . In Matamoros , part of the city lost power and running water ; in Valle Hermoso , two schools were damaged ; in Reynosa , 180 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas in five districts of the city , while in San Fernando , the main highway through the city was closed , and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane . 
 In Mier , the spillway of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped , causing a river bridge to be destroyed and electric power to be lost , as well . In Río Bravo , 50 families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road ; approximately 90 % of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm . In Altamira , 200 families were evacuated as well , and relocated to seven shelters . Also , in the municipalities of Burgos , <unk> , and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings . Overall , the municipalities of Mier , Reynosa , Río Bravo , Valle Hermoso , Matamoros , San Fernando , San Carlos , Burgos , <unk> , Méndez , Soto la Marina , Mante and Altamira were affected in the state , losing potable water and electricity . 
 After the storm , the state government promised to take the necessary steps to prevent an outbreak of dengue and West Nile virus ; however , by June 29 , there had already been 187 cases of classic dengue , and 29 of hemorrhagic dengue , up from 8 cases two years before , and none the previous year .

 In Nuevo León , about 6 @,@ 000 residents who lived near the Conchos , <unk> , and Grande Rivers were evacuated from their residences across the state .

In the city , one building was evacuated , as a 100 ft ( 30 m ) fissure appeared on the ground near the structure . 
 In the municipalities of San Vicente <unk> , Valles and <unk> , 100 people were evacuated . 
 = Gone for Goode = 
 " Gone for Goode " is the first episode of the first season of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 31 , 1993 , immediately following Super Bowl XXVII . The episode was written by series creator Paul Attanasio and directed by executive producer Barry Levinson . " Gone for Goode " introduced regular cast members Daniel Baldwin , Ned Beatty , Richard Belzer , Andre Braugher , Wendy Hughes , Clark Johnson , Yaphet Kotto , Melissa Leo , Jon Polito and Kyle Secor . 
 The episode connects several subplots involving the detectives of a Baltimore Police Department homicide unit and establishes story arcs that continued through the first season . Among them are an investigation by Meldrick Lewis ( Johnson ) and Steve Crosetti ( Polito ) into a widow killing husbands for insurance money , as well as rookie Tim Bayliss ( Secor ) being assigned the murder of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl for his first case . Both of those subplots were taken directly from Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , the 1991 David Simon non @-@ fiction book from which the series was adapted . 
 " Gone for Goode " was seen by 18 @.@ 24 million viewers , the largest viewership of the first season , although NBC was initially disappointed with the ratings . The episode received generally positive reviews upon its original broadcast . Barry Levinson won an Emmy Award for his direction in " Gone for Goode " , and was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award . Paul Attanasio received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for the episode 's script . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The episode opens with Lewis ( Clark Johnson ) and Crosetti ( Jon Polito ) looking for a projectile a few yards away from the body of a man shot to death . The man 's girlfriend ( Oni <unk> Lampley ) , who was shot in the head during the incident but survived , tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money . The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands . Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands , Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy , but reach a dead @-@ end when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave . 
 Felton ( Daniel Baldwin ) hesitates to take a new murder case because he fears it will be too difficult to solve , so it is taken on by his partner Howard ( Melissa Leo ) , who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases . They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement , and much to Felton 's bewilderment , Howard solves the case easily . The owner of the house , Jerry <unk> ( Jim <unk> ) , literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview , during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder . 
 Munch ( Richard Belzer ) is reluctant to follow up on the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode , who was run over by a car . The case has been cold for three months , but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander ( Ned Beatty ) into reexamining it . Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes . Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car , Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair , but blond eyebrows . Munch and Bolander question him , believing the suspect ( Joe Hansard ) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman . He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk . 
 Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) tells Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) , an excellent detective but a lone wolf , that he must work with a partner . Pembleton ends up investigating the death of a 65 @-@ year @-@ old man with rookie detective Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) . Bayliss initially believes the death to be a heart attack , but Pembleton correctly determines it is a murder because the man 's car is missing . Police later arrest a man named Johnny ( Alexander Chaplin ) who is found driving the dead man 's car . During an interrogation , Pembleton fools Johnny into waiving his Miranda Rights , then sneakily persuades him into confessing to the murder . Bayliss , although convinced of Johnny 's guilt , nevertheless questions the ethics of Pembleton 's approach , prompting Pembleton to yell angrily at him in front of the other officers . The episode ends with Bayliss responding to his first homicide as the primary detective : the brutal murder of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl named Adena Watson .

 " Gone for Goode " was written by series creator Paul Attanasio and directed by executive producer Barry Levinson . Levinson was seeking to create a television series based on Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , a 1991 non @-@ fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives . Levinson and fellow executive producer Tom Fontana hired Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode . It was first television script Attanasio ever wrote . The episode was shot by director of photography Wayne Ewing . Stan <unk> started out working as editor , but departed before the process was done due to creative differences with Levinson . Tony Black finished the editing for " Gone for Goode " , but did not return for the rest of the season , and Jay Rabinowitz worked as editor for the remaining episodes . The costumes for the episode were designed by Van Smith , but he also did not return to work on subsequent episodes . Although it was first episode of Homicide : Life on the Street , it was not technically a television pilot because the network had already ordered a full season of episodes before " Gone for Goode " was produced . The first episode was noted at the time for weaving four separate storylines into a single episode , the first in a trend of multiple subplots in each Homicide show . NBC executives indicated to Attanasio and Levinson they would have preferred the script to focus on a single homicide case rather than four , but ultimately allowed the script to be filmed with all subplots included . Additionally , despite intense advance promotion of the Homicide premiere , Attanasio deliberately sought to introduce the show with little fanfare , avoiding sensational gimmicks in favor of character @-@ driven plot , quirky dialogue and morbid dark humor . 
 " Gone for Goode " included several storylines , and even exact bits of dialogue , adapted straight from Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets . Among them were the investigation into Calpurnia Smith , an elderly woman suspected of murdering five husbands in order to collect their life insurance policies . This was based on the real @-@ life case of Geraldine Parrish , who was also accused of killing five husbands for insurance money , and was eventually convicted for three of their deaths . A scene involving a funeral director accidentally exhuming the wrong body while investigating the Church case mirrored a similar situation described in Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets from the Parrish case . The Adena Watson murder case , which is assigned to Bayliss in the final scene of " Gone for Goode " , was adapted from the unsolved 1988 slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace , which made up a major part of the book . The Watson case became an important story arc throughout the first season which ended without the case being solved . The hit @-@ and @-@ run murder of Jenny Goode was also based on Simon 's book , and the murder of the elderly man was inspired by a case featured in the book in which a young homosexual man killed his elderly lover and stole his car . 
 Attanasio also based the characters in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon 's book . The difficulties Bayliss experienced with the case , as well as the extremely personal approach he took in attempting to solve it , were inspired by the real @-@ life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini , who was the primary detective in the Wallace case . Most of the detectives featured in the Homicide book said they were happy with their on @-@ screen counterparts , although Detective Harry Edgerton , the inspiration for Frank Pembleton , objected to a scene in " Gone for Goode " in which the character drinks milk in a bar , something Edgerton said he never does . 
 The episode opens with Crosetti and Lewis looking for clues in a dark alley . Levinson and Attanasio specifically wanted a dialogue @-@ driven prologue scene that did not immediately clarify the fact that the two men were detectives or what they were looking for . The dialogue and staging of the scene were imitated in the final scene of the last Homicide episode , " Forgive Us Our Trespasses " , which aired on May 21 , 1999 . In that final scene , Detective Rene Sheppard ( played by Michael Michele ) says to Lewis , " Life is a mystery , just accept it " , a line spoken by Crosetti in the first episode . Lewis also said , " That 's what 's wrong with this job . It ain 't got nothin ' to do do with life " , a line also spoken by Crosetti in the first episode . Early scenes in " Gone for Goode " also involved Giardello introducing rookie detective Bayliss to the homicide unit . Attanasio sought to use Bayliss ' orientation as a way of introducing exposition and background about the show to the viewer as well . 
 In writing the script , Attanasio , Levinson and Fontana wanted the dialogue to reflect the kinds of things detectives would talk about when not discussing murders or cases , which led to the inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office . Fontana , who compared the scenes to Levinson 's 1982 film Diner , said , " That really made the show different from other shows , because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn 't ( <unk> ) connect anything , but they did reveal a lot about the characters . " Levinson specifically asked that the body by Howard and Felton be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other police dramas did not portray corpses in a realistic way . 
 = = = Photography style = = = 
 Levinson and Fontana sought to establish many of the stylistic elements in the episode which would define the series for its entire run . Among them were near @-@ constant movement with hand @-@ held Super 16 cameras to give the episode a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time . Levinson said this camera and editing style was partially inspired by Breathless , the 1960 Jean @-@ Luc Godard film . The scenes were shot on @-@ location in Baltimore , as would be the case throughout the duration of the series . The use of hand @-@ held cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city , rather than on a sound @-@ stage in Los Angeles or New York City , where most shows are typically shot . Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore " to be a character in the show " . 
 While filming the episode , Levinson said he would simply allow the actors to perform while he switched back and forth between them with the hand @-@ held camera instead of filming carefully planned shots and individual scenes from multiple angles . This camera style largely persisted through the end of the series in 1999 . Some individual scenes involved a number of jump cuts repeated several times in fast succession . Another unusual stylistic element used in the episode involved sudden changes in jump @-@ screen direction ; a shot with an actor looking from left to right might immediately jump to another shot of the same actor looking from right to left . This process was born during the editing sessions for " Gone for Goode " , where Levinson insisted that the footage be edited to include the actor 's best performances . During editing , Tony Black cut together two shots that did not match and began looking for a cutaway shot he could use to disguise the edit . Levinson , however , liked the technique that came from cutting the two conflicting shots together and insisted it stay in . 
 In addition to stylistic touches , the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide : Life on the Street throughout the duration of the series . Among them was the white board where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black . The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the white board . The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story . Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show , particularly through the interactions between the detectives ; Levinson said of the first episode , " We have to inform the audience , but at the same time you want to do it with a sense of humor so you don 't seem too pretentious , in a way . " Several long @-@ standing character traits were established in " Gone for Goode " , including Kay Howard 's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton , which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together . The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real @-@ life Detective Donald Kincaid , who was the inspiration behind Felton , and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton , as chronicled in Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets . Howard 's perfect streak is based on a similar ( although shorter ) lucky streak experienced by the real @-@ life Detective Rich Garvey , who is also featured in David Simon 's book . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The episode was filmed over the course of seven days in Baltimore . The scene in which Pembleton and Felton try to find the correct police car in a large garage was filmed in a rundown early 20th @-@ century ballroom . The scene features dozens of white unmarked Cavaliers . Shortly before " Gone for Goode " was filmed , the Baltimore Police Department stopped using Cavaliers as their regular brand of police car , and agreed to sell their collection of leftover Cavaliers to the Homicide show for $ 1 . Although the cars were used as props in the episode , only two of the cars were actually drivable . The scenes set in the medical examiner 's office were filmed in the actual Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore . The actors , particularly Jon Polito , hated performing in the morgue because they found the atmosphere unsettling . Ned Beatty said of filming there , " The one thing you can 't get on camera is , oh boy , it smells . " The identification pictures of suspects that Munch looks through were all pictures of photos of members of the Homicide crew . One of the final scenes in the episode , featuring Polito , Johnson and Belzer speaking in an alley at night , was conceived , written and shot in one night simply because it was raining outside , and the Homicide crew wanted to take advantage of the location during a rainy night . 
 Levinson said he considered the interrogation scene in " Gone for Goode " between Braugher , Secor and Chaplin , to be the " defining scene " for Frank Pembleton 's character because it defined the character 's intelligence , quirkiness , sharp instincts and sneaky interrogation style . While filming that scene , Levinson commented to Tom Fontana that the acting was so effective , an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation . The comments partially inspired Fontana to write the first @-@ season episode , " Three Men and Adena " , which became one of the most critically acclaimed Homicide episodes . The final scene of the episode features Bayliss responding to the murder scene of Adena Watson in a rainy alleyway . The body was wrapped in a red raincoat , and Levinson worked with colorists to bleed out all the colors except that red to give the film a stark look . " Gone for Goode " originally included a scene with Gee and Bayliss discussing detective work at the police station . The scene , which was cut from the final episode , featured Gee comparing the work to challenges faced by literary character Sherlock Holmes , as well as Gee mistakenly referring to Holmes ' antagonist Moriarty as " Murray " . 
 " Gone for Goode " marks the first performance of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch , a character the actor has played in more than 300 television episodes in a number of shows , including Homicide and Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . Levinson said Belzer was a " lousy actor " during his first audition with the " Gone for Goode " script . Levinson asked Belzer to take some time to reread and practice the material , then come back and read it again . During his second reading , Levinson said Belzer was " still terrible " , but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance . " Gone for Goode " included guest appearances by actors who later become much more widely known . Steve Harris , who later achieved fame playing Eugene Young on the ABC legal drama The Practice , played an uncooperative suspect who repeatedly lies to Munch during questioning . Alexander Chaplin , who later played speechwriter James Hobert on the ABC sitcom Spin City , portrayed the alleged murderer Johnny in " Gone for Goode " . The comedic confession scenes involving Jim <unk> as accused murderer Jerry <unk> were almost entirely improvised . 
 The editing process for " Gone for Goode " proved difficult due to audio problems that forced producers to re @-@ shoot several scenes . However , the cast and crew also found the atmosphere fun during editing , so much so that Barry Levinson 's mother brought in home @-@ baked snacks and the crew had to be asked to stop visiting because they were slowing down the edit sessions . When the cast finally watched the last cut of " Gone for Goode " , they hugged each other in celebration . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Throughout the episode , Crosetti discusses with Lewis various conspiracy theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln , the 16th president of the United States . Crosetti disputes the accepted theory that actor John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln and instead theorizes that Jefferson Davis , the president of the Confederate States of America , organized the murder . Crosetti 's assassination theories about Lincoln would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the first season . Crosetti 's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana 's real @-@ life obsession with it . During an early scene in which a suspect tries lying to Munch , the detective berates the suspect for treating him as if he were Montel Williams instead of Larry King . King is a long @-@ time television journalist and host of CNN 's Larry King Live , whereas Williams is a more tabloid @-@ style television show host . Williams is also a Baltimore native , which becomes a point of discussion between Munch and Bolander . Munch tells a lying suspect that his false story has an " Elmore Leonard quality " , a reference to an American novelist and screenwriter . 
 When Munch wonders how Romans become Italians , he asks when " Friends , Romans , countrymen ; lend me your ears " turned into " Hey , yo ! " The former line is from the William Shakespeare play Julius Caesar . Munch says , " Great , let 's arrest Axl Rose " , a Guns N ' Roses musician , when he is told the suspect in a murder is blond . During one scene , the detectives eat steamed crabs . This was deliberately included in the episode to reflect the culinary culture of Baltimore , where eating crabs is extremely popular . During a discussion about Pembleton , Crosetti compares him to the lone wolf character played by actor Gary Cooper in the 1952 western film High Noon ; when trying to recall the title of the film , Crosetti said the character had a New York City type of attitude , prompting Lewis to believe he is referring to the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees , also starring Cooper .

 " Gone for Goode " was scheduled to premiere on January 31 , 1993 , in the time slot immediately following Super Bowl XXVII . Having consistently placed third in the Nielsen ratings during prime time since September 1992 , NBC hoped a large football audience coupled with an extensive advertising campaign would allow Homicide : Life on the Street to give the network a large ratings boost . The network ran numerous television commercials advertising the premiere episode , some of which focused on the involvement of Barry Levinson with the hope of capitalizing on the feature film director 's household name . 
 " Gone for Goode " was seen by 18 @.@ 24 million viewers . It earned an 18 rating , which represents the percentage of television @-@ equipped homes , and a 31 share , which represents percentage of sets in use . This marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since The Wonder Years in 1988 . It was also the largest viewership of the first season , in large part due to its 10 : 25 p.m. time @-@ slot immediately following the Super Bowl . Nevertheless , NBC considered it a disappointing performance , based on the amount of advertising and press coverage the episode received . The episode received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did . Levinson later said the Super Bowl crowd might not have been perfectly suited to Homicide : Life on the Street . In particular , regarding the episode 's complex story lines and distinctive visual style , he said , " I imagine anyone who has been drinking a lot at a Super Bowl party might have trouble following the show .

 The debut episode received generally positive reviews . Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register said , " One word about ' Gone for Goode ' - wow . " Littlefield praised the episode for dropping the viewer into the middle of an episode with complex characters and storylines without getting too confusing . People magazine reviewer David Hiltbrand called the episode " extraordinary " and gave it an A grade . He complimented the realism , the hand @-@ held camera work and the cast , particularly Belzer . Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times complimented the cast and praised the show for not depending on car chases or action sequences . Grahnke also said the show " has the spice , dry wit and ethnic diversity of the Hill Street Blues crew , with even more eccentricities and a heightened sense of realism " . John Goff of Daily Variety said the episode was well filmed and edited , and included a strong cast with performances " above normal level of series work " . Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts particularly praised Andre Braugher 's performance : " It 's not often you actually witness a TV star being born ...

 = California State Route 78 = 
 State Route 78 ( SR 78 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from Oceanside east to Blythe , traversing nearly the entire width of the state . Its western terminus is at Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in San Diego County and its eastern terminus is at I @-@ 10 in Riverside County . The route is a freeway through the heavily populated cities of northern San Diego County and a two @-@ lane highway running through the Cuyamaca Mountains to Julian . In Imperial County , SR 78 travels through the desert near the Salton Sea and passes through the city of Brawley before turning north and passing through an area of sand dunes on the way to its terminus in Blythe . 
 SR 78 was one of the original state highways designated in 1934 , although portions of the route existed as early as 1900 . However , it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959 . The freeway section in the North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built in the middle of the twentieth century in several stages , including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway , and has been improved several times . An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012 . There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 78 begins in Oceanside as a continuation of Vista Way . As it encounters a traffic signal and crosses over I @-@ 5 , the route becomes a suburban freeway traveling east through Oceanside . The freeway loosely parallels Buena Vista Creek before entering the city of Vista . Turning southeast , SR 78 continues into the city of San Marcos near California State University San Marcos and enters Escondido , where it has an interchange with I @-@ 15 . A 2011 Caltrans study estimated that the average commuter encountered a delay of 10 minutes on the portion from I @-@ 5 to I @-@ 15 . After passing the Center City Parkway ( I @-@ 15 Business ) interchange , the freeway abruptly ends at the intersection with Broadway . SR 78 then makes a turn south onto Broadway and continues through downtown Escondido by turning east onto Washington Avenue and south onto Ash Street , which becomes San Pasqual Valley Road . 
 Turning east once again , SR 78 leaves the Escondido city limits and enters the San Pasqual Valley as it provides access to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and San Pasqual Battlefield State Park . After leaving the San Pasqual Valley , the road follows a serpentine alignment , heading south to enter the community of Ramona as Pine Street . In Ramona , SR 78 intersects SR 67 and makes a turn east onto Main Street , going through downtown Ramona . The highway leaves Ramona as Julian Road , which continues on a winding mountain alignment through Witch Creek to Santa Ysabel where it meets SR 79 . 
 SR 78 runs concurrently with SR 79 across the headwaters of the San Diego River and through the hamlet of <unk> , briefly entering Cleveland National Forest before reaching Julian and entering the town as Washington Street . The route , still concurrent with SR 79 , turns east onto Main Street and travels through downtown Julian before SR 79 diverges south towards Cuyamaca and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road . The road intersects with County Route S2 ( CR S2 ) at a junction called Scissors Crossing ; CR S2 runs concurrently in a wrong @-@ way concurrency . Shortly afterwards , SR 78 enters Anza @-@ Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park . Although this route travels many miles south of the town of Borrego Springs , it provides access to the town via CR S3 . SR 78 travels through the town of Ocotillo Wells before exiting the state park and entering Imperial County . 
 In Imperial County , SR 78 intersects with SR 86 , running concurrently with it southwest of the Salton Sea and northwest of San Felipe Creek . SR 78 passes through the desert community of Elmore Desert Ranch before entering the city of Westmorland . The route , still concurrent with SR 86 , enters into the city of Brawley as Main Street , where SR 86 splits to the south towards El Centro . SR 78 continues north onto the Brawley Bypass , a freeway that passes to the north of downtown Brawley . SR 111 runs concurrently with SR 78 for a short duration before the latter exits from the freeway and continues east . 
 Then , SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley , running concurrently with it for a brief distance . Shortly after passing through the small community of Glamis , the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe , passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve . As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border , SR 78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde , where the river turns away from the highway and SR 78 enters Riverside County . 
 As it nears Blythe , the highway makes a sharp turn east onto 32nd Avenue before turning north on <unk> Boulevard . It makes a right on 28th Avenue before turning north on South Neighbours Boulevard and passing through Ripley . SR 78 continues north for a few more miles to its terminus at I @-@ 10 , approximately seven miles ( 11 km ) west of the Arizona border . North of I @-@ 10 , Neighbours Boulevard becomes Interstate 10 Business for a block before the business route turns east toward Blythe . 
 SR 78 is designated as the Ronald Packard Parkway ( after a former Congressman named Ronald Packard from the area ) from I @-@ 5 in the city of Oceanside to I @-@ 15 in the city of Escondido , and Ben Hulse Highway ( after a former state senator named Ben Hulse ) from SR 86 near Brawley to I @-@ 10 near the city of Blythe . The portion of SR 78 from SR 86 in Brawley to CR S3 near Anza @-@ Borrego Desert State Park is designated as part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail auto tour route , promoted by the National Park Service . An informal nickname for the road is " the Hops Highway , " referring to the fact that the 60 @-@ mile ( 97 km ) stretch of SR 78 from Oceanside to Julian passes by one @-@ third of all the breweries in San Diego County . 
 SR 78 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , although only the metropolitan section of SR 78 is a freeway . The section of SR 78 from the western junction of SR 79 to the western junction with SR 86 is designated by the California State Legislature as eligible by law for the State Scenic Highway System ; however , only the section in Anza Borrego Desert State Park has officially been designated by Caltrans as being part of the system , meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a " memorable landscape " with no " visual intrusions " , where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community ; it gained this status in 1971 . SR 78 from I @-@ 5 to I @-@ 15 , and from the eastern junction with SR 86 to the eastern junction with SR 111 is part of the National Highway System ( NHS ) , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In 2013 , SR 78 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 670 between the San Diego – Imperial county line and the western SR 86 junction , and 163 @,@ 000 between Twin Oaks Valley Road and Nordahl Road , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway .

 The Old Banner Toll Road connected the towns of Julian and Banner in 1871 , after a gold rush began in 1870 , and eliminated the need to manually lower supplies to gold miners down a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 300 m ) slope . The county bought the road from Horace Wilcox in 1874 , and removed the toll . The road remained in service until 1925 , and remained operational until a flood in the winter season of 1979 – 1980 . By August 1874 , a road from Valle de las Viejas to Julian was open and accessible for horse teams . In the meantime , the City of Oceanside began discussions regarding a road east from Oceanside through the San Marcos valley . Efforts to realign the road from Ramona to Julian began in 1892 , when a county surveyor examined the prospect of shifting the road away from the Graves hill . 
 Before the designation of SR 78 , a road known as the Brawley @-@ Westmorland @-@ Julian @-@ Oceanside Highway ( connecting Oceanside , Escondido , Ramona , Julian , Westmorland , and Brawley ) existed during the early twentieth century . This road roughly followed the current routing of SR 78 from Escondido to the east of Brawley , although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley . No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919 ; it was necessary to travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe . East of the Sand Hills , there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde , which roughly follows the routing of SR 78 . 
 At this time , when the road from the west into Julian had been approved , many in the community began discussing a road east into the Imperial Valley . There were many proposed alignments besides the one east of Julian through Banner , including through the San Felipe Valley , and the Montezuma Valley . The plan was to construct the Santa Ysabel grade portion as a gravel road , and the rest of the road between Ballena ( near Ramona ) and Julian as a concrete road . The work to pave the road from Santa Ysabel to Julian was nearing completion in September 1920 . Grading was completed by August 1921 , and paving work continued , as well as grading on the Santa Ysabel and Julian grades . In 1922 , the Automobile Club of Southern California scouting expedition reported that the road from Ramona to Julian was " in excellent condition " though the pavement was poor from Ballena to Santa Ysabel , and under construction just east of Santa Ysabel . 
 A road from Julian to Kane Springs was completed in 1925 . Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927 , in order to receive state funding for the road . Plans for a cross @-@ country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927 , as there were no east – west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside . Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved , and included in the state highway system . In 1928 , state assembly member Myron Witter wrote a letter to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east , and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from El Centro ; however , the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation . Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter , proposing that the El Centro – Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system , and the Kane Springs – Julian road be given second priority for inclusion . 
 In June 1930 , an agreement was made between the county and the state to share in the construction and maintenance on the road to Kane Springs from Julian ; prison crews were to make up some of the workforce . Vista Way opened on November 26 , 1930 . By 1932 , the road from Escondido to Ramona was a gravel road , and the portion from Julian to U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) , which is currently designated as SR 86 , was still a dirt road . That year , the cost was predicted to be $ 176 @,@ 000 ( about $ 20 @.@ 6 million in 2015 dollars ) .

 SR 78 was originally formed along with the originally signed state highways in California ( Sign Routes ) in 1934 ; however , it only extended to what was then US 99 near Kane Springs . In the North County , SR 78 was legislatively designated as Route 196 from then @-@ US 101 ( present @-@ day I @-@ 5 ) to Vista , and as Route 77 from Vista to US 395 in Escondido . SR 78 was legally known as Route 197 from Escondido to Ramona , and Route 198 from Ramona to US 99 , which is now SR 86 . From the eastern junction of SR 86 to the Riverside county line , the route was designated as Route 146 in 1959 . 
 By 1947 , US 395 ran concurrently along the portion of SR 78 from Vista to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s . At this time , all of SR 78 that existed had been paved . Before the present @-@ day freeway was built , SR 78 was routed on the Vista Way Freeway ( which was an expressway ) from Oceanside east to downtown Vista . After this , it followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east ( now signed as CR S14 ) , continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido . Following the intersection with US 395 , SR 78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway . In 1949 , the rerouting of SR 78 from US 395 to US 99 was listed as a priority by local officials . The road was known for its curves , even though it went over relatively flat terrain ; this reduced its efficiency . 
 The 3 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) portion of the SR 78 freeway in Oceanside opened to traffic on February 11 , 1954 . This highway was extended to Vista in May 1955 , at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 159 @,@ 000 ( about $ 25 @.@ 1 million in 2015 dollars ) . The part of the freeway from Vista to Escondido was one of the top priorities for highway construction in the county as early as 1960 . The center portion of the Vista Way Freeway opened in April 1962 , but the western part of the route was not entirely access controlled , as an expressway . The section of the SR 78 freeway from Rancho Santa Fe Road in San Marcos to Nordahl Road was completed in April 1962 . The part of the freeway connecting Rancho Santa Fe Road to the Vista portion opened in February 1963 , at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 9 million ( about $ 64 @.@ 5 million in 2015 dollars ) . The opening of the freeway was credited with helping to bring 315 jobs to San Marcos in 1963 . The rest of the freeway between Nordahl Road and US 395 opened on December 21 , 1964 , providing a four @-@ lane highway from Escondido to Oceanside ; the segment cost $ 1 @,@ 865 @,@ 000 ( about $ 30 @.@ 8 million in 2015 dollars ) . SR 78 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering . 
 The San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego Highway Development Association urged for the conversion of SR 78 west of Vista , a length of 5 @.@ 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 0 km ) , from an expressway to a freeway in April 1967 . The College Boulevard diamond interchange on this western segment was scheduled to open to traffic on October 24 , 1967 , and connected the recently relocated <unk> College to the freeway . The interchange , previously an at @-@ grade intersection , improved traffic flow to the college by removing the left turn across the highway needed to access it . The construction of the interchange cost $ 800 @,@ 941 ( about $ 10 @.@ 3 million in 2015 dollars ) . May 1968 saw the state designating the Jefferson Street and Emerald Drive interchanges as a priority . In August 1968 , the state allocated $ 750 @,@ 000 ( about $ 8 @.@ 91 million in 2015 dollars ) for building the Jefferson Street interchange . Further funding difficulties were encountered due to US 395 being given priority , but both interchanges had funding by August 1970 . 
 The construction of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971 . While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange , the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall . The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September , and the rest of the project was to be completed by the end of the year , leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal . Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972 ; the section from I @-@ 5 east to Melrose Drive ( along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway ) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973 . 
 = = = Glamis Road = = = 
 Plans to construct a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953 ; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks . The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north – south road traversing Imperial County , and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use , as the road was closed during the day for five days a week . However , in August , the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction , even though it would replace the Niland – Blythe road . The chamber reversed its stance in December , as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County . 
 To construct the road , the House Armed Services Committee voted to allocate $ 660 @,@ 000 ( about $ 13 @.@ 3 million in 2015 dollars ) for the Navy to give to Imperial County to construct it in February 1956 . The House Appropriations Committee bundled it with 616 other projects , however , which President Dwight Eisenhower vetoed in mid @-@ July . The allocation was eventually approved by both Congress and Eisenhower a few weeks later . The San Diego Union and the Evening Tribune ( later merged to form the Union @-@ Tribune ) were recognized by the San Diego county supervisors for their role in winning congressional support for the funding . 
 There was a brief delay in approving the money in February 1957 when there was a proposal to move the gunnery range . However , at the end of the month , the United States Navy obtained ownership from Imperial County of the old Niland – Blythe road running through the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range for the specified amount . The county then used this money to fund the construction of the Glamis Road , which Ben Hulse predicted would become a state highway . This portion of the road was specifically designed to address the challenges of building it through sand dunes . The engineers routed the highway according to the terrain and made cuts in the sand up to 80 feet ( 24 m ) deep . The routing roughly followed an old Native American trail that went from the Imperial Valley to the Palo Verde Valley . According to an Imperial County official , the road was predicted to be more busy than US 80 and to bring traffic to San Diego directly from Needles and US 66 . 
 The Glamis road opened in August 1958 , and the road from Glamis to Palo Verde was under construction at that time ; the part of the road that was already open was dedicated in October . In 1959 , the rest of the current routing of SR 78 between Brawley and Palo Verde was added to the state highway system as SR 195 and Legislative Route 146 . The state legislature added the portion of SR 78 from SR 115 to the Riverside County line in the 1964 state highway renumbering , also naming the road the Ben Hulse Highway . In March 1964 , the Ben Hulse Highway leading to Palo Verde was dedicated , and state senator Hulse 's efforts to have the road built were recognized . Following this , in 1965 , the newly constructed section was signed as CR <unk> . The section from Palo Verde to Blythe shows up as part of SR 78 on maps as early as 1965 , and the section from southwest of Midway Well to Palo Verde is shown as part of SR 78 as early as 1966 .

 In 1969 , plans to extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway interchange through Escondido were delayed by Caltrans director Jacob Dekema due to a lack of funding until 1980 . However , in 1970 , the community raised concerns about the number of buildings that would need to be destroyed , as the freeway would go through a dense urban area . Other routes , including routing SR 78 along I @-@ 15 south , were proposed . The majority of the Escondido City Council supported sending representatives to the upcoming California Coastal Commission meeting in January 1971 to expedite the process of construction . 
 A month later , an environmental study was conducted that focused on the possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway . In April 1972 , the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR 78 freeway through the city of Escondido . The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead , and also requested that the routing of SR 78 be moved to Broadway , Washington Avenue , and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow . Five years later , signs were installed on eastbound SR 78 , directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I @-@ 15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound , to bypass the Escondido traffic . 
 City officials expressed a desire to have SR 78 included in the Interstate Highway System in 1985 , but this was determined unlikely to succeed by state senator William Craven . In September , the state government agreed to pay $ 7 @.@ 5 million ( about $ 23 million in 2015 dollars ) for the widening between Oceanside and Escondido , but the county and the five cities the route ran through would have to pay for the rest of the cost . The San Diego County Board of Supervisors endorsed the project that month , in order to have the best chance at getting federal funding . A spike in accidents during that year led to Representative Ron Packard proposing a way to split the costs between the governments ; there were 387 accidents from January to August 1985 , a sharp increase from 234 in 1984 . In recognition for his work obtaining funding , SR 78 between Oceanside and Escondido was named the Ronald Packard Parkway in 2000 . 
 The House Public Works and Transportation Subcommittee allocated $ 12 million ( about $ 21 @.@ 9 million in 2015 dollars ) in a bill during June 1986 . The Senate raised an issue over the 65 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 105 km / h ) speed limit in October , which made the outcome dubious . The House and Senate eventually settled on a version of the bill in March 1987 , only to have President Ronald Reagan veto the bill due to " pork barrel " spending . Congress passed the bill in April 1987 , overriding Reagan 's veto , in the same legislation that allowed for rural Interstates to have a speed limit of up to 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . The bill authorized $ 15 million ( about $ 41 @.@ 7 million in 2015 dollars ) in federal funding , and the cities of Oceanside , Carlsbad , Vista , San Marcos , and Escondido agreed to pay $ 6 million ( about $ 16 @.@ 7 million in 2015 dollars ) ; the total cost was $ 30 million ( about $ 83 @.@ 4 million in 2015 dollars ) . Caltrans predicted that without the widening project , traffic speeds on SR 78 would be as low as 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) by the year 2000 because of congestion . A public relations campaign had begun to garner public support for the project , including bumper stickers saying " I hate 78 " . 
 The widening project began construction on April 14 , 1989 , with the first project adding two lanes between San Marcos Boulevard and I @-@ 15 . Additional funding was secured with a local sales tax increase in 1987 , providing $ 80 million ( about $ 195 million in 2015 dollars ) , and an additional $ 7 @.@ 8 million ( about $ 19 million in 2015 dollars ) from the California Transportation Commission . By March 1991 , another part of the project from College Boulevard to Melrose Drive began the bidding process . The next year , the project began to wind down , with bidding on the final part of the work between Nordahl Road and I @-@ 15 . The widening was complete by the beginning of 1994 . 
 = = = Upgrades and improvements = = = 
 Several projects took place following the completion of the widening project . A realignment project took place in 1994 to remove one of the curves in the San Pasqual Valley , at a cost of $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( about $ 5 @.@ 03 million in 2015 dollars ) . The San Marcos Boulevard interchange was renovated beginning in late 1996 , but encountered difficulties in the land acquisition process . Work resumed in 1999 , and was expected to be finished by 2000 , at a cost of $ 10 million ; the benefits of decreased congestion came into effect once the new westbound offramp was opened . The Twin Oaks Valley Road interchange was another subject of contention , as the state Assembly refused to fund the project with $ 5 @.@ 1 million ( about $ 9 @.@ 02 million in 2015 dollars ) in April 1997 . However , in June 1998 , the California Transportation Commission approved the funding after the San Diego Association of Governments officially requested it . Construction began in August 1999 , and was scheduled to end in 2001 . 
 A new interchange with Vista Village Drive was opened in 1998 , and the College Boulevard interchange in Oceanside was revised along westbound SR 78 , at a cost of $ 5 @.@ 5 million ( about $ 9 @.@ 32 million in 2015 dollars ) . In addition to this , a new interchange was constructed at Las <unk> Road in San Marcos , which opened in 2006 . According to the U @-@ T San Diego ( the renamed San Diego Union @-@ Tribune ) , SR 78 at Barham Drive was the worst " traffic bottleneck " in the county between 2010 and 2012 . Thus , the interchange at Nordahl Road was also improved , and extra lanes were to be added between Nordahl Road and I @-@ 15 ; construction commenced in early 2012 , and the new bridge opened in November . The project cost $ 41 million . 
 In the late 2000s , planning began for a bypass around the downtown portion of the city of Brawley . An expressway would carry the routing of SR 78 north and east of the city , with an interchange at SR 111 , before intersecting with the current alignment of SR 78 . A Swedish company began construction on this bypass in April 2008 ; the first phase consisted of the portion of the bypass that is solely SR 111 . The second phase of the bypass , from the western junction with SR 111 to the eastern junction with SR 78 , lasted from February 2008 to June 2011 . On the third phase of the project , from the junction with SR 86 west of Brawley to the western end of the completed bypass , construction began in late 2010 . This project was identified in August 2010 as a project that could be affected by California state budget cuts . The Brawley Bypass , as it was known , opened on October 30 , 2012 .

 The western portion of SR 78 in North County is currently slated for several improvements . There were plans to construct an additional interchange at Rancho Del Oro Road in Oceanside ; however , the Oceanside City Council decided to cancel these plans in 2005 , despite studies suggesting that this move would be detrimental to the traffic in the region . The City Council reinstated those plans in September 2012 . 
 There are also plans to improve the interchange with I @-@ 5 , which currently involves a traffic signal connecting Vista Way and SR 78 with the ramps to I @-@ 5 southbound . Plans call for adding more lanes to I @-@ 5 and SR 78 as well as for the construction of a new ramp from SR 78 westbound to I @-@ 5 southbound and from I @-@ 5 southbound to SR 78 eastbound . The nearby lagoon has served as an obstacle in constructing additional ramps . In 2002 , the I @-@ 5 northbound to SR 78 eastbound ramp was widened to two lanes to ease congestion . At 2015 meeting , the Oceanside community expressed concerns about a potential " flyover " ramp design for the new interchange . The project is scheduled for completion in the late 2020s . 
 A 2011 Caltrans report proposed adding two high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes to the freeway portion of SR 78 between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 15 to accommodate increased traffic . In early 2016 , the mayor of San Marcos stated that there were plans to add another lane in each direction to SR 78 through parts of the city .

 = Strobilurus tenacellus = 
 Strobilurus tenacellus , commonly known as the pinecone cap , is a species of agaric fungus in the family Physalacriaceae . It is found in Asia and Europe , where it grows on the fallen cones of pine and spruce trees . The fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) are small , with convex to flat , reddish to brownish caps up to 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter , set atop thin cylindrical stems up to 4 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long with a rooting base . A characteristic microscopic feature of the mushroom is the sharp , thin @-@ walled cystidia found on the stipe , gills , and cap . The mushrooms , sometimes described as edible , are too small to be of culinary interest . The fungus releases compounds called strobilurins that suppress the growth and development of other fungi .

 The species was first described as Agaricus tenacellus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his 1796 Observationes <unk> . In its taxonomic history , it has been moved to the genera Collybia by Paul Kummer in 1803 , Marasmius by Jules Favre in 1939 , and <unk> by Georges Métrod in 1952 . Rolf Singer transferred it to the newly circumscribed genus Strobilurus in 1962 , giving it the name by which it is currently known . 
 The specific epithet tenacellus is a diminutive form of the Latin word <unk> , meaning " tough " . Its British Mycological Society @-@ recommended common name is the " pinecone cap " . English botanist James Edward Smith called it the " dark fir @-@ cone Agaric " in his 1836 work The English Flora . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is initially convex before flattening out , sometimes retaining a small central papilla , and sometimes developing a central depression ; the cap diameter reaches 5 – 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) . The smooth cap is hygrophanous ( i.e. , it changes colour as it loses or absorbs moisture ) , and has shallow radial grooves extending about halfway up the cap . Its colour is reddish to brownish , and is often paler in the center than the margin ; when dry , the colour fades to greyish . The greyish @-@ white gills have a free to deeply emarginate ( notched ) attachment to the cap . They are somewhat crowded together , numbering 20 – 25 gills with 1 to 7 tiers of interspersed lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stipe ) . The cylindrical stipe measures 4 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 2 mm thick , and has at its base a root @-@ like pseudorrhiza that extends into the substrate . The upper stipe is yellowish brown , while lower it is dark orange @-@ brown to reddish @-@ brown . The flesh has no odour and usually has a bitter taste . While the fruit bodies are sometimes described as are edible , they are too small to be of culinary interest . 
 The spore print is white . Spores are roughly elliptical to tear @-@ shaped , with dimensions of 5 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 5 by 2 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 0 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , and measure 20 – 40 by 7 – 11 μm . Cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are thin walled , plentiful , spindle @-@ shaped to somewhat flask @-@ shaped with a sharp tip , and measure 30 – 70 by 3 – 10 μm . The pleurocystidia ( on the gill face ) are similar in shape and size to the cheilocystidia , although usually not quite as numerous . The cap cuticle is made of a hymeniderm of club @-@ shaped to somewhat spherical cells measuring 8 – 25 by 7 – 20 μm , mixed with flask @-@ shaped pileocystidia ( cystidia on the cap ) that are 20 – 45 by 5 – 11 μm . Hyphae lack clamp connections .

 Strobilurus esculentus and S. <unk> are similar in appearance to S. tenacellus . S. esculentus mushrooms have thin , sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen spruce cones . S. <unk> has a yellow @-@ brown to reddish @-@ yellow cap that is not hygrophanous . Baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and spruce cones , but it fruits in autumn .

 Strobilurus tenacellus is a saprobic wood @-@ rotting fungus . It fruits singly or in small groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) , European black pine ( Pinus nigra ) and sometimes spruce ( Picea ) in coniferous and mixed forests . It is found in Europe and Asia , where it has been recorded in Japan and Jordan . In Europe , the fungus usually fruits from March to June . Its occurrence is occasional .

 Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility , methanol @-@ based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were shown in a 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus . The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurin A , which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977 ; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood @-@ rotting fungi , like Porcelain Mushroom for example . <unk> A is thought to be derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L @-@ phenylalanine . In nature , the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source . It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria , stopping respiration by binding to the <unk> oxidation center of the <unk> complex . This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle , the spore germination stage . The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its <unk> has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding . Because of their sensitivity to light , and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf , chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use . The strobilurin @-@ derived compound <unk> , ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996 , was designed to overcome these limitations . It is the world 's biggest @-@ selling fungicide . Other commercial fungicides developed from the strobilurins include Allegro , and Brio ( <unk> @-@ methyl ) <unk> . 
 = Gilbert de Clare , 8th Earl of Gloucester = 
 Gilbert de Clare , 8th Earl of Gloucester , 7th Earl of Hertford , 10th Lord of Clare , 5th Lord of Glamorgan ( c . 10 May 1291 – 24 June 1314 ) was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Scottish Wars . In contrast to most English earls at the time , his main focus lay in the pursuit of war rather than in domestic political strife . He was the son of Gilbert de Clare , 7th Earl of Gloucester , and Joan of Acre , daughter of Edward I. The older Gilbert died when his son was only four years old , and the younger Gilbert was invested with his earldoms at the young age of sixteen . Almost immediately , he became involved in the defence of the northern border , but later he was drawn into the struggles between Edward II and some of his barons . He was one of the Lords Ordainers who ordered the expulsion of the king 's favourite Piers Gaveston in 1311 . When Gaveston was killed on his return in 1312 , Gloucester helped negotiate a settlement between the perpetrators and the king . 
 Now one of Edward 's strongest supporters , he accompanied the king on a campaign to Scotland in 1314 , when several other nobles refused . He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June , under somewhat unclear circumstances . Gloucester was the most prominent of the casualties of the battle , which ended in a humiliating defeat for England . As he had no issue , his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family . His estates were divided between his three sisters , one of whom was married to the king 's new favourite , Hugh Despenser the Younger . Despenser 's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of Edward II 's later reign , including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches , the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge , and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326 . 
 = = Family background and early life = = 
 Gilbert de Clare was the son of Gilbert de Clare , 7th Earl of Gloucester – known as Gilbert ' the Red ' – who in 1290 married Joan of Acre , daughter of Edward I. As a condition for the marriage , the earl had to surrender all his lands to the king , only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either . This grant was made on the condition that the lands would pass to the couple 's joint heirs , but if they were childless to Joan 's heirs from any later marriages . The younger Gilbert was born the next year , around 10 May 1291 , securing the inheritance for the de Clare family , but his father died only four years later , on 7 December 1295 , while the boy was still a minor . Because of the joint enfeoffment , Joan kept the custody of the family lands , and did homage to the king on 20 January the next year . 
 In 1297 , Joan secretly married Ralph de Monthermer , a knight in the late earl 's household . This enraged Edward I , who had other marriage plans for Joan . The king imprisoned Monthermer , but later relented , and sanctioned the marriage . Because of the previous settlement , Joan was still titled countess , and her new husband became Earl of Gloucester and Hertford . This , however , only lasted for the life of Joan , who died in 1307 . Only a few months later , Gilbert was granted his inheritance , and by March 1308 made Earl of Gloucester and Hertford , at the young age of sixteen . This grant was made by Edward II , who succeeded his father Edward I in July 1307 . It was previously believed that Edward II and Gilbert were brought up together , but this is based on a confusion with another person of the same name . This other Gilbert de Clare , who was closer to the king in age , was in fact the earl 's cousin , the son of Thomas de Clare , Lord of Thomond . 
 = = Early service under Edward II = = 
 Gilbert 's first years as earl were predominantly concerned with the Scottish Wars . He had no personal interest in the region , but the Welsh Marches , where his landed interest lay , were largely pacified at the time , and Scotland presented a good opportunity to pursue military glory and reward . He was almost immediately trusted with important military commands on the northern border , and served as warden of Scotland from 1308 to 1309 , and as captain of Scotland and the northern marches in 1309 . He led an expedition to relieve the castle of Rutherglen in December 1308 . The war effort , however , was not pursued with the same intensity by Edward II as it had been by his father . The new king 's neglect of the Scottish Wars allowed Robert the Bruce to regain the initiative in the war . 
 This situation led to frustration among the English nobility . In addition to the Scottish issue , there was also discontent with the king 's treatment of his favourite , Piers Gaveston . Gaveston 's promotion from relative obscurity to Earl of Cornwall , combined with his arrogant behaviour , caused resentment among the established nobility . Gloucester was initially not hostile to Gaveston , who had married Gloucester 's sister Margaret in October 1307 . He did , however , share in the other earls ' frustration with Edward 's lack of initiative towards Scotland . In 1308 , therefore , Gloucester was among the earls who demanded Gaveston 's exile , a demand the king was forced to meet . After this , he seems to have been reconciled with the king , and in 1309 he acted as a mediator when the earls agreed to Gaveston 's return . Relations between the king and the nobility deteriorated even further , however , after Gaveston 's return . In 1310 , a group of so @-@ called Lords Ordainers were appointed to draft the Ordinances of 1311 , a set of restrictions on the rule of Edward II , including a renewed exile for Gaveston . Gloucester , who was still a supporter of the king , was not initially among the Ordainers , but was appointed on 4 March 1311 , upon the death of the Earl of Lincoln . 
 = = Escalation of the national conflict = = 
 In spite of his participation in the baronial reform movement , Gloucester still maintained the trust of the king . He , Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310 – 11 . In March 1311 , while the Ordinances were still in the workings , Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland . There are signs that he might have fallen out with Thomas , Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers . When Gaveston once more returned from exile , however , Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition . The earls divided the country into different parts for defence , and Gloucester was given charge of the south . In June 1312 , Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick , who was working in cooperation with Lancaster . Aymer de Valence , Earl of Pembroke , who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king , appealed to Gloucester , as Gaveston 's kinsman , for assistance . Gloucester , however , refused to help , and Gaveston was killed . This act brought the country to the brink of civil war , and Gloucester was one of the few men who was still trusted enough by both sides to be able to take on a role as mediator . In the following months , he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls , an effort that was at least temporarily successful . 
 Gloucester remained in the inner circle around the king over the next months . In the summer of 1313 , he was again guardian of the realm while the king was in France , and in February 1314 , he was sent to France on a diplomatic mission regarding Gascony . The greatest problem of the reign , however , remained the unresolved conflict with Scotland , and the resurgence of Robert the Bruce . In the summer of 1314 , Edward finally embarked on a major Scottish campaign . The objective was to protect the English garrison at Stirling Castle from an attack by Bruce . The campaign was impeded by the absence of some of the greater magnates , such as Lancaster and Warwick . There were still a number of great lords in the king 's company , including Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford , Pembroke and Gloucester . These men were valuable to the king for their ability to raise large numbers of troops from their dominions in the Welsh Marches . On 23 June 1314 , the royal army had passed Falkirk and was within a few miles of Stirling . There were , however , signs of strife between the earls of Gloucester and Hereford . Gloucester had been given the command of the English vanguard , a position he had earned through his loyalty to the king . Yet Hereford , who had been placed under Gloucester 's command , believed the command belonged to him , in his capacity of hereditary Constable of England . 
 = = Death at Bannockburn = = 
 Gloucester was involved in a brief skirmish with the Scots on 23 June , the day before the main battle . While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage the Scots immediately , Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the New Park , where the Scots were encamped . The English immediately ran into difficulties , and Hereford 's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce . It was perhaps during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was thrown off his horse , but managed to escape unharmed . The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action . While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains , recommending that Edward avoid battle that day , the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly , and advised attack . According to the Vita Edwardi , when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason , the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the field of battle . 
 The most detailed account of the Earl of Gloucester 's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi . This account is written as a moral tale , expounding on the earl 's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions . For this reason , its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution . According to some accounts , Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle in the pursuit of glory , and fell victim to his own foolishness . The Vita , on the other hand , claimed that , as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks , he was knocked off his horse , and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue . It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation . According to one account , Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms , exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers , who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom . 
 After Gloucester was killed , the English army soon fell into disarray , and the battle resulted in a resounding victory for the Scots , and a humiliating withdrawal for the English . It was widely agreed that Gloucester , with his proud family history and valuable estates , was the most prominent of the many casualties that day . Robert the Bruce mourned his death and stood vigil over Gloucester 's body at a local church . Later he allowed its transfer to England , where the earl was buried at Tewkesbury Abbey , on his father 's right @-@ hand side . 
 = = Dispersal of estates and aftermath = = 
 Gloucester 's political importance did not end with his death ; his disappearance from the political scene had immediate consequences . In his Welsh lordship of Glamorgan , the uncertain situation caused by his death caused a short @-@ lived rebellion in 1316 . In Ireland , where he also held large possessions , the power vacuum he left behind facilitated the 1315 invasion by Robert the Bruce 's brother Edward . The greatest consequences , however , resulted from the division of the de Clare estates . In 1308 , Gilbert de Clare had married Maud ( or Matilda ) de Burgh , the daughter of Richard de Burgh , Earl of Ulster . The couple left no surviving issue , so his death marked the end of the great de Clare family . The family lands were worth as much as £ 6 @,@ 000 , second only to those of the Earl of Lancaster among the nobility of the realm . 
 The lands went into royal possession while the matter of inheritance was being settled . By the entail of 1290 , the lands could only be inherited by direct descendants of the seventh earl and Joan of Acre . Maud managed to postpone the proceedings by claiming to be pregnant , but by 1316 it was clear that this could not be the case . The late earl 's sisters , Eleanor , Margaret ( now widowed after the death of Gaveston ) and Elizabeth were by 1317 all married to favourites of Edward II : Hugh Despenser the Younger , Hugh de Audley and Roger d 'Amory respectively . The three were granted equal parts of the English possessions , but Despenser received the entire lordship of Glamorgan in Wales , politically the most important of the de Clare lands . 
 Not content with his part , Despenser used his relationship with the king to impinge on the lands of other Marcher lords . This caused resentment among such men as Hereford and Roger Mortimer , who rose up in rebellion in 1321 . The rebellion was crushed , but resistance continued under the Marcher lords ' ally Thomas of Lancaster , who was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 , and executed . Although this victory temporarily secured Edward 's position on the throne , he was eventually deposed in 1326 by Roger Mortimer , with the help of the king 's wife Queen Isabella . The title of Earl of Gloucester was recreated by Edward II 's son Edward III in 1337 , for Hugh de Audley .

 = Romeo and Juliet = 
 Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star @-@ crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families . It was among Shakespeare 's most popular plays during his lifetime and , along with Hamlet , is one of his most frequently performed plays . Today , the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers . 
 Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity . The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 , and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567 . Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both , but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters , particularly Mercutio and Paris . Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 , the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 . The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality , however , and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare 's original . 
 Shakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub @-@ plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill . The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters , sometimes changing the form as the character develops . Romeo , for example , grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play . 
 Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage , film , musical and opera venues . During the English Restoration , it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant . David Garrick 's 18th @-@ century version also modified several scenes , removing material then considered indecent , and Georg Benda 's Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action , and added a happy ending . Performances in the 19th century , including Charlotte Cushman 's , restored the original text , and focused on greater realism . John Gielgud 's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare 's text , and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama . In the 20th and into the 21st century , the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor 's 1935 film Romeo and Juliet , Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 version Romeo and Juliet , and Baz Luhrmann 's 1996 MTV @-@ inspired Romeo + Juliet .

 The play , set in Verona , Italy , begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet servants who , like their masters , are sworn enemies . Prince <unk> of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death . Later , Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet , but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball . Lady Capulet and Juliet 's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris 's courtship . 
 Meanwhile , Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo , Montague 's son , about Romeo 's recent depression . Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline , one of Capulet 's nieces . Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio , Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline . However , Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet . Juliet 's cousin , Tybalt , is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball , but is only stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet 's father , who doesn 't wish to shed blood in his house . After the ball , in what is now called the " balcony scene " , Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family 's hatred of the Montagues . Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married . With the help of Friar Laurence , who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children 's union , they are secretly married the next day . 
 Tybalt , meanwhile , still incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball , challenges him to a duel . Romeo , now considering Tybalt his kinsman , refuses to fight . Mercutio is offended by Tybalt 's insolence , as well as Romeo 's " vile submission " , and accepts the duel on Romeo 's behalf . Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo attempts to break up the fight . Grief @-@ stricken and wracked with guilt , Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt . 
 Montague argues that Romeo has justly executed Tybalt for the murder of Mercutio . The Prince , now having lost a kinsman in the warring families ' feud , exiles Romeo from Verona , under penalty of death if he ever returns . Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet 's chamber , where they consummate their marriage . Capulet , misinterpreting Juliet 's grief , agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris 's " joyful bride " . When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed , her mother rejects her . 
 Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help , and he offers her a potion that will put her into a deathlike coma for " two and forty hours " . The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan , so that he can rejoin her when she awakens . On the night before the wedding , she takes the drug and , when discovered apparently dead , she is laid in the family crypt . 
 The messenger , however , does not reach Romeo and , instead , Romeo learns of Juliet 's apparent death from his servant Balthasar . Heartbroken , Romeo buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulet crypt . He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately . Believing Romeo to be a vandal , Paris confronts him and , in the ensuing battle , Romeo kills Paris . Still believing Juliet to be dead , he drinks the poison . Juliet then awakens and , finding Romeo dead , stabs herself with his dagger . The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead . Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two " star @-@ cross 'd lovers " . The families are reconciled by their children 's deaths and agree to end their violent feud . The play ends with the Prince 's elegy for the lovers : " For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo . "

 Luigi da Porto ( 1485 – 1529 ) adapted the story as Giulietta e Romeo and included it in his Historia <unk> <unk> di due Nobili <unk> , written in 1524 and published posthumously in 1531 in Venice . Da Porto drew on Pyramus and Thisbe , Boccacio 's Decameron , and <unk> 's Mariotto e <unk> , but it is likely that his story is also autobiographical : present as a soldier at a ball on 26 February 1511 at a residence of the Savorgnan clan in Udine , following a peace ceremony with the opposite <unk> , Da Porta fell in love with Lucina , the daughter of the house , but relationships of their mentors prevented advances . The next morning , the <unk> led an attack on the city , and many members of the <unk> were murdered . When years later , half @-@ paralyzed from a battle @-@ wound , he wrote Giulietta e Romeo in <unk> Vicentino ( from where he could see the " castles " of Verona ) , he dedicated the novella to <unk> e <unk> madonna Lucina Savorgnan . Da Porto presented his tale as historically true and claimed it took place a century earlier than <unk> had it , in the days Verona was ruled by Bartolomeo II della Scala ( anglicized as Prince <unk> ) . 
 Da Porto gave Romeo and Juliet most of its modern form , including the names of the lovers , the rival families of <unk> and <unk> , and the location in Verona . He named the friar Laurence ( <unk> Lorenzo ) and introduced the characters Mercutio ( <unk> <unk> ) , Tybalt ( <unk> <unk> ) , Count Paris ( <unk> ( <unk> ) di <unk> ) , the faithful servant , and Giulietta 's nurse . Da Porto originated the remaining basic elements of the story : the feuding families , Romeo <unk> by his <unk> meeting Giulietta at a dance at her house , the love scenes ( including the balcony scene ) , the periods of despair , Romeo killing Giulietta 's cousin ( <unk> ) , and the families ' reconciliation after the lovers ' suicides . In da Porto 's version Romeo takes poison and Giulietta stabs herself with his dagger . 
 In 1554 , Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his <unk> , which included his version of <unk> e Romeo , probably written between 1531 and 1545 . Bandello lengthened and weighed down the plot , while leaving the storyline basically unchanged ( though he did introduce Benvolio ) . Bandello 's story was translated into French by Pierre Boaistuau in 1559 in the first volume of his Histories <unk> . Boaistuau adds much moralising and sentiment , and the characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts . 
 In his 1562 narrative poem The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet , Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully , but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer 's Troilus and Criseyde . There was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on Italian <unk> — Italian tales were very popular among theatre @-@ goers — and Shakespeare may well have been familiar with William Painter 's 1567 collection of Italian tales titled Palace of Pleasure . This collection included a version in prose of the Romeo and Juliet story named " The goodly History of the true and constant love of Romeo and <unk> " . Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity : The Merchant of Venice , Much Ado About Nothing , All 's Well That Ends Well , Measure for Measure , and Romeo and Juliet are all from Italian novelle . Romeo and Juliet is a dramatisation of Brooke 's translation , and Shakespeare follows the poem closely , but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters ( in particular the Nurse and Mercutio ) . 
 Christopher Marlowe 's Hero and Leander and Dido , Queen of Carthage , both similar stories written in Shakespeare 's day , are thought to be less of a direct influence , although they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive . 
 = = Date and text = = 
 It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet . Juliet 's nurse refers to an earthquake she says occurred 11 years ago . This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 , which would date that particular line to 1591 . Other earthquakes — both in England and in Verona — have been proposed in support of the different dates . But the play 's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night 's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594 – 95 , place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595 . One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591 , which he completed in 1595 . 
 Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet was published in two quarto editions prior to the publication of the First Folio of 1623 . These are referred to as Q1 and Q2 . The first printed edition , Q1 , appeared in early 1597 , printed by John Danter . Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions , it is labelled a ' bad quarto ' ; the 20th @-@ century editor T. J. B. Spencer described it as " a detestable text , probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors " , suggesting that it had been pirated for publication . An alternative explanation for Q1 's shortcomings is that the play ( like many others of the time ) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company . In any event , its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 the latest possible date for the play 's composition . 
 The superior Q2 called the play The Most Excellent and <unk> <unk> of Romeo and Juliet . It was printed in 1599 by Thomas Creede and published by Cuthbert <unk> . Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1 . Its title page describes it as " Newly corrected , augmented and amended " . Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare 's pre @-@ performance draft ( called his foul papers ) , since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and " false starts " for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter . It is a much more complete and reliable text , and was reprinted in 1609 ( Q3 ) , 1622 ( Q4 ) and 1637 ( Q5 ) . In effect , all later <unk> and Folios of Romeo and Juliet are based on Q2 , as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions ( whether good or bad ) are likely to arise from editors or compositors , not from Shakespeare . 
 The First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3 , with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical <unk> or Q1 . Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 ( F2 ) , 1664 ( F3 ) , and 1685 ( F4 ) . Modern versions — that take into account several of the Folios and <unk> — first appeared with Nicholas Rowe 's 1709 edition , followed by Alexander Pope 's 1723 version . Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1 . This tradition continued late into the Romantic period . Fully annotated editions first appeared in the Victorian period and continue to be produced today , printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play .
