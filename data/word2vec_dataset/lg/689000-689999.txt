At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport , EVA Air 's flight operations are concentrated in Terminal 2 . Additionally , EVA Air and its domestic subsidiary UNI Air operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport . A focus city for EVA Air outside Taiwan is Bangkok 's Suvarnabhumi Airport , with westerly connections to all its European destinations except for Paris , which is flown non @-@ stop . 
 Through the mid @-@ 2000s , EVA Air 's route network was affected by the political status of Taiwan , which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries . Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China , EVA Air has used Hong Kong and Macau as interline destinations . EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008 . The airline began regularly scheduled , direct cross @-@ strait operations in December 2008 , following the restoration of direct travel links . 
 EVA air currently plans to expand its North America network . Houston route was open in June 2015 , while Chicago route will be open around 2016 . EVA currently plans to increase North American flights from 58 flights to 77 flights a week .

 In October 2005 , EVA Air launched a campaign with Japanese company Sanrio to create the " Hello Kitty Jet , " featuring the popular Japanese character . Using the airline 's A330 @-@ 200 , the exterior adopted a livery of Hello Kitty characters . A year later , the airline launched a second Hello Kitty Jet . The aircraft featured a Hello Kitty motif on exterior and interior fittings and features . Both planes were used to serve Japanese destinations , and from mid – July 2007 , also Taipei @-@ Hong Kong routes . The original Hello Kitty livery was retired in 2009 , but in 2011 EVA Air announced its return in redesigned form to mark the carrier 's 20th anniversary and renew interest in Japanese tourism . For this occasion , EVA Air had ordered brand @-@ new Airbus A330 @-@ 300s to be painted in an all @-@ new Hello Kitty livery .

 = Vintage amateur radio = 
 Vintage amateur radio is a subset of amateur radio activity , considered a form of nostalgia or hobby much like antique car collecting , where enthusiasts collect , restore , preserve , build , and operate amateur radio equipment from bygone years , most notably those using vacuum tube technology . 
 Popular modes of operation include voice communication using amplitude modulation ( AM ) , and Morse code using continuous wave ( CW ) radiotelegraphy . Among enthusiasts , there is considerable interest in owning , restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment , much of it more than 40 years old . Some undertake to construct their own gear , known in ham slang as homebrewing , using vintage parts and designs . A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests , events , and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby . 
 = = Appeal = = 
 Many amateurs prefer the relatively precise digital frequency displays and stability of modern , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , microprocessor based amateur radios . Vintage radio enthusiasts contend that modern amateur equipment lacks the aesthetic appeal and " soul " of amateur electronic gear from the vacuum tube era . Additionally , many find satisfaction in taking commercially @-@ made amateur equipment from the 1930s @-@ 1970s ( affectionately called boat anchors by US amateurs because of their large size and weight ) and carefully restoring it . 
 Enthusiasts feel that the spacious electrical and mechanical designs of boat anchor radios are more easily worked on than the miniaturized layouts of modern Japanese gear . Fixing a modern transceiver often involves nothing more than a VLSI chip replacement . Vintage amateur radio devotees enjoy the more primitive experience that boat anchor radios offer , calling it " real radio " . Enthusiasts claim that boat anchors sound better than modern equipment , saying that the tube audio from vintage gear is " warmer " and more aesthetically pleasing . Some hobbyists see vintage radio operation as a valuable asset to help preserve the history and heritage of radio for future generations , and may assist in the restoration and operation of vintage radio equipment for historical exhibits , museums and museum ships . 
 = = AM activity = = 
 Amplitude modulation ( AM ) was once the main voice mode in amateur radio before being superseded by Single @-@ sideband modulation ( SSB ) . But AM has recently become a nostalgic specialty interest on the shortwave ham bands . Vintage radio operation has drawn a wide range of amateur radio enthusiasts from rock star Joe Walsh , <unk> , to former Federal Communications Commission attorney Riley Hollingsworth , <unk> . A majority of " AM 'ers " stations consist of vintage transmitters and receivers housed in separate cabinets . Some operators have even obtained old AM broadcast transmitters from radio stations that have upgraded their equipment . Others build their equipment from scratch ( called homebrewing ) using both modern and vintage @-@ era components . 
 In the United States , shortwave HF frequencies ( in MHz ) on which amateur radio AM activity can be found include 1 @.@ 885 , 1 @.@ 930 , 1 @.@ 985 , 3 @.@ 870 @-@ 3 @.@ 885 , 7 @.@ 290 @-@ 7 @.@ 295 , 7 @.@ 160 , 14 @.@ 286 , 14 @.@ 330 , 21 @.@ 425 , and 29 @.@ 000 @-@ 29 @.@ 200 , and sometimes feature " special event " stations using unique call signs . In the United Kingdom , AM activity can be found almost every day on frequencies between 3 @.@ 615 and 3 @.@ 625 MHz . The French AM activity can be found almost every day the morning between <unk> and <unk> the frequency 3 @.@ 550 MHz . Conversations ( QSO 's in ham slang ) are typically configured as " <unk> " consisting of several participants . Interested newcomers are usually encouraged to switch their modern transceivers to AM mode , introduce themselves , and join the conversation .

Many devotees use their " classic " amateur gear from vintage @-@ era American manufacturers like <unk> , EF Johnson , National , <unk> , <unk> , Drake , Collins , <unk> , Swan , Signal / One , Lafayette and <unk> , to make radiotelegraphy ( CW ) , SSB , FM and <unk> two @-@ way contacts . Although 1930s through 1970s gear is considered " vintage " , collectors may differ on the cutoff dates . 
 Some even sub @-@ specialize in military radio collecting and undertake to restore and operate surplus communications equipment , much of it dating back to World War II , from the ubiquitous US Signal Corps SCR @-@ 300 and SCR @-@ 536 walkie talkies to exotic gear like the British <unk> , a small espionage transceiver supplied to Resistance forces in France , Belgium and the Netherlands . 
 There is considerable interest in vintage military and commercial radio equipment among EU amateur radio operators , especially gear from British manufacturers such as Marconi , Racal , Eddystone , Pye , and a variety of Russian , German , Canadian , British RAF and British Army equipment , such as the well known Wireless Set No. 19 .

 " <unk> " are a related aspect of vintage radio and harken back to the early days of amateur radio , when the majority of hams hand @-@ crafted their own equipment . Smaller in size than " boat anchors " , " glowbug " is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home @-@ made tube @-@ type radio set , reminiscent of the shortwave radio @-@ building craze of the 1920s and 1930s . " Glow " refers to the glow of the vacuum tubes and " bug " to the gear 's relatively diminutive size . The <unk> regenerative receiver and Hartley transmitter circuits are considered " classic " glowbug designs . Generally , any small , home @-@ built tube @-@ type transmitter or receiver may be referred to as a glowbug . The majority of glowbug transmitters are designed to be used in the CW radiotelegraphy mode . 
 As late as the 1960s , <unk> were part of many beginner ham stations , and the <unk> Radio Amateur Handbook for those years exhibited a number of such simple , tube @-@ based designs . Today , glowbug operators are enjoying a resurgence of interest among <unk> enthusiasts and others with a penchant for constructing their own equipment . Many hams are assembling " glowbug rigs " on improvised chassis such as tin <unk> and wooden boards , and putting them on the air between <unk> – <unk> kHz and <unk> – <unk> kHz . Amateur radio <unk> enthusiasts can often be heard communicating on the shortwave bands via CW using Morse code . Popular frequencies to hear glowbug contacts are around 3560 kHz and also <unk> @.@ 5 kHz , chosen because crystals for this frequency can be salvaged from discarded color TV sets , along with other transmitter components .

 Many vintage radio clubs sponsor special events and contests , such as the " AM QSO Party " sponsored by the Antique Wireless Association , the " Heavy Metal Rally " sponsored by Electric Radio Magazine , and the " Classic Radio Exchange " . Such operating events are not traditional ham radio contests inasmuch as they are a night of friendly QSO ’ s using home @-@ built , restored commercial ham , broadcast or military equipment . 
 The Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society and The AM Radio Network 's " Expedition to Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse " in Chesapeake Bay , MD commemorated the history of lighthouses with a vintage special event station using the call sign <unk> . 
 Britain 's Vintage and Military Amateur Radio Society ( affiliated with the Radio Society of Great Britain ) coordinates regular on @-@ air " nets " where enthusiasts gather as well as massive technical files for the benefit of members . The Surplus Radio Society , a Dutch society of collectors of old ex @-@ military radio equipment and other nostalgic receivers and transmitters holds weekly radio activity nets every Sunday on 3 @.@ 575 MHz CW / 3 @.@ 705 MHz AM and sponsors several flea markets and exchange fairs each year . 
 The Canada @-@ based The Wireless Set No. 19 Group , with members virtually world @-@ wide , caters to those who collect , restore and / or operate vintage military communications equipment , with emphasis on the World War II Wireless Set No. 19 radio .

 = = Safety = = 
 Those accustomed to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages . The practice of discharging power @-@ supply capacitors and keeping one hand in your pocket when working on powered @-@ up gear are essential safety measures . Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis to one side of the incoming AC line , a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards . Many older radios , such as vintage receivers , are not safety @-@ fused . Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in @-@ line or chassis mount <unk> . The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged . Those who collect , restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances . 
 = Galerina marginata = 
 Galerina marginata is a species of poisonous fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae of the order Agaricales . Prior to 2001 , the species G. autumnalis , G. oregonensis , G. unicolor , and G. venenata were thought to be separate due to differences in habitat and the <unk> of their caps , but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are all the same species . 
 The fruit bodies of this fungus have brown to yellow @-@ brown caps that fade in color when drying . The gills are brownish and give a rusty spore print . A well @-@ defined membranous ring is typically seen on the stems of young specimens but often disappears with age . In older fruit bodies , the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner . The species is a classic " little brown mushroom " — a catchall category that includes all small to medium @-@ sized , hard @-@ to @-@ identify brownish mushrooms , and may be easily confused with several edible species . 
 Galerina marginata is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere , including Europe , North America , and Asia , and has also been found in Australia . It is a wood @-@ rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood . An extremely poisonous species , it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap ( Amanita phalloides ) . Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting , diarrhea , hypothermia , and eventual death if not treated rapidly . About ten poisonings have been attributed to the species now grouped as G. marginata over the last century . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 What is now recognized as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species . Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA for various North American and European specimens in Galerina section Naucoriopsis . The results showed no genetic differences between G. marginata and G. autumnalis , G. oregonensis , G. unicolor , and G. venenata , thus reducing all these names to synonymy . The oldest of these names are Agaricus marginatus , described by August Batsch in 1789 , and Agaricus unicolor , described by Martin <unk> in 1792 . Agaricus autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873 , and later moved to Galerina by A. H. Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 worldwide monograph on that genus . In the same publication they also introduced the G. autumnalis varieties robusta and <unk> . Another of the synonymous species , G. oregonensis , was first described in that monograph . Galerina venenata was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953 . Since Agaricus marginatus is the oldest validly published name , it has priority according to the rules of botanical nomenclature . 
 Another species analysed in Gulden 's 2001 study , Galerina <unk> , also could not be distinguished from G. marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses . Because of differences in ecology , fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling , the authors preferred to maintain G. <unk> as a distinct species . A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods , but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct . 
 In the fourth edition ( 1986 ) of Singer 's comprehensive classification of the Agaricales , G. marginata is the type species of Galerina section Naucoriopsis , a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert Kühner in 1935 . It includes small brown @-@ spored mushrooms characterized by cap edges initially curved inwards , fruit bodies resembling Pholiota or <unk> and thin @-@ walled , obtuse or acute @-@ ended pleurocystidia that are not rounded at the top . Within this section , G. autumnalis and G. oregonensis are in stirps <unk> , while G. unicolor , G. marginata , and G. venenata are in stirps <unk> . <unk> species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous cap surface while <unk> species lack a gelatinous cap — the surface is moist , " fatty @-@ shining " , or matte when wet . However , as Gulden explains , this characteristic is highly variable : " <unk> is a notoriously difficult character to assess because it varies with the age of the fruitbody and the weather conditions during its development . Varying degrees of <unk> tend to be described differently and applied inconsistently by different persons applying terms such as lubricous , fatty , fatty @-@ shiny , sticky , viscid , glutinous , or ( somewhat ) slimy . " 
 The specific epithet marginata is derived from the Latin word for " margin " or " edge " , while autumnalis means " of the autumn " . Common names of the species include the " marginate Pholiota " ( resulting from its synonymy with Pholiota marginata ) , " funeral bell " , " deadly skullcap " , and " deadly Galerina " . G. autumnalis was known as the " fall Galerina " or the " autumnal Galerina " , while G. venenata was the " deadly lawn Galerina " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap reaches 1 @.@ 7 to 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 67 to 1 @.@ 57 in ) in diameter . It starts convex , sometimes broadly conical , and has edges ( margins ) that are curved in against the gills . As the cap grows and expands , it becomes broadly convex and then flattened , sometimes developing a central elevation , or umbo , which may project prominently from the cap surface . 
 Based on the collective descriptions of the five taxa now considered to be G. marginata , the texture of the surface shows significant variation . Smith and Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture : from " viscid " ( G. autumnalis ) , to " shining and viscid to lubricous when moist " ( G. oregonensis ) , to " shining , lubricous to <unk> ( particles of dirt adhere to surface ) or merely moist , with a fatty appearance although not distinctly viscid " , to " moist but not viscid " ( G. marginata ) . The cap surface remains smooth and changes colors with humidity ( hygrophanous ) , pale to dark ochraceous tawny over the disc and yellow @-@ ochraceous on the margin ( at least when young ) , but fading to dull tan or darker when dry . When moist , the cap is somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as striations . The flesh is pale brownish ochraceous to nearly white , thin and pliant , with an odor and taste varying from very slightly to strongly like flour ( farinaceous ) . 
 The gills are typically narrow and crowded together , with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent attachment to the stem and convex edges . They are a pallid brown when young , becoming tawny at maturity . Some short gills , called lamellulae , do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem , and are intercalated among the longer gills . The stem ranges from 3 to 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) long , 3 to 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 to 0 @.@ 35 in ) thick at the apex , and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward . Initially solid , it becomes hollow from the bottom up as it matures . The membranous ring is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap , but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens . Its color is initially whitish or light brown , but usually appears a darker rusty @-@ brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it . Above the level of the ring , the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap ; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish @-@ brown to <unk> base . The lower portion of the stem has a thin coating of pallid fibrils which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales . The spore print is rusty @-@ brown . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores measure 8 – 10 by 5 – 6 µm , and are slightly inequilateral in profile view , and egg @-@ shaped in face view . Like all Galerina species , the spores have a plage , which has been described as resembling " a slightly wrinkled plastic shrink @-@ wrap covering over the distal end of the spore " . The spore surface is warty and full of wrinkles , with a smooth depression where the spore was once attached via the <unk> to the basidium ( the spore @-@ bearing cell ) . When in potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) solution , the spores appear tawny or darker rusty @-@ brown , with an apical callus . The basidia are four @-@ spored ( rarely with a very few two @-@ spored ones ) , roughly cylindrical when producing spores , but with a slightly tapered base , and measure 21 – 29 by 5 – 8 @.@ 4 µm . 
 Cystidia are cells of the fertile hymenium that do not produce spores . These sterile cells , which are structurally distinct from the basidia , are further classified according to their position . In G. marginata , the pleurocystidia ( cystidia from the gill sides ) are 46 – 60 by 9 – 12 µm , thin @-@ walled , and hyaline in KOH , fusoid to ventricose in shape with wavy necks and blunt to subacute apices ( 3 – 6 µm diameter near apex ) . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edges ) are similar in shape but often smaller than the pleurocystidia , abundant , with no club @-@ shaped or abruptly tapering ( mucronate ) cells present . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Galerina marginata may be mistaken for a few edible mushroom species . Pholiota mutabilis produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood , but may be distinguished from G. marginata by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring , and from growing in large clusters ( which is not usual of G. marginata ) . However , the possibility of confusion is such that this good edible species is " not recommended to those lacking considerable experience in the identification of higher fungi . " Furthermore , microscopic examination shows smooth spores in Pholiota . G. marginata may be easily confused with other edibles such as Armillaria mellea and <unk> mutabilis . Regarding the latter species , one source notes " Often , G. marginata bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus , and it requires careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one . " K. mutabilis may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring , the larger cap , which may reach a diameter of 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) , and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh . The related K. vernalis is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to G. marginata . Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two , revealing smooth spores with a germ pore . 
 Another potential edible lookalike is the " velvet foot " , Flammulina velutipes . This species has gills that are white to pale yellow , a white spore print , and spores that are elliptical , smooth , and measure 6 @.@ 5 – 9 by 2 @.@ 5 – 4 µm . A rough resemblance has also been noted with the edible Hypholoma <unk> , as well as Conocybe <unk> , another poisonous amatoxin @-@ containing species . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Galerina marginata is a saprobic fungus , obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter . It is known to have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides , and has been used as a model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi . Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other <unk> materials , the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( <unk> ) is currently sequencing its genome . The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers , although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well . Fruit bodies may grow solitarily , but more typically in groups or small clusters , and appear in the summer to autumn . Sometimes , they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil . 
 Galerina marginata is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere , found in North America , Europe , Japan , Iran , continental Asia , and the Caucasus . In North America , it has been collected as far north as the boreal forest of Canada and subarctic and arctic habitats in Labrador , and south to Jalisco , Mexico . It is also found in Australia . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins . Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic <unk> derivatives composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups ; these compounds are responsible for more than 90 % of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans . The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II , which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules . The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells , and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins . Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because , as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison , it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage . Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours . Beyond these symptoms , toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding , a coma , kidney failure , or even death , usually within seven days of consumption . 
 Galerina marginata was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins α @-@ amanitin and γ @-@ amanitin , first as G. venenata , then as G. marginata and G. autumnalis . The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was confirmed by growing the mycelium as a liquid culture ( only trace amounts of β @-@ amanitin were found ) . G. marginata is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin @-@ producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture . Both amanitins were quantified in G. autumnalis ( 1 @.@ 5 mg / g dry weight ) and G. marginata ( 1 @.@ 1 mg / g dry weight ) . Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of γ @-@ amanitin and β @-@ amanitin in German specimens of G. autumnalis and G. marginata and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of G. unicolor . Although some mushroom field guides claim that the species ( as G. autumnalis ) also contains phallotoxins ( however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans ) , scientific evidence does not support this contention . A 2004 study determined that the amatoxin content of G. marginata varied from 78 @.@ 17 to 243 @.@ 61 µg / g of fresh weight . In this study , the amanitin amounts from certain Galerina specimens were higher than those from some Amanita phalloides , a European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins . The authors suggest that " other parameters such as extrinsic factors ( environmental conditions ) and intrinsic factors ( genetic properties ) could contribute to the significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens . " The lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0 @.@ 1 mg / kg human body weight , or even lower . Based on this value , the ingestion of 10 G. marginata fruit bodies containing about 250 µg of amanitins per gram of fresh tissue could poison a child weighing approximately 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) . However , a 20 @-@ year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of Galerina species . This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom 's nondescript appearance as a " little brown mushroom " leading to it being overlooked by collectors , and by the fact that 21 % of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species . 
 The toxicity of certain Galerina species has been known for a century . In 1912 , Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G. autumnalis . In 1954 , a poisoning was caused by G. venenata . Between 1978 and 1995 , ten cases caused by amatoxin @-@ containing <unk> were reported in the literature . Three European cases , two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G. marginata and G. unicolor , respectively . Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G. venenata , with five cases reacting positively to treatment ; four poisonings were caused by G. autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas , in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio . Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe <unk> .

 = American robin = 
 The American robin ( Turdus migratorius ) is a migratory songbird of the thrush family . It is named after the European robin because of its reddish @-@ orange breast , though the two species are not closely related , with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family . The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America , wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast . It is the state bird of Connecticut , Michigan , and Wisconsin . According to some sources , the American robin ranks behind only the red @-@ winged blackbird ( and just ahead of the introduced European starling and the not @-@ always @-@ naturally @-@ occurring house finch ) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America . It has seven subspecies , but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive , with pale gray @-@ brown underparts . 
 The American robin is active mostly during the day and assembles in large flocks at night . Its diet consists of invertebrates ( such as beetle grubs , earthworms , and caterpillars ) , fruits , and berries . It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs , beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range . Its nest consists of long coarse grass , twigs , paper , and feathers , and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials . It is among the first birds to sing at dawn , and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated . 
 The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks , cats , and larger snakes , but when feeding in flocks , it can be vigilant and watch other birds for reactions to predators . Brown @-@ headed cowbirds lay eggs in robin nests ( see brood parasite ) , but robins usually reject the cowbird eggs . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This species was first described in 1766 by Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae as Turdus migratorius . The binomial name derives from two Latin words : <unk> , " thrush " , and migratorius from <unk> " to go " . The term robin for this species has been recorded since at least 1703 . There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus , characterized by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs . A study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the American robin is not part of the Central / South American clade of Turdus thrushes ; instead it shows genetic similarities to the <unk> thrush , T. <unk> , and the olive thrush , T. olivaceus , both African species . This conflicts with a 2007 DNA study of 60 of 65 Turdus species which places the American robin 's closest relative as the rufous @-@ collared robin ( T. <unk> ) of Central America . Though having distinct plumage , the two species are similar in vocalization and behavior . Beyond this , it lies in a small group of four species of otherwise Central American distribution , suggesting it recently spread northwards into North America . 
 Seven subspecies of American robin are recognized . These subspecies intergrade and are only weakly defined . 
 T. m. migratorius , the nominate subspecies , breeds in the US and Canada , other than down the west coast , to the edge of the tundra from Alaska and northern Canada east to New England and then south to Maryland , northwest Virginia , and North Carolina . It winters in southern coastal Alaska , southern Canada , most of the US , Bermuda , the Bahamas and eastern Mexico . 
 T. m. <unk> breeds from coastal northern Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters from southern Newfoundland south through most of the eastern US states to southern Louisiana , southern Mississippi and northern Georgia . It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head , with a dark gray back . The underparts are slightly more red than those of the nominate subspecies . 
 T. m. <unk> breeds from southern Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states . It winters through much of the southern part of the breeding range . It is smaller than the nominate subspecies . The black feathers of the forehead and crown have pale gray tips . The underparts are paler than those of the nominate subspecies . 
 T. m. caurinus breeds in southeast Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon . It winters from southwest British Columbia south to central and southern California and east to northern Idaho . It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark @-@ headed . The white on the tips of the outer two tail feathers is restricted . 
 T. m. propinquus breeds from southeast British Columbia , southern Alberta , southwest Saskatchewan south to southern California and northern Baja California . It winters throughout much of the southern breeding range and south to Baja California . It is the same size as or slightly larger than nominate T. m. migratorius , but paler and tinged more heavily brownish @-@ gray . It has very little white on the tip of the outermost tail feather . Some birds , probably females , lack almost any red below . Males are usually darker and may show pale or whitish sides to the head . 
 T. m. confinis breeds above 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) in the highlands of southern Baja California . This form is particularly distinctive , with pale gray @-@ brown underparts . It is relatively small , and the palest subspecies , with uniform pale gray @-@ brown on the head , face and upperparts . It usually lacks any white spots to the tips of the outer tail feathers , which have white edges . It is sometimes classed as a separate species , the San Lucas robin , but the American Ornithologists ' Union regards it as only a subspecies , albeit in a different group from the other races . 
 T. m. phillipsi is resident in Mexico south to central Oaxaca . It is slightly smaller than propinquus but has a larger bill ; the male 's underparts are less brick @-@ red than the nominate subspecies , and have a <unk> tone . 
 = = Description = = 
 The nominate subspecies of the American robin is 23 to 28 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 to 11 @.@ 0 in ) long with a wingspan ranging from 31 to 41 cm ( 12 to 16 in ) , with similar size ranges across all races . The species averages about 77 g ( 2 @.@ 7 oz ) in weight , with males ranging from 72 to 94 g ( 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 3 oz ) and females ranging from 59 to 91 g ( 2 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 2 oz ) . Among standard measurements , the wing chord is 11 @.@ 5 to 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 7 in ) , the culmen is 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 71 to 0 @.@ 87 in ) and the tarsus is 2 @.@ 9 to 3 @.@ 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 3 in ) . The head varies from jet black to gray , with white eye arcs and white <unk> . The throat is white with black streaks , and the belly and undertail coverts are white . The robin has a brown back and a reddish @-@ orange breast , varying from a rich red maroon to peachy orange . The bill is mainly yellow with a variably dark tip , the dusky area becoming more extensive in winter , and the legs and feet are brown . 
 The sexes are similar , but the female tends to be duller than the male , with a brown tint to the head , brown upperparts and less bright underparts . However , some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone . The juvenile is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast , and whitish wing coverts . First @-@ year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults , but they tend to be duller , and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This bird breeds throughout most of North America , from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico . While robins occasionally overwinter in the northern part of the United States and southern Canada , most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico , as well as along the Pacific Coast . Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March ( exact dates vary with latitude and climate ) . Despite being depicted in the film Mary Poppins " feathering its nest " in London , this species is actually a rare vagrant to western Europe , where the majority of records , more than 20 , have been in Britain . In autumn 2003 , migration was displaced eastwards leading to massive movements through the eastern U.S. , and presumably this is what led to no fewer than three American robins being found in Britain , with two attempting to overwinter in 2003 – 2004 , although one was taken by a sparrowhawk . The most recent sighting in Britain occurred in January 2007 . 
 This species has also occurred as a vagrant to Greenland , Jamaica , Hispaniola , Puerto Rico and Belize . Vagrants to Europe , where identified to subspecies , are nominate T. m. migratorius , but the Greenland birds also included T. m. <unk> , and some of the southern <unk> may have been T. m. <unk> . 
 The American robin 's breeding habitat is woodland and more open farmland and urban areas . It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost part of the Deep South of the United States , and there prefers large shade trees on lawns . Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 The American robin has an extensive range , estimated at 16 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km2 ( 6 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , and a large population of about 320 million individuals . The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List ( i.e. , declining more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) , and is therefore evaluated as least concern . At one point , the bird was killed for its meat , but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act . 
 Birds in central California of the subspecies propinquus are considered to be still increasing their range , and this is probably the case elsewhere in the U.S.A. 
 = = = Disease = = = 
 The American robin is a known reservoir ( carrier ) for West Nile virus . While crows and jays are often the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus , the American robin is suspected to be a key host , and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans . This is because , while crows and jays die quickly from the virus , the American robin survives the virus longer , hence spreading it to more mosquitoes , which then transmit the virus to humans and other species . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The American robin is active mostly during the day , and on its winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation . The flocks break up during the day when the birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups . During the summer , the American robin defends a breeding territory and is less social . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The American robin 's diet generally consists of around 40 percent small invertebrates ( mainly insects ) , such as earthworms , beetle grubs , caterpillars and grasshoppers , and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries . Their ability to switch to berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes . They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries , and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking . Robins forage primarily on the ground for soft @-@ bodied invertebrates , and find worms by sight , pouncing on them and then pulling them up . Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft @-@ bodied animal prey . In some areas , robins , particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus , will feed on beaches , taking insects and small mollusks . 
 The robin uses auditory , visual , olfactory and possibly <unk> cues to <unk> prey , but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection . It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms , and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic . In addition to hunting visually , it also has the ability to hunt by hearing . Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills . It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left , right or forward to detect movement of its prey . In urban areas , robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use . They also are attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens , where worms and grubs are abundant targets . Occasionally , they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal @-@ fat suet is offered . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Juvenile robins and eggs are preyed upon by squirrels , snakes , and some birds , such as blue jays , Steller 's jay , common grackles , American crows , and common ravens . Adults are primarily taken by Accipiter hawks , cats , dogs , and larger snakes ( especially rat snakes ) . They may be taken by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid , from the smallest , the sharp @-@ shinned hawk , to one of the two largest , the golden eagle , most every North American falcon from the smallest , the American kestrel , to the largest , the gyrfalcon , and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls . Overall , 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins . Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight . However , when feeding in flocks , the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators . 
 The American robin is known to be a <unk> of cowbird eggs , so brood parasitism by the brown @-@ headed cowbird is rare . Even when it occurs , the parasite 's chick does not normally survive to fledging . In a study of 105 juvenile robins , 77 @.@ 1 % were infected with one or more species of <unk> , with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered , found in 57 @.@ 1 % of the birds . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to its summer range . It is one of the first North American bird species to lay eggs , and normally has two to three broods per breeding season , which lasts from April to July . 
 The nest is most commonly located 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 14 @.@ 8 ft ) above the ground in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches , and is built by the female alone . The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass , twigs , paper , and feathers . This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials . A new nest is built for each brood , and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an evergreen tree or shrub while later broods are placed in deciduous trees . The American robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation and will frequently construct nests under eaves or awnings on human homes when such locations provide adequate shelter . Robins are not cavity nesters , and so will generally not use a bird house , but will take advantage of artificial nesting platforms that have been provided . 
 A clutch consists of three to five light blue eggs , and is incubated by the female alone . The eggs hatch after 14 days , and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later . The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the first few days after hatching . While the chicks are still young , the mother broods them continuously . When they are older , the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather . 
 The chicks are fed worms , insects , and berries . Waste accumulation does not occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away . Chicks are fed , and then raise tails for elimination of waste , a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off . All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other . Even after leaving the nest , the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them . Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging . 
 The adult male and female both are active in protecting and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own . The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators , such as approaching cats , dogs and humans . The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest . The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly , and it only takes a couple of weeks for them to become proficient at flying . The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators . 
 Bird banders have found that only 25 % of young robins survive the first year . The longest known lifespan in the wild of an American robin is 14 years ; the average lifespan is about 2 years . 
 = = = Vocalization = = = 
 The male American robin , as with many thrushes , has a complex and almost continuous song . Its song is commonly described as a cheerily carol , made up of discrete units , often repeated , and spliced together into a string with brief pauses in between . The song varies regionally , and its style varies by time of day . The song period is from early March in California to late July or early August ; some birds , particularly in the east , sing occasionally into September or later . The American robin is often among the first songbirds singing as dawn rises or hours before , and last as evening sets in . It usually sings from a high perch in a tree . The song of T. m. confinis is weaker than that of the nominate subspecies , and lacks any clear notes . 
 The robin also sings when storms approach and again when storms have passed . In addition to its song , the American robin has a number of calls used for communicating specific information such as when a ground predator approaches , and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened . Even during nesting season , when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior , they may still band together to drive away a predator . 
 = = In culture = = 
 The American robin is the state bird of Connecticut , Michigan , and Wisconsin . It was also depicted on the 1986 Birds of Canada series Canadian $ 2 note , but this note has since been withdrawn . 
 Robin 's egg blue is a color named after the bird 's eggs . 
 The American robin has a place in Native American mythology . The story of how the robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that surround the European robin . The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture @-@ hero created by Raven to please the people with its song . One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga 'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest . 
 The Peace Bridge robins were a family of American robins that attracted minor publicity in the mid @-@ 1930s for their prominent nest on the Canadian side of the Peace Bridge connecting Buffalo , New York to Fort Erie , Ontario . 
 The robin is considered a symbol of spring . A well @-@ known example is a poem by Emily Dickinson , " I Dreaded That First Robin So " . Among other 19th @-@ century poems about the first robin of spring is " The First Robin " by Dr. William H. Drummond , which according to the author 's wife is based on a Quebec superstition that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck . The harbinger of spring sobriquet is borne out by the fact that robins tend to follow the 37 ° F ( 3 ° C ) isotherm north in spring , but also south in fall . 
 American popular songs featuring this bird include " When the Red , Red Robin ( Comes Bob , Bob , Bobbin ' Along ) " , written by Harry M. Woods and a hit for Al Jolson and others , and " Rockin ' Robin " , written by Roger Thomas and a hit for Bobby Day and others . 
 Although the comic @-@ book superhero Robin was inspired by an N. C. Wyeth illustration of Robin Hood , a later version had his mother nicknaming him Robin because he was born on the first day of spring . His red shirt suggests the bird 's red breast . 
 = Ballard Carnegie Library = 
 The Ballard Carnegie Library , also known until 1963 as the Seattle Public Library – Ballard Branch , is a historic library in the Ballard neighborhood in Seattle , Washington . The library was predated by a freeholders ' library in the 1860s , which eventually gave way to a reading room that was organized and funded by a women 's ' group in 1901 . With a grant for $ 15 @,@ 000 , among other funds , a new library for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a Carnegie library . The building , located at 2026 N.W. Market Street in downtown Ballard , opened to the public on June 24 , 1904 . Notable as the first major branch of the Seattle public library system , after Seattle annexed the City of Ballard into itself in 1907 , and for employing one of the first African American librarians in Seattle , the Ballard Carnegie Library was in service until 1963 , when a newer and more modern facility replaced it . After its sale , the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises , including an antique shop , a restaurant and a kilt manufacturer . 
 After being nominated in 1976 for the recognition by Seattle architect Larry E. Johnson , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) in 1979 ( ID # <unk> ) . 
 = = History = = 
 In the late 1860s , when Ballard was a new settlement along the edge of Salmon Bay , a homesteader named Ira Wilcox Utter helped create a freeholders ' library . Later , in 1901 , the Women 's Christian Temperance Union of Ballard began raising money with fairs and socials for a new reading room on Ballard Avenue ; it moved and expanded several times to different locations . Having decided to build a proper library , the Ballard City Council established a library board in 1903 and the city applied to the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for a library grant to help underwrite the costs of construction of a new library . The library was built on a lot of 100 feet ( 30 @.@ 5 m ) square , which was purchased for $ 2 @,@ 100 raised by local businesses and citizens , supported by the earlier fundraising and book collections of the women 's union , and a $ 15 @,@ 000 grant from Carnegie . When construction was completed , the building included features such as a 500 @-@ seat auditorium and a men 's smoking room , which was later converted into a reading room . Part of the construction work was executed by a chain gang . 
 Initially , the library had a cache of books waiting for the completion and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools , as Carnegie 's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books . A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection . In 1907 , the Seattle Public Library took control of the Carnegie library , when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government . Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility ; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people . Early in the library 's existence , it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks , to count the number of book borrowers that passed through . With the arrival of World War I , the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities , such as dispensing information on the war , and also provided Red Cross and English language classes . In 1942 , during World War II , one of the first African American librarians in Seattle , Lucille Smith , was assigned to the Carnegie library . 
 In 1956 , Seattle voters approved a municipal bond to replace what was by then considered the " inadequate and impractical " library . The Ballard Carnegie Library eventually was shut in 1963 , when a new , larger public library was built in the area , and the Carnegie building became an antique store . One of the cited reasons for the closure and sale of the library building were expert claims that the building would never survive an earthquake ( of which Seattle had numerous instances , both before and after 1963 ) . The building has , in fact , survived several quakes since 1963 . 
 = = The building today = = 
 The building is now owned by Karoline Morrison and her husband , Dennis Beals ; The former library was home to Carnegie 's , a French restaurant from 2003 until 2010 . 
 As of April 2010 , the building is home to Ström and Ström Consulting , providing legal and marketing services to mental health professionals . As of March 2011 , the building is also home to Root . Integrative Health , a holistic wellness center offering massage therapy , chiropractic , nutrition , mental health counseling , acupuncture , <unk> medicine , and creative writing services . The area around Market Street in Ballard , where the library building is located , is one of the areas of Seattle that is quickly rising in land value , and has been compared to Belltown , a growing Seattle neighborhood that is affected by gentrification . As the Carnegie Library building is without the City of Seattle 's " City landmark status " despite its NRHP status , the structure is at risk from new development . 
 As of 2012 , the building is occupied by the Kangaroo and Kiwi Pub 
 = Siege of Klis = 
 The Siege of Klis or Battle of Klis ( Croatian : Opsada <unk> or Bitka <unk> <unk> , Turkish : <unk> Kuşatması ) was a siege of Klis Fortress in the Kingdom of Croatia within Habsburg Monarchy . The siege of the fortress , which lasted for more than two decades , and the final battle near Klis in 1537 , were fought as a part of the Ottoman – Habsburg wars between the defending Croatian @-@ Habsburg forces under the leadership of Croatian feudal lord Petar Kružić , and the attacking Ottoman army under the leadership of the Ottoman general Murat @-@ beg Tardić . 
 After decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493 , and especially after the Battle of Mohács in 1526 , the Croats continued defending themselves against the Ottoman attacks . The Ottoman conquest during the early years of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks , which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić , also called ( Prince of Klis ) . As a part of the Habsburg defensive system , Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position . They fought almost alone against the Ottomans , and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the Ottoman attacks . 
 After the final battle , which resulted in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kružić 's death , the Klis defenders , who were lacking in water supplies , finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom on 12 March 1537 . Citizens fled the town , while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj , where they continued fighting the Ottoman army . Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak ( Kilis Sancağı ) of the Bosnia Eyalet , and would remain so for a century . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463 , the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected , the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense . Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493 , shook all of Croatia . However , it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy . A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521 , after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged . 
 On 29 August 1526 , at the Battle of Mohács , the Christian forces led by King Louis II were defeated by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent . Louis was killed in the battle , which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary as he died without an heir . Both the Kingdoms of Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires . Ferdinand I , Archduke of Austria , a member of the House of Habsburg , the brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and a future Holy Roman Emperor himself , married the sister of Louis II and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia . 
 Owing to its location , Klis Fortress was an important defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans . The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split , from Ottoman @-@ held Bosnia . The Croat feudal lord Petar Kružić gathered together a garrison composed of Croat refugees , who used the base at Klis both to hold the Ottomans at bay , and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping . Although nominally accepting the sovereignty of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand , who obtained the Croatian crown in 1527 , Kružić and his freebooting Uskoks were a law unto themselves . 
 = = Siege = = 
 = = = Failed attempts = = = 
 From 1513 , Petar Kružić was one of the commanding officers of Klis Fortress . The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis Fortress on several occasions . The first major attempt was by Skender @-@ beg <unk> in 1515 . The Ottomans captured Klis , a village just below the fortress bearing the same name , but the garrison in the fortress above held . Kružić was promoted to captain of the Klis Fortress by the ban Petar <unk> in 1520 . The second major attempt was in 1520 , and a year later another attempt was made by <unk> @-@ paša , with additional 2 @,@ 000 infantry , 50 horsemen and siege equipment . Another unsuccessful attempt was made in 1522 , by Hasan @-@ paša from Mostar and Mehmed @-@ beg Mihalbegović . Later that year , Mihalbegović made another attempt at a siege with 3 @,@ 000 men , but failed again . During 1523 , Klis Fortress was again under attack by the Sultan 's army . Attempts were also made by Gazi <unk> @-@ beg in 1526 and 1528 , and later in 1531 and 1532 . 
 In 1534 , the Ottomans under Mihalbegović laid a months @-@ long siege with a constant concentrated cannonade to the fortress . Ferdinand urged the Pope to send ships to relieve the Ottoman siege . Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege , Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no assistance in the defense of the fortress . In 1535 , the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery , and again in 1536 , but they failed on both occasions . During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of the fortress . 
 When a large Ottoman force threatened the fortress , Kružić appealed to Ferdinand for help , but the Emperor 's attention was diverted by an Ottoman attack in Slavonia . Kružić led the defense of Klis , and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans , as they repeatedly hurled armies against the fortress . No troops from the Hungarian king arrived , as they were slaughtered by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526 , and the Venetians baulked at sending any help . Only the pope was willing to provide some men and money . 
 = = = Final battle = = = 
 Pope Paul III claimed some rights in Klis , and in September , 1536 , there was talk in the Curia of strengthening the defenses of the fortress . The Pope notified Ferdinand that he was willing to share the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis . Ferdinand did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress , when the Ottomans again laid siege to it . Ferdinand recruited men from Trieste and elsewhere in the Habsburg lands , and the Pope sent soldiers from Ancona . There were about 3 @,@ 000 infantry in the reinforcements , which made a sizeable relief force , that were commanded by Petar Kružić , Niccolo dalla Torre , and a papal commissioner <unk> <unk> d <unk> . On 9 March 1537 they disembarked near Klis , at a place called S. Girolamo , with fourteen pieces of artillery . After Ibrahim 's death , Suleiman sent 8 @,@ 000 men under the command of Murat @-@ beg Tardić ( <unk> <unk> ) , a Croatian who had been born in Šibenik , to go and lay siege to Klis fortress ( Clissa ) , and fight against Kružić . An initial encounter of the Christian relief force with the Ottomans was indecisive , but , on 12 March they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Ottomans . 
 The attempts to relieve the citadel ended in farce . Badly @-@ drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans , and their attempts to re @-@ board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink . Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape . Kružić himself – who had left the fortress to make contact with the reinforcements - was captured and executed ; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis , who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north . After Kružić 's death , and with a lack of water supplies , the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom , on 12 March 1537 . Many of the citizens fled the town , while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj , where they continued fighting the Ottoman army .

 During the Ottoman wars in Europe , Klis Fortress became an administrative centre or sanjak ( Kilis Sancağı ) of the Bosnia Eyalet , and would remain so for a century . As the first Sanjak @-@ Beg of Klis , Murat @-@ beg Tardić built a notable mosque inside the Klis Fortress . That same year , the Ottoman forces took Vrana , while Nadin and Perušić fell in 1538 . 
 Months after the fall of Klis , the Ottoman – Venetian War of 1537 @-@ 1540 started , and in that war , as well as the Ottoman – Venetian War of 1570 @-@ 1573 , the Ottomans took much of the Dalmatian hinterland near Šibenik and Zadar . On 7 April 1596 , Split noblemen Ivan Alberti and Nikola <unk> , along with Uskoci , <unk> , and <unk> irregulars , organized a liberation of Klis . Assisted by dissident elements of the Ottoman garrison , they succeeded . Mustafa @-@ beg responded by bringing more than 10 @,@ 000 soldiers under the fortress . General Ivan Lenković , leading 1 @,@ 000 Uskoci , came in relief of the 1 @,@ 500 Klis defenders . During the battle , Ivan Lenković and his men retreated after he was wounded in battle , and the fortress was lost to the Ottomans , on 31 May . Nevertheless , this temporary relief resounded in Europe and among the local population . 
 The Venetians fought for decades before they finally managed to re @-@ take Klis . During the Cretan War of 1645 @-@ 1669 , the Venetians in Dalmatia enjoyed the support of the local population , particularly the <unk> ( <unk> ) . Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts , retook Novigrad , temporarily captured the Knin Fortress , and managed to compel the garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender .

Beyoncé announced the tour and its name after her performance the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show on February 3 . The tour 's title refers to her marriage with Shawn ' Jay @-@ Z ' Carter . However , the official poster of the tour with the name written on it was leaked on the ticket 's website Live Nation prior to the official announcement . It shows Beyoncé wearing a Victorian golden royal top and a crown , referencing Queen Elizabeth I. Rosie Swash of The Guardian described it as a " visual stamp of authority " . Along with the tour 's name , initial dates in Europe and North America were announced , and later more were added in Latin America , Australia , and New Zealand . 
 Following the announcement of the tour 's title , Beyoncé was criticized by several critics and feminists alike for entitling it after her husband 's name as she has been regarded as a feminist . Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person . During an interview with Vogue , Beyoncé described herself as a " modern @-@ day feminist " and further spoke about her decision to reference her husband 's name : " I feel like Mrs. Carter is who I am , but more bold and more fearless than I 've ever been ..... It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself once I saw my child . I was like , ' OK , this is what you were born to do ' . The purpose of my body became completely different .

 On April 24 , 2013 , it was announced by Beyoncé 's publicist that all photographers except Beyoncé 's personal photographer Frank Micelotta , were banned from the tour stating that " no photo credentials " will be present . The ban was interpreted as a reaction to the " unflattering " pictures from Beyoncé 's Super Bowl XLVII halftime performance showing her " jubilant exertions " , that appeared on websites such as Gawker and BuzzFeed . The pictures were not removed even after her publicist Yvette Noel @-@ Schure asked the websites through an e @-@ mail to change their articles , using " some better photos " . On May 13 , 2013 , the general counsel of the National Press Photographers Association ( NPPA ) Mickey H. <unk> , wrote a letter to Noel @-@ Schure on behalf of 19 other organizations requesting from him to " immediately revise your guidelines to restore photo credentialing " for the rest of the tour in Europe and the US . For the tour , the singer took part in " Miss A Meal " , a food @-@ donation campaign and supported the charity Goodwill during her tour , where fans were asked to bring food , clothes and household goods at the stops . Throughout the tour , an auction for the campaign was held by Beyoncé and her mother , Tina Knowles on the website <unk> in which the auction value was $ 25 @,@ 000 .

For the performance at the 2013 Made in America , Beyoncé wore a new costume designed by Timothy White , <unk> with shoes made by Reed <unk> . The outfit designed by DSQUARED2 was from their spring / summer 2013 collection at the Glamazon catwalk show and was inspired by models of the ' 90s . Several costumes were also designed by Emilio Pucci 's Peter Dundas who described them as a " modern take on glamour " , taking them from his fall / winter 2013 collection . He focused on the singer being able to perform the choreography during her performances . Stuart Weitzman designed the shoes for Beyoncé , her back @-@ up dancers and band collaborating with stylists Ty Hunter , Raquel Smith , and Beyoncé 's mother Tina Knowles . Weitzman created them in different colors with military elements . Beyoncé wanted Weitzman to focus on her being able to dance wearing the shoes without noticing they were on her feet . One of Beyoncé 's costumes which was worn during the first concerts was a gold bodysuit designed by The Blonds embellished with golden breasts complete with a nipple detail . The costume was a collaboration between the group , Beyoncé , Knowles , and Hunter . It was hand embroidered in 600 hours with approximately 30 @,@ 000 Swarovski crystals . According to The Blonds , it was meant to give the illusion of being covered in crystallized honey and reflect Beyoncé 's personality for the tour . They were inspired by Beyoncé 's songs of female empowerment and female nudes painted by Tamara de Lempicka . The costume received wide media and fan attention and divided critics ' opinions . InStyle 's Meghan Blalock described the costume as the " most scandalous " that the singer has worn in her career . For the 2014 shows , the singer wore numerous new designs collaborating again with DSQUARED2 , Givenchy , Pucci and Weitzman as well as with new designers such as Tom Ford , Versace and Karen Langley . 
 Beyoncé 's makeup for the tour focused on trying to emulate cosmic stars with the underlying themes based on the stratosphere . Other references used as inspiration for the makeup included : film noir , 60 's London , cyber beauty , cosmic constellations , and felines . The tourbook for The Mrs. Carter Show was meant to artistically illustrate all the different visual aspects of the tour through multi @-@ media collage and image manipulation . By using collage , Beyoncé 's team created images inspired by the singer and her songs and image manipulation was explored , with photos being solarized , layered and stacked . With the tourbook , fans had an opportunity to " bring a part of the tour home with them " , as Beyoncé 's team stated .

 = = Critical reception = = 
 Mike Wass from the website Idolator called the show a " concert extravaganza in the style of Michael Jackson or Madonna " praising the fact that the singer made a progress in the production values compared with her previous performances , mostly due to the expensive and high @-@ quality visual projections which " create atmosphere and add another layer to the production " . He further praised the singer 's " extraordinary talent " during the performances hailing her as " the greatest entertainer of her generation " after seeing the show which showcased " an icon at top of her game " . Tiffany Poole from The Oklahoman praised the fashion , video backdrops and " some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube " concluding , " To say that Beyoncé puts on a good show would be grossly understated . " Billboard writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a " musical and visual extravaganza " complete with a kaleidoscope of colorful imagery and dancing , which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer 's strong vocals , rather than overshadowing it . He concluded that the tour claimed " the multi @-@ talented artist 's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer " . Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing " big @-@ budget movie clips and Broadway musical dance moves , with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras " further hailing it as a " Cecil B. DeMille spectacle " . He finished his reviews by concluding , " what makes this show 's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé 's tireless physical effort . She has created a literal body of work " . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian who compared the singer 's performance with Tina Turner praised the show 's " bombastic " opening and wrote that " there 's something powerful and relentless " about it . He concluded " while onstage Beyoncé feels weirdly unassailable " . Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times noted , " What left the deepest impression was something far more elemental : Beyoncé 's ability to make self @-@ aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility ... [ Her ] ambition seemed in proportion with her fans ' expectations ; she came by the sense of scale honestly . " The Observer 's Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as " nothing short of breathtaking , making awesome and repeated use of silhouette , of great white blocks of video screens , of live dancers interacting with video " . She praised the singer 's " fierce " tireless dancing and concluded , " But for all the hauteur here , in couture and bearing , Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range . " Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph found " air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony ... [ and ] of an expensive revue show " in the concert . Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music , McNulty concluded : " Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch , and often blistering in her vocal attack " . 
 Philip Matusavage of musicOMH praised Beyoncé 's abilities to perform live , calling her " insanely talented " and considered the performance at the B @-@ stage a show highlight ; however he commented that the production values of the show , consisting solely of a video screen were " relatively low @-@ key " compared to other pop arena concerts . Matusavage further criticized the repetition of the songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during the singer 's other concerts as the tour 's " most notable problem " . Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the singer " tore through her ... set with the ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove " and felt that she tried " her damnedest to win the crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and good old @-@ fashioned hyping " further showcasing " unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals " which placed her at the top of R & B music . However Halperin criticized the show 's set list mainly due to the majority of the songs from the album 4 , writing , " Bey sounded terrific on all , of course , but with a ... ready @-@ to @-@ party audience angling to groove in the aisles , rather than sway with their hands to the heavens , overall it missed the mark . " Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey praised the high @-@ energy nature of the show with vigorous dancing and " blistering " pace but felt that there was a lack of hits performed in the show 's first half . NME editor Emily Mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for the tour , further criticizing the lack of hits in the set list and adding that only a " paucity of material " was incorporated in the set . She further dismissed the placement of interlude films in the show . A negative review came from San Jose Mercury News ' Jim Harrington who called the tour " flawed " , criticized its set list consisting of " plenty of filler [ s ] " and the many dissipating costume changes she went through for the show . He further noted that the singer looked and sounded well but blamed the way the show and the production were choreographed . 
 The revamped show in 2014 received acclaim by critics . Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show praising the singer 's sex appeal and noted that although the set included many new songs , the singer " remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent , charisma and awe @-@ inspiring thighs " . Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show 's fashion . Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey felt that the show 's set list was better than the original one describing the tour as " wall @-@ to @-@ wall amazing Beyoncé " . He concluded in his review , " The relentless pace , ever @-@ changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in , let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease . When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre , these days she 's really only competing with herself . " The Observer 's Kitty Empire praised the singer 's <unk> during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing , " There is no question as to Beyoncé 's own powers . She can stop and start her all @-@ female band ... with a click of her fingers , and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest . She sings ( with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour ) and dances ( flawlessly ) for more than one and a half hours . " David Pollock of The Independent felt that , " this near two @-@ hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era . It was , at the very least , one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year , and with barely a drop of minutely @-@ choreographed sweat to be seen . " 
 The tour received a nomination in the category for Choice Summer Tour at the 2013 Teen Choice Summer Tour losing to One Direction 's Take Me Home Tour . It was also nominated for Concert Marketing & Promotion Award and <unk> Fans ' Choice Award at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards .

 Finn Hudson is a fictional character from the Fox musical comedy @-@ drama series Glee . The character was portrayed by Cory Monteith and appears in Glee starting with its pilot episode , first broadcast on May 19 , 2009 . Finn was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan . Glee follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima , Ohio . Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team . A popular jock at the top of the school ’ s social hierarchy , when he finds himself forced to join the school 's glee club , he discovers that he loves it , although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member . His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club , which is at the bottom of the social ladder , while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks . The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) and glee club star singer Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) , the series ' female lead . Following Monteith 's death on July 13 , 2013 , it was announced that Finn 's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season , titled " The Quarterback " . 
 Monteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show . The actor said , " Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on , Finn ’ s not dumb anymore , really , he ’ s just a little naïve . " Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed ; Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that he and Michele were " both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet " in the pilot episode . Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season , Eric Goldman of IGN wrote , " We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn [ ... ] it 's good to see this , because up until now , Finn 's been a bit too straight @-@ laced to totally invest in . " In the second season 's eighth episode , " Furt " , Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack said , " It 's been a while since we ’ ve gotten some Finn focus , and I think I just missed Cory Monteith . But I also forgot what a good , natural actor he can be . " Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV : Actor Comedy , and was nominated in the same category in 2010 . 
 Although he was not a singer before being cast as Finn , Monteith sang lead or joint lead on a large number of songs on the show , most of which have charted in the US and abroad . " Jessie 's Girl " , which Finn performed as a solo , was certified gold in Australia , one of only three singles to do so from the show 's releases in that country ; he was joint lead on " Don 't Stop Believin ' " in the pilot episode , the show 's first single sung by the glee club , which was certified gold and platinum in Australia and the US .

 Finn Hudson is portrayed by Cory Monteith . He has also been portrayed as a child by Jerry Phillips in " Pilot " and as a preschooler by Jake Vaughn in the episode " The Substitute " . When Glee was being cast , Monteith 's Vancouver agent , Elena Kirschner , submitted a video of him drumming with some pencils and Tupperware containers . Series creator ( Ryan Murphy ) took notice of the video , but pointed out that he had to be singing , as auditioning actors for Glee with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act . Monteith submitted a second , musical tape , in which he sang " a cheesy , ' 80s music @-@ video @-@ style version " of REO Speedwagon 's " Can 't Fight This Feeling " . He then attended a mass audition in Los Angeles ; his vocal skills were considered weak , but he later performed very well with one of Glee 's casting directors , who said that his audition captured the most elusive quality of Finn 's , his " naive , but not stupid sweetness " . Monteith said of his casting process , " I was like a lot of kids , looking for something to be interested in . Something to be passionate about . All you need is permission . Not only for Glee , but for anything in life . " 
 In December 2010 , Murphy announced that some members of the cast of Glee would be replaced after the end of the third season in spring 2012 , to coincide with their graduation . Murphy said : " Every year we 're going to populate a new group . There 's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot . " He added , " I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers ' lives . " Although Murphy said in July 2011 that Monteith would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season , Falchuk later stated that while Monteith , along with Lea Michele and Chris Colfer , will graduate at the end of the third season , " because they 're graduating doesn 't mean they 're leaving the show . " Falchuk insisted that " it was never our plan or our intention to let them go … . They are not done with the show after this season . " 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 Finn originated as a character who " walks a fine line between following his dreams and balancing what other people expect of him . " Monteith 's former acting coach said : " You 've got to be incredibly smart to understand how dim Finn can be " , though Monteith appreciated the fact that Finn is more than " just a dumb jock " . He has admitted that he is sometimes frustrated by Finn 's " convenient dumb @-@ guy writing " , and commented , " I think every actor wants to be stretched . But it 's also important to realize that whatever we 're doing works . I realize that this happens to an actor about once every ten lifetimes . To be on a show that 's this good , it 's rarified air . " Finn has matured during his run on the series — in January 2011 , Monteith noted that he had " grown up a little bit " and become " a little wiser " . He later expanded , " Finn 's not dumb anymore , really , he ’ s just naive . The opposite of me . I love Finn ’ s optimism . He ’ s very idealistic ; he wants a good girl to love him , and he chases after what he wants in life — that I can relate to . " The actor hopes that in time his character will be able to grow and mature more . He said in an interview with MTV , " I think the harder it is for him , the better , you know ? I think Finn has a lot of growing up to do and I think that Finn has a lot of struggle left for him . I think dealing with a lot of his dad stuff , the passing of his father and dealing with the unrequited love all of a sudden from Rachel , I think the more trouble he goes through , the more interesting it is for me as an actor . " 
 Over the course of his run on the series , Finn 's primary relationship has been with the glee club 's main singer , Rachel . In a meeting with the press at <unk> , which occurred when the characters were in the middle of a months @-@ long breakup , Monteith commented : " That 's a very important central relationship to the show . I think it 's important , and I think they 're endgame , but I can 't be sure of when . I try not to get too attached to the pairing , so I can focus on storyline that does come my way . " Falchuk said of the Finn – Rachel relationship ahead of the third season , " We 're not interested in breaking them up this year but at the same time the challenge is they are graduating , they are different kinds of people and where does that take you ? " During the <unk> Glee cast interview , Monteith said , " There are a lot of people who really , really want Finn and Rachel to be together . But at the same time , I think that it 's really interesting when they 're clearly in love with each other but they 're apart . I think it makes for good television . " He added , " I think there 's a different dynamic to Finn with Quinn and with Rachel , and single . "

 Finn is introduced as quarterback of the William McKinley High School football team . He is blackmailed into joining the school glee club , New Directions , by its faculty director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) .

She subsequently moves in with Finn and his mother Carole ( Romy Rosemont ) after her parents find out about her pregnancy and evict her . When Rachel figures out that Puck is the father and informs Finn , he attacks Puck , breaks up with Quinn , and quits the glee club in a fury ; but after cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) sabotages the glee club 's first show choir competition , he is able to set aside his anger and return to lead the club to victory . He and Rachel briefly date , but he ends the relationship to concentrate on his own well @-@ being . By the time Finn realizes that he truly does want to be with Rachel , he is chagrined to discover that she has started dating Jesse St. James ( Jonathan Groff ) , the lead singer of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline . Cheerleader Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) offers to take Finn 's virginity to improve her social status and his , and he accepts , but afterward he regrets having done so and claims to Rachel that he did not go through with it ; she , in turn , falsely claims to have had sex with Jesse .

As Finn and Rachel are about to go onstage , Finn tells her that he loves her ; although they lose the competition , they become a couple and continue dating well into the next school year . 
 Glee club member Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) , who is gay , has a longstanding crush on Finn , and sets up his father Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) with Finn 's mother Carole in the hopes of spending more time with him . Finn initially opposes the relationship , worried that his mother will forget about his late father , but relents when Burt tells Finn that he loves Carole , though Kurt is dismayed by the deepening rapport between Finn and Burt . Finn and his mother eventually move in with the Hummels , but when Finn , uncomfortable about rooming with Kurt who he knows has a crush on him but will not admit it , uses a homophobic slur against Kurt during an argument , Burt throws him out . Finn is ashamed , and makes amends by standing up for Kurt when he is victimized by bullies . The following fall , the bullying against Kurt has intensified , but Finn refuses to stand up for him this time , concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback . When their parents marry , Finn uses his best man speech as an opportunity to apologize to Kurt , which begins a brotherly bond between the two . In the spring , the two of them team up to arrange the funeral of Sue Sylvester 's sister , Jean ( Robin Trocki ) , when Sue is too upset to do so , after which Sue ends her long @-@ running campaign to destroy the glee club .

Rachel learns the truth about Finn sleeping with Santana . Hurt , she makes out with Puck to get even with Finn ; this betrayal causes Finn to break up with her . The football team <unk> a spot in the championship game , but animosity is running high between glee and non @-@ glee members and harming the team 's performance . In " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " , Coach Beiste and Will Schuester force the entire football team to join the glee club for a week to settle their differences and dispel their prejudices . After a promising start , the non @-@ glee members quit the club and are kicked off the team ; at the same time , Sue arranges to have the cheerleading Regionals rescheduled to conflict with the football championship to sabotage both Beiste and Will , whose glee club now has to do the halftime show . With the football team down to half strength and the glee club without its cheerleader members , football players Finn and Puck settle their differences ; Puck convinces the non @-@ glee football players to perform in the halftime show , which will also get them back on the team , while Finn convinces Quinn , Santana , and Brittany ( Heather Morris ) to quit the Cheerios and perform in the halftime show instead . The show is a great success , and the football team wins the championship game . 
 Emboldened by leading the team to the championship , Finn sets his eyes on a new prize : Quinn , who is in a serious relationship with football player and glee club member Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) . After setting up a kissing booth ostensibly to raise money for the glee club , Finn succeeds in kissing Quinn , and they make an assignation . Although Quinn ultimately decides to stay with Sam , he finds out about her cheating on him with Finn , and breaks up with her .

Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn again because he realizes how deep his feelings are for Rachel . At Nationals , as the New Directions are about to go on stage , Finn begs Rachel to come back to him , but though she professes her love , she refuses , still torn between her lifelong dream of Broadway stardom and her love for him . At the end of their duet — " Pretending " , written by Finn — the audience responds with awkward silence as Rachel and Finn actually kiss ; the club consequently fails to place at Nationals . Back in Ohio , Rachel tells Finn she is moving to New York for college and will not be coming back ; he reminds her that they have a whole year until graduation and they kiss , renewing their relationship .

 As the new school year begins , Finn , a senior , has trouble figuring out what he wants to do with his life after graduation . In the fifth episode , " The First Time " , Finn is not recruited to play football in college , as he had hoped . He and Rachel decide to have sex together for the first time . In the episode " Mash Off " , Santana , who has joined the rival Troubletones , is relentlessly bullying Finn . After a fake apology pushes him to the edge , Finn tells her to just " come out of the closet " and accuses her of being a coward for tearing other people down only because she can 't admit to everyone that she 's in love with Brittany . They are overheard by a girl whose uncle is running against Sue in a congressional campaign , and he uses Santana 's lesbianism — because she 's Sue 's cheerleading co @-@ captain — against Sue in a campaign commercial , effectively " outing " her . Santana , devastated by this , slaps Finn , but he later claims it was a " stage slap " to prevent her from being suspended . In the episode " Yes / No " , Finn asks Rachel to marry him . In the episode " On My Way " , the wedding is set for after the Regionals competition , which New Directions wins , but it is canceled after Quinn is badly injured in a car crash on her way to the ceremony . They change the wedding date to after graduation , but after Finn fails to get into his New York acting school while she has been accepted by hers and she decides to wait a year , he instead sends her off to New York without him , and tells her that he has enlisted in the army and is " setting her free " .

 Finn has not been in touch with Rachel or Kurt all summer and into the fall — the two friends are now rooming together in Brooklyn while Rachel is attending NYADA — but he reappears unexpectedly at the end of the third episode . He has been given an early discharge from the army after injuring himself . He finds out she kissed Brody ( Dean Geyer ) , a NYADA junior , and feels that he doesn 't belong in her world in New York , so he returns to Lima without telling her . She then breaks up with him . In Lima , Finn is working at Burt 's tire shop again , and Artie enlists his help to co @-@ direct the school musical , Grease , which had been Finn 's suggestion . When Rachel comes to see the musical in the " <unk> " episode , their reunion does not go well , and they agree to refrain from contact when Rachel visits Lima in the future . Will takes a leave of absence from McKinley to be a member of a blue @-@ ribbon panel in Washington , DC , so starting in " Dynamic Duets " , Finn becomes the interim director of New Directions . While he has a rocky start in the position , they come to accept him as their leader . At Sectionals , the glee club loses to the Warblers after Marley ( Melissa Benoist ) passes out on stage , interrupting the performance . Afterward , Finn does what he can to keep the club together and finally succeeds despite Sue 's opposition — she has deprived New Directions of rehearsal space at school . The Warblers are disqualified , and New Directions is again eligible to compete in Regionals ; the choir room is returned to them . Finn enlists Emma , who is deep in wedding preparations in advance of Will 's return , to help him judge a glee club competition for which member is the best diva . When he finds her panicking over the reception arrangements , he kisses her . In " I Do " , when Emma flees the church the day of the wedding , Finn blames himself , but Rachel sets him straight , and he and Rachel sleep with each other post @-@ reception . In " Girls ( and Boys ) On Film " , Finn teams up with Artie to help find Emma for Will ; he later confesses to Will that he kissed Emma , and Will is unable to forgive him . Since working with Will is untenable , Finn leaves New Directions though he enjoyed directing them ; Marley tells him he 's a good teacher , and he should get a teaching degree . He goes to college , where he shares a dorm room with Puck — who isn 't actually attending the school . Will later asks Finn to return to co @-@ lead New Directions , and he agrees . Meanwhile , Santana has discovered that Brody , who is now living with Rachel , is a gigolo , and tells Finn , who flies to New York and warns Brody away , ultimately beating him up and saying , " Stay away from my future wife .

 = = = Season 6 = = = 
 In the flash back episode " 2009 " , the original Glee club members have second thoughts about Finn being the leader of the new club . After talking about how different Finn is from the other school jocks , they decide to let him stay in the club .

 In " A Wedding " , Burt and Carole tell the reunited Kurt and Blaine that Finn taught them to live the most out of every day . 
 In the series finale " Dreams Come True " , U.S. Vice President Sue Sylvester <unk> the McKinley High auditorium to be named in honor of Finn . 
 = = Musical performances = = 
 As Finn is the most frequent male lead in New Directions numbers , Monteith features in a great many musical performances which have been released as singles available for digital download and are also featured in the show 's soundtrack albums . He frequently shares vocal leads with the main female singer , Rachel , as in the pilot episode 's closing song , Journey 's " Don 't Stop Believin ' " , the single of which has sold over a million copies and been certified platinum in the US and Australia . 
 Like Finn , Monteith was a novice singer when the show started . In an interview with GQ 's Alex <unk> , he noted that , early on , " you could hear the Auto @-@ Tune . " He was not called on to sing much on the first few episodes , as he rapped in " Push It " for " Showmance " , had a short solo phrase in the song " I Wanna Sex You Up " in " Acafellas " , and was not featured as a vocal lead in " Preggers " . Over the next three episodes , he shares the lead on four group numbers . Three are with Rachel : Queen 's " Somebody to Love " , " No Air " and " Keep Holding On " . The fourth is a boys @-@ only mash @-@ up of Bon Jovi 's " It 's My Life " with Usher 's " Confessions Part II " , where Finn sings lead on the " It 's My Life " sections and Artie on the rest . 
 Excluding a scene from the pilot of him singing a portion of " Can 't Fight This Feeling " in the shower , Finn 's first solo songs are not until the show 's tenth episode , " Ballad " . Finn sings " I 'll Stand By You " to the unborn child he thinks is his , and later sings " ( You 're ) Having My Baby " to Quinn , the mother of the child , in front of her parents , who respond with her mother being forced to watch as her father evicts her from the family home . He has two solo numbers later in the season : " Hello , I Love You " by The Doors , characterized by Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle as " one of Finn 's best vocal performances to date " , and " Jessie 's Girl " by Rick Springfield ; the latter song charted in the top ten in Australia , Canada and Ireland , and was certified gold in Australia , one of only three singles from Glee to have received gold certification in that country . 
 Finn sings lead more frequently in the second half of the first season , as he is featured in over a dozen songs , including several with Rachel . However , in Glee 's second season , he sings lead in fewer songs than in the first , though he again sings a significant proportion with Rachel , including the duets " Don 't Go Breaking My Heart " , " With You I 'm Born Again " , " Last Christmas " , and the one ostensibly written by Finn at the end of the season , " Pretending " . His first solo performance of the second season , in the episode " Grilled Cheesus " , is R.E.M. ' s " Losing My Religion " . Monteith said he and series music producer Adam Anders " had a bit of a different idea " about how the song should be performed . While Anders " always brings the songs in very positive , very upbeat " , he felt the song " was expressing a betrayal " , and with Finn feeling both betrayal and anger , Monteith wanted his performance to reflect that . Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented positively on the arrangement of Monteith 's song , and graded the performance an " A " , but Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone was critical of the arrangement , and said Monteith 's performance was " more awkward than inspired . " Finn 's other solo is " I 've Gotta Be Me " in the episode " Born This Way " . 
 In the episode " Furt " , when Finn 's mother marries Kurt 's father and the glee club provides music for the wedding , two of the songs are by Bruno Mars : " Marry You " , which is sung by the entire club as a big processional production number , and " Just the Way You Are " , which is sung by Finn to Kurt at the reception . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized the " two Bruno Mars songs " as " brilliant in execution and touching in sentiment " , and Futterman agreed : " the Bruno Mars songs gave the show two of its best performances this season " . While Benigno and Stack also praised " Just the Way You Are " , and both gave the song an " A " , Jen Harper of BuddyTV thought Monteith 's vocals as Finn " aren 't the strongest " and AOL TV 's Jean Bentley also wished Finn had not been the soloist . In " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " , Finn led his football teammates , some of whom were performing with the glee club under duress , in The Zombies ' " She 's Not There " . VanDerWerff called it " one of the better numbers of the season " , and Futterman felt that Monteith 's vocals were a " perfect fit " for the song . Finn 's sole duet with Quinn , Fleetwood Mac 's " I Don 't Want to Know " from the episode " Rumours " , was given an " A − " by Entertainment Weekly 's Sandra Gonzalez , and Futterman said it was " better than Quinn and Sam 's ' Lucky ' " , which she had called " charming " when it was performed in " Duets " .

 The character of Finn has gotten mixed to positive reviews from television critics . VanDerWerff praised the " terrific " cast in the pilot episode , and wrote that Monteith and Michele " are both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet as the show choir 's central two singers " . The Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan opined that " Cory Monteith gives quarterback Finn Hudson a jock @-@ ish authority mixed with an appealingly square naivete . " <unk> Ghosh of Zap2it enjoyed Finn 's " sweet nature " and observed , " it 's clear that at Finn 's core , he 's a good person . " Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times noted a contradiction in his characterization in the episode " Preggers " — she questioned whether the intelligence he demonstrated in striving for a football scholarship was incongruent in a character who believed he had impregnated Quinn by sharing a hot tub with her . 
 Goldman welcomed the emergence of Finn 's " darker side " as he manipulated Rachel in " The Rhodes Not Taken " , as " up until now , Finn 's been a bit too straight @-@ laced to totally invest in " . Denise Martin of the Los Angeles Times added , " Did anyone not want to kill Finn for coming on to Rachel to get her to come back to the club ? ( Yes , the logic was there . He wants to win a scholarship so he can provide for the baby he thinks is his . But a girl 's heart is a fragile thing , and like Rachel tells him , he could have just tried being honest . ) " In his review of " Ballad " , Goldman commented : " Finn singing ' I 'll Stand By You ' to the unborn baby he thinks is his was very sweet " . He found the scene that followed Finn 's revelation of Quinn 's pregnancy to her parents the grimmest on Glee to that point . The intense sequence featuring Finn , Kurt and Burt in " Theatricality " garnered praise for Monteith from James Poniewozik of Time , who wrote : " One thing I love about his performance , here and throughout Glee , is that he plays Finn as a kid , which of course he still is . He 's basically a good kid , but as his ' faggy ' outburst shows , he 's flawed and often overwhelmed . And while he has little to do during Burt 's lecture but react , his reactions are great : he 's scared and defensive , but shows Finn 's guilt at the same time . " 
 When Finn 's mother marries Kurt 's father in the second season 's eighth episode , " Furt " , Stack was pleased to see Finn being featured : " It ’ s been a while since we ’ ve gotten some Finn focus , and I think I just missed Cory Monteith . But I also forgot what a good , natural actor he can be . " While giving " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " episode a " C " grade , VanDerWerff wrote as an aside , " Let ’ s pause for a moment to give Cory Monteith some praise , though , since he was asked to do a lot of difficult things in this episode , in regards to selling the idea of Finn as a leader , bringing disparate groups together , and he mostly managed that task , much better than he has in past episodes . " While reviewing " Funeral " , the season 's penultimate episode , Gonzalez said , " I was glad that the writers chose [ … ] Finn and Kurt to be the ones to connect with Sue because I think they 're two of the most genuine characters on the show . [ … ] I think they pulled it off well . " In his review of " Funeral " , <unk> noted that Finn was not the best vocalist among the male students : " the show hits on something very odd in its DNA : Finn continues to be the male lead of the group because he ’ s the male lead of the show , less because he ’ s the best singer New Directions has . [ ... ] But because he ’ s trying to get better , that ’ s OK " . 
 At the conclusion of the second season , Poniewozik wrote that he had not found the relationship between Finn and Rachel " the most compelling story " of the season , and as such " didn 't enjoy ' New York ' as much as [ he ] might have " , and VanDerWerff commented that their storyline had " ceased being too interesting long ago . " However , the former conceded " I may not be that invested in Finn / Rachel , but the startling moment where the audience disappeared in the middle of their kiss made me feel like I was " , and the latter opined that their kiss resonated , despite being unoriginal and " too neat way of suggesting that Rachel can 't have both Finn and her Broadway dreams " .

 = <unk> and tegula = 
 The imbrex and tegula ( plurals imbrices and tegulae ) were overlapping roof tiles used in ancient Greek and Roman architecture as a waterproof and durable roof covering . They were made predominantly of fired clay , but also sometimes of marble , bronze or gilt . In Rome , they replaced wooden shingles , and were used on almost every type of structure , from humble outbuildings to grand temples and public facilities . 
 The tegula ( Greek <unk> ) was a plain flat tile , or a flat tile with raised edges , which was laid flat upon the roof , while the imbrex ( Greek <unk> ) was a semi @-@ cylindrical roofing tile , like a half @-@ pipe , laid over the joints between the tegulae . When well @-@ made and properly imbricated ( overlapped ) , there was little need for further waterproofing or sealant . 
 The roofing area was generally surrounded by antefixae which were often decorated , and had several decorative <unk> to cover each end row imbrex . 
 The concept of imbrex and tegula roofing in pitched roof construction is still in use today as an international feature of style and design , and is the origin of the term <unk> for the condition of things arranged in overlapping layers . 
 = = History and development = = 
 <unk> and tegulae were first made by the Greeks . Like bricks , they were formed of wet clay in a four @-@ sided mould , often shaped with a piece of wire , and then baked in an oven or kiln . More sophisticated moulds were developed over time . 
 <unk> were originally made perfectly flat , or with nothing more than a ridge underneath the upper border , which allowed the tile to be " hung " upon a sloping roof so that it would not slide to the ground . Later , tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides , which would channel rainwater to the bottom of the tile , rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the roofing materials . Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge , forming a broad v @-@ shaped trapezoid with the narrowest edge downwards , nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel . 
 The imbrices completed the waterproofing of the roof by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae , dividing the roof into channels . Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae , and descended into the gutter ( canalis ) . In formal architecture the canalis had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the entablature , immediately above the cornice . The semicircular opening at the front of the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental fronton , and the spouts which drained the gutters were frequently decorated with lions ' heads ( capita <unk> ) or other fantastic or grotesque faces . 
 By Roman times many tiles were being made under the auspices of various Roman legions , and were imprinted with a stamp of the legion 's insignia . <unk> and tegulae are common finds in archaeological sites , and their design and markings can be of use in dating the sites and identifying the inhabitants . For instance , a 1993 archaeological dig in Merseyside in England uncovered over 300 kg ( 660 lb ) of tile and kiln remains . Some of the tegulae were stamped with the " <unk> " <unk> of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix . Romans also often recycled broken tiles by incorporating them into mortar . 
 Tiles of marble were first used around the year 620 BC . Besides the superior beauty and durability of the material , these tiles could be made of a much larger size than those of clay . Consequently , they were used in the construction of the greatest temples , such as the Temple of Zeus at Olympia , the Parthenon at Athens , and the Serapeum at Puteoli ( modern Pozzuoli ) . Still more expensive and magnificent tiles were made of bronze and gilt .

 James Lance Bass was born in Laurel , Mississippi , to James Irvin Bass , Jr . , a medical technologist , and Diane ( née Pulliam ) , a middle school mathematics , English , and career discovery teacher . Along with his older sister , Stacy , Bass grew up in nearby Clinton Mississippi , and was raised as a Southern Baptist . Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative and has said that his childhood was " extremely happy " . As a young boy , Bass developed an interest in space , and at age 9 traveled to Cape Canaveral , Florida , with his father to watch his first live space shuttle launch . Of this experience Bass said , " I was certain from then on that my future was to be involved with space . " Shortly after , Bass attended space camp in Titusville , Florida , and aspired to attend college and study engineering , with the hope that he would one day work for NASA . 
 When Bass was 11 years old , his father was transferred to a different hospital , and the family moved to Clinton , Mississippi ( <unk> Driven , 2002 ) Bass began singing in his Baptist church choir , and was encouraged to audition for local performance groups by his childhood best friend , Darren Dale , the youngest child of former longtime Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale . Bass joined the Mississippi Show Stoppers , a statewide music group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum , and the Attaché Show Choir , a national @-@ award @-@ winning competitive show choir group at Clinton High School . He was also a member of a seven @-@ man vocal group named Seven Card Stud , which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for Senator Trent Lott . 
 At Clinton High School , Bass was elected vice president of his junior class and has said that he performed well in math and science . However , Bass later stated that his primary focus during high school was singing , and when looking back , he remembers " hardly anything " about academia .

 In 1995 , during his junior year of high school , Bass received a call from Justin Timberlake and his mother , Lynn Harless , who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group NSYNC after the group 's original bass singer , Jason Galasso , had quit . Timberlake 's vocal coach ( who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper ) recommended Bass as a replacement . Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning in front of the other bandmembers and Lou Pearlman , and soon left school to move to Orlando , Florida , and rehearse full @-@ time . Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC , and therefore found much of the group 's choreography difficult to learn . According to an episode of VH1 's Driven , Jan Boltz , president of BMG 's German division , offered NSYNC a recording contract under the condition that they replace Bass , whose dancing , he felt , " wasn 't at the same level as all the others . " However , the other members of the group refused to accept the contract without Bass , and the group 's manager , Johnny Wright , convinced <unk> that Bass 's dancing would quickly improve . <unk> conceded , and the group soon moved to Munich , Germany to record their first album with BMG . ' N Sync began extensive touring in Europe , and Bass 's mother quit her job to tour with the group as a chaperone , as Bass was still a minor . 
 After gaining significant notability in Europe , NSYNC was signed to American record label RCA in 1997 . The group 's first single , " I Want You Back " began receiving major radio play in the United States , and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an " overnight sensation " , a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as " the death of my own innocence " . Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Pearlman , due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part . NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company , Trans Continental , for defrauding the group of more than 50 % of their earnings , rather than his original promise of only receiving one @-@ sixth of the profits . The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records , which prompted Pearlman and RCA to <unk> NSYNC for $ 150 million US , citing breach of contract . The injunction was thrown out of court and , after winning back their earnings , NSYNC signed with Jive . Bass has been estranged from Pearlman ever since . 
 In March 2000 , NSYNC released No Strings Attached , which became the fastest @-@ selling record of all time , selling 1 @.@ 1 million copies in its first day of release . In 2001 , the group followed up with their Celebrity album , which scored the second highest first @-@ week album sales ever , trumped only by the group 's previous album . NSYNC went on to sell over 56 million records worldwide . In 2002 , the group announced that they would be taking a " hiatus " , during which Timberlake began to record solo material . ' N Sync has not recorded new material since , and Bass has stated that he feels the group has officially disbanded . 
 In 2007 , Bass stated that he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC , and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake 's 2004 decision to pursue his solo career instead . Bass has also said that he has little hope for a reunion , since Timberlake has " made it clear that he wouldn 't be interested in discussing another album any time soon . " Despite these statements , Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake , saying : " At that time ... it did feel like betrayal . I felt heartbroken . All these emotions went through me . Today , I ’ m really happy , and Justin and I are really great friends . I don ’ t hate him at all . And I understand what he was going through , and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us . "

 Despite heavy marketing towards NSYNC teen fans , the film was a commercial failure , grossing only $ 4 @.@ 2 million US domestically despite its $ 10 million US budget . The film , along with Bass 's acting , was also poorly received by critics .

 Bass came out as gay in a cover story for People magazine on July 26 , 2006 . There had been considerable media speculation about his orientation due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs , most notably during the preceding Independence Day weekend in Provincetown , Massachusetts . Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had also been posting items on his website about Bass 's orientation since September 2005 , and New York gossip column Page Six ran a blurb on July 12 , 2006 , that reported a sighting of Bass at a gay bar with his then @-@ boyfriend , Reichen Lehmkuhl . Bass 's publicist , Ken Sunshine , chose to release the story exclusively to People magazine , who bumped actor Johnny Depp off of that week 's cover in favor of Bass . In his coming out interview , Bass stated , 
 Bass 's announcement received a large amount of media attention . The American public 's reaction was generally positive , with Bass receiving " overwhelming support " from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to ' N Sync . However , Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as " straight acting " in his People interview , stating , " I call them the <unk> — the straight @-@ acting gays . We 're just normal , typical guys . I love to watch football and drink beer . " This comment angered some members of the LGBT community , who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not ' normal ' , but further enforced unneeded stereotypes . In a 2007 interview with The Advocate , Bass called his comment a " mistake " and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term . Bass stated , " Every community is hard to please . Our community is very fickle . It 's a touchy community because it 's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America . So when someone new like myself comes along and says off @-@ the @-@ mark things , yeah , I can see how people would get pissed . " 
 Bass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he , along with then @-@ boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl , was awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7 , 2006 . The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long @-@ time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass 's fame to sell tickets . The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award , responding to critics by saying , " Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out , and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance , but his declaration did initiate a positive , national conversation that continues today .

 In February 2002 , Lena Banks , a space advocate and founder / producer of Think Tank Ink Productions , contacted Lance Bass to propose his involvement in her Youngest Person in Space project . Ms. Banks brought her longtime associate David <unk> of Destiny Productions on board and through a series of events in August 2002 , Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City , Russia . Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled The Big Mission , which had been successful in Denmark , in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule . However , the game show concept was reconsidered , as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space , and airing it on a major network . Lena Banks came up with the idea of the Youngest Person in Space many years before Dennis Tito had his historical flight . Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend 's daughter shouted out , " Lance Bass wants to go into space ! " The girl , who was an NSYNC fan , learned of Bass ' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum . Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass 's management who then went to him with the proposal . " At first he thought we were joking , " Lena Banks remarks . " I assured him it was for real ; he accepted and we moved forward with the project . " 
 In order to be admitted into training , Bass had to go through strenuous physicals that saved his life . It was discovered he had cardiac arrhythmia , and he agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct it . Prior to this , in 1999 , he collapsed after a concert because of his condition . After several months of training , Bass received cosmonaut certification and went on to Houston 's Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) to take part in astronaut training . He was scheduled to fly into space on the Soyuz TMA @-@ 1 mission that was to be launched on October 30 , 2002 . The capsule was scheduled to fly to the International Space Station and land in a desert in Kazakhstan . 
 Several months before Bass was scheduled to fly , the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through . Bass 's camp turned to MTV , who initially agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over " payment , insurance , and indemnification issues . " Shortly after , all of Bass 's other sponsorships fell through , including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission . Bass was eventually rejected from the program , and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts Yuri <unk> , Sergei Zalyotin and Belgium 's Frank De Winne .

 = Burning of Falmouth = 
 The Burning of Falmouth ( October 18 , 1775 ) was an attack by a fleet of Royal Navy vessels on the town of Falmouth , Massachusetts ( site of the modern city of Portland , Maine , and not to be confused with the modern towns of Falmouth , Massachusetts or Falmouth , Maine ) . The fleet was commanded by Captain Henry Mowat . The attack began with a naval bombardment which included incendiary shot , followed by a landing party meant to complete the town 's destruction . The attack was the only major event in what was supposed to be a campaign of retaliation against ports that supported Patriot activities in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War . 
 Among the colonies , news of the attack led to rejection of British authority and the establishment of independent governments . It also led the Second Continental Congress to contest British Naval dominance by forming a Continental Navy . Both Mowat and his superior , Vice @-@ Admiral Samuel Graves , who had ordered Mowat 's expedition , suffered professionally as a consequence of the act . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 , the British army was besieged in the City of Boston . The British were supported and supplied by the Royal Navy under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral Samuel Graves , who was under Admiralty instruction to suppress the burgeoning rebellion . Under his orders , vessels were searched for military stores and potential military communications . Laid @-@ up vessels were stripped of their masts and rudders to prevent their use by privateers and military equipment was salvaged from readily @-@ accessible recent wrecks . 
 Captain Henry Mowat had been in the port of Falmouth ( present @-@ day Portland , Maine ) in May 1775 , during Thompson 's War when local Patriots captured several ships carrying supplies for Boston and weaponry from Fort Pownall at the mouth of the Penobscot River . Graves ' Admiralty orders ( issued in July 1775 and received by him on October 4 ) required that he " carry on such Operations upon the Sea Coasts ... as you shall judge most effective for suppressing ... the Rebellion " . Graves ordered Mowat to " lay waste burn and destroy such Sea Port towns as are accessible to His Majesty 's ships ... and particularly Machias where <unk> was taken " . 
 = = Sailing to Falmouth = = 
 Mowat left Boston harbor on October 6 , 1775 aboard his 16 @-@ gun hydrographic survey sloop HMS Canceaux , in company with the 20 @-@ gun ship Cat , the 12 @-@ gun schooner HMS Halifax , the bomb sloop HMS Spitfire , and the supply ship HMS Symmetry . While his instructions were broad in the number of possible targets , he opted against attacks on harbors on Cape Ann , where the buildings were too widely spaced for naval cannon fire to be effective . On October 16 he reached the outer parts of Falmouth harbor and anchored there . 
 The people of Falmouth had mixed reactions to the presence of the British fleet . Some recognized the Canceaux and believed there was no danger ; but militia members remembering Thompson 's War were more suspicious . The next day was windless : Mowat <unk> the ships into the inner harbor and anchored them near the town . He sent one of his lieutenants ashore with a proclamation stating that he was there to " execute a just punishment " for the town 's state of rebellion . He gave the townspeople two hours to evacuate . 
 As soon as they received this ultimatum , the townspeople sent a deputation to plead with Mowat for mercy . He promised to withhold fire if the town swore an oath of allegiance to King George . They must also surrender all their small arms and powder , along with their gun carriages . In response , the people of Falmouth began to move out of the town . No oaths were sworn . A small number of muskets were surrendered , but no gun carriages . 
 = = Attack = = 
 Mowat had set a deadline of 9 : 00 am on October 18 for the town 's response . By 9 : 40 the town appeared to be deserted , so he ran a red flag up the Canceaux 's masthead , and ordered the fleet to begin firing . Incendiary cannonballs set fire to the harbor installations and most of the town 's houses and public buildings . One witness reported : 
 The firing began from all the vessels with all possible briskness , discharging on all parts of the town ... a horrible shower of balls from three to nine pounds weight , bombs , carcasses , live shells , grapeshot and musketballs . ... The firing lasted , with little cessation , until six o 'clock . 
 When the bombardment appeared inadequate to Mowat , he sent a landing party to set fire to any buildings that had survived . The town militia offered little significant resistance , as most were helping their families to safety . In spite of this , some of the landed British marines were killed or wounded . By evening , according to Mowat , " the body of the town was in one flame " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the bombardment , Mowat went on to <unk> , where he set fire to a few houses and raided for livestock , but his expedition was faltering to an end . The decks of some of his ships had been inadequately braced for prolonged gunnery , and many of his guns had jumped their mounts . He returned to Boston , and remained there as winter was setting in . When Admiral Graves was relieved in December 1775 , these punitive raids were gradually abandoned . One of the last , undertaken to avenge British military losses to revolutionary Patriots , was the burning of Norfolk , Virginia , on January 1 , 1776 , instigated by Lord Dunmore , the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia . 
 = = = Damage assessment = = = 
 More than 400 buildings and houses were recorded as damaged or destroyed by fire . In his report to Graves , Mowat stated that eleven small vessels were destroyed in the harbor itself , and four captured , at the cost of one man killed and one wounded . The people were left to fend for themselves for the winter . A visitor to the town reported that , a month later , there was " no lodging , eating or housekeeping in Falmouth " . 
 On October 26 , the town formed a committee to raise funds for the distressed families . More than 1 @,@ 000 people ( out an estimated population of 2 @,@ 500 ) , including at least 160 families , had been left homeless by the raid . The Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized £ 250 to be paid to the distressed families , and arranged for the distribution of up to 15 bushels of corn to those left destitute . As late as 1779 , additional grants were made to needy families in Falmouth . Despite numerous earlier entreaties to a wide variety of parties , significant recompense was not made until 1791 , when Congress granted two tracts of land as compensation . These tracts became the towns of New Portland and Freeman . The town of Falmouth accounted losses in the raid at over £ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 The citizens of Falmouth began rebuilding their town . In 1784 they built over 40 homes and 10 shops . By 1797 over 400 homes had been built , or rebuilt , along with factories , offices , and municipal buildings . Part of the Falmouth Neck was politically separated in 1786 to form the city of Portland . 
 = = = Political reaction = = = 
 News of the raid caused uproar in the colonies . <unk> emphasised its cruelty . The Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the issue of letters of marque , licensing privateer actions against the British navy . The Second Continental Congress heard of the event just as word arrived of King George 's Proclamation of Rebellion . Outraged by the news , Congress recommended that some provinces adopt self @-@ rule and that Royal Navy ships in South Carolina be seized . The attack on Falmouth stimulated Congress to advance its plans for establishment of a Continental Navy . It authorized the commissioning of two ships on October 30 " for the protection and defense of the united Colonies " . The Falmouth incident was again mentioned on November 25 , when Congress passed legislation described by John Adams as " the true origin of the American Navy " . 
 When news of the event first reached England , it was dismissed as rebel propaganda . When the reports were confirmed , Graves ' superior , Lord George Germain expressed surprise rather than offence , noting that " I am to suppose that Admiral Graves had good reason for the step he took " , in spite of orders ( not received by Graves until after Mowat had sailed for Falmouth ) to not take such acts unless the town clearly refused to do business with the British . Graves was relieved of his command in December 1775 , in part due to his failure to suppress the rebel naval forces . Germain issued the orders before Falmouth burned . 
 News of the event also reached France , which was carefully monitoring political developments in North America . The French foreign secretary wrote : " I can hardly believe this absurd as well as barbaric procedure on the part of an enlightened and civilized nation . " 
 Mowat 's career suffered as a result of his actions . He was repeatedly passed over for promotion , and achieved it only when he downplayed his role in the event , or omitted it entirely from his record . 
 = = Similar acts of reprisal = = 
 On August 30 , 1775 , Royal Naval Captain James Wallace , commanding HMS Rose , fired into the town of Stonington , Connecticut , after the townspeople there prevented Rose 's tender from capturing a vessel it had chased into the harbor . Apparently not seeking to burn the town , he did not fire any heated rounds or incendiaries . Wallace also fired on the town of Bristol , Rhode Island , in October 1775 , after its townspeople refused to deliver livestock to him .

 = Bring Us Together = 
 " Bring Us Together " was a political slogan popularized after the election of Republican candidate Richard Nixon as United States President in 1968 . The text was derived from a sign which 13 @-@ year @-@ old Vicki Lynne Cole stated that she carried at Nixon 's rally in her home town of Deshler , Ohio during the campaign . 
 Richard Moore , a friend of Nixon , told the candidate 's speechwriters he had seen a child carrying a sign reading " Bring Us Together " at the Deshler rally . The speechwriters , including William Safire , began inserting the phrase into the candidate 's speeches . Nixon mentioned the Deshler rally and the sign in his victory speech on November 6 , 1968 , adopting the phrase as representing his administration 's initial goal — to reunify the bitterly divided country . Cole came forward as the person who carried the sign , and was the subject of intense media attention . 
 Nixon invited Cole and her family to the inauguration , and she appeared on a float in the inaugural parade . The phrase " Bring Us Together " was used ironically by Democrats when Nixon proposed policies they disagreed with or refused to support . Cole declined to comment on Nixon 's 1974 resignation , but subsequently expressed her sympathy for him . In newspaper columns written in his final years before his 2009 death , Safire expressed doubts that Cole 's sign ever existed . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 1968 presidential campaign was one of the most bitterly fought in the nation 's history . Set among national divisions over the Vietnam War , social policy , and against the backdrop of riot and assassination , none of the campaigns made healing divisions a major theme — an early slogan by Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey , " United With Humphrey " had been scrapped . The incumbent President , Democrat Lyndon Baines Johnson ( often called <unk> ) could give Humphrey little support because of his own unpopularity . 
 By 1968 , candidates were appealing to the electorate through television , rather than through whistle @-@ stop train tours . Nixon had included them in his past national campaigns — he had broken off one such tour in 1952 to make the Checkers speech , and in 1960 , had stopped at Deshler . The rural Ohio village , about 45 miles ( 72 km ) southwest of Toledo , was popular among whistle @-@ stopping presidential candidates as two main lines of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad crossed there — other visitors in search of votes had included Al Smith , Harry Truman , and Barry Goldwater . Deshler voters would respond in 1968 by giving Nixon an overwhelming majority of their votes . 
 = = Rally and sign = = 
 Cole was an eighth grader in Deshler ; her father was the local Methodist minister while her mother taught third grade . On October 22 , 1968 , the day of Nixon 's stop in Deshler , Cole attended class as usual . During the morning session , one of her teachers announced that any girls interested in being " <unk> " ( girls asked to cheer and provide atmosphere at the rally ) should report to the fire station after school . Cole did so , along with her friend , Rita Bowman , and the girls were provided with paper red , white , and blue dresses ( to be worn over other clothing ) and signs . Cole 's said , " <unk> Convinced Us — Vote Republican " . 
 That afternoon , Cole attended the rally , wearing her dress and holding her sign . The Nixon train pulled in , and the police lowered the rope which kept the crowd clear of the tracks . In interviews , Cole related that as the crowd surged forward , she dropped her sign amidst the pushing and shoving . Cole stated , " I wanted a sign to wave . I had lost my own placard and as the crowd moved forward as the train approached I saw this sign lying in the street and I just picked it up and held it high , hoping Mr. Nixon would see it . " 
 Nixon gave a speech from the rear platform of the train . He praised the size of the crowd , stating , " There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960 . " The candidate asserted that though his opponent , Vice President Humphrey , claimed that Americans had never had it so good , he should tell that to the farmer . Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer 's advocate to the White House . He promised to restore order : " The most important civil right is the right to be free from [ local ] violence . " He noted the many youths in the crowd , stating , " Young Americans know their future is at stake . They don 't want four more years of the same . " He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio : " his roots are here and mine are too ! " As Nixon spoke , Cole observed him , and thought he was a good family man , looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to . She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate , who suggested the sign , " Bring Us Together Again " was about boys , not politics . She kept the dress , but told the media she threw away the sign .

 Nixon speechwriter William Safire had been told of the sign by a friend of Nixon , Richard Moore , who left the train at campaign stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use . Safire stated in his book on the early days of the Nixon administration ( originally published in 1975 ) that at Deshler , " Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with , some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick . " According to Safire in a 2007 column , Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon 's speechwriters and stated , " There 's a little kid out there with a hand @-@ lettered sign that I think says ' Bring Us Together ' . " Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon 's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop . 
 Nixon used the phrase in concluding a rally at New York 's Madison Square Garden on October 31 , 1968 . Recalling the visit to Deshler , the Republican candidate stated , " There were many signs like those I see here . But one sign held by a teenager said , ' Bring Us Together Again ' . My friends , America needs to be brought together . " However , Nixon 's use of the phrase received little coverage until after the election . Deshler school officials heard of the speech , and asked students about the sign , but no one came forward . 
 Safire included the incident in a draft victory statement , which Nixon looked at before addressing the nation as President @-@ elect . In his victory speech on November 6 , Nixon recalled the sign : 
 I saw many signs in this campaign , some of them were not friendly ; some were very friendly . But the one that touched me the most was one that I saw in Deshler , Ohio , at the end of a long day of whistle @-@ stopping . A little town . I suppose five times the population was there in the dusk . It was almost impossible to see , but a teenager held up a sign , " Bring Us Together . " And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset , to bring the American people together . 
 Reconciliation among the American people was also a theme of Humphrey 's concession statement . " I have done my best . I have lost , Mr. Nixon has won . The democratic process has worked its will , so now let 's get on with the urgent task of uniting our country . " 
 School officials again asked students about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech , and this time Cole came forward . She stated that she had not done so before as she had not written the sign . Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal 's office . Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again . Being interviewed by reporters from Washington , New York , and Chicago , she indicated , was more fun than sitting in history class . The Toledo Blade investigated the matter , but could not ascertain who made the sign , or what happened to it after Cole discarded it . John Baer , village chief of police , stated , " I think this has to be the most important thing that has ever happened around here . " Paul Scharf , editor of the Deshler Flag , stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign 's origin or fate would ever be cleared up . Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign . 
 As early as November 7 , the Northwest Signal , local paper for nearby Napoleon , Ohio , reported that Deshler merchants were considering taking up a collection to send Cole to Washington ; the following day the paper editorialized that she , along with whoever actually made the sign , be sent to Washington to see the inauguration . On November 19 , 1968 , campaign special assistant and longtime Nixon advisor Murray Chotiner proposed inviting the Cole family to the inauguration and having Vicki Cole ride the theme float . The President @-@ elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration ; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee . Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her sign on the theme float in the inaugural parade . 
 Carla Garrity , a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old girl from Burbank , California , objected to Cole 's invitation to the inauguration on the ground that Cole had done nothing to deserve it . In a letter to her congressman , Ed Reinecke , Garrity stated she had worked very hard for Nixon and other Republican candidates , " Therefore , I am very much against that 13 @-@ year old girl in Ohio who held up the sign ' Bring us Together ' being invited to the inaugural . She didn 't even read or write it ! " Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment , " I suspect that Carla 's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign " . Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke , stating , " Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign , or even because she made the sign , but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon " and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans . 
 = = Political usage and aftermath = = 
 The Inaugural Committee wanted to adopt " Bring Us Together " as the inaugural theme , appalling Safire , who said , " That wasn 't the theme of the campaign . " Safire and other aides felt the administration should seek to advance its agenda , rather than seeking consensus on policy , and White House Chief of Staff @-@ designate H. R. Haldeman was able to change the theme to " Forward Together . " Nevertheless , the phrase " Bring Us Together " was thrown in the face of the Nixon administration by Democrats each time something divisive was proposed , and was used as the title of a tell @-@ all expose by Leon Panetta after he was fired from the Nixon administration for dissenting from the White House 's " Southern strategy " on civil rights policy . According to Safire , the use of the phrase against Nixon shows a slogan which evokes emotion can cut both ways . 
 Nixon 's advisors denied he had abandoned a desire to bring the American people together . However , they were divided between those who sought national unity , and those , such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell , who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him , and should seek to win over the voters who had favored third @-@ party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace , as the key to reelection in 1972 . According to Safire , after taking office , Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together , but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies — they became known as the Silent Majority . Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon 's policies widened divisions in America , but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency — to reject Nixon and demand his removal . 
 In late 1970 , Vicki Cole indicated in an interview Nixon was doing the best he could . During the 1972 campaign , Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign . She then left politics , devoting her spare time to training and showing horses . In 1974 , Cole declined to comment on the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal , but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him , though she believed his resignation was necessary . 
 Safire , in his political dictionary published in 2008 , recollected that when he asked Moore , some years after the inauguration , whether he had really seen the girl holding the sign , or whether he had imagined it , " his eyes took on a faraway look " . In columns written in the final years before his 2009 death , Safire commented that the sign was " almost too good to be true " , and said of Moore , " [ h ] e may have made that up " . 
 = Second Persian invasion of Greece = 
 The second Persian invasion of Greece ( 480 – 479 BC ) occurred during the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , as King Xerxes I of Persia sought to conquer all of Greece . The invasion was a direct , if delayed , response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece ( 492 – 490 BC ) at the Battle of Marathon , which ended Darius I 's attempts to subjugate Greece . After Darius 's death , his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion , mustering an enormous army and navy . The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance . About a tenth of the Greek city @-@ states joined the ' Allied ' effort ; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes . 
 The invasion began in spring 480 BC , when the Persian army crossed the Hellespont and marched through Thrace and Macedon to Thessaly . The Persian advance was blocked at the pass of Thermopylae by a small Allied force under King Leonidas I of Sparta ; simultaneously , the Persian fleet was blocked by an Allied fleet at the straits of Artemisium . At the famous Battle of Thermopylae , the Allied army held back the Persian army for seven days , before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the Allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated . The Allied fleet had also withstood two days of Persian attacks at the Battle of Artemisium , but when news reached them of the disaster at Thermopylae , they withdrew to Salamis . 
 After Thermopylae , all of Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persian army , which captured and burnt Athens . However , a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth , protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest . Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter the course of the war . The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis , where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised , and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet . The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion , and fearing becoming trapped in Europe , Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army . 
 The following spring , the Allies assembled the largest ever hoplite army , and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius . At the ensuing Battle of Plataea , the Greek infantry again proved its superiority , inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process . On the same day , across the Aegean Sea an Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale . With this double defeat , the invasion was ended , and Persian power in the Aegean severely dented . The Greeks would now move to the offensive , eventually expelling the Persians from Europe , the Aegean islands and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC 
 = = Background = = 
 The Greek city @-@ states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499 – 494 BC . The Persian Empire was still relatively young , and prone to revolts among its subject peoples . Moreover , Darius was a usurper , and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule . The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire , and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved ( especially those not already part of the empire ) . Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece . A preliminary expedition under Mardonius , in 492 BC , to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re @-@ conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate kingdom part of Persia . It had previously been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC , but remained having autonomy and not fully subordinate yet . 
 In 491 BC , Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city @-@ states , asking for a gift of ' earth and water ' in token of their submission to him . Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year , the majority of Greek cities duly obliged . In Athens , however , the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed ; in Sparta , they were simply thrown down a well . This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia . 
 Darius thus put together an ambitious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC , which attacked Naxos , before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands . The task force then moved on Eretria , which it besieged and destroyed . Finally , it moved to attack Athens , landing at the bay of Marathon , where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army . At the ensuing Battle of Marathon , the Athenians won a remarkable victory , which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia . 
 Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece ; however , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition . Darius then died while preparing to march on Egypt , and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt , and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece . 
 = = Persian preparations = = 
 Since this was to be a full @-@ scale invasion , it required long @-@ term planning , stock @-@ piling and conscription . It was decided that Xerxes ' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe , and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos ( rounding which headland , a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC ) . These were both feats of exceptional ambition , which would have been beyond any contemporary state . However , the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia . 
 In 481 BC , after roughly four years of preparation , Xerxes began to muster the troops for the invasion of Europe . Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted . The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor in the summer and autumn of 481 BC . The armies from the Eastern satrapies was gathered in <unk> , Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter . Early in spring it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies . Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe , crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges . 
 = = = Size of the Persian forces = = = 
 = = = = Army = = = = 
 The numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute , because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed . Herodotus claimed that there were , in total , 2 @.@ 5 million military personnel , accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel . The poet Simonides , who was a contemporary , talks of four million ; Ctesias , based on Persian records , gave 800 @,@ 000 as the total number of the army ( without the support personnel ) that was assembled by Xerxes . While it has been suggested that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition , modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems , their logistical capabilities , the Greek countryside , and supplies available along the army 's route . 
 Modern scholars thus generally attribute the numbers given in the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors , or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war . The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300 @,@ 000 – 500 @,@ 000 . Nevertheless , whatever the real numbers were , it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea , and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease , never returning to Asia . 
 Herodotus tells us that the army and navy , while moving through Thrace , was halted at Doriskos for an inspection by Xerxes , and he recounts the numbers of troops found to be present : 
 Herodotus doubles this number to account for support personnel and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5 @,@ 283 @,@ 220 men . Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers . The poet Simonides , who was a near @-@ contemporary , talks of four million ; Ctesias gave 800 @,@ 000 as the total number of the army that assembled in Doriskos . 
 An early and very influential modern historian , George Grote , set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus : " To admit this overwhelming total , or anything near to it , is obviously impossible . " Grote 's main objection is the supply problem , though he does not analyse the problem in detail . He did not reject Herodotus 's account altogether , citing the latter 's reporting of the Persians ' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years , but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources . A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army , first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice ( a British transport officer ) is the supply of water . Maurice suggested in the region of 200 @,@ 000 men and 70 @,@ 000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece . He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for <unk> ( 1 @,@ 000 ) and <unk> ( 10 @,@ 000 ) , leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten . Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100 @,@ 000 soldiers or less , based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients . 
 Munro and Macan note Herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 <unk> ( leaders of a <unk> , the basic unit of the Persian infantry , which numbered about 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong ) ; this would give a land force of roughly 300 @,@ 000 men . Other proponents of larger numbers suggest figures from 250 @,@ 000 to 700 @,@ 000 . One historian , Kampouris , even accepts as realistic Herodotus ' 1 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 for the infantry plus 80 @,@ 000 cavalry ( including support ) for various reasons including the size of the area from which the army was drafted ( from modern @-@ day Libya to Pakistan ) , the ratios of land troops to fleet troops , of infantry to cavalry and Persian troops to Greek troops . 
 = = = = Fleet = = = = 
 The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed , though perhaps less so . According to Herodotus the Persian fleet numbered 1 @,@ 207 triremes and 3 @,@ 000 transport and supply ships , including 50 @-@ oared galleys ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . Herodotus gives a detailed breakdown of the Persian triremes : 
 Herodotus also records that this was the number at the Battle of Salamis , despite the losses earlier in storms off Sepia and Euboea , and at the battle of Artemisium . He claims that the losses were replenished with reinforcements , though he only records 120 triremes from the Greeks of Thrace and an unspecified number of ships from the Greek islands . Aeschylus , who fought at Salamis , also claims that he faced 1 @,@ 207 warships there , of which 1 @,@ 000 were triremes and 207 fast ships . Diodorus and Lysias independently claim there were 1 @,@ 200 at Doriskos . The number of 1 @,@ 207 ( for the outset only ) is also given by Ephorus , while his teacher Isocrates claims there were 1 @,@ 300 at Doriskos and 1 @,@ 200 at Salamis . Ctesias gives another number , 1 @,@ 000 ships , while Plato , speaking in general terms refers to 1 @,@ 000 ships and more . 
 These numbers are ( by ancient standards ) consistent , and this could be interpreted that a number around 1 @,@ 200 is correct . Among modern scholars some have accepted this number , although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis . Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number , 1 @,@ 207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean . 
 = = Greek preparations = = 
 The Athenians had been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid @-@ 480s BC , and in 482 BC the decision was taken , under the guidance of the politician Themistocles , to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians . The Athenians did not have the man @-@ power to fight on land and sea ; therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of several Greek city states . In 481 BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water , but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta . Support thus began to coalesce around these two states . 
 = = = Hellenic alliance = = = 
 A congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC , and a confederate alliance of Greek city @-@ states was formed . This confederation had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation . Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them " οἱ Ἕλληνες " ( the Greeks ) and " the Greeks who had sworn alliance " ( Godley translation ) or " the Greeks who had banded themselves together " ( Rawlinson translation ) . Hereafter , they will be referred to as the ' Allies ' . Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy . Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings . Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives . Nevertheless , this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world , especially since many of the city @-@ states in attendance were still technically at war with each other . 
 The majority of other city @-@ states remained more @-@ or @-@ less neutral , awaiting the outcome of the confrontation . Thebes was a major absentee , and was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived . Not all Thebans agreed with this policy , and 400 " loyalist " hoplites joined the Allied force at Thermopylae ( at least according to one possible interpretation ) . The most notable city actively siding with the Persians ( " <unk> " ) was Argos , in the otherwise Spartan @-@ dominated Peloponnese . However , the Argives had been severely weakened in 494 BC , when a Spartan @-@ force led by Cleomenes I had annihilated the Argive army in Battle of <unk> and then massacred the fugitives . 
 = = = Size of allied forces = = = 
 The allies had no ' standing army ' , nor was there any requirement to form one ; since they were fighting on home territory , they could muster armies as and when required . Different @-@ sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign . These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle . 
 = = Spring 480 BC : Thrace , Macedonia and Thessaly = = 
 Having crossed into Europe in April 480 BC , the Persian army began its march to Greece . Five major food depots had been set up along the path : at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont , at <unk> in <unk> territory , at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies , at Eion on the Strymon river , and at Therme , modern @-@ day Thessaloniki . There , food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign . Animals had been bought and fattened , while the local populations had , for several months , been ordered to grind the grains into flour . The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme , a journey of about 360 miles ( 600 km ) . It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet . Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march . 
 The Allied ' congress ' met again in the spring of 480 BC . A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe , on the borders of Thessaly , and thereby block Xerxes 's advance . A force of 10 @,@ 000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch <unk> and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass . However , once there , they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes , and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming ; the Allies therefore retreated . Shortly afterwards , they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont . The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians , as did many cities to the north of the pass of Thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming . 
 A second strategy was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles . The route to southern Greece ( Boeotia , Attica and the Peloponnesus ) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae . This could easily be blocked by the Allies , despite the overwhelming number of Persians . Furthermore , to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea , the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium . This dual strategy was adopted by the congress . However , the Peloponnesian cities made fall @-@ back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it , while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen . 
 = = August 480 BC : Thermopylae and Artemisium = = 
 When the Allies received the news that Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus , and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae , it was both the period of truce that accompanied the Olympic games , and the Spartan festival of Carneia , during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious . Nevertheless , the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard ( the Hippeis ) of 300 men ( in this case , the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons ) . Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta , and other forces that were picked up en route to Thermopylae . The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass , rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass , and waited for Xerxes 's arrival . 
 When the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid @-@ August , they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse . When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass , he sent his troops to attack . However , the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare , the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on . The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them . However , at the end of the second day , they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines to Xerxes . Xerxes then sent his elite guards , the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied . When he was made aware of this maneuver ( while the Immortals were still en route ) , Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army , remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans , 700 Thespians , 400 <unk> and perhaps a few hundred others . On the third day of the battle , the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could . Ultimately , however , the Allied rearguard was annihilated , and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians . 
 Simultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae , an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians . Directly before Artemisium , the Persian fleet had been caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia , losing many ships , but could still probably muster over 800 ships at the start of the battle . On the first day ( also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae ) , the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships , which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea . These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet . Meanwhile , the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon , the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels . That evening , another storm occurred , wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea . 
 On the second day of the battle , news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened ; they therefore resolved to maintain their position . They staged a hit @-@ and @-@ run attack on some Cilician ships , capturing and destroying them . On the third day , however , the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force . In a day of savage fighting , the Allies held on to their position , but suffered severe losses ( half the Athenian fleet was damaged ) ; nevertheless , the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet . That evening , the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae . Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged , and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae , they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis . 
 = = September 480 BC : Salamis = = 
 Victory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes ; the two cities that had resisted him , Thespiae and Plataea , were captured and razed . Attica was also left open to invasion , and the remaining population of Athens was thus evacuated , with the aid of the Allied fleet , to Salamis . The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth , building a wall , and demolishing the road from Megara , thereby abandoning Athens to the Persians . Athens thus fell ; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated , and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be torched . 
 The Persians had now captured most of Greece , but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance from the Greeks ; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible ; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely , and probably Xerxes did not wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long . Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success ; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus , there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land . However , if the isthmus 's defensive line could be outflanked , the Allies could be defeated . Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy , and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy . In summary , if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy , he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender ; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season . Conversely by avoiding destruction , or as Themistocles hoped , by destroying the Persian fleet , the Greeks could avoid conquest . In the final reckoning , both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle , in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war . 
 Thus it was that the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis into September , despite the imminent arrival of the Persians . Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army , the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis , trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle . Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles , the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis . There , the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance , as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised . Seizing the opportunity , the Greek fleet attacked , and scored a decisive victory , sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships , and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked . 
 According to Herodotus , after this loss Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the straits to attack Salamis ( although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle ) . In any case this project was soon abandoned . With the Persians ' naval superiority removed , Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges . According to Herodotus , Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand @-@ picked group of troops , while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with the bulk of the army . All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica , with Mardonius over @-@ wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly . The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt @-@ out city for the winter . 
 = = Autumn / winter 480 / 479 BC = = 
 = = = Siege of Potidaea = = = 
 Herodotus tells us that a Persian general , Artabazus , having escorted Xerxes to the Hellespont with 60 @,@ 000 men , began the return journey to Mardonius in Thessaly . However , as he neared Pallene , 
 " he thought it right that he should enslave the people of Potidaea , whom he found in revolt . " 
 Despite attempts to capture the city by treachery , the Persians were forced to keep up the siege for three months . Then , attempting to use an unusually low tide to attack the town from sea , the Persian army was caught by the returning tide , many drowning and the survivors being attacked by the <unk> in boats . Artabazus was thus forced to lift the siege , and return to Mardonius with the remnants of his men . 
 = = = Siege of Olynthus = = = 
 While besieging Potidea , Artabazus also decided to besiege Olynthus , which was also in revolt . The town was held by the <unk> tribe , who had been driven out of Macedon . Having taken the town , he massacred the defenders , and handed over the town to the Chalcidian people . 
 = = June 479 BC : Plataea and Mycale = = 
 Over the winter , there seems to have been some tension between the Allies . In particular , the Athenians , who were not protected by the isthmus , but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus , felt hard done by . They demanded an Allied army march north the following year . When the other Allies failed to commit to this , the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring . The navy , now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides , thus skulked off Delos , while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos , both sides unwilling to risk battle . Similarly , Mardonius remained in Thessaly , knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless , while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus . 
 Mardonius moved to break the stalemate , by offering peace , self @-@ government and territorial expansion to the Athenians ( with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces ) , using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary . The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer , but rejected it . Athens was thus evacuated again , and the Persians marched south and re @-@ took possession of it . Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis . Athens , along with Megara and Plataea , sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance , and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not . The Spartans , who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus , delayed making a decision for 10 days . However , when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans , they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians . 
 When Mardonius heard that the Allied army was on the march , he retreated into Boeotia , near Plataea , trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry . The Allied army however , under the command of the Spartan regent Pausanias , stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics . Mardonius ordered a hit @-@ and @-@ run cavalry attack on the Greek lines , but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed . The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp , still on high ground . As a result , the Allied lines of communication were exposed . The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies . The Allied position now undermined , Pausanias ordered a night @-@ time retreat towards their original positions . This went awry , leaving the Athenians , and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills , with the other contingents scattered further away , near Plataea itself . Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack , Mardonius ordered his whole army forward . However , as at Thermopylae , the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites , and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius 's bodyguard and killed him . The Persian force thus dissolved in rout ; 40 @,@ 000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly , but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies , thus finalising their victory . 
 On the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea , Herodotus tells us that rumour of the Allied victory reached the Allied navy , at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia . Their morale boosted , the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day , destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet . As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus , the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up with the rest of the Allied fleet . The fleet , now able to match the Persians , had first sailed to Samos , where the Persian fleet was based . The Persians , whose ships were in a poor state of repair , had decided not to risk fighting , and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale . An army of 60 @,@ 000 men had been left there by Xerxes , and the fleet joined with them , building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships . However , Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet 's marines . Seeing the small size of the Allied force , the Persians emerged from the camp , but the hoplites again proved superior , and destroyed much of the Persian force . The ships were abandoned to the Allies , who burnt them , crippling Xerxes ' sea power , and marking the ascendancy of the Allied fleet . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale , the second Persian invasion of Greece was over . Moreover , the threat of future invasion was abated ; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again , over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished . 
 In many ways Mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict , the Greek counterattack . After the victory at Mycale , the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges , but found that this was already done . The Peloponnesians sailed home , but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos , still held by the Persians . The Persians in the region , and their allies made for Sestos , the strongest town in the region , which the Athenians then laid siege to ; after a protracted siege , it fell to the Athenians . Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos . Over the next 30 years , the Greeks , primarily the Athenian @-@ dominated Delian League , would expel the Persians from Macedon , Thrace , the Aegean islands and Ionia . Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias , finally ending the half @-@ century of warfare . 
 = = Tactical analysis = = 
 The Greek style of warfare had been honed over the preceding centuries . It revolved around the hoplite , members of the middle @-@ classes ( the zeugites ) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner . The hoplite was , by the standards of the time , heavily armoured , with a breastplate ( originally bronze , but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version ) , greaves , a full helmet , and a large round shield ( the aspis ) . Hoplites were armed with a long spear ( the <unk> ) , which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears , and a sword ( the <unk> ) . Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation ; the exact details are not completely clear , but it was a close @-@ knit formation , presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields , and spears , to the enemy . Properly assembled , the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon ; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened , it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx . The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry , if caught on the wrong terrain , however . The hoplite 's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers . Even if the shield did not stop a missile , there was a reasonable chance the armour would . 
 The Persian infantry used in the invasion were a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire . However , according to Herodotus , there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting . The troops were , generally speaking , armed with a bow , ' short spear ' and sword , carried a wicker shield , and wore at most a leather jerkin . The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops , who may have worn a corslet of scaled armour . Some of the contingents may have been armed somewhat differently ; for instance , the Saka were renowned axemen . The ' elite ' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians , Medians , Cissians and the Saka . The foremost of the infantry were the royal guards , the Immortals , although they were still armed in the aforementioned style . Cavalry was provided by the Persians , <unk> , Medes , Cissians and Saka ; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry . The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy , using their bows ( or equivalent ) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword . 
 The Persians had encountered hoplites in battle before at Ephesus , where their cavalry had easily routed the ( probably exhausted ) Greeks . However , at the battle of Marathon , the Athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the Persian infantry , albeit in the absence of any cavalry . It is therefore slightly surprising that the Persians did not bring any hoplites from the Greek regions , especially Ionia , under their control in Asia . Equally , Herodotus tells us that the Egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed , and performed well against the Greek marines ; yet no Egyptian contingent served in the army . The Persians may not have completely trusted the Ionians and Egyptians , since both had recently revolted against Persian rule . However , if this is the case , then it must be questioned why there were Greek and Egyptian contingents in the navy . The Allies evidently tried to play on the Persian fears about the reliability of the Ionians in Persian service ; but , as far as we can tell , both the Ionians and Egyptians performed particularly well for the Persian navy . It may therefore simply be that neither the Ionians nor Egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet — none of the coastal regions of the Persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army . 
 In the two major land battles of the invasion , the Allies clearly adjusted their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry , by occupying the pass at Thermopylae , and by staying on high ground at Plataea . At Thermopylae , until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed , the Persians <unk> failed to adjust their tactics to the situation , although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options . At Plataea , the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic , forcing the precipitous ( and nearly disastrous ) retreat ; however , Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry , which resulted in the Persian defeat . The events at Mycale reveal a similar story ; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites , with disastrous results . It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco @-@ Persian wars . However , as simple as the Greek tactics were , they played to their strengths ; the Persians however , may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite , and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat . 
 = = Strategic analysis = = 
 At the beginning of the invasion , it is clear that the Persians held most advantages . Regardless of its actual size , it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece . The Persians had a unified command system , and everyone was answerable to the king . They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy , which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning . The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established . Furthermore , the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare , as shown by their ( nearly successful ) attempts to divide @-@ and @-@ conquer the Greeks . The Greeks , by comparison , were fragmented , with only 30 or so city @-@ states actively opposing the Persian invasion ; even those were prone to quarrel with each other . They had little experience of large @-@ scale warfare , being largely restricted to small @-@ scale local warfare , and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing , rather than because of any experience or expertise . As Lazenby therefore asks : " So why did the Persians fail ? " 
 The Persian strategy for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force . The cities in any territory that the army passed through would be forced to submit or risk destruction ; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian , Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced . Conversely , the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible , and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible . Beyond this , the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians ' overwhelming numbers , they had little chance in open battle , and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle @-@ necks , where the Persian numbers would count for less . The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context . Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly . After they realised that they could not defend this position , they chose the next @-@ most northerly position , the Thermopylae / Artemisium axis . The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective ; however , the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy , and led to defeat . At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes , but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained , and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant . Thus far , the Persian strategy had succeeded , while the Allied strategy , though not a disaster , had failed . 
 The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies changed the nature of the war . The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land , realising they probably could not breach it . This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one . Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign ; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis . However , as successful as this was , there was no need for the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war ; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident , or overeager to finish the campaign . Thus , the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder . After Salamis , the Persian strategy changed . Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance . In particular , he sought to win over the Athenians , which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus . Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle , his actions in the run @-@ up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this . He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms , but he waited either for the Allies to attack , or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously . The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess ; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance , and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win . It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms . Mardonius may have been overeager for victory ; there was no need to attack the Allies , and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength , combat in the melee . The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake . 
 Thus , the Persian failure may be seen partly as a result of two strategic mistakes that handed the Allies tactical advantages , and resulted in decisive defeats for the Persians . The Allied success is often seen as the result of " free men fighting for their freedom " . This may have played a part , and certainly the Greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms . One crucial factor in the Allied success was that , having formed an alliance , however fractious , they remained true to it , despite the odds . There appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt , but ultimately it withstood ; and while this alone did not defeat the Persians , it meant that even after the occupation of most of Greece , the Allies were not themselves defeated . This is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of Athens , Thespiae and Plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the Persians . Ultimately , the Allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats , stuck to their alliance , took advantage of Persian mistakes , and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage ( perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict ) , which , at Plataea , allowed them to destroy the Persian invasion force . 
 = = Significance = = 
 The second Persian invasion of Greece was an event of major significance in European history . A large number of historians hold that , had Greece been conquered , the Ancient Greek culture that lies at the basis of Western civilization would have never developed ( and by extension Western civilization itself ) . While this may be an exaggeration ( it is obviously impossible to know ) , it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened . 
 Militarily , there was not much in the way of tactical or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion , one commentator suggesting it was something of " a soldier 's war " ( i.e. , it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war ) . Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a force multiplier , while Themistocles 's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare . The major lesson of the invasion , reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon , was the superiority of the hoplite in close @-@ quarters fighting over the more @-@ lightly armed Persian infantry . Taking on this lesson , the Persian empire would later , after the Peloponnesian War , start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries .

 Another Green World is the third studio album by English musician Brian Eno , released by Island Records in September 1975 . Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies , it featured contributions from several guest musicians including Robert Fripp , Phil Collins , and John Cale . The album marked a transition from the rock @-@ based music of Eno 's previous releases toward the minimalist sensibility of his late ' 70s ambient work . Employing tactics derived from his Oblique Strategies cards for guidance , the album utilized a variety of unconventional recording techniques and instrumental approaches , and made use of fewer lyrics . 
 Though the album failed to chart in the United States or the United Kingdom , Another Green World was initially met with high praise from critics . Contemporary reception of Another Green World has been very positive ; several critics and publications have placed the album on lists of the top albums of all time . 
 = = Production = = 
 Another Green World was recorded at Island Studios in London during the months of July and August 1975 . Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand . For the first four days in the studio , Eno failed to be productive . To look for new ideas , Eno turned to his instructional cards , the Oblique Strategies , and began coming up with new ideas as he did with his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) . 
 Some of the album credits for the instruments have fanciful names that describe the sound they make . The " <unk> Guitars " are electric guitars played with mallets and are electronically treated to sound something like castanets . The " Leslie piano " is an acoustic piano miked and fed through a Leslie speaker with a built @-@ in revolving horn speaker . Eno described the " snake guitar " and " digital guitar " by stating " the kind of lines I was playing reminded me of the way a snake moves through the brush , a sort of speedy , forceful , liquid quality . Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound . " 
 Like his previous two solo efforts , Eno had several guest musicians contributing to Another Green World . Unlike his previous albums , Eno worked on more solo material . Seven songs on the album have Eno playing all the instruments himself , including electronic and <unk> keyboards , guitars , and percussion . Among the guest musicians was Phil Collins , who played drums on Tiger Mountain and got along with Eno , which led to calling him and fellow Brand X bandmate Percy Jones to play on Another Green World . On recording the album , Collins recalled : 
 [ Eno ] gave us all a bit of paper , and we made lists from one to 15 . Eno said ' No. 2 , we all play a G ; No. 7 we all play a C sharp ' ; an so on . So it was like painting by numbers ... [ Eno ] used to love me and Percy ; we 'd go in and run through our dictionary licks and he 'd record them and make a loop of them . 
 Robert Fripp , who worked with Eno on ( No <unk> ) and Here Come the Warm Jets , performed the solo on " St. Elmo 's Fire " . Eno asked Fripp to improvise a lightning @-@ fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a Wimshurst high voltage generator . This was the basis for Eno crediting Fripp 's solo on this track as " Wimshurst Guitar " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Another Green World represents a turning point in Eno 's musical career . While his previous albums contained quirky rock songs , only five of the fourteen tracks on the album have lyrics . Music critic Jim DeRogatis called it an " ambient / art @-@ pop " album . According to eMusic 's Richard Gehr , the album 's music veers from the guitar @-@ oriented experimental rock of Eno 's 1974 albums Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) to the synth @-@ oriented ambient minimalism of his subsequent work . Its minimalist instrumentals are scattered among more structured art @-@ rock songs . According to AllMusic 's Steve Huey , most of the album has " paced instrumentals that , while often closer to ambient music than pop , are both melodic and rhythmic " , and are accompanied by few pop songs , including " St. Elmo 's Fire " , " I 'll Come Running " , and " Golden Hours " . The instrumental tracks explore a new kind of sound that is more quiet and restful , marking the change between Eno 's earlier rock songs and his later instrumental works in which texture and timbre are the most important musical elements . 
 " Sky Saw " opens the album with the instruments constantly changing structure , except for one of the two bass parts which plays the same pattern throughout . Eno has re @-@ used differently mixed instrumentations of " Sky Saw " for a track for Music for Films and a song for Ultravox 's debut album which he would later produce . " Over Fire Island " has a jazz influence on the bass and drumming style . " In Dark Trees " and " The Big Ship " are two songs on which Eno plays all the instruments , namely the synthesiser , synthetic percussion and treated rhythm generator . The pulse of these songs is provided by the repeated rhythm coming from the rhythm box . These instrumental pieces and others like " Little Fishes " have been described as " highly imagistic , like paintings done in sound that actually resemble their titles " . 
 To create the lyrics , Eno would later play the backing tracks singing nonsense syllables to himself , then taking them and forming them into actual words , phrases and meaning . This lyric @-@ writing method was used for all his vocal @-@ based recordings of the 1970s . The tracks that do feature lyrics are in the same free @-@ associative style as Eno 's previous albums . The humour in the lyrics has been described as " less bizarre than gently whimsical and addled " . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Another Green World was released in September 1975 and did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States . The album 's reception was for the most part very favourable . Henry Edwards of High Fidelity wrote positively of the album , claiming it to be Eno 's " most accessible to date " . Tom Hull of The Village Voice felt that , although it " wouldn 't be fair to say that Another Green World is Eno 's best album , " the album is definitely " his easiest to love . " Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a " major triumph " that Eno 's creative risks " so consistently pan out " , and said that it is " indeed an important record — and also a brilliant one " . Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno 's previous albums . Jon Pareles , writing in Crawdaddy ! , found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno 's previous progressive rock songs and remarked , " This ain 't no Eno record . I don 't care what the credits say . It doesn 't even get on my nerves . " Lester Bangs of The Village Voice was lulled by much of the music and said that " those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden " . Robert Christgau , who originally gave the album an " A – " in his review for The Village Voice , admitted that he resisted the album at first , but ultimately grew to " love every minute of this arty little collection of static ( i.e. , non @-@ swinging ) synthesizer pieces ( with vocals , percussion , and guitar ) . " He felt that its 13 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole , and called the album " the aural equivalent of a park on the moon — oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity . " In 1977 , Another Green World was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in the Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . Christgau , the poll 's creator , ranked it second on his own list for the poll . 
 In 2004 , Virgin Records began reissuing Eno 's albums in remastered digipaks . Modern reception of Another Green World has been more unanimously positive . Steve Huey of AllMusic called the album " a universally acknowledged masterpiece " and " the perfect introduction to his achievements even for those who find ambient music difficult to enjoy . " Chris Ott of Pitchfork Media hailed it as one of Eno 's most important albums , and Q magazine wrote that it was " breathtakingly ahead of its time " . J. D. Considine , writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , said that Eno used the recording studio for the album " as an instrument , molding directed improvisations , electronic effects , and old @-@ fashioned songcraft into perfectly balanced aural ecosystems " . In his review for Blender , Douglas Wolk said that the audio clarity of the remastered edition " makes it easier to pay attention to every [ song 's ] subtle complexities . " The album has made several top albums lists . Pitchfork placed the album at number ten on its list of greatest albums of the 1970s . In 2012 , Rolling Stone ranked the album number 429 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 2003 , Blender placed the album on its list of " 500 CDs You Must Own : Alternative Rock " , stating that the album is " Experimental yet accessible , it ’ s exactly the kind of album that Eno devotees long for from him today " . The album also ranked at number 36 in NME 's list of the greatest albums of the seventies . The title track was used as the theme music for BBC Two television 's arts series Arena . 
 The album was included in Robert Dimery 's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 = HMS Dreadnought ( 1875 ) = 
 HMS Dreadnought was an ironclad turret ship built for the Royal Navy during the 1870s . Construction was halted less than a year after it began and she was redesigned to improve her stability and buoyancy . Upon completion in 1879 , the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1884 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet . Upon her return 10 years later , she became a coast guard ship in Ireland for two years . The ship then became a depot ship in 1897 before she was reclassified as a second @-@ class battleship in 1900 . Dreadnought participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres for the next two years before she became a training ship in 1902 . The ship was taken out of service three years later and sold for scrap in 1908 . 
 = = Background and design = = 
 Dreadnought was originally named Fury and was designed by the Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , Sir Edward Reed , as an improved and enlarged version of the preceding Devastation @-@ class ironclad turret ships . The ship was laid down , fully framed and partially plated up to the bottom of the waterline belt armour when work was ordered stopped in 1871 in light of the loss of the ironclad turret ship Captain in a heavy storm the previous year . A Committee on Designs was formed in January 1871 to evaluate existing ship designs with special consideration as to their stability and buoyancy and found that the designs of Devastation and Fury were lacking in both qualities and needed to be modified . Reed had resigned before Captain was lost and he vehemently opposed the changes made by the new DNC , Nathaniel Barnaby and his assistant , William White , himself a future DNC . 
 The main changes were to increase the beam by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) and widen Reed 's armoured breastwork to cover the full width of the hull ; this increased the ship 's freeboard amidships which improved buoyancy and stability and provided additional , badly needed accommodation for the crew . In addition , the maximum thickness of the armour was increased from 12 to 14 inches ( 305 to 356 mm ) , it was extended all the way to the bow and reinforced the ram . Barnaby and White 's initial plan was to extend the breastwork fore and aft , almost to the ends of the ship , but this was changed to run all the way to the ends after the results of Devastation 's sea trials in 1873 – 74 revealed that her low bow caused major problems in head seas . Other changes was the substitution of more economical inverted vertical compound @-@ expansion steam engines for Reed 's original horizontal , low @-@ pressure engines , more powerful 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 320 mm ) guns for the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) ones first chosen , and the fitting of hydraulic pumps to work the gun turrets . 
 = = Description = = 
 Dreadnought had a length between perpendiculars of 320 feet ( 97 @.@ 5 m ) and was 343 feet ( 104 @.@ 5 m ) long overall , some 35 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) longer than the Devastation class . She had a beam of 63 feet 10 inches ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) , and a draught of 26 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 1 m ) . The ship displaced 10 @,@ 886 long tons ( 11 @,@ 061 t ) . Dreadnought was the first ship to have a longitudinal watertight bulkhead that divided the engine and boiler rooms down the centreline . Her crew consisted of 369 officers and ratings . She proved to be a very steady ship with minimal rolling , although she was very wet as high seas usually swept her deck from end to end . 
 The ship was the first large ironclad to have two 3 @-@ cylinder inverted vertical compound @-@ expansion steam engines . These were built by Humphry & Tennant and each drove a single four @-@ bladed , 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) propeller . Dreadnought 's engines were powered by a dozen cylindrical boilers with a working pressure of 60 psi ( 414 kPa ; 4 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines were designed to produce a total of 8 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 000 kW ) for a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) , this was 2 @,@ 400 ihp ( 1 @,@ 800 kW ) more and 1 @.@ 5 knots ( 2 @.@ 8 km / h ; 1 @.@ 7 mph ) faster than the Devastation class . Dreadnought reached a maximum speed of 14 @.@ 5 knots ( 26 @.@ 9 km / h ; 16 @.@ 7 mph ) from 8 @,@ 216 ihp ( 6 @,@ 127 kW ) during her sea trials . The ship carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 800 long tons ( 1 @,@ 829 t ) of coal , enough to steam 5 @,@ 650 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 460 km ; 6 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Dreadnought was originally intended to be equipped with a pair of RML 12 @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns in each turret , but these were replaced by RML 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns while the ship was being redesigned . The shell of the 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun weighed 809 pounds ( 367 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 38 long tons ( 39 t ) . The shell had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 575 ft / s ( 480 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 18 @.@ 4 inches ( 470 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The gun turrets were rotated by steam power and loaded by hydraulic power . 
 The ship had a complete wrought iron , waterline armour belt that was 14 inches ( 356 mm ) thick amidships and tapered to 8 inches ( 203 mm ) outside the armoured citadel towards the ends of the ship . The armour plates were tapered to a thickness of 8 inches at their bottom edge and they extended 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) above the waterline and 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) below it . The 184 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 56 @.@ 1 m ) armoured citadel protected the bases of the gun turrets , the funnel uptakes and the crew 's quarters . The sides of the citadel were 11 to 14 inches ( 279 to 356 mm ) thick and it had 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) thick curved ends . The turrets were protected by two 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) plates , each backed by wood . The aft 13 @-@ inch bulkhead of the original design was retained , but the forward one was made redundant by the forward extension of the belt . The conning tower ranged in thickness from 14 to 6 inches ( 356 to 152 mm ) and the upper deck was 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick inside the citadel and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) outside . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Dreadnought , the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy , was laid down on 10 September 1870 at No. 2 Slip , Pembroke Dockyard , Wales with the name of Fury . Construction was subsequently halted for a time in 1871 to redesign the ship and she was renamed Dreadnought on 1 February 1875 . The renamed ship was launched on 8 March by Mrs. Agnes Wood , daughter of William Courtenay , 11th Earl of Devon . She was completed on 15 February 1879 at a cost of £ 619 @,@ 739 . 
 The ship was then immediately placed in reserve until 1884 when she was commissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet . Dreadnought was fitted with ten 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck when she was commissioned . The ship sailed for the Mediterranean Sea on 14 October and remained there for the next decade . The future King George V served aboard in 1886 – 88 . She returned to British waters in September 1894 and began a refit at Chatham Dockyard that included the replacement of her Nordenfelt guns with six quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 6 @-@ pounder ( 2 @.@ 2 in ( 57 mm ) ) and ten QF 3 @-@ pounder ( 1 @.@ 5 in ( 37 mm ) ) Hotchkiss guns . Dreadnought became a coast guard ship at Bantry Bay , Ireland in March 1895 . 
 Two years later , in March 1897 , she was relieved of that duty and became a depot ship in July at Devonport . The ship was reboilered and had more QF guns installed in 1898 . Dreadnought was reclassified as a second @-@ class battleship in 1900 and took part in British fleet manoeuvres in that year and the following one . In June 1902 , she was refitted at Chatham to serve as a tender to HMS Defiance , torpedo school ship at Devonport , and later as a depot ship . She was taken out of service and transferred to the Kyles of Bute in 1905 . The ship was sold to T. Wards for scrap for £ 23 @,@ 000 on 14 July 1908 and was broken up by February 1909 .

 William " Billy " Purdon Geen ( 14 March 1891 – 31 July 1915 ) was a rugby union wing and centre , who represented Wales , and played club rugby for Oxford University and Newport and county rugby for Monmouthshire . He was also invited to play for the Barbarians on several occasions . Geen unsuccessfully trialled for England in 1910 , but was selected and played for Wales on three occasions in the 1912 – 1913 season . Injury prevented him from playing more internationals , and his service in the First World War put an end to his career . 
 Geen excelled athletically at Oxford , earning four Blues between 1910 and 1913 . However , in three successive Varsity Matches , he failed to score after dropping the ball over the tryline . In the holidays , he played club rugby for Newport , and he was part of the team that defeated the touring South African side of 1912 – 1913 . He was also a decent cricketer keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire . 
 Geen was commissioned second lieutenant into the 9th King 's Royal Rifle Corps in August 1914 and sent to the Western Front in May 1915 . He was killed in action in Hooge , Belgium . He is remembered on the Menin Gate memorial .

 Geen was born in Newport , Wales . He went to school in England at Northam Place , Potter 's Bar , and then Haileybury College before being accepted into Oxford University . At Haileybury he was wicketkeeper for the cricket team ; he also captained the rugby team , playing at centre . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 Although Geen was a decent cricketer , keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire in the Minor Counties Championship between 1909 and 1912 , his rugby playing was more notable . He played wing for Oxford and Wales , and centre for Newport . He was " in the thick of everything " , a " class centre " with a " dodging style " , according to the rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell . He also appeared for Blackheath and the Barbarians . He was , however , repeatedly injured and his form was at times inconsistent . The First World War prevented him from playing more for Wales .
