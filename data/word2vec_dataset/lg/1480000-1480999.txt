 = = = Main cell layers = = = 
 Cnidaria are diploblastic animals ; in other words , they have two main cell layers , while more complex animals are <unk> having three main layers . The two main cell layers of cnidarians form epithelia that are mostly one cell thick , and are attached to a fibrous basement membrane , which they secrete . They also secrete the jelly @-@ like mesoglea that separates the layers . The layer that faces outwards , known as the ectoderm ( " outside skin " ) , generally contains the following types of cells : 
 <unk> cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form muscle fibers in parallel rows . The fibers of the outward @-@ facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward @-@ facing one . In Anthozoa ( anemones , corals , etc . ) and Scyphozoa ( jellyfish ) , the mesoglea also contains some muscle cells . 
 Cnidocytes , the harpoon @-@ like " nettle cells " that give the phylum Cnidaria its name . These appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells . 
 Nerve cells . Sensory cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells , and communicate via synapses ( gaps across which chemical signals flow ) with motor nerve cells , which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells . 
 Interstitial cells , which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types . These are found between the bases of muscle cells . 
 In addition to <unk> , nerve and interstitial cells , the inward @-@ facing gastroderm ( " stomach skin " ) contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes . In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes , which are used to subdue prey that is still struggling . 
 The mesoglea contains small numbers of amoeba @-@ like cells , and muscle cells in some species . However , the number of middle @-@ layer cells and types are much lower than in sponges . 
 = = = Polymorphism = = = 
 Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of structurally and functionally more than two different types of individuals within the same organism . It is a characteristic feature of Cnidarians , particularly the polyp and medusa forms , or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa . In Hydrozoans , colonial individuals arising from individuals zooids will take on separate tasks . For example , in Obelia there are feeding individuals , the gastrozooids ; the individuals capable of asexual reproduction only , the gonozooids , <unk> and free @-@ living or sexually reproducing individuals , the medusae . 
 = = = Cnidocytes = = = 
 These " nettle cells " function as harpoons , since their payloads remain connected to the bodies of the cells by threads . Three types of cnidocytes are known : 
 <unk> inject venom into prey , and usually have barbs to keep them embedded in the victims . Most species have nematocysts . 
 <unk> do not penetrate the victim or inject venom , but entangle it by means of small sticky hairs on the thread . 
 <unk> are not used for prey capture — instead the threads of discharged <unk> are used for building protective tubes in which their owners live . <unk> are found only in the order <unk> , tube anemones . 
 The main components of a cnidocyte are : 
 A cilium ( fine hair ) which projects above the surface and acts as a trigger . <unk> do not have cilia . 
 A tough capsule , the cnida , which houses the thread , its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or adhesives or both . ( " cnida " is derived from the Greek word <unk> , which means " nettle " ) 
 A tube @-@ like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida , like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards . When a cnidocyte fires , the finger pops out . If the cell is a venomous <unk> , the " finger " ' s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey . 
 The thread , which is an extension of the " finger " and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires . The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target . 
 An operculum ( lid ) over the end of the cnida . The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie . 
 The cell body , which produces all the other parts . 
 It is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex . At least four hypotheses have been proposed : 
 Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure . 
 The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released . 
 In the case of <unk> ( the " sea wasp " ) , chemical changes in the cnida 's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization . 
 Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more concentrated solution , so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it . This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class Hydrozoa , sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 atmospheres , similar to that of scuba air tanks , and fully extending the thread in as little as 2 milliseconds ( 0 @.@ 002 second ) . 
 Cnidocytes can only fire once , and about 25 % of a hydra 's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a brine shrimp . Used cnidocytes have to be replaced , which takes about 48 hours . To minimise wasteful firing , two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes : nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water , and their cilia respond to contact . This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non @-@ living objects . Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and , if one fires , the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Medusae swim by a form of jet propulsion : muscles , especially inside the rim of the bell , squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell , and the <unk> of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke . Since the tissue layers are very thin , they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents . 
 <unk> and some sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means : creeping like snails , crawling like inchworms , or by somersaulting . A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases . 
 = = = Nervous system and senses = = = 
 Cnidaria have no brains or even central nervous systems . Instead they have decentralized nerve nets consisting of sensory neurons that generate signals in response to various types of stimulus , such as odors , motor neurons that tell muscles to contract , and " cobwebs " of intermediate neurons to connect them . As well as forming the " signal cables " , intermediate neurons also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers . The cilia of the cnidocytes detect physical contact . Nerves inform cnidocytes when odors from prey or attackers are detected and when neighbouring cnidocytes fire . Most of the communications between nerve cells are via chemical synapses , small gaps across which chemicals flow . As this process is too slow to ensure that the muscles round the rim of a medusa 's bell contract simultaneously in swimming the neurons which control this communicate by much faster electrical signals across gap junctions . 
 Medusae and complex swimming colonies such as siphonophores and <unk> sense tilt and acceleration by means of statocysts , chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called <unk> . If the body tilts in the wrong direction , the animal rights itself by increasing the strength of the swimming movements on the side that is too low . Most species have ocelli ( " simple eyes " ) , which can detect sources of light . However the agile Box Jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas , corneas and lenses . Although the eyes probably do not form images , Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid @-@ colored objects . 
 = = = Feeding and excretion = = = 
 Cnidarians feed in several ways : predation , absorbing dissolved organic chemicals , filtering food particles out of the water , and obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells . Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some , including the corals <unk> and <unk> , depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients . Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide , some nutrients , a place in the sun and protection against predators . 
 Predatory species use their cnidocytes to poison or entangle prey , and those with venomous nematocysts may start digestion by injecting digestive enzymes . The " smell " of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth . In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by " oral arms " , which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area . Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards , spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking . In species for which suspended food particles are important , the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of cilia whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth , and some produce nets of mucus to trap particles . Their digestion is both intra and extracellular . 
 Once the food is in the digestive cavity , gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry , usually within a few hours . This circulates through the digestive cavity and , in colonial cnidarians , through the connecting tunnels , so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients . Absorption may take a few hours , and digestion within the cells may take a few days . The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both , so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity . Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or , for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick <unk> , are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea . 
 Indigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth . The main waste product of cells ' internal processes is ammonia , which is removed by the external and internal water currents . 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 There are no respiratory organs , and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide into the surrounding water . When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced , and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it . Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles , allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth . This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals , which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton , to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food . 
 Cnidaria that carry photosynthetic symbionts may have the opposite problem , an excess of oxygen , which may prove toxic . The animals produce large quantities of antioxidants to neutralize the excess oxygen . 
 = = = Regeneration = = = 
 All cnidarians can regenerate , allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually . Medusae have limited ability to regenerate , but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells . This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 = = = Sexual = = = 
 <unk> sexual reproduction often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages . For example , in Scyphozoa ( jellyfish ) and Cubozoa ( box jellies ) a larva swims until it finds a good site , and then becomes a polyp . This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae , a process called <unk> . The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity , while the polyp re @-@ grows and may continue <unk> periodically . The adults have gonads in the gastroderm , and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season . 
 This phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations ( one asexually reproducing , sessile polyp , and one sexually reproducing , free @-@ swimming medusa or sessile polyp ) is sometimes called <unk> of asexual and sexual phases or <unk> , but should not be confused with the alternation of generations as found in plants , characterized by an alternation of a multicellular spore @-@ producing form and a multicellular gamete @-@ producing form . 
 Shortened forms of this life cycle are common , for example some oceanic <unk> omit the polyp stage completely , and <unk> polyps produce only one medusa . Hydrozoa have a variety of life cycles . Some have no polyp stages and some ( e.g. hydra ) have no medusae . In some species , the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction ; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae . Meanwhile , life cycle reversal , in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process , was observed in both Hydrozoa ( <unk> <unk> and Laodicea undulata ) and Scyphozoa ( Aurelia <unk> ) . Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction . 
 Spawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature , and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise , sunset or the phase of the moon . Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location , so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage — one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef , where at least 110 corals and a few non @-@ cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy . These mass spawnings may produce hybrids , some of which can settle and form polyps , but it is not known how long these can survive . In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species . 
 The fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ( blastula ) and then a depression forms at one end ( <unk> ) and eventually become the digestive cavity . However , in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk ( at the animal pole ) , while in bilaterians it forms at the other end ( vegetal pole ) . The larvae , called <unk> , swim or crawl by means of cilia . They are cigar @-@ shaped but slightly broader at the " front " end , which is the aboral , vegetal @-@ pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage . 
 <unk> larvae either have large yolks or are capable of feeding on plankton , and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them . Since the parents are immobile , these feeding capabilities extend the larvae 's range and avoid overcrowding of sites . <unk> and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae , and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps . Instead , these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges . 
 = = = Asexual = = = 
 All known cnidaria can reproduce asexually by various means , in addition to regenerating after being fragmented . <unk> polyps only bud , while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle . <unk> polyps can both bud and split down the middle . In addition to both of these methods , Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base . Asexual reproduction makes the daughter Cnidaria clone the adult . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata , but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla . Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes : sessile Anthozoa ( sea anemones , corals , sea pens ) ; swimming Scyphozoa ( jellyfish ) and Cubozoa ( box jellies ) ; and Hydrozoa , a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms , and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o ' War . Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub @-@ group of Scyphozoa , and there is debate about whether the parasitic Myxozoa and <unk> are cnidarians or whether they are more closely related to the bilaterians . 
 <unk> , small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage , have traditionally been classified as members of the Scyphozoa , but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class , Staurozoa . 
 The Myxozoa , microscopic parasites , were first classified as protozoans , but recently as heavily modified cnidarians , and more closely related to Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa than to Anthozoa . However other recent research suggests that <unk> <unk> , a parasite within the egg cells of sturgeon , is closely related to the Myxozoa and that both <unk> and the Myxozoa are intermediate between cnidarians and bilaterian animals . 
 Some researchers classify the extinct <unk> as cnidarians , while others propose that they form a completely separate phylum . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Many cnidarians are limited to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients . The life cycles of most have polyp stages , which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates . Nevertheless , major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations . Hydrozoans have a worldwide range : some , such as Hydra , live in freshwater ; Obelia appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans ; and <unk> can form large shoals near the surface in mid @-@ ocean . Among anthozoans , a few scleractinian corals , sea pens and sea fans live in deep , cold waters , and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) below sea @-@ level . Reef @-@ building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30 ° N and 30 ° S with a maximum depth of 46 m ( 151 ft ) , temperatures between 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) and 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) high salinity and low carbon dioxide levels . <unk> , although usually classified as jellyfish , are stalked , sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters . Cnidarians range in size from Hydra , 5 – 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 79 in ) long , to the Lion 's mane jellyfish , which may exceed 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in diameter and 75 m ( 246 ft ) in length . 
 Prey of cnidarians ranges from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves . Some cnidarians are parasites , mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish . Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients . Predators of cnidarians include : sea slugs , which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self @-@ defense ; starfish , notably the crown of thorns starfish , which can devastate corals ; butterfly fish and parrot fish , which eat corals ; and marine turtles , which eat jellyfish . Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish ; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones , and each partner protects the other against predators . 
 Coral reefs form some of the world 's most productive ecosystems . Common coral reef cnidarians include both <unk> ( hard corals , <unk> , anemones ) and Hydrozoans ( fire corals , lace corals ) . The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers , in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use , and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently . In addition , reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support a wide range of other organisms . <unk> reefs just below low @-@ tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high @-@ tide level and sea grass meadows in between : the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted , while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt , fresh water and pollutants . This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals , which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 The earliest widely accepted animal fossils are rather modern @-@ looking cnidarians , possibly from around 580 million years ago , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation can only be dated approximately . The identification of some of these as embryos of animals has been contested , but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals . Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged . Although the Ediacaran fossil Charnia used to be classified as a jellyfish or sea pen , more recent study of growth patterns in Charnia and modern cnidarians has cast doubt on this hypothesis , leaving only the Canadian polyp , <unk> , as the only bona @-@ fide cnidarian body fossil from the Ediacaran . Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks , except in lagerstätten that preserved soft @-@ bodied animals . 
 A few mineralized fossils that resemble corals have been found in rocks from the Cambrian period , and corals diversified in the Early Ordovician . These corals , which were wiped out in the Permian @-@ Triassic extinction about 251 million years ago , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part . During the Mesozoic era <unk> bivalves were the main reef @-@ builders , but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago , and since then the main reef @-@ builders have been scleractinian corals . 
 = = = Family tree = = = 
 It is difficult to reconstruct the early stages in the evolutionary " family tree " of animals using only morphology ( their shapes and structures ) , because the large differences between Porifera ( sponges ) , Cnidaria plus Ctenophora ( comb jellies ) , Placozoa and Bilateria ( all the more complex animals ) make comparisons difficult . Hence reconstructions now rely largely or entirely on molecular phylogenetics , which groups organisms according to similarities and differences in their biochemistry , usually in their DNA or RNA . 
 It is now generally thought that the Calcarea ( sponges with calcium carbonate spicules ) are more closely related to Cnidaria , Ctenophora ( comb jellies ) and Bilateria ( all the more complex animals ) than they are to the other groups of sponges . In 1866 it was proposed that Cnidaria and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata ( " hollow guts " ) , because Cnidaria and Ctenophora both rely on the flow of water in and out of a single cavity for feeding , excretion and respiration . In 1881 , it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other , since they shared features that Cnidaria lack , for example muscles in the middle layer ( mesoglea in Ctenophora , mesoderm in Bilateria ) . However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague , and the current view , based on molecular phylogenetics , is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora . This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled " <unk> " because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the planula larvae of Cnidaria . 
 Within the Cnidaria , the Anthozoa ( sea anemones and corals ) are regarded as the sister @-@ group of the rest , which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were sessile polyps with no medusa stage . However , it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage , since Hydrozoa form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other <unk> do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp . The traditional grouping of Scyphozoa included the Staurozoa , but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to Cubozoa ( box jellies ) than to other " Scyphozoa " . Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct <unk> suggest that they are closely related . The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria , and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main axes of the body . 
 However , in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals , since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have striated muscle , which in bilaterians arises from the mesoderm . They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians . 
 In molecular phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards , important groups of developmental genes show the same variety in cnidarians as in chordates . In fact cnidarians , and especially anthozoans ( sea anemones and corals ) , retain some genes that are present in bacteria , protists , plants and fungi but not in bilaterians . 
 The mitochondrial genome in the <unk> cnidarians , unlike those in other animals , is linear with fragmented genes . The reason for this difference is unknown . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 Jellyfish stings killed about 1 @,@ 500 people in the 20th century , and <unk> are particularly dangerous . On the other hand , some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia . Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds , protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides , and more recently as centers of tourism . However , they are vulnerable to over @-@ fishing , mining for construction materials , pollution , and damage caused by tourism . 
 Beaches protected from tides and storms by coral reefs are often the best places for housing in tropical countries . Reefs are an important food source for low @-@ technology fishing , both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas . However , despite their great productivity , reefs are vulnerable to over @-@ fishing , because much of the organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen . Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands , attracting photographers , divers and sports fishermen . However , human activities damage reefs in several ways : mining for construction materials ; pollution , including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains ; commercial fishing , including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums ; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs . Coral , mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery , and demand rose sharply in the 1980s . 
 Some large jellyfish species of the <unk> order are commonly consumed in Japan , Korea and Southeast Asia . In parts of the range , fishing industry is restricted to daylight hours and calm conditions in two short seasons , from March to May and August to November . The commercial value of jellyfish food products depends on the skill with which they are prepared , and " Jellyfish Masters " guard their trade secrets carefully . Jellyfish is very low in cholesterol and sugars , but cheap preparation can introduce undesirable amounts of heavy metals . 
 The " sea wasp " <unk> <unk> has been described as the world 's most venomous jellyfish and is held responsible for 67 deaths , although it is difficult to identify the animal as it is almost transparent . Most <unk> by C. <unk> cause only mild symptoms . Seven other box jellies can cause a set of symptoms called <unk> syndrome , which takes about 30 minutes to develop , and from a few hours to two weeks to disappear . Hospital treatment is usually required , and there have been a few deaths .

 Mary Anning ( 21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847 ) was an English fossil collector , dealer , and paleontologist who became known around the world for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England . Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth . 
 Mary Anning searched for fossils in the area 's Blue Lias cliffs , particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea . It was dangerous work , and she nearly lost her life in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog , Tray . Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified ; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found ; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany ; and important fish fossils . Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites , known as bezoar stones at the time , were fossilised faeces . She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods . When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior , the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions , he based it largely on fossils Anning had found , and sold prints of it for her benefit . 
 Anning did not fully participate in the scientific community of 19th @-@ century Britain , who were mostly Anglican gentlemen . She struggled financially for much of her life . Her family was poor , and her father , a cabinetmaker , died when she was eleven . 
 She became well known in geological circles in Britain , Europe , and America , and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils . Nonetheless , as a woman , she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions . Indeed , she wrote in a letter : " The world has used me so unkindly , I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone . " The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the Magazine of Natural History in 1839 , an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine 's editor questioning one of its claims . 
 After her death in 1847 , her unusual life story attracted increasing interest . An uncredited author in All the Year Round , edited by Charles Dickens , wrote of her in 1865 that " [ t ] he carpenter 's daughter has won a name for herself , and has deserved to win it . " In 2010 , one hundred and sixty @-@ three years after her death , the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science .

 = = = Early childhood = = = 
 Anning was born in Lyme Regis in Dorset , England . Her father , Richard Anning , was a cabinetmaker who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff @-@ side fossil beds near the town , and selling his finds to tourists . He married Mary Moore , known as Molly , on 8 August 1793 in Blandford Forum . The couple moved to Lyme and lived in a house built on the town 's bridge . They attended the Dissenter chapel on Coombe Street , whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as Congregationalists . Shelley Emling writes that the family lived so close to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings ' home , on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned . 
 Richard and Molly had ten children . The first child , Mary , was born in 1794 . She was followed by another girl , who died almost at once ; Joseph in 1796 ; and another son in 1798 , who died in infancy . In December that year , the oldest child , then four years old , died after her clothes caught fire , possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire . The incident was reported in the Bath Chronicle on 27 December 1798 : " A child , four years of age of Mr. R. Anning , a cabinetmaker of Lyme , was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl 's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death . " When another daughter was born just five months later , she was named Mary after her dead sister . More children were born after her , but none of them survived more than a couple of years . Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood . The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not very unusual . Almost half the children born in Britain throughout the 19th century died before the age of 5 , and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis , infant deaths from diseases like smallpox and measles were particularly common . 
 On 19 August 1800 , when Anning was 15 months old , an event occurred that became part of local lore . She was being held by a neighbour , Elizabeth <unk> , who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below . Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water . A local doctor declared her survival miraculous . Her family said she had been a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom . For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child 's curiosity , intelligence and lively personality to the incident . 
 Her education was extremely limited . She was able to attend a Congregationalist Sunday school where she learned to read and write . Congregationalist doctrine , unlike that of the Church of England at the time , emphasised the importance of education for the poor . Her prized possession was a bound volume of the Dissenters ' Theological Magazine and Review , in which the family 's pastor , the Reverend James Wheaton , had published two essays , one insisting that God had created the world in six days , the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology . 
 = = = Fossils as a family business = = = 
 By the late 18th century , Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort , especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry , and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle class tourists were arriving there . Even before Mary 's time , locals supplemented their income by selling what were called " curios " to visitors . These were fossils with colourful local names such as " snake @-@ stones " ( ammonites ) , " devil 's fingers " ( belemnites ) , and " <unk> " ( vertebrae ) , to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties . Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century , at first as a pastime , but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood . 
 The source of most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis , part of a geological formation known as the Blue Lias . This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale , laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period ( about 210 – 195 million years ago ) . It is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain . The cliffs could be dangerously unstable , however , especially in winter when rain caused landslides . It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils . 
 Their father , Richard , often took Mary and Joseph on fossil @-@ hunting expeditions to make more money for the family . They offered their discoveries for sale to tourists on a table outside their home . This was a difficult time for England 's poor ; the French Revolutionary Wars , and the Napoleonic Wars that followed , caused food shortages . The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812 , but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged . In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest , even riots . At one point , Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages . 
 In addition , the family 's status as religious dissenters — not followers of the Church of England — attracted discrimination . Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army , and were excluded by law from several professions . Her father had been suffering from tuberculosis and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff . When he died in November 1810 ( aged 44 ) , he left the family with significant debts and no savings , forcing them to apply for parish relief . 
 The family continued collecting and selling fossils together , and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn . Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes , Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too , and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father 's death . 
 Their first well @-@ known find was in 1811 , when Mary was 12 ; Joseph dug up a 4 @-@ foot ichthyosaur skull , and a few months later Mary found the rest of the skeleton . Henry Hoste Henley of Sandringham , Norfolk , who was lord of the manor of <unk> , near Lyme Regis , paid the family about £ 23 for it , and in turn he sold it to William Bullock , a well @-@ known collector , who displayed it in London . There it generated considerable interest , because at a time when most people in England still believed in the Biblical account of creation , which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old , it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself . It was later sold for £ 45 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a " Crocodile in a Fossil State " to Charles Konig , of the British Museum , who had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus for it . 
 Mary 's mother Molly initially ran the fossil business after Richard 's death , but it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself . As late as 1821 , she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen . Joseph 's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer , but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825 . By that time , Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business . 
 = = = Birch auction = = = 
 One of the family 's keenest customers was Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Thomas James Birch , later <unk> , a wealthy collector from Lincolnshire , who bought several specimens from them . In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family 's poverty . Having made no major discoveries for a year , they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent . So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf . He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was " for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme , who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with , yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied . " The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820 , and raised £ 400 ( worth the equivalent of over £ 26 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) . How much of that was given to the Annings is not known , but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing , and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna , the three @-@ day event raised the family 's profile within the geological community . 
 = = = Fossil shop and growing expertise in a risky occupation = = = 
 Anning continued to support herself selling fossils . Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as ammonite and belemnite shells , which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings . Vertebrate fossils , such as ichthyosaur skeletons , sold for more , but were much rarer . Collecting them was dangerous winter work . In 1823 , an article in The Bristol Mirror said of her : 
 This persevering female has for years gone daily in search of fossil remains of importance at every tide , for many miles under the hanging cliffs at Lyme , whose fallen masses are her immediate object , as they alone contain these valuable relics of a former world , which must be snatched at the moment of their fall , at the continual risk of being crushed by the half suspended fragments they leave behind , or be left to be destroyed by the returning tide : – to her exertions we owe nearly all the fine specimens of <unk> of the great collections ... 
 The risks of her profession were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black @-@ and @-@ white terrier , Tray , her constant companion when she went collecting . She wrote to a friend , Charlotte Murchison , in November of that year : " Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me , the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes , and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate . " 
 As Anning continued to make important finds , her reputation grew . On 10 December 1823 , she found the first complete Plesiosaurus , and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as pterosaurs , called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum , followed by a <unk> fish skeleton in 1829 . Despite her limited education , she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain , and often , laboriously hand @-@ copied papers borrowed from others . Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by William Conybeare on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original . She also dissected modern animals including both fish and cuttlefish to gain a better understanding of the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working . Lady Harriet Silvester , the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London , visited Lyme in 1824 and described Anning in her diary : 
 The extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong . She fixes the bones on a frame with cement and then makes drawings and has them engraved ... It is certainly a wonderful instance of divine favour — that this poor , ignorant girl should be so blessed , for by reading and application she has arrived to that degree of knowledge as to be in the habit of writing and talking with professors and other clever men on the subject , and they all acknowledge that she understands more of the science than anyone else in this kingdom . 
 In 1826 , at the age of 27 , Anning managed to save enough money to purchase a home with a glass store @-@ front window for her shop , Anning 's Fossil Depot . The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper , which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display . Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme , including the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh , who called Anning a " very clever funny Creature . " He purchased fossils from her for the newly opened New York Lyceum of Natural History in 1827 . King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection . The king 's physician and aide , Carl Gustav Carus , wrote in his journal : 
 We had alighted from the carriage and were proceeding on foot , when we fell in with a shop in which the most remarkable <unk> and fossil remains — the head of an Ichthyosaurus — beautiful ammonites , etc. were exhibited in the window . We entered and found the small shop and adjoining chamber completely filled with fossil productions of the coast ... I found in the shop a large slab of blackish clay , in which a perfect Ichthyosaurus of at least six feet , was embedded . This specimen would have been a great acquisition for many of the cabinets of natural history on the Continent , and I consider the price demanded , £ 15 sterling , as very moderate . 
 Carus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference — she wrote it as " Mary <unk> " — and when she handed it back to him she told him : " I am well known throughout the whole of Europe . " As time passed , Anning 's confidence in her knowledge grew , and in 1839 she wrote to the Magazine of Natural History to question the claim made in an article , that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark <unk> represented a new genus , as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago . The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning 's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime . Some personal letters written by her , such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell , were published while she was alive , however . 
 = = = Interactions with the scientific community = = = 
 As a working @-@ class woman , Anning was an outsider to the scientific community . At the time in Britain women were not allowed to vote , hold public office , or attend university . The newly formed , but increasingly influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members , or even to attend meetings as guests . The only occupations generally open to working @-@ class women were farm labour , domestic service , and work in the newly opening factories . 
 Although Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy <unk> to whom she sold , it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found , often neglecting to mention her name . She became resentful of this . Anna Pinney , a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected , wrote : " She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains , and made a great deal of publishing works , of which she furnished the contents , while she derived none of the advantages . " Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working @-@ class people in early 19th @-@ century scientific literature . Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman , construction worker , or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector , and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest . 
 Along with purchasing specimens , many geologists visited her to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification . Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme , and he , Mary , and sometimes Mary 's brother Joseph , went fossil @-@ hunting together . De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain 's leading geologists . William Buckland , who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford , often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning . It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones , were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs . Buckland would name the objects coprolites . In 1839 Buckland , Conybeare , and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil @-@ collecting excursion . 
 She also assisted Thomas Hawkins with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s . She was aware of his penchant to " enhance " the fossils he collected . She wrote : " he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be ; and not as they are really found ... " . A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete , and later sold them to the government for the British Museum 's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions . 
 The Swiss palaeontologist Louis Agassiz visited Lyme Regis in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region . He was so impressed by her and her friend Elizabeth Philpot that he wrote in his journal : " Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the <unk> dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types . " He thanked both of them for their help in his book , Studies of Fossil Fish . 
 Another leading British geologist , Roderick Murchison , did some of his first field work in southwest England , including Lyme , accompanied by his wife , Charlotte . Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to " become a good practical <unk> , by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place ... " . Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents . Charlotte , who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband , helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe , and Anning stayed with the <unk> when she visited London in 1829 . 
 Gideon Mantell , discoverer of the dinosaur Iguanodon , also visited her at her shop . 
 Anning 's correspondents included Charles Lyell , who wrote to her to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme , as well as Adam Sedgwick — one of her earliest customers — who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered Charles Darwin among his students . 
 = = = Financial difficulties and change in church affiliation = = = 
 By 1830 , because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils , coupled with long gaps between major finds , Anning was having financial problems again . Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche 's watercolour painting , Duria Antiquior , portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found . De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her . It became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated . In December 1830 she finally made another major find , a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur , which sold for £ 200 . 
 It was around this time that she switched from attending the local Congregational church , where she had been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members , to the Anglican church . The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor , John Gleed , a fellow fossil collector , left for the United States to campaign against slavery . He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith . The greater social respectability of the established church , in which some of Anning 's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland , Conybeare , and Sedgwick were ordained clergy , was also a factor . Anning , who was devoutly religious , actively supported her new church as she had her old . 
 She suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings , about £ 300 , in a bad investment . Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong . Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money , but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment . Concerned about her financial situation , her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity , known as a civil list pension , in return for her many contributions to the science of geology . The £ 25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 Anning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847 . Her work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness , and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of laudanum she was taking for the pain , there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem . The regard in which she was held by the geological community was shown in 1846 when , upon learning of her cancer diagnosis , the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses and the council of the newly created Dorset County Museum made her an honorary member . She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of St. Michael 's , the local parish church . Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained @-@ glass window in her memory , unveiled in 1850 . It depicts the six corporal acts of mercy — feeding the hungry , giving drink to the thirsty , clothing the naked , sheltering the homeless , visiting prisoners and the sick , and the inscription reads : " This window is sacred to the memory of Mary Anning of this parish , who died 9 March AD 1847 and is erected by the vicar and some members of the Geological Society of London in commemoration of her usefulness in furthering the science of geology , as also of her benevolence of heart and integrity of life . " 
 After her death , Henry De la Beche , president of the Geological Society , wrote a eulogy that he read to a meeting of the society and published in its quarterly transactions , the first such eulogy given for a woman . These were honours normally only accorded to fellows of the society , which did not admit women until 1904 . The eulogy began : 
 " I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without <unk> to that of one , who though not placed among even the easier classes of society , but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour , yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great <unk> @-@ <unk> , and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ... " 
 Charles Dickens wrote an article about her life in February 1865 in his literary magazine All the Year Round that emphasised the difficulties she had overcome , especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople . He ended the article with : " The carpenter 's daughter has won a name for herself , and has deserved to win it . " 
 = = Major discoveries = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Anning 's first famous discovery was made shortly after her father 's death . In 1811 ( some sources say 1810 or 1809 ) her brother Joseph found a 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) skull , but failed to locate the rest of the animal . After Joseph told her to look between the cliffs at Lyme Regis and Charmouth , Mary found the skeleton — 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) long in all — a few months later . The family hired workmen to dig it out in November that year , an event covered by the local press on 9 November , who identified the fossil as a crocodile . 
 Other ichthyosaur remains had been discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere , but the specimen found by the Annings was the first to come to the attention of scientific circles in London . It was purchased by the lord of a local manor , who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation . At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis , that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct , the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth . Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers , starting in 1814 , describing it for the Royal Society . The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil , and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock 's museum . Perplexed by the creature , Home kept changing his mind about its classification , first thinking it was a kind of fish , then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck @-@ billed platypus ( only recently known to science ) ; finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards , which led him to propose naming it <unk> @-@ Saurus . By then Charles Konig , an assistant curator of the British Museum , had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus ( fish lizard ) for the specimen and that name stuck . Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819 . The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London ( to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century ) , but at some point , it became separated from the rest of the skeleton , the location of which is not known . 
 Anning found several other ichthyosaur fossils between 1815 and 1819 , including almost complete skeletons of varying sizes . In 1821 William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche , both members of the Geological Society of London , collaborated on a paper that analysed in detail the specimens found by Anning and others . They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown type of marine reptile , and based on differences in tooth structure , they concluded that there had been at least three species . Also in 1821 , Anning found the 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) skeleton from which the species Ichthyosaurus <unk> ( now <unk> <unk> ) would be named . In the 1980s it was determined that the first ichthyosaur specimen found by Joseph and Mary Anning was also a member of <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Plesiosaurus = = = 
 In the same 1821 paper he co @-@ authored with Henry De la Beche on ichthyosaur anatomy , William Conybeare named and described the genus Plesiosaurus ( near lizard ) , called so because he thought it more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been . The description was based on a number of fossils , the most complete of them specimen OUMNH <unk> , a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Thomas James Birch . Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning , during the winter of 1820 / 1821 . If so , it would have been Anning 's next major discovery , providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile . No records by Anning of the find are known . The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it , but does not mention who discovered and prepared it . 
 In 1823 , Anning discovered a second , much more complete plesiosaur skeleton , specimen BMNH <unk> . When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824 , he again failed to mention Anning by name , even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation . Conybeare 's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles . The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus <unk> and is the type specimen ( holotype ) of this species , which itself is the type species of the genus . 
 Conybeare 's presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils . The fact that the plesiosaur 's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning 's drawings of the second skeleton , and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals . Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th @-@ century fossil collectors , and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly , the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning 's ability to sell fossils to other geologists . Cuvier 's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824 , which , after some debate , had concluded the skeleton was legitimate . Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken . 
 Anning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830 . It was named Plesiosaurus macrocephalus by William Buckland and was described in an 1840 paper by Richard Owen . Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination , but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it . 
 = = = Fossil fish and pterosaur = = = 
 Anning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an " unrivalled specimen " of <unk> <unk> . This was a ray @-@ finned fish , which would be described in 1828 . In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a pterosaur . In 1829 William Buckland described it as Pterodactylus <unk> ( later renamed <unk> <unk> by Richard Owen ) , and unlike many other such occasions , Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper . 
 It was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany , and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum . In December 1829 she found a fossil fish , <unk> , which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and rays . 
 = = = Invertebrates and trace fossils = = = 
 Vertebrate fossil finds , especially of marine reptiles , made Anning 's reputation , but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology . In 1826 she discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil . She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils . Soon other local artists were doing the same , as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered . Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttlefish , which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods , and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do . It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as " bezoar stones " were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons . She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales , and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs . Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824 . After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places , Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them coprolites . In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier , for which she was not credited , when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society , he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery . 
 = = Impact and legacy = = 
 Anning 's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction . Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths . Nevertheless , until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear , so existing ones did not become extinct — in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God 's creation had been imperfect ; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth . The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning , some , such as the plesiosaur , so unlike any known living creature , struck a major blow against this idea . 
 The ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs , and pterosaur she found , along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period , showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today , and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier 's : that there had been an " age of reptiles " when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life . This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled " The Age of Reptiles " that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land , air , and sea . These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of <unk> analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived . This discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology . Illustrations of scenes from " deep time " ( now known as <unk> ) , such as Henry De la Beche 's ground @-@ breaking painting Duria Antiquior , helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past . De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites . The study of coprolites , pioneered by Anning and Buckland , would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems . 
 Throughout the 20th century , beginning with H. A. Forde and his The Heroine of Lyme Regis : The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist ( 1925 ) , a number of writers saw Anning 's life as inspirational . She was even the basis of Terry Sullivan 's 1908 tongue twister , " She sells seashells , " according to P. J. McCartney in Henry de la Beche ( 1978 ) : 
 Much of the material written about her was aimed at children , and tended to focus on her childhood and early career . Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate . She has been referenced in several historical novels , most notably in The French Lieutenant 's Woman ( 1969 ) by John Fowles , who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime . As her biographer , Shelley Emling , noted , this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds , such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison , who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them . The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss @-@ American naturalist , Louis Agassiz . In the early 1840s , he named two fossil fish species after her — <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> — and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot . Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834 . After her death , other species , including the ostracod <unk> <unk> , and two genera , the therapsid reptile genus <unk> , and the bivalve mollusc genus <unk> , were named in her honour . In 2012 , the plesiosaur genus <unk> was named for her , and the species Ichthyosaurus <unk> was named for her in 2015 . 
 In 1999 , on the 200th anniversary of her birth , an international meeting of historians , palaeontologists , fossil collectors , and others interested in Anning 's life was held in Lyme Regis . In 2005 the Natural History Museum added her , alongside scientists such as Carl Linnaeus , Dorothea Bate , and William Smith , as one of the gallery characters it uses to patrol its display cases . In 2007 American playwright / performer Claudia Stevens premiered Blue Lias , or the Fish Lizard 's Whore , a solo play with music by Allen Shearer depicting Anning in later life . Among the presenters of its thirty performances around the Charles Darwin bi @-@ centennial were the Cleveland Museum of Natural History , museums of natural history at the University of Michigan and the University of Kansas , and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History . In 2009 Tracy Chevalier wrote a historical novel entitled Remarkable Creatures , in which Anning and Elizabeth Philpot were the main characters , and another historical novel about Anning , Curiosity by Joan Thomas , was published in March 2010 . Also that month , as part of the celebration of its 350th anniversary , the Royal Society invited a panel of experts to produce a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science . They included Anning in the list . 
 = St Eleth 's Church , Amlwch = 
 St Eleth 's Church , Amlwch is a parish church built in the Neo @-@ classical style in 1800 in Amlwch , a town on the island of Anglesey in north Wales . It stands on the site of earlier buildings , with the first church here said to have been established by St <unk> ( or Eleth ) in the 6th century . Increasing prosperity in the town through copper mining during the 18th century led to the construction of a new church to serve the growing population . 
 The church is still used for services within the Church in Wales , and is one of four churches in the parish of Amlwch . It is a Grade II * listed building , a designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , because it is a " substantially Neo @-@ classical church retaining much of its original architectural character " . 
 = = History and location = = 
 The first church in the area was reputedly established in the 6th century by <unk> , or Eleth . He was a ruler from northern Britain who fled to Anglesey in north Wales when ousted from power , settling at St Seiriol 's monastery at Penmon . 
 Amlwch grew and became increasingly prosperous during the 18th century after copper mining began at nearby Parys Mountain in 1768 . As a result , the church became too small . Planning for a replacement church began in 1787 when Thomas Williams , " the Copper King " , offered £ 600 ( approximately £ 68 @,@ 800 in present @-@ day terms ) . The Copper Mines Company provided the majority of the money required for the new church ; Henry Paget , 1st Earl of Uxbridge , and the Reverend Edward Hughes ( a co @-@ owner of the mines ) also made donations . Work eventually got underway and the church , designed by the architect James Wyatt , was built and consecrated in 1800 . Different figures for the cost of construction are given by two 19th @-@ century writers : in 1833 , Angharad Llwyd said that the cost was £ 4 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 291 @,@ 300 in present @-@ day terms ) but in 1849 , Samuel Lewis stated it to have been £ 2 @,@ 500 ( approximately £ 182 @,@ 000 in present @-@ day terms ) . 
 The new church was constructed on the same site as earlier buildings , set back from the road on the east side of Queen Street in the town centre . Some internal alterations were made in 1867 under Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor : tracery was added to the windows , a chancel arch and arcades inserted , and the galleries removed . Restoration took place in 1999 and 2000 under the architect Adam <unk> , when a gallery at the west end , a baptistry and meeting rooms were added . 
 The church is still used for services as part of the Church in Wales . It is in the parish of Amlwch , which has three other churches in the surrounding area ( St Eilian , Llaneilian ; St Gwenllwyfo , Llanwenllwyfo ; and St Tyfrydog , Llandyfrydog ) . As of 2012 , the priest in charge is H. V. Jones . The parish is in the deanery of Twrcelyn , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The predominant style of the church is Neo @-@ classical , although there are some Gothic elements . It is built from local stone , with courses of rubble and ashlar dressings ; the roof is made of slate . There is a tower at the centre of the west end , which houses a clock and a bell @-@ chamber behind large arched windows ; it has a parapet with pinnacles at each corner . There are two bells , one dated 1687 and the other dated 1820 . The arched doorway is set into the tower , with a circular window ( an oculus ) above it ; the tracery in this window was added in the 19th century . 
 Inside , the division of the nave from the narrow chancel was carried out in the 19th century through the addition of a chancel arch and creation of a chapel at the east end . Arcades were also added in the nave , to form aisles to either side . The inside of the roof is plastered . The east window contains 19th @-@ century stained glass . There are memorial stones , mostly from the previous church on the site . 
 The organ is 19th @-@ century by Bevington and is housed in a gallery at the west end that was added in the restoration in 1999 and 2000 . The font dates from 1900 . Outside the church , the large lychgate at the west of the churchyard dates from the early 19th century . Inside the churchyard , the gravestones have been moved to the side , possibly for ease of maintenance . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church is a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 25 October 1951 , and has been listed because it is " a substantially Neo @-@ classical church retaining much of its original architectural character . " Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales ) notes that the " lightness of its Victorian restoration left the original fabric and much of the detail intact , and traces changing attitudes to church layout and style without obliterating the character of the original . " It also states that the church is historically important for its links with copper mining . The lychgate has also been given listed building status at the lowest level , Grade II ( for buildings of national importance and special interest ) , because it is a " good early example " of a 19th @-@ century lychgate of " characteristic local type " and because it forms a group with the adjacent church . 
 The 19th @-@ century Welsh antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as a " spacious handsome structure " , and Samuel Lewis ( a writer of topographical guides in the 19th century ) described the church in very similar words as a " spacious and handsome structure " ; he particularly noted the " lofty square embattled tower crowned with pinnacles . " A 2009 guide to the buildings of north Wales describes the 19th @-@ century alterations by Kennedy as " egregious " , but says that the interior " possesses considerable grace " , with the columns of the arcades being " touched by a breath of classicism " . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes it as " a good example of a tastefully restored church " , and a " spacious , high sided building with an impressive tower " . It also comments that its shape is not typical of churches on the island . 
 = 1st Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division ( United States ) = 
 The 1st Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division is an infantry brigade combat team of the United States Army based at Fort Drum , New York . It is a subordinate unit of the 10th Mountain Division . 
 Formed as the 10th Mountain Division 's original headquarters company , the brigade traces its lineage through the division 's fight through Italy in World War II and afterwards , as it commanded a training division and then an infantry division which briefly deployed to Europe . 
 1st Brigade was reactivated 11 April 1986 at Fort Drum , New York . The 1st Brigade is the Command and Control Headquarters for Task Force Warrior , consisting of its organic battalions 1 – 32nd Infantry , 1 – 87th Infantry , and 2 – 22nd Infantry . The principal units that have been assigned to TF Warrior during Division Ready Brigade missions , off post deployments , and major exercises have been the 3 – 6th Field Artillery , 10th Forward Support Battalion , A / 3 @-@ 62nd Air Defense Artillery , A / 41st Engineer , A / 110th Military Intelligence , A / 10th Signal Battalion , and 1st <unk> / 10th Military Police Battalion . 
 1st Brigade and its elements saw numerous deployments to contingencies around the world in the 1990s . With the War on Terrorism the brigade has seen multiple deployments to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom and to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The 1st Brigade Combat Team is a subordinate unit of the 10th Mountain Division , however its modular nature means it is capable of operating independently of the division 's Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion . 
 The brigade consists of six subordinate battalions ; its combat element consists of two infantry battalions , the 1st Battalion , 87th Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion , 22nd Infantry Regiment . The 1st Squadron , 71st Cavalry Regiment provides armored reconnaissance services to the Brigade Combat Team , while the 3rd Battalion , 6th Field Artillery Regiment provides field artillery support . The brigade 's Headquarters and command services are provided by 1st Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division Special Troops Battalion . All supporting services for the brigade are provided by the 10th Brigade Support Battalion . All of these battalions are located at Fort Drum with most of the rest of the 10th Mountain Division .

 On 13 February 1985 , the 10th Mountain Division ( Light Infantry ) was reactivated at Fort Drum , New York . In accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan , the division was no longer centered around regiments , instead two brigades were activated under the division . The 1st Brigade , 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Drum while the 2nd Brigade , 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Benning , moving to Fort Drum in 1988 . The division was also assigned a round @-@ out brigade from the Army National Guard , the 27th Infantry Brigade . The division was specially designed as a light infantry division able to rapidly deploy . Equipment design was oriented toward reduced size and weight for reasons of both strategic and tactical mobility . The division also received a distinctive unit insignia . 
 Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida on 24 August 1992 , killing 13 people , leaving another 250 @,@ 000 homeless and causing damages in excess of 20 billion dollars . On 27 September 1992 , the 10th Mountain Division assumed responsibility for Hurricane Andrew disaster relief as Task Force Mountain . Division soldiers set up relief camps , distributed food , clothing , medical necessities and building supplies , as well as helping to rebuild homes and clear debris . The last of the 6 @,@ 000 division soldiers to deployed to Florida returned home in October 1992 .

 On 3 December 1993 , the division headquarters was designated as the headquarters for all Army Forces ( <unk> ) of the Unified Task Force ( UNITAF ) for Operation Restore Hope . Major General Steven L. Arnold , the division Commander , was named Army Forces commander . The 10th Mountain Division ’ s mission was to secure major cities and roads to provide safe passage of relief supplies to the Somali population suffering from the effects of the Somali Civil War . Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts , humanitarian agencies declared an end to the food emergency and factional fighting decreased . When Task Force Ranger and the SAR team were pinned down during a raid in what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu , 10th Mountain units provided infantry for the UN quick reaction force sent to rescue them . The 10th had 2 soldiers killed in the fighting , which was the longest sustained firefight by regular US Army forces since the Vietnam War . The division began a gradual reduction of forces in Somalia in February 1993 , until the last soldiers of the 2nd Battalion , 22nd Infantry returned to the United States in March 1994 .

 The division formed the nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti ( MNF Haiti ) and Joint Task Force 190 ( JTF 190 ) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy . More than 8 @,@ 600 of the division 's troops deployed during this operation . On 19 September 1994 , the 1st Brigade conducted the Army ’ s first air assault from an aircraft carrier . This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2 @,@ 000 soldiers . They occupied the Port @-@ au @-@ Prince International Airport . This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II . 
 The division ’ s mission was to create a secure and stable environment so the government of Haitian President Jean @-@ Bertrand Aristide could be reestablished and democratic elections held . After this was accomplished , the 10th Mountain Division handed over control of the MNF @-@ Haiti to the 25th Infantry Division on 15 January 1995 . The Division redeployed the last of its soldiers who served in Haiti by 31 January 1995 .

The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi <unk> Valley in 2002 . Upon the return of the battalions , they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush . 
 In 2003 , the division 's headquarters , along with the 1st Brigade , returned to Afghanistan . During that time , they operated in the frontier regions of the country such as Paktika Province , going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al @-@ Qaeda forces . Fighting in several small @-@ scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche , Operation Mountain Resolve , and Operation Mountain Viper , the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents .

 = Russian cruiser Bayan ( 1900 ) = 
 The cruiser Bayan ( Russian : <unk> ) was the name ship of the four Bayan @-@ class armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . The ship had to be built in France because there was no available capacity in Russia . Bayan was assigned to the First Pacific Squadron after completion and based at Port Arthur from the end of 1903 . She suffered minor damage during the Battle of Port Arthur at the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and supported destroyers as they patrolled outside the harbour . After bombarding Japanese positions in July 1904 , the ship struck a mine and was out of action for the next several months . Bayan was sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and was then salvaged by the Japanese after the war . 
 Renamed Aso by the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) she served as a training ship after extensive repairs . The ship was converted into a minelayer in 1917 and was decommissioned in 1930 to serve as a target ship . She was eventually sunk as a target in 1932 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Unlike previous Russian armoured cruisers , the Bayan @-@ class ships were designed as scouts for the fleet . They were 449 feet 7 inches ( 137 @.@ 0 m ) long overall and 443 feet ( 135 @.@ 0 m ) between perpendiculars . They had a maximum beam of 57 feet 6 inches ( 17 @.@ 5 m ) , a draft of 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) and displaced 7 @,@ 802 long tons ( 7 @,@ 927 t ) . The ships had a crew of 573 officers and men . 
 The Bayan class had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by 26 Belleville boilers . Designed for a total of 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 304 kW ) intended to propel the cruisers at 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , the engines actually developed 17 @,@ 400 ihp ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) during Bayan 's sea trials in October 1902 and drove the ship to a maximum speed of 20 @.@ 9 knots ( 38 @.@ 7 km / h ; 24 @.@ 1 mph ) . She could carry a maximum of 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 118 t ) of coal , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 200 km ; 4 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Bayan 's main armament consisted of two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ calibre guns in single turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . Her eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the ship 's hull . Anti @-@ torpedo boat defence was provided by twenty 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) 50 @-@ calibre guns ; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure . The remaining guns were located above the six @-@ inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with gun shields . Bayan also mounted eight 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) and two 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship had two submerged 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . 
 The ship used Harvey armour throughout . Her waterline belt was 7 @.@ 9 inches ( 200 mm ) thick over her machinery spaces . Fore and aft , it reduced to 3 @.@ 9 inches ( 100 mm ) . The upper armour strake and the armour protecting the casemates was 2 @.@ 4 inches ( 60 mm ) thick . The thickness of the armoured deck was 2 inches ( 50 mm ) ; over the central battery it was a single plate , but elsewhere it consisted of a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 30 mm ) plate over two 0 @.@ 39 @-@ inch ( 10 mm ) plates . The gun turret sides were protected by 5 @.@ 9 inches ( 150 mm ) of armour and their roofs were 1 @.@ 2 inches thick . The barbettes were protected by armour plates 6 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 170 mm ) thick . The sides of the conning tower were 6 @.@ 3 inches ( 160 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Bayan , named after the bard Boyan , had to be ordered in May 1898 from the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne @-@ sur @-@ Mer because there was no capacity available in Russian shipyards . The ship was laid down in February 1899 and launched on 12 June 1900 . Bayan was completed in February 1903 and , under the command of Captain 1st Rank Robert <unk> , made port visits in Greece , Italy and North Africa before sailing for Kronstadt . Arriving in April 1903 , she was only there for several months before departing for Port Arthur on 7 August . Together with the French @-@ built battleship Tsesarevich , Bayan arrived on 2 December and they were both assigned to the First Pacific Squadron . 
 On the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 , the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . Bayan was not hit by the initial torpedo @-@ boat incursion and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , attacked . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his assault . The Japanese vessels had been spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore , and alerted the Russian defences . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted inconsequential damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on their opponents with some effect . Bayan suffered superficial damage from nine hits and numerous splinters ; 6 crewmen were killed and 35 injured . The ship fired 28 eight @-@ inch , 100 six @-@ inch and 160 seventy @-@ five @-@ millimetre shells during the battle . 
 The damage to Bayan was repaired in several days and subsequently the cruiser patrolled off Port Arthur . Together with the protected cruiser Novik , the ship sortied on 11 March 1904 to support the destroyer Steregushchiy . Under attack by Japanese destroyers , the ship was sunk before help arrived . Early on the morning of 13 April , the Russian destroyer Strashnii fell in with four Japanese destroyers in the darkness while on patrol . Once her captain realized his mistake , the Russian ship attempted to escape but failed after a Japanese shell struck one of her torpedoes and caused it to detonate . By this time Bayan had sortied to provide support , but was only able to rescue five survivors before a Japanese squadron of protected cruisers attacked . Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov led a force of two battleships and three cruisers out to support Bayan and also ordered the rest of the First Pacific Squadron to follow as soon as they could . In the meantime , the Japanese had reported the Russian sortie to Tōgō and he arrived with all six Japanese battleships . Heavily outnumbered , Makarov ordered his ships to retreat and to join the rest of the squadron that was just exiting the harbour . <unk> , however , his flagship , Petropavlovsk , struck a naval mine and sank almost instantly . 
 Bayan sailed with the rest of the Pacific Squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok . The new squadron commander , Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset , as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle . After bombarding Imperial Japanese Army positions on 27 July , the ship struck a mine and was under repair until September . After the death of Vitgeft during the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , <unk> was promoted to rear admiral and became the commander of the First Pacific Squadron . Bayan was subsequently trapped in Port Arthur and sunk at her mooring by five 28 @-@ centimetre ( 11 in ) howitzer shells on 9 December . 
 = = = Japanese service = = = 
 After the war , Bayan 's wreck was refloated on 24 June and towed to Dairen . There she was given temporary repairs and commissioned as Aso ( named after a volcano in Kumamoto Prefecture ) on 22 August . The next day she was towed to Maizuru , Japan for permanent repairs that lasted until July 1908 . During this time , her boilers were replaced by Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers and she was rearmed with Japanese @-@ built weapons of the same size . Her 20 seventy @-@ five @-@ millimetre guns were replaced by 16 three @-@ inch guns . 
 On 7 September 1908 , Aso , together with the ex @-@ Russian protected cruiser Soya , was assigned to the Training Squadron . On 14 March 1909 they began a training cruise that took their naval cadets to the West Coast of the United States and Canada and Hawaii before they returned to Yokosuka on 7 August . The next year the two ships made a cruise to Australia and Southeast Asia that last from 1 February to 3 July 1910 . They were briefly relieved of their assignment to the Training Squadron on 25 September before rejoining it on 1 April 1911 . The next training cruise lasted from 25 November 1911 to 28 March 1912 and took the cadets to the same destinations as the 1910 cruise . On 20 April 1912 , Aso was transferred away from the Training Squadron and she was refitted in March 1913 . During this refit , her eight @-@ inch guns were replaced by a pair of six @-@ inch guns and her torpedo tubes were removed . Aso and Soya were reassigned to the Training Squadron on 1 December 1914 and they made their last training cruise from 20 April to 23 August 1915 , during which they visited Rabaul , New Guinea , and Fremantle , Australia . 
 In 1917 , Aso was converted into a minelayer , with a capacity of 420 mines , although she was not formally reclassified as such until 1 April 1920 . Aso was stricken from the navy list on 1 April 1930 and renamed Hai Kan No. 4 . She was sunk on 4 August 1932 by two submarine torpedoes after serving as a target for the heavy cruisers Myōkō and Nachi . 
 = Twilight ( Star Trek : Enterprise ) = 
 " Twilight " is the eighth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , originally broadcast on November 5 , 2003 . It was the sixtieth episode of the series overall . The episode was written by co @-@ producer Michael Sussman , and directed by former Star Trek : Voyager actor Robert Duncan McNeill . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , following an accident , Captain Jonathan Archer 's ( Scott Bakula ) long term memory is affected and he is relieved of duty . The crew of the Enterprise subsequently fail to stop the Xindi attack on Earth resulting in the remnants of the human race resettling another planet . Dr Phlox ( John Billingsley ) finds a way of curing Archer in the past , in the hope that it would undo everything since the Captain was originally injured . 
 The episode and script was praised by Bakula during the shoot , which required the actors and sets to be aged in order to appear older in later time frames . The production of the episode was suspended for a day following the death of first assistant director Jerry Fleck , who was in pre @-@ production on the following episode " North Star " , which subsequently resulted in crew changes on " Twilight " . References in the episode were made to locations previously mentioned in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Space Seed " and the film Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . On first broadcast , " Twilight " was watched by 3 @.@ 88 million viewers , more than the following episode . The critical response was positive . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While rescuing Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol from a spatial anomaly , Captain Archer is infected by subspace parasites in his cerebral cortex , resulting in anterograde amnesia . His condition prevents him from forming new long term memories . This allows him to remember everything prior to the accident , but any new memories fade within a few hours . It soon becomes clear that Archer is not fit for duty , and he is subsequently relieved of his command . T 'Pol is granted a field commission to Captain , but the mission fails and Earth , alongside every other human colony , is destroyed by the Xindi weapon . The few surviving humans form a convoy , led by the Enterprise , which travels to the planet Ceti Alpha V. 
 Twelve years pass and Archer , still plagued by memory loss , lives with T 'Pol in a house on the colony . They are visited by Doctor Phlox , who eventually engineers a cure . He also discovers that when the subspace radiation treatments kill one of the parasite clusters in Archer 's brain , it also vanishes from every other previous medical scan – as if the parasite had never existed . Therefore , since Archer will never have been infected , he would have remained Captain and possibly prevented the chain of events that led to Earth 's destruction . 
 Unfortunately , the ship , now captained by Captain Tucker , is observed and attacked by Xindi vessels before the treatments can be completed . Outnumbered and heavily damaged , Phlox , T 'Pol , and Archer race against the clock to create a subspace implosion . The ship is destroyed , but their plan works and the subspace parasites ( which exist outside the normal space / time realm ) are also destroyed by the implosion . The episode ends with the time @-@ line reset ; Archer is in sickbay recovering from a physical injury but will never develop the amnesia he originally suffered . 
 = = Production = = 
 The script for " Twilight " was written by Mike Sussman , one of the co @-@ producers on Enterprise . The producers had considered showing the episode later on in the series in order to show what could have happened if the Xindi were successful in their attack on Earth , but instead elected to show it earlier in the series to demonstrate the stakes in the storyline during season three . " Twilight " was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill , his third directing credit for the series following " Cold Front " and " The Breach " . McNeill had previously starred in Star Trek : Voyager as Tom Paris . McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for " Twilight " for the first time . He explained that after reading it , he said " Holy crap how are we going to do that ? " He explained that the episode would see the Enterprise destroyed but wasn 't yet sure how they were going to film certain sequences such as the roof being blown off the bridge and the crew being sucked out into space . 
 Filming on the episode began on September 10 , 2003 , the same day as the airing of the season three premiere episode , " The Xindi " . Production ran through to September 17 . Production was suspended for a day on 8 September following the death of first assistant director Jerry Fleck over the preceding weekend . Fleck had been in pre @-@ production for the following episode " North Star " . Following the death of Fleck , the first assistant director on " Twilight " , Michael DeMeritt , moved on to working on " North Star " and Arlene <unk> took over on " Twilight " . 
 Whilst filming the episode , Bakula described it as " potentially the best script we 've had and the best show to date " . He found it hard to describe , saying it involved " time travel into the future , parasites in my hippocampus , and Xindi and subspace implosions " . In order to represent the changes in time frames throughout the episodes , several of the cast were required to have their make @-@ up adjusted between scenes . This included adding grey make @-@ up to the dog actor who portrayed Archer 's dog , Porthos , but the scene was cut from the final broadcast . Costume changes were made to represent promotions granted to the characters over the changes in time periods . These included Bakula who wore a wig during the later time periods shown in the episode . The wig he wore had originally been created for Gary Graham in his role as Ambassador Soval . The sets on the Enterprise were dressed to represent ongoing wear and tear . 
 During the shoot of the previous episode , " The Shipment " , director David Straiton wore a suit and tie on the final day of shooting , something that Bakula described as being out of character . After McNeill heard about Straiton , he sought to outdo his fellow director . So instead , he arrived on the final day of shooting for " Twilight " wearing the uniform he wore as Tom Paris in Star Trek : Voyager . He hoped this would cheer the cast and crew up after a week of working on such a somber episode . 
 Guest stars in " Twilight " included Graham in his recurring role as Ambassador Soval , who appeared in two scenes . Brett Rickaby made a guest appearance as <unk> Ross . Rickaby had previously appeared in the television series Carnivàle . Richard Anthony Crenna was also credited in this episode as a security guard on board the Enterprise . " Twilight " contained references to the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Space Seed " and the associated film Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . These references included the humans settling on Ceti Alpha V , the planet that Khan Noonien Singh and his followers were exiled to in " Space Seed " and escaped from in Wrath of Khan . Reference is also made to the Mutara Nebula , where the climactic battle occurred between Captain James T. Kirk and Khan . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Twilight " was first aired on November 5 , 2003 on UPN . It received Nielsen ratings stating a 2 @.@ 6 / 4 % share . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 6 percent of all viewers , and 4 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast . This was the same as the ratings received by the following episode entitled " North Star " , but the total number of viewers was 200 @,@ 000 higher as " Twilight " was watched by 3 @.@ 88 million people . These figures placed " Twilight " sixth in the timeslot based on the Nielsen ratings and fifth based on the number of viewers . 
 Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website " Jammer 's Reviews " , thought that the episode 's story bore similarities to the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " Yesterday 's Enterprise " due to the alternative timeline and also the film Memento due to the memory issues suffered by Archer . Epsicokhan also suggested that the flashback sequences were similar to the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episode " The Visitor " , but was a " substantially less poignant take on hypothetical material " . He said that the episode had " something for everyone " , with an " apocalyptic " action storyline which tied in neatly to an interesting character drama . He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four . The review on Ain 't It Cool News also suggested that the storyline had been inspired by a number of different episodes in the Star Trek franchise , including the Voyager episodes " Year of Hell " and " Endgame " , as well as The Next Generation 's " Yesterday 's Enterprise " and " All Good Things ... " . But the reviewer thought that the episode presented the viewer with a sense of what is at stake with the fight against the Xindi for the first time , and gave the episode a score of four out of five , a grade described as " better than most motion pictures " . 
 The only home media release of " Twilight " has been as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The Blu ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013 . 
 = Cretan War ( 205 – 200 BC ) = 
 The Cretan War ( 205 – 200 BC ) was fought by King Philip V of Macedon , the Aetolian League , many Cretan cities ( of which Olous and Hierapytna were the most important ) and Spartan pirates against the forces of Rhodes and later Attalus I of Pergamum , Byzantium , Cyzicus , Athens , and Knossos . 
 The Macedonians had just concluded the First Macedonian War and Philip , seeing his chance to defeat Rhodes , formed an alliance with Aetolian and Spartan pirates who began raiding Rhodian ships . Philip also formed an alliance with several important Cretan cities , such as Hierapytna and Olous . With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates , Philip believed his chance to crush Rhodes was at hand . To help achieve his goal , he formed an alliance with the King of the Seleucid Empire , Antiochus the Great , against Ptolemy V of Egypt ( the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two Diadochi states ) . Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes 's allies in Thrace and around the Propontis . 
 In 202 BC , Rhodes and her allies Pergamum , Cyzicus , and Byzantium combined their fleets and defeated Philip at the Battle of Chios . Just a few months later , Philip 's fleet defeated the Rhodians at Lade . While Philip was plundering Pergamese territory and attacking cities in Caria , Attalus I of Pergamum went to Athens to try to create a diversion . He succeeded in securing an alliance with the Athenians , who immediately declared war on the Macedonians . The King of Macedon could not remain inactive ; he assailed Athens with his navy and with some infantry . The Romans warned him , however , to withdraw or face war with Rome . After suffering a defeat at the hands of the Rhodian and Pergamese fleets , Philip withdrew , but not before attacking the city of Abydos on the Hellespont . Abydos fell after a long siege and most of its inhabitants committed suicide . Philip rejected the Roman ultimatum to stop attacking Greek states and the Romans declared war on Macedon . This left the Cretan cities with no major allies , and the largest city of Crete , Knossos , joined the Rhodians . Faced with this combination , both Hierapytna and Olous surrendered and were forced to sign a treaty favourable to Rhodes and Knossos . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In 205 BC , the First Macedonian War came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Phoenice , under the terms of which the Macedonians were not allowed to expand westwards . Rome , meanwhile , was preoccupied with Carthage , and Philip hoped to take advantage of this to seize control of the Greek world . He knew that his ambitions would be aided by an alliance with Crete and began pressing the Cretans to attack Rhodian assets . Having crushed Pergamum , the dominant Greek state in Asia Minor , and formed an alliance with Aetolia , Philip was now opposed by no major Greek power other than Rhodes . Rhodes , an island state that dominated the south @-@ eastern Mediterranean economically and militarily , was formally allied to Philip , but was also allied to his enemy Rome . Furthermore , Philip worked towards consolidating his position as the major power in the Balkans . Marching his forces to Macedon 's northern frontier , he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Illyrians , who lost 10 @,@ 000 men in battle . With his northern frontier secured , Philip was able to turn his attention towards the Aegean Sea . 
 = = Piracy and early campaigns = = 
 The Treaty of Phoenice prohibited Philip from expanding westward into Illyria or the Adriatic Sea , so the king turned his attentions eastwards to the Aegean Sea , where he started to build a large fleet . 
 Philip saw two ways of shaking Rhodes ' dominance of the sea : piracy and war . Deciding to use both methods , he encouraged his allies to begin pirate attacks against Rhodian ships . Philip convinced the Cretans , who had been involved in piracy for a long time , the Aetolians , and the Spartans to take part in the piracy . The lure for these nations was the promise of vast loot from captured Rhodian vessels . He sent the Aetolian freebooter <unk> on a large <unk> through the Aegean , during the course of which he plundered the Cyclades and Rhodian territories . Additionally , Philip sought to weaken the Rhodians ' naval capacity through subterfuge . He achieved this by sending his agent , Heracleides , to Rhodes where he succeeded in burning 13 boat @-@ sheds . 
 By the end of 205 BC , Rhodes had been significantly weakened by these raids , and Philip saw his chance to go forward with the second part of his plan , direct military confrontation . He convinced the cities of Hierapytna and Olous and other cities in Eastern Crete to declare war against Rhodes . 
 Rhodes ' initial response to the declaration of war was diplomatic ; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip . The Romans , however , were wary of another war , the Second Punic War having just ended . The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war , even after Pergamum , Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side , but was unable to sway the city 's war @-@ weary population . 
 At this point Philip further provoked Rhodes by attacking Cius , which was an Aetolian @-@ allied city on the coast of the Sea of Marmara . Despite attempts by Rhodes and other states to mediate a settlement , Philip captured and razed Cius as well as its neighbour <unk> . Philip then handed these cities over to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , the King of Bithynia , Prusias I who rebuilt and renamed the cities <unk> after himself and <unk> after his wife , respectively . In return for these cities Prusias promised that he would continue on expanding his kingdom at the expense of Pergamum ( his latest war with Pergamum had ended in 205 ) . The seizure of these cities also enraged the Aetolians , as both were members of the Aetolian League . The alliance between Aetolia and Macedon was held together only by the Aetolians ' fear of Philip , and this incident worsened the already tenuous relationship . Philip next compelled the cities of Lysimachia and Chalcedon , which were also members of the Aetolian League , to break off their alliance with Aetolia probably through the threatened use of violence . 
 On the way home , Philip 's fleet stopped at the island of Thasos off the coast of Thrace . Philip 's general <unk> , went to the island 's eponymous capital to meet emissaries from the city . The envoys said they would surrender the city to the Macedonians on the conditions that they not receive a garrison , that they not have to pay tribute or contribute soldiers to the Macedonian army and that they continue to use their own laws . <unk> replied that the king accepted the terms , and the Thasians opened their gates to the Macedonians . Once within the walls , however , Philip ordered his soldiers to enslave all the citizens , who were then sold away , and to loot the city . Philip 's action during this campaign had a drastic impact on his reputation amongst the Greek states , where his actions were considered to be no better than the savage raids of the Aetolians and the Romans during the First Macedonian War . 
 In 204 BC or the spring of 203 BC , Philip was approached by <unk> and Agathocles of Egypt , the ministers of the young pharaoh Ptolemy V. The ministers sought to arrange a marriage between Ptolemy and Philip 's daughter in order to form an alliance against Antiochus III the Great , emperor of the Seleucid Empire , who was seeking to expand his empire at Egypt 's expense . Philip , however , declined the proposal and in the winter of 203 BC @-@ 202 BC , Philip formed an alliance with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire . Philip agreed to help Antiochus to seize Egypt and Cyprus , while Antiochus promised to help Philip take control of Cyrene , the Cyclades and Ionia . 
 In late 202 BC , the Aetolians sent ambassadors to Rome in order to form an alliance against Philip . Macedonian aggression had convinced the Aetolian League that they needed additional protectors in order to maintain their current position . However , the Romans rebuffed the Aetolian envoys as they were still seething about the fact that the Aetolians had come to terms with Philip to end the First Macedonian War . The unsupportive attitude of Rome encouraged Philip to continue with his Aegean campaign . Philip considered control of the Aegean to be paramount in maintaining his regional dominance . By ruling the Aegean he would be able to isolate Pergamum as well as restrict Roman attempts to interfere in the Eastern Mediterranean . 
 = = War against Pergamum and Rhodes = = 
 With the Seleucid treaty concluded , Philip 's army attacked Ptolemy 's territories in Thrace . Upon hearing that the King of Pergamum , Attalus I , had joined the Rhodian alliance , Philip became enraged and invaded Pergamese territory . However , before having set out to campaign against Philip 's navy in the Aegean Sea , Attalus had strengthened the city walls of his capital . By taking this and other precautions , he hoped to prevent Philip from a seizing a large amount of booty from his territory . Seeing that the city was undermanned , he sent his skirmishers against it , but they were easily repelled . Judging that the city walls were too strong , Philip retreated after destroying a few temples , including the temple of Aphrodite and the sanctuary of Athena Nicephorus . After the Macedonians captured <unk> , they advanced to plunder the plain of Thebe , but the booty proved less fruitful than anticipated . Once he arrived at Thebe , he demanded supplies from the Seleucid governor of the region , Zeuxis . Zeuxis , however , never planned to give Philip substantial supplies . 
 After withdrawing from Pergamese land , Philip with the Macedonian fleet headed south and after subduing the Cyclades , took the island of Samos from Ptolemy V , capturing the Egyptian fleet stationed there . The fleet then turned north and laid siege to the island of Chios . Philip was planning to use the northern Aegean islands as stepping @-@ stones as he worked his way down to Rhodes . The siege was not going well for Philip and the situation worsened as the combined fleets of Pergamum , Rhodes and their new allies , Kos , Cyzicus and Byzantium approached from both the north and south . Philip , comprehending that the allies were attempting to seal his line of retreat , lifted the siege and began to sail for a friendly harbour . However , he was confronted by the allied fleet , precipitating the Battle of Chios . 
 The Macedonian fleet of around 200 ships , manned by 30 @,@ 000 men , significantly outnumbered the coalition 's fleet of sixty @-@ five large warships , nine medium vessels and three triremes . The battle began with Attalus , who was commanding the allied left wing , advancing against the Macedonian right wing , while the allied right flank under the command of the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus attacked the Macedonian 's left wing . The allies gained the upper hand on their left flank and captured Philip 's flagship ; Philip 's admiral , Democrates , was slain in the fighting . Meanwhile , on the allied right flank , the Macedonians were initially successful in pushing the Rhodians back . Theophiliscus , fighting on his flagship , received three fatal wounds but managed to rally his men and defeat the Macedonian boarders . The Rhodians were able to use their superior navigational skills to incapacitate large numbers of Macedonian ships , swinging the battle back into their favour . 
 On the allied left flank , Attalus saw one of his ships being sunk by the enemy and the one next to it in danger . He decided to sail to the rescue with two quadriremes and his flagship . Philip , however , whose ship had not been involved in the fighting to this point , saw that Attalus had strayed some distance from his fleet and sailed to attack him with four quinqueremes and three <unk> . Attalus , seeing Philip approaching , fled in terror and was forced to run his ships aground . Upon landing he spread coins , purple robes and other splendid articles on the deck of his ship and fled to the city of Erythrae . When the Macedonians arrived at the shore , they stopped to collect the plunder . Philip , thinking that Attalus had perished in the chase , started towing away the Pergamese flagship . 
 Following the flight of their monarch , the Pergamese fleet withdrew north . However , having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing , the Macedonian left wing disengaged and retreated to join its victorious right flank . The withdrawal of the Macedonian left permitted the Rhodians to sail unmolested back into Chios ' harbour . 
 While the battle was not decisive , it was a significant setback for Philip , who lost 92 ships destroyed and 7 captured . On the allied side , the Pergamese had three ships destroyed and two captured , while the Rhodians lost three ships sunk and none captured . During the battle the Macedonians lost 6 @,@ 000 rowers and 3 @,@ 000 marines killed and had 2 @,@ 000 men captured . The casualties for the allies were significantly lower , with the Pergamese losing 70 men the Rhodians 60 killed , the allies as a whole losing 600 captured . Peter Green describes this defeat as " crippling and costly " , with Philip sustaining more casualties than he had previously suffered in any battle . 
 After this battle , the Rhodian admirals decided to leave Chios and sail back home . On the way back to Rhodes , the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he received at Chios , but before he died he appointed <unk> as his successor . As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus on the shore of Asia Minor , Philip 's fleet attacked them . Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes . The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of <unk> Cone . 
 = = Asia Minor campaign = = 
 Philip , disappointed by the spoils in Mysia , proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria . He invested <unk> , which held out bravely at first , but when Philip set up his artillery , he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or they would all be killed . The citizens decided to abandon the city . At this stage in the campaign , Philip 's army was running out of food , so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies . Since the Magnesians had no grain , Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army . Subsequently , Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in quick succession . 
 While Philip 's fleet was wintering in <unk> , the combined Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour . The situation in the Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering . The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis . Philip , however , managed to get out by trickery . He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians to say that he was preparing to attack the allies the next day . Upon hearing the news , Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack . While the allies were making their preparations , Philip slipped past them by night with his fleet , leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp . 
 While Philip was involved in this campaign , his allies the Acarnanians became involved in a war against Athens after the Athenians murdered two Acarnanian athletes . The Acarnanians complained to Philip about this provocation , and he decided to send a force under the command of Nicanor the Elephant to assist them in their attack on Attica . The Macedonians and their allies plundered and looted Attica before attacking Athens . The invaders made it as far as the Academy of Athens when the Roman ambassadors in the city ordered the Macedonians to retreat or to face war with Rome . 
 Philip 's fleet had just escaped from the allied blockade and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens . The Macedonian squadron sailed into Piraeus and captured four Athenian ships . As the Macedonian squadron was retreating , the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet , which had followed Philip 's ships across the Aegean , appeared from the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians . The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships , which they returned to the Athenians . The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro @-@ Macedonian tribes , the Demetrias and <unk> tribes , with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings . Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians . 
 The Pergamese fleet sailed back to their base at Aegina and the Rhodians set out to conquer all the Macedonian islands from Aegina to Rhodes , successfully assaulting all except Andros , Paros and <unk> . Philip ordered his prefect on the island of Euboea , <unk> , to assault Athens once again with 2 @,@ 000 infantry and 200 cavalry . <unk> was unable to capture Athens , but ravaged the surrounding countryside . 
 = = Roman intervention = = 
 Meanwhile , Rhodian , Pergamese , Egyptian , anti @-@ Macedonian Cretan and Athenian delegations travelled to Rome to appear before the Senate . When they were given audience they informed the Senate about the treaty between Philip and Antiochus and complained of Philip 's attacks on their territories . In response to these complaints the Romans sent three ambassadors , Marcus Aemilius Lepidus , Gaius Claudius Nero and Publius Sempronius <unk> to Egypt with the orders to go to Rhodes after speaking with Ptolemy . 
 While this was happening , Philip attacked and occupied the cities in Thrace which still belonged to Ptolemy , Maroneia , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The Macedonians then advanced on the Thracian Chersonese where they captured the cities of Perinthus , Sestos , Elaeus , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Philip then descended to the city of Abydos , which was held by a combined Pergamese and Rhodian garrison . Philip started the siege by blockading the city by land and sea to stop attempts to reinforce or supply the city . The Abydenians , full of confidence , dislodged some of the siege engines with their own catapults while some of Philip 's other engines were burnt by the defenders . With their siege weaponry in tatters , the Macedonians started undermining the city 's walls , eventually succeeding in collapsing the outer wall . 
 The situation was now grave for the defenders and they decided to send two of their most prominent citizens to Philip as negotiators . Appearing before Philip , these men offered to surrender the city to him on the conditions that the Rhodian and the Pergamese garrisons were allowed to leave the city under a truce and that all the citizens were permitted to leave the city with the clothes they were wearing and go wherever they pleased , in effect meaning an unconditional surrender . Philip replied that they should " surrender at discretion or fight like men . " The ambassadors , powerless to do more , carried this response back to the <unk> 
 Informed of this response , the city 's leaders called an assembly to determine their course of action . They decided to liberate all slaves to secure their loyalty , to place all the children and their nurses in the gymnasium and to put all the women in the temple of Artemis . They also asked for everyone to bring forward their gold and silver and any clothes that were valuable so they could put them in the boats of the Rhodians and the <unk> . Fifty elder and trusted men were elected to carry out these tasks . All the citizens then swore an oath . As Polybius writes : 
 After reciting the oath , they brought forward the priests and everyone swore that they would defeat the enemy or die <unk> 
 When the interior wall fell , the men , true to their promise , sprang from the ruins and fought with great courage , forcing Philip to send his troops forward in relays to the front line . By nightfall the Macedonians retreated to camp . That night the Abydenians resolved to save the women and children and at daybreak they sent some priests and priestess with a garland across to the Macedonians , surrendering the city to Philip . 
 Meanwhile , Attalus sailed across the Aegean to the island of Tenedos . The youngest of the Roman ambassadors , Marcus Aemilius Lepidus , had heard about the siege at Abydos while he was in Rhodes and he arrived at Abydos to find Philip . Meeting the king outside the city , Lepidus informed him of the Senate 's wishes . Polybius writes : 
 While Philip was walking through Abydos , he saw people killing themselves and their families by stabbing , burning , hanging , and jumping down wells and from rooftops . Philip was surprised to see this , and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day 's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide . The Abydenians , who were bent on following the orders of the original decree , thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died , and refused to live under these terms . Apart from those in chains or similar restraints , each family individually hurried to their deaths . 
 Philip then ordered another attack on Athens ; his army failed to take either Athens or Eleusis , but subjected Attica to the worst ravaging the <unk> had seen since the Persian Wars . In response , the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria . Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign in order to deal with the Romans and the situation in Greece . Thus began the Second Macedonian War . 
 After Philip 's withdrawal from his campaign against Rhodes , the Rhodians were free to attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies . Rhodes ' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of Knossos saw that the war was going in Rhodes ' favour and decided to join Rhodes in an attempt to gain supremacy over the island . Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous . Now under attack on two fronts , Hierapytna surrendered . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Under the treaty signed at the conclusion of the war , Hierapytna agreed to break off all relations and alliances with foreign powers and to place all its harbors and bases at Rhodes ' disposal . Olous , among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found , had to accept Rhodian domination . As a result , Rhodes was left with control of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war . The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War . 
 The war had no particular short @-@ term effect on the rest of Crete . Pirates and mercenaries there continued in their old occupations after the war 's end . In the Battle of Cynoscephalae during the Second Macedonian War three years later , Cretan mercenary archers fought for both the Romans and the Macedonians . 
 The war was costly for Philip and the Macedonians , losing them a fleet that had taken three years to build as well as triggering the defection of their Greek allies , the Achean League and the Aetolian League , to the Romans . In the war 's immediate aftermath the <unk> , a barbarian tribe , swarmed across the northern border of Macedon , but Philip was able to repel this attack . In 197 , however , Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans and was forced to surrender . This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1 @,@ 000 talents of silver to the Romans . 
 The Rhodians regained control over the Cyclades and reconfirmed their naval supremacy over the Aegean . The Rhodians ' possession of eastern Crete allowed them to largely stamp out piracy in that area , but pirate attacks on Rhodian shipping continued and eventually led to the Second Cretan War . Attalus died in 197 and was succeeded by his son , Eumenes II , who continued his father 's anti @-@ Macedonian policy . The Pergamese , meanwhile , came out of the war having gained several Aegean islands which had been in Philip 's possession and went on to become the supreme power in Asia Minor , rivaled only by Antiochus .

 = Half @-@ Life ( video game ) = 
 Half @-@ Life ( stylized as <unk> @-@ LIFE ) is a science fiction first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Valve L.L.C. , released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows . It was Valve L.L.C. ' s debut product and the first in the Half @-@ Life series . Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman , who must fight his way out of a secret research facility after a teleportation experiment goes disastrously wrong , fighting enemies and solving puzzles . 
 Unlike many other games at the time , Half @-@ Life features no cutscenes ; the player has uninterrupted control of Freeman , and the story is told through scripted sequences seen through his eyes . Valve L.L.C. co @-@ founder Gabe Newell said the team had wanted to create an immersive world rather than a " shooting gallery " . The game 's engine , GoldSrc , is a heavily modified version of the Quake engine licensed from id Software . 
 Half @-@ Life received acclaim for its graphics , realistic gameplay , and seamless narrative . It won over fifty PC " Game of the Year " awards and is often considered one of the greatest games of all time . It influenced first @-@ person shooters for years after its release ; according to IGN , the history of the genre " breaks down pretty cleanly into pre @-@ Half @-@ Life and post @-@ Half @-@ Life eras . " 
 Half @-@ Life had sold eight million copies by November 16 , 2004 , and 9 @.@ 3 million copies by December 2008 . It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001 , and OS X and Linux in 2013 . It was followed in 2004 by a sequel , Half @-@ Life 2 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Half @-@ Life is a first @-@ person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game . Unlike most of its peers at the time , Half @-@ Life used scripted sequences , such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door , to advance major plot points . Compared to most first @-@ person shooters of the time , which relied on cut @-@ scene intermissions to detail their plotlines , Half @-@ Life 's story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences , keeping the player in control of the first @-@ person viewpoint . In line with this , the game has no cut @-@ scenes , and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon , who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game ; the player sees " through his eyes " for the entire length of the game . Half @-@ Life has no " levels " ; it instead divides the game by chapters , whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game . Progress through the world is continuous , except for short pauses for loading . 
 The game regularly integrates puzzles , such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts , or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to . Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy , like turning on a steam valve to spray hot steam at their enemies . There are few " bosses " in the conventional sense , where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation . Instead , such organisms occasionally define chapters , and the player is generally expected to use the terrain , rather than firepower , to kill the " boss " . Late in the game , the player receives a " long jump module " for the HEV suit , which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping . The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer @-@ style jumping puzzles in Xen toward the end of the game . 
 For the most part the player battles through the game alone , but is occasionally assisted by non @-@ player characters ; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player , the former who will fight alongside and both who can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information . A wide array of enemies populate the game including parasites of Xen such as headcrabs , <unk> , headcrab zombies and Vortigaunts . The player also faces human opponents , in particular Hazardous Environment Combat Unit ( <unk> ) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra @-@ dimensional threats and silence all witnesses . 
 The iconic weapon of Half @-@ Life is the crowbar . The game also features numerous conventional weapons , such as the Glock 17 pistol ( with the HD pack enabled , it resembles a Beretta ) , Franchi <unk> @-@ 12 shotgun ( with the HD pack enabled , the stock is folded up ) , MP5 submachine gun with an attached <unk> grenade launcher ( with the HD pack enabled , it resembles an M4 Carbine ) , Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver , and rocket launcher as well as unusual weapons ranging from a crossbow to weapons from Xen and genetically engineered weapons such as an organic homing gun and flesh @-@ eating parasites called " <unk> " . Two experimental weapons , the tau cannon ( nicknamed the Gauss gun ) and the <unk> Gun , are built by the scientists in the facility and are acquired by the player late in the game .

 Most of the game is set in a remote desert area of New Mexico in the Black Mesa Research Facility , a fictional complex that bears many similarities to both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Area 51 , at some point during the 2000s . The game 's protagonist is the theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman , who holds a Ph.D. from MIT . Freeman becomes one of the survivors of an experiment at Black Mesa that goes horribly wrong , when an unexpected " resonance cascade " — a fictitious phenomenon — rips dimensional seams , devastating the facility . Aliens from another dimension known as Xen subsequently enter the facility through these dimensional seams ( an event known as the " Black Mesa incident " ) . 
 As Freeman tries to make his way out of the ruined facility , he soon discovers that he is caught between two sides : the hostile aliens and the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit , a U.S. Marine Corps special operations unit dispatched to cover up the incident by eliminating the organisms , as well as Dr. Freeman and the other surviving Black Mesa personnel to keep them from talking . Throughout the game , a mysterious figure known ( but not actually referred to in @-@ game ) as the " G @-@ Man " regularly appears , and seems to be monitoring Freeman 's progress . Ultimately , Freeman uses the cooperation of surviving scientists and security officers to work his way towards the mysterious " Lambda Complex " of Black Mesa ( signified with the Greek " λ " character ) , where a team of survivors teleport him to the alien world Xen to kill the Nihilanth , the gigantic entity keeping Xen 's side of the dimensional rift open . 
 The game 's plot was originally inspired by the video games Doom and Quake ( both PC games produced by id Software ) , Stephen King 's short story / novella The Mist , and an episode of The Outer Limits called " The Borderland " . It was later developed by Valve 's in @-@ house writer and author , Marc Laidlaw , who wrote the books Dad 's Nuke and The 37th Mandala . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Dr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8 : 47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility , using the advanced Black Mesa train system that leads through the facility . He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab , his work place , and is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today , so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit . He goes to the lab 's lower levels , arriving at the Anti @-@ Mass Chamber , where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen the lab has ever worked with . He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti @-@ Mass Spectrometer for analysis . However , as soon as the specimen enters the beam , the spectrometer explodes , creating a sudden catastrophe called a " resonance cascade " , and opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen . Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms , including a circle of Vortigaunts , shortly before blacking out . 
 Freeman awakens in the ruined test chamber and surveys the destroyed lab , strewn with the bodies of scientists and security personnel . Finding survivors , Freeman learns that communication to the outside is completely cut and is encouraged to head to the surface for help because of the protection afforded by his suit . His journey consists of sidestepping Black Mesa 's structural damage and defending himself against hostile Xen creatures , such as the parasitic headcrab which attaches itself to a human host before enslaving it . Other survivors claim a rescue team has been dispatched , only to discover that the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit sent in is killing both the organisms and the personnel there as part of a government cover @-@ up of the catastrophe . 
 Freeman fights the Marines before reaching the surface of Black Mesa , where he learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have the means to resolve the problems created by the cascade . Gordon travels to the other end of the facility to assist them . However , Gordon encounters several hurdles throughout the facility , such as reactivating a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant creature of three tentacles , using an aged railway system in order to get to and launch a crucial satellite rocket , and fighting a group of Black Ops soldiers , before he is captured by Marines and dumped in a garbage compactor . Gordon escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility where he discovers an extensive collection of specimens collected from Xen , long before the resonance cascade . 
 Reaching the surface once more , Gordon finds a warzone . Despite calling for reinforcements , the Marines are being overwhelmed by the aliens . Scaling cliffs and navigating destroyed buildings , Gordon reaches safety underground . The Marines begin to pull out of Black Mesa and airstrikes begin . Meanwhile , Gordon goes through underground water channels as aliens pick off the remaining Marines . He arrives at the Lambda Complex , where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen in the first place . After meeting the remaining personnel , Gordon is told the satellite he launched failed to reverse the effects of the resonance cascade because an immensely powerful being on the other side of the rift is keeping it open . Gordon must therefore kill this being to stop the <unk> invasion and the scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen . 
 Entering the borderworld Xen , Gordon encounters organisms that had been brought into Black Mesa , as well as the remains of HEV @-@ wearing researchers that came before him . He fights his way through <unk> , the huge egg laying headcrab , an alien camp and arrives at a massive alien factory , which is creating the Alien Grunt soldiers . After fighting his way through levitating creatures , he finds a giant portal and enters it . In a vast cave , Gordon confronts the Nihilanth , the entity maintaining the rift , and destroys it . The Nihilanth dies in an explosion , knocking Gordon unconscious . 
 Freeman awakens , stripped of his weapons , to find the G @-@ Man , who has been watching over Gordon throughout . The G @-@ Man praises Freeman 's actions in Xen . He explains that his " employers " , believing that Freeman has potential , have authorized him to offer Freeman a job . The player is then given a choice . If the offer is accepted , Freeman is congratulated by the G @-@ Man and placed into stasis . If he refuses , he is teleported to a map full of enemies , and the game ends .

 Valve , based in Kirkland , Washington , was founded in 1996 by former Microsoft employees Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell . For its first product , Valve settled on a concept for a horror 3D action game using the Quake engine licensed from id Software . Valve eventually modified 70 % of the engine 's code , adding skeletal animation and Direct3D support . 
 According to designer Harry <unk> , id Software 's 1993 first @-@ person shooter Doom was a major influence , and the team wanted Half @-@ Life to " scare you like Doom did " . Newell said that " Half @-@ Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first @-@ person genre . Many of us had fallen in love with videogames because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field , and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities . Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries . " 
 The team had early difficulties with level design ; in desperation , they eventually built a single level including every weapon , enemy , scripted event , and idea they had so far conceived . This level inspired the studio to continue development . 
 The project had the working title Quiver , after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King 's novella The Mist , an early inspiration for the game . The name Half @-@ Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme , not clichéd , and had a corresponding visual symbol : the Greek letter λ ( lower @-@ case lambda ) , which represents the decay constant in the half @-@ life equation . 
 Valve struggled to find a publisher , as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first @-@ time developer . Sierra On @-@ Line signed Valve for a one @-@ game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game , especially one based on the Quake engine . Valve first showed Half @-@ Life in early 1997 ; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year , where Valve demonstrated the game 's animation and artificial intelligence . At E3 1998 it was given Game Critics Awards for " Best PC Game " and " Best Action Game " . 
 In August 1997 , Valve hired science fiction author Marc Laidlaw to work on characters and level design . The soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey . Half @-@ Life was originally planned for release in late 1997 , to compete with Quake II , but Valve decided the game needed significant revision . The studio completely reworked the game 's artificial intelligence and levels in the year leading up to its release . The release date was delayed several times in 1998 before the game was finally released in November of that year . A few days prior to the release the developers discovered an error in the source code . Developers fixed the error by adding corrections into a single line of the source code . 
 Valve released two demos for Half @-@ Life . The first , Half @-@ Life : Day One , contained the first fifth of the game , and was distributed with certain graphic cards . The second demo , Half @-@ Life : Uplink , was released on February 12 , 1999 , featuring heavily revised variations of levels cut during Half @-@ Life 's development phase .

 Half @-@ Life was ported to the PlayStation 2 by Gearbox Software and released in 2001 . This version of the game had a significant overhaul in terms of both character models , weapons , and more advanced and extended levels and general map geometry , incorporated from work on a planned Dreamcast version . Also added in is a head @-@ to @-@ head play and a co @-@ op expansion called Half @-@ Life : Decay that allowed players to play as the two women scientists Dr. Cross and Dr. Green at Black Mesa . Another interesting feature allowed players to use a USB mouse and keyboard , a feature previously unused on the platform . 
 A version for Mac OS , ported by <unk> , was announced but never released . <unk> Digital Laboratories , Inc. was slated to develop a port to the Dreamcast , to be released near the end of 2000 . The Dreamcast version revamped the graphics of the game with double the polygon count of the original models . Like Opposing Force for PC and Decay for PlayStation 2 , the Dreamcast version was set to have its own exclusive expansion , Blue Shift . However , after many delays , the Dreamcast version was cancelled in June 2001 due to " changing market conditions " . The Blue Shift expansion was then preserved and ported over to become Half @-@ Life 's second expansion for PC . 
 That year Sierra On @-@ Line showed its PlayStation 2 port at E3 2001 . This version was released in North America in late October of the same year , followed by a European release just a month later . Around the same time , Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift , which was intended to be the Dreamcast @-@ exclusive side story , was eventually released on Windows as the second Half @-@ life Expansion Pack . It featured the " High Definition Pack " , upgraded models originally in the Dreamcast version , which overhauled the graphics of the original Half @-@ Life and Opposing Force as well . 
 On January 29 , 2013 , Valve released beta versions of ports for OS X and Linux , and finalized them on February 14 , 2013 .

 = = = Expansions = = = 
 Two expansion packs by outside developer Gearbox Software have been released for the PC version : Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force ( 1999 ) and Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift ( 2001 ) . The former returns the player to Black Mesa during the events of Half @-@ Life 's storyline , but this time from the perspective of Adrian Shephard , one of the Marines in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit sent to cover up evidence of the incident . It introduced several new weapons , new non @-@ player characters , both friendly and hostile and new , previously unseen areas of the facility . The expansion is shorter than Half @-@ Life , having 11 chapters to the original 's 19 . 
 Blue Shift returns the player to Half @-@ Life 's Black Mesa timeline once more , this time as Barney Calhoun , one of the facility 's security guards . The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the cancelled Dreamcast version . Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack , that gave the player the option to update the look of Half @-@ Life , Opposing Force , and the new Blue Shift content . Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force : aside from a few variations on existing models , all content was already present in the original Half @-@ Life . 
 Half @-@ Life : Decay was another expansion by Gearbox , released only as an extra with the PlayStation 2 version of Half @-@ Life . The add @-@ on featured cooperative gameplay in which two players could solve puzzles or fight against the many foes in the Half @-@ Life universe . 
 In 2000 , a compilation pack titled the Half @-@ Life : Platinum Pack was released , including ( with their respective manuals ) Half @-@ Life , Counter @-@ Strike , Team Fortress Classic , Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force . In 2002 , the pack was re @-@ released under the new titles Half @-@ Life Platinum Collection and Half @-@ Life : Generation . These new iterations also included the Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift expansion pack ; though if registered on Steam , Day of Defeat , as well as Ricochet and Deathmatch Classic were also included . In 2005 , Half @-@ Life 1 : Anthology was released , containing Steam @-@ only versions of the following games on a single DVD : Half @-@ Life , Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force , Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift , and Team Fortress Classic . 
 = = = Sequels = = = 
 The sequel , Half @-@ Life 2 , was merely a rumor until it was finally revealed at E3 in May 2003 , which ignited a firestorm of hype surrounding the game . The player again takes the role of Gordon Freeman , this time 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the dystopic Eastern European " City 17 " where he must fight as part of a rebellion against an alien regime . After a series of controversies and delays , Half @-@ Life 2 was released on November 16 , 2004 . 
 On June 1 , 2006 Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode One was released . It was announced as part of a trilogy of episodes , of which the second was released on October 10 , 2007 , as part of The Orange Box . No third episode in the Half @-@ Life 2 trilogy was released .

 To experience firsthand the processes mod @-@ makers would have to go through with the new engine , Valve ported Half @-@ Life ( dubbed Half @-@ Life : Source ) and Counter @-@ Strike to their new Source engine . Half @-@ Life : Source is a straight port , lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack . However , it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects , as well as Half @-@ Life 2 's realistic physics engine . They also added several other features from Half @-@ Life 2 , including improved dynamic lightmaps , vertex maps , <unk> , and a <unk> system with cleaner , higher resolution , specular texture and normal maps , as well as utilization of the render @-@ to @-@ texture soft shadows found in Half @-@ Life 2 's Source engine , along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16 @-@ bit color prerendered bitmap skies . The Half @-@ Life port possesses many of the Source engine 's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine . Later updates added field of view options , support for OS X and Linux , an optional high @-@ definition texture pack , among other improvements . Half @-@ Life : Source is available with special editions of Half @-@ Life 2 , or separately on Steam . 
 Half @-@ Life : Source has been criticized for not fully utilizing many of the features of the Source engine found in Half @-@ Life 2 , as it still uses textures and models from the original game . In response to this , a third @-@ party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed . The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14 , 2012 , with the second promised to be coming later . 
 On June 10 , 2005 Valve announced through their Steam update news service an upcoming port of Half @-@ Life Deathmatch , the multiplayer portion of the original game , much in the same fashion as the earlier released Half @-@ Life : Source . No exact release date was given , simply the words " In the coming weeks ... " On July 2 , 2005 Half @-@ Life Deathmatch : Source was released . 
 = = = Third @-@ party mods = = = 
 From its release in 1998 , Half @-@ Life saw fervent support from independent game developers , due in no small part to support and encouragement from Valve Software . Worldcraft , the level @-@ design tool used during the game 's development , was included with the game software . Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft 's eventual release as a retail product , but these plans never materialized . Valve also released a software development kit , enabling developers to modify the game and create mods . Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1 @.@ 1 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 patch . Many supporting tools ( including texture editors , model editors , and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor <unk> ) were either created or updated to work with Half @-@ Life . 
 The Half @-@ Life software development kit served as the development base for many multiplayer mods , including the Valve @-@ developed Team Fortress Classic and Deathmatch Classic ( an updated version of Quake ) . Other mods such as Counter @-@ Strike and Day of Defeat ( DOD ) began life as the work of independent developers ( self @-@ termed " modders " ) who later received aid from Valve . Other multiplayer mods include Action Half @-@ Life , Firearms , Science and Industry , The Specialists , Pirates , Vikings and Knights , Natural Selection and Sven Co @-@ op . 
 Numerous single player mods have also been created , like USS <unk> ( 1999 , a futuristic action @-@ adventure on board a zoological research spaceship ) , The Xeno Project 1 and 2 ( 1999 – 2005 , a two @-@ part mod starting in Xen and again including spaceships ) , Edge of Darkness ( 2000 , which features some unused Half @-@ Life models ) , Half @-@ Life : Absolute Redemption ( 2000 , which brings back Gordon Freeman for four additional episodes and another encounter with the G @-@ Man ) , They Hunger ( 2000 – 2001 , a survival horror total conversion trilogy involving zombies ) , <unk> ( 2001 , a follow @-@ up to the original Half @-@ Life story with improved graphics ) , <unk> Else ( 2002 , Side story to the original Half @-@ Life ) , and Heart of Evil ( 2003 , Vietnam war with zombies ) . 
 Some Half @-@ Life modifications eventually landed on retail shelves . Counter @-@ Strike was the most successful , having been released in six different editions : as a standalone product ( 2000 ) , as part of the Platinum Pack ( 2000 ) , as an Xbox version ( 2003 ) , as a single player spin @-@ off called Counter @-@ Strike : Condition Zero ( 2004 ) , Counter @-@ Strike : Source , which runs on Half @-@ Life 2 's Source engine , and the newest addition Counter @-@ Strike : Global Offensive , also running on the Source engine . Team Fortress Classic , Day of Defeat , Gunman Chronicles ( 2000 , a futuristic Western movie @-@ style total conversion with emphasis on its single player mode ) and Sven Co @-@ op were also released as stand @-@ alone products . 
 Black Mesa , a fan @-@ made remake of Half @-@ Life utilising the Source engine , began development in 2005 , and was released as a free download on September 14 , 2012 . The free 2007 Source SDK base is needed to run the game . It has been confirmed that Black Mesa will be distributed via Steam ; the remake was among the first ten titles whose release on the platform was approved using Valve 's <unk> service Steam Greenlight . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Half @-@ Life 's public reception was overwhelmingly positive in terms of reviews , acclaim and sales . As of November 16 , 2004 , eight million copies of the game had been sold , by 2008 9 @.@ 3 million copies had been sold at retail . The game has won over 50 Game of the Year awards . 
 Half @-@ Life was universally acclaimed , earning an overall score of 96 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic . Computer Gaming World 's Jeff Green said that the game " is not just one of the best games of the year . It 's one of the best games of any year , an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition , and - in its single @-@ player form - is the best shooter since the original Doom " . IGN described it as " a tour de force in game design , the definitive single player game in a first person shooter " . IGN has also respected the game as one of the most influential video games . GameSpot claimed that it was the " closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken " . GameSpot inducted Half @-@ Life into their " Greatest Games of All Time " list in May 2007 . In 2004 , GameSpy held a Title Fight , in which readers voted on what they thought was the " greatest game of all time " , and Half @-@ Life was the overall winner of the survey . In the November 1999 , October 2001 , and April 2005 issues of PC Gamer , Half @-@ Life was named " Best Game of All Time " / " Best PC Game Ever " . 
 The immersive gaming experience and interactive environment was cited by several reviewers as being revolutionary . Allgame said " It isn 't everyday that you come across a game that totally <unk> an entire genre , but Half @-@ Life has done just that " . Hot Games commented on the realism of the game , and how the environment " all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison " . Gamers Depot found the game engaging , stating that they have " yet to play a more immersive game period " . 
 Despite the praise that the game has received , there have also been some complaints . The Electric Playground said that Half @-@ Life was an " immersive and engaging entertainment experience " , but said that this only lasted for the first half of the game , explaining that the game " peaked too soon " . 
 Guinness World Records awarded Half @-@ Life with the world record for Best @-@ Selling First @-@ Person Shooter of All Time ( PC ) in the Guinness World Records : Gamer 's Edition 2008 . 
 A short film based upon Half @-@ Life entitled Half @-@ Life : Uplink , was developed by Cruise Control , a British marketing agency , and was released on March 15 , 1999 . However , Sierra withdrew it from circulation , after itself and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film . The critical reception of the film was very poor . The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility , trying to discover what has happened there . 
 = Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō = 
 Hiyō ( <unk> , " Flying Hawk " ) was a Hiyō @-@ class aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy . Begun as the ocean liner Izumo Maru ( <unk> ) in 1939 , she was purchased by the Navy Ministry in 1941 for conversion to an aircraft carrier . Completed shortly after the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , she participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign in October and missed the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands later that month because of an electrical generator fire . Her aircraft were disembarked several times and used from land bases in a number of battles in the South West Pacific . Hiyō was torpedoed in mid @-@ 1943 and spent three months under repair . She spent most of the next six months training and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat . She was sunk by a gasoline vapor explosion caused by an American torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid @-@ 1944 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The ship was ordered as the fast luxury passenger liner Izumo Maru by Nippon Yusen Kaisha ( Japan Mail Steamship Company ) in late 1938 . In exchange for a 60 % subsidy of her building costs by the Navy Ministry , she was designed to be converted to an aircraft carrier . 
 Hiyō had a length of 220 meters ( 721 ft 9 in ) overall . She had a beam of 26 @.@ 7 meters ( 87 ft 7 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 15 meters ( 26 ft 9 in ) . She displaced 24 @,@ 150 tonnes ( 23 @,@ 770 long tons ) at standard load . Her crew ranged from 1 @,@ 187 to 1 @,@ 224 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was fitted with two Mitsubishi @-@ Curtis geared steam turbine sets with a total of 56 @,@ 250 shaft horsepower ( 41 @,@ 950 kW ) , each driving a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 18 ft ) propeller . Steam was provided by six Kawasaki @-@ La Mont water @-@ tube boilers . Her machinery , designed for merchant service , was over four times heavier than that of the aircraft carrier Hiryū . Hiyō had a designed speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) , but during sea trials she reached 25 @.@ 63 knots ( 47 @.@ 47 km / h ; 29 @.@ 49 mph ) from 56 @,@ 630 shp ( 42 @,@ 230 kW ) . The ship carried 4 @,@ 100 tonnes ( 4 @,@ 000 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 11 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 21 @,@ 700 km ; 13 @,@ 500 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 Hiyō 's flight deck was 210 @.@ 3 meters ( 690 ft 0 in ) long and had a maximum width of 27 @.@ 3 meters ( 89 ft 7 in ) . A large island was fitted on the starboard side that was integrated with , for the first time in a Japanese carrier , the ship 's funnel . This was angled 26 ° outwards to help keep its exhaust from interfering with flight operations . The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars , each approximately 153 meters ( 502 ft 0 in ) long , 15 meters ( 49 ft 3 in ) wide and 5 meters ( 16 ft 5 in ) high . Each hangar could be subdivided by four fire curtains and they were fitted with fire fighting foam dispensers on each side . The hangars were served by two square aircraft elevators with rounded corners , 14 @.@ 03 meters ( 46 @.@ 0 ft ) on each side . The elevators had a maximum capacity of 5 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) and took 15 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck . Hiyō was fitted with electrically operated Kure type model 4 arresting gear with nine cables . She also mounted two Type 3 crash barricades . No aircraft catapult was fitted . The ship mounted a crane on the port side of the flight deck , just aft of the rear elevator . When collapsed , it was flush with the flight deck . 
 The ship 's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M ' Claude ' fighters , plus four in storage , 18 Aichi D3A ' Val ' dive bombers , plus two in reserve , and 18 Nakajima B5N ' Kate ' torpedo bombers . This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters , and three in storage for the A5Ms by the time the ship commissioned in 1942 . As a result of the lessons learned from the Battle of Midway in June , the ship 's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros , and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns . By the end of the year , six more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As . Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars , eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks . 
 = = = Armor , armament and sensors = = = 
 As a conversion from an ocean liner , it was not possible to add much armor , although the ship had a double hull . Two plates of Ducol steel , each 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick , protected the sides of the ship 's machinery spaces . The ship 's aviation gasoline tanks and magazines were protected by one layer of Ducol steel . In addition , her machinery spaces were further subdivided by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads to limit any flooding . 
 The ship 's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm Type 89 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull . Hiyō was also initially equipped with eight triple 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns , also in sponsons along the sides of the hull . In early 1943 , four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts late in the year . Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island . A dozen single mounts were also added , some of which were portable and could be mounted on tie @-@ down points on the flight deck . 
 Two Type 94 high @-@ angle fire @-@ control directors , one on each side of the ship , were fitted to control the Type 89 guns . Each director mounted a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 14 ft 9 in ) rangefinder . Four Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and another pair were added in early 1943 . Early warning was provided by two Type 2 , Mark 2 , Model 1 air search radars . The first of these was mounted on the top of the island shortly before she was completed in July 1942 and the other was added later in the year . This latter system was fitted on the port side of the hull , outboard of the rear elevator . A smaller Type 3 , Mark 1 , Model 3 air search radar was added in 1944 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Hiyō 's keel was laid down by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Shipyard , Kobe , on 30 November 1939 with the name of Izumo Maru . The ship was purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was temporarily referred to as No. 1002 Ship ( Dai 1002 bankan ) to keep her conversion secret . She was launched on 24 June 1941 and commissioned on 31 July 1942 . 
 The ship was assigned to the Second Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet after commissioning and became Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta 's flagship on 12 August . After spending the next several months working up , Hiyō arrived at Truk , together with her sister Jun 'yō , on 9 October to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet . On 15 October , the two carriers reached the vicinity of Malaita Island in the Solomon Islands and their aircraft discovered a resupply convoy for Guadalcanal that was escorted by the destroyer Meredith . The A6M Zeros and D3As from the sisters attacked and sank the destroyer . The next day , they found the small seaplane tender , McFarland , in Lunga Roads offloading avgas into barges . Nine D3As attacked , blowing the ship 's stern off and destroying the barge . McFarland was not sunk , but required months of repairs . The two carriers were intended to play a prominent role in the Japanese effort to retake Guadalcanal Island and were assigned to the Advance Force for this operation . Their aircraft were supposed to provide air cover after the Japanese night attack that retook Henderson Field and then they were to be flown ashore . A fire in the generator room occurred on 17 October and reduced her top speed to 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) so Admiral Kakuta transferred his flag to Jun 'yō while Hiyō returned to Truk for repairs . Some of her aircraft , however , were also transferred to Jun 'yō before she left . 
 The remaining aircraft of her air group ( 16 Zeros and 17 D3As ) were flown off for Rabaul on 23 October where they provided air cover for Japanese forces on Guadalcanal . A detachment from the air group was transferred to Buin , Papua New Guinea on 1 November and participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal later in the month . Those aircraft that remained at Rabaul flew back to Truk by 11 November , but the Buin detachment was ferried back to Japan on 14 December . 
 Hiyō spent November in Truk , during which time she was twice slightly damaged by American air raids , before returning to Japan in early December where she was rejoined by the rest of her air group . Aside from a brief refit at Kure from 26 February to 4 March 1943 , the ship was training in the Inland Sea until she sailed for Truk on 22 March . Her air group consisted of 27 Zeros and 12 D3As at this time . They were detached from Hiyō in early April to participate in Operation I @-@ Go , a land @-@ based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea . The carrier was again lightly damaged from bomb splinters on 12 April from an American air attack . After her air group returned , the ship arrived back in Japan on 21 May in case she was needed to relieve Japanese forces fighting on the Attu Island . 
 Now the flagship of the Second Carrier Division under Rear Admiral <unk> <unk> , Hiyō and her sister Junyō departed Yokosuka on 7 June en route for Truk . Later that evening , the ship was torpedoed by the submarine USS Trigger off Miyakejima . Hits in the starboard bow and boiler room knocked out all power , but she managed to return to Japan the following day after restoring power . Hiyō 's fighters were flown to Truk by 15 July and assigned to the light carrier Ryūhō . The ship was under repair at Yokosuka until 15 September . On 1 November , Hiyō 's air group was reconstituted with 24 Zeros , 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns and the ship departed Japan for Singapore on 24 November . She arrived on 3 December and was almost immediately assigned duties as an aircraft ferry . On 9 December , Hiyō left Singapore en route for Truk with several deliveries on the way . The ship arrived there on 22 December and disembarked her own air group before proceeding on to Saipan to deliver more aircraft . The air group was transferred to Kavieng and later Rabaul to provide air cover for Japanese operations there . 
 Hiyō returned to Japan on 1 January 1944 and her air group rejoined her on 2 March , albeit without aircraft . In the meantime , the Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division and Air Group 652 was assigned to the 2nd Carrier Division with Hiyō , Jun 'yō and Ryūhō . The air group was last in priority to be rebuilt and only had 30 Model 21 Zeros , 13 Model 52 Zeros and four D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorized 81 fighters , 36 dive bombers and 27 torpedo bombers . The ship conducted training for her aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May when she sailed for Tawi @-@ Tawi in the Philippines . The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack . However , the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage . 
 = = = Battle of the Philippine Sea = = = 
 The Japanese fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June , 1944 where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines , when Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day . Upon reaching Guimares , the fleet refuelled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June . The Americans failed to locate Ozawa 's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning . At this time , Air Group 652 consisted 81 Zeros , 27 D3As , 9 Yokosuka D4Y " Judy " dive bombers and 18 Nakajima B6N " Jill " torpedo bombers , roughly evenly divided among the three three carriers under his command . The carriers began launching their first air strike of 26 bomb @-@ carrying A6M2 Zeros , seven B6Ns and 16 A6M5 Zeros as escort around 09 : 30 . Most of these aircraft were misdirected and failed to find any American ships , although a dozen persisted in their search and found one of the American task groups . Five bomb @-@ carrying Zeros , a B6N and an escort Zero were shot down by the defending fighters and no damage was inflicted on any American ship . 
 A second air strike of 27 D3As , nine D4Ys , two B6Ns and 26 escorting Zeros was launched around 11 : 00 , accompanied by at least 18 A6Ms and B6Ns from the carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku . They had also been given an erroneous spot report and were unable to find any American ships . Some of the aircraft headed for airfields at Rota and Guam to refuel while the remainder headed back to the carriers . Six D4Ys and two Zeros bound for Rota spotted the carriers Wasp and Bunker Hill en route and failed to inflict any damage on the American ships while losing five D4Ys to anti @-@ aircraft fire . Radar had spotted those aircraft headed for Guam and they were intercepted by 41 Grumman F6F Hellcats . Only one A6M5 , one D4Y and seven D3As of 49 Japanese aircraft survived the encounter and landed . 
 At dusk , the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance . They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched . Hiyō was struck by two bombs , one of which detonated above the bridge and killed or wounded virtually everyone there . More seriously , the ship was struck by one torpedo dropped by a Grumman TBF Avenger from Belleau Wood . This knocked out the starboard engine room and started fires , but Hiyō was able to continue , albeit a slower speed . Two hours later , a large explosion occurred when leaking gasoline vapor ignited and it knocked out all power on the ship . The fires raged out of control and Hiyō sank stern first shortly afterwards at 16 ° 20 ′ N 132 ° 32 ′ E. Roughly 1 @,@ 000 men were rescued by her escorting destroyers , but 247 officers and enlisted men died aboard the carrier .

 Johnson Senior High School is a comprehensive high school for grades 9 to 12 in Saint Paul , Minnesota , United States . Originally named Cleveland High School , the school was renamed after Minnesota governor John A. Johnson in 1911 . Johnson is the second oldest high school in the Saint Paul Public Schools district and is only surpassed in age by Central High School . The school has operated in three different buildings since 1897 , all located on the East Side of Saint Paul . 
 Johnson is the third largest high school in the district and enrolls 1647 students . The school offers Advanced Placement classes as well as the University of Minnesota @-@ affiliated College in the Schools program . In 2002 the school received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which led to the introduction of eight Small Learning Communities . 
 Johnson offers over 40 extracurricular clubs and organizations including an Air Force Junior Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( <unk> ) unit , one of only three in the state . The school was a founding member and currently competes in the Saint Paul City Conference .

 Johnson High School was established in 1897 , making it the second oldest high school in the Saint Paul Public Schools district and the oldest on the East Side of Saint Paul . The school was originally named Cleveland High School , after the U.S. President Grover Cleveland , although some sources state the school was named after Horace Cleveland , a local landscape architect . 
 In 1910 increasing enrollment and overcrowding led to the construction of a second school building at 740 York Ave . The school was renamed John A. Johnson High School in honor of the recently deceased Minnesota governor John Albert Johnson ( 1861 – 1909 ) . Students attended class at the second location from 1911 to 1963 . 
 By 1959 overcrowding as a result of the post @-@ World War II baby boom forced the construction of a third school building . Land was purchased in 1960 at the former site of Hastings Pond , which had been filled in during construction of Interstate 94 through Saint Paul , and the building was completed at a cost of $ 3 @,@ 663 @,@ 529 @.@ 78 . Johnson High School has been located at the third school building since the fall of 1963 .

 Students are able to enroll from throughout the city , however most students live on the East Side . Johnson is the third largest high school in the Saint Paul Public Schools district with 1647 students attending in the 2006 – 2007 school year . The plurality of students identified as Asian , with 46 % , while students identifying as Black and White composed 29 % and 14 % of the student body respectively . Ten percent ( 10 % ) of students identified as Hispanic and 2 % American Indian . Eighty @-@ one ( 81 % ) qualified for Free or Reduced Price Lunch and 34 % of students had limited English Proficiency .

Students can also earn college credit through College in the Schools ( CIS ) classes offered by the University of Minnesota , and Post Secondary Enrollment Options ( <unk> ) classes at area colleges and universities . Language classes in Spanish and French are offered . 
 In 2002 Johnson received $ 1 @.@ 1 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education . Johnson used the money to create eight smaller learning communities for the 2003 – 2004 school year . In the first five years the graduation rate at Johnson increased 19 % with state @-@ required 10th grade reading and writing tests also seeing double digit increases . The money from the grants ran out before the 2006 – 2007 school year . Currently , there are eight smaller learning communities within the school . All students start in the Freshmen FOCUS Academy and then choose one of seven other academies for the remainder of their high school career based on their interests . Beginning with the class of 2006 , graduating seniors are required to engage in the Senior Project , a program designed for students to showcase the skills they have developed during their stay at Johnson and as a practice for building a résumé or portfolio when applying for jobs . 
 The senior project consists of four main P 's project , paper , portfolio and presentation . The students are required to work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time . This project can be anything . Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project , so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house . The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed . The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together . All the projects are judged throughout the year , and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education .

 Joseph Émile Alcide " Butch " Bouchard , CM , CQ ( September 4 , 1919 – April 14 , 2012 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played defence with the Montreal Canadiens in the National Hockey League from 1941 to 1956 . He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame , won four Stanley Cups , was captain of the Canadiens for eight years and was voted to the NHL All @-@ Star Team four times . Although having a reputation as a clean player , he was also one of the strongest players and best body @-@ checkers of his era . He excelled as a defensive defenceman , had superior passing skills and was known for his leadership and mentoring of younger players . In his early years in the NHL , Bouchard was one of the players who made a major contribution to reinvigorating what was at the time an ailing Canadien franchise . 
 He was born in Montreal , Quebec , and at the time his death resided in Saint @-@ Lambert , Quebec . In retirement Bouchard was active with several business interests and contributions to his community . In 2008 , he received the National Order of Quebec . On December 4 , 2009 , Bouchard 's No. 3 was retired by the Canadiens as part of their 100th anniversary celebrations . On December 30 , 2009 , Michaëlle Jean , Governor General of Canada , announced Bouchard as among the appointments to the Order of Canada . 
 = = Youth and learning the game = = 
 Bouchard was born September 4 , 1919 , in Montreal the son of Regina <unk> and <unk> Bouchard . Growing up poor during the depression , Bouchard did not begin skating until he was 16 and had to learn on rented skates , before borrowing $ 35 from his brother for a complete set of hockey equipment which included his own pair of skates . Bouchard opted for a career in hockey over banking when he was offered $ 75 a week to play senior hockey and the bank paid $ 7 . In the minors Bouchard played with the Verdun Maple Leafs , Montreal Junior Canadiens and Providence Reds . It was Verdun team @-@ mate Bob Fillion who gave Bouchard the nickname " Butch " . It originated due to the resemblance of his last name to the English word " butcher " . Bouchard was determined , strong and developed enough skills to impress coach Dick Irvin in the Canadiens ’ 1940 – 41 training camp after which he was signed as a free agent . Bouchard had arrived at training camp in peak condition , which was unusual for National Hockey League ( NHL ) players of the time . To attend this first training camp he rode a bike 50 miles ( 80 km ) , which also allowed him to pocket the travel expenses the Canadiens had allotted . 
 In an era when hockey players were regarded by hockey management as rural and unsophisticated , Bouchard had already developed his entrepreneurial skills . While still in high school he was working alongside an inspector with the Department of Agriculture when he came across a bee ranch owned by a priest who had just died . Borrowing $ 500 from his brother he bought the business . He turned it into an apiary of 200 hives which was so successful he earned enough to buy his parents a home . It was due to this business acuity that prior to signing with the Canadiens he uncovered what Ken Reardon and Elmer Lach , already playing with the Montreal , were currently earning . Then , over the course of ten days he negotiated a larger contract than either player had been receiving , $ 3 @,@ 750 ( $ 55 @,@ 941 in 2016 dollars ) .

 = = = Arrival to the Canadiens = = = 
 Along with a strong work ethic and keen intellect , Bouchard was physically imposing . At 6 ft 2 in ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) and 205 pounds ( 93 kg ) he was considered a giant compared to NHL players of the 1940s , when the average height was 5 ft 8 in ( 1 @.@ 73 m ) and average weight was 165 pounds ( 75 kg ) . Moreover , since he also practiced heavy weight training in an era before NHL players were concerned about upper body strength he became a very effective defensive presence . Hockey Hall of Fame <unk> and team @-@ mate Dickie Moore said of Bouchard : " He appeared to have been chiseled out of stone . " 
 By the time of Bouchard 's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the championship for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low , often less than 3 @,@ 000 a game , and there was talk of folding the franchise . A few years earlier , in 1935 , Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland . After finishing last or near the bottom of the league for several years , apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life . In his first training camp , he showcased his physical play by body @-@ checking players , including veterans , with abandon . When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around . Bouchard 's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal . 
 However , Bouchard was more than just a physical presence . He learned to play good positional hockey and became skilled at passing the puck . He also possessed a flair for judging the flow of the game and knew when to join the attack and when to retreat . Despite his role as a " stay @-@ at @-@ home " defenceman , due to his skills for the long breakout pass , he was a contributor to the style of <unk> hockey for which the Canadiens exemplified . 
 Though he had an immediate impact on the team , Bouchard had not scored many points for the team ; in his first season , 1941 – 42 , he collected six points in the regular season and scored the first NHL goal of his career in the Canadiens ' first @-@ round playoff loss to the Detroit Red Wings . 
 = = = NHL star = = = 
 The 1942 – 43 season was Bouchard 's breakthrough year as he finished leading all Canadien defencemen in points and was key to the Canadiens ' first season in several years without a losing record . They finished in fourth place with a record of 19 wins , 19 losses and 12 ties . Although they lost in the first round of the playoffs , the team was building in the right direction . 
 The 1943 – 44 season was Maurice Richard 's first full season with the Canadiens . Richard was not just an exciting player to watch which served to increase attendance , but also had the offensive skills needed to turn the Canadiens into an exceptional team . The Canadiens proceeded to dominate the regular season finishing well ahead of second @-@ place Detroit . In the playoffs in the first round against Toronto , after losing the opening game , they won the next four straight to win the series . Then , in the final they swept Detroit in four games to win their first Stanley Cup in thirteen years . While the " Punch Line " of Richard , Toe Blake and Lach provided the offensive power it was Bouchard and goal @-@ tender Bill Durnan who kept the goals out . During the regular season Montreal had allowed only 109 goals , 68 less than second @-@ place Detroit . Bouchard along with Richard and Lach were named to the NHL All Stars ' second team and goaltender Bill Durnan made the first team and won the Vezina . Bouchard had become one of the most reliable defencemen in the league . He would be named to the NHL First All Star team , as one of the best defencemen in the league , for the next three seasons . He won his second Stanley Cup in 1945 – 46 . 
 As physical on the ice as Bouchard was , he was also regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights . Immensely strong , most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants . However , it was a fight involving Bouchard which led to a significant change in the role of referees . During the 1946 – 47 season , Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one @-@ sided fight with Boston 's Terry Reardon . Due to the fight , Clarence Campbell , president of the NHL , added to the duties of referees ; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights . Then there was the time in March 1947 , in a game in Boston , as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period , a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin . Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully . A few moments later , Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car . According to Bouchard , Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins , interceded and talked the police out of the arrest . 
 For the 1947 – 48 season , defenceman Doug Harvey joined the team . Within a couple years Harvey would become the best offensive @-@ oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long @-@ time and very effective defensive pairing . Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous , he was confident in the knowledge that Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose the puck . 
 = = = Leader and mentor = = = 
 In 1948 , Bouchard became the first Quebec @-@ born captain of the Canadiens , a position he retained for eight years until his retirement . At the time of his retirement no player had served more years as captain of the Canadiens than Bouchard . Hall of Famer Jean Beliveau , a teammate of Bouchard for Beliveau 's early years with the Canadiens , said Bouchard was the model for his time as captain in the 1960s . Bouchard was a well @-@ respected leader and played a role in supporting and mentoring the younger players . Never afraid to speak up to management , in 1950 on Bouchard 's recommendation to Selke to " give the kid a shot " , Bernie Geoffrion was given a tryout and eventually joined the Canadiens . Geoffrion won the Calder for rookie of the year and would be near the top of league scoring for years to come . Bouchard commenting on the fact that he was nominated for captain by his teammates : " I don 't agree with management nominating you . I can respond to players , not be a yes @-@ man for the proprietor . " He missed a large part of the 1948 – 49 season after a severe knee injury which threatened his career . Despite medical opinion that he might not be able to continue to play he trained hard and was able to strengthen the knee enough to return to the Canadiens . 
 In 1951 , Bouchard was involved in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a New York Rangers fan . The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend watching the game on TV . Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow . In what may have been the first time in legal history , evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan 's friend testified he 'd seen Bouchard strike the blow . Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey , president of Abercrombie and Fitch , who was at the game testified he heard " vile language " and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave . 
 On February 28 , 1953 , the Canadiens had a " Bouchard Night at the Forum " . Bouchard was honoured in a ceremony during the second intermission in a game against the Detroit Red Wings . It was presided over by Montreal Mayor <unk> Houde and broadcast nationally live over the CBC . Among the gifts Bouchard received was a Buick automobile which was driven out onto the ice . The organizer 's plan was to have Bouchard drive off in the car at the end of the ceremony . However , sitting in the car Bouchard discovered the keys were missing . To the roar of the crowd Ted Lindsay , captain of the Red Wings , returned the keys he had stolen and congratulated Bouchard on behalf of the Red Wings 
 In 1952 – 53 , Montreal and Detroit battled for first place with Detroit coming out on top by the end of the season . In the first round of the playoffs the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings were upset by the Boston Bruins and Montreal won a close seven @-@ game series over the Chicago Black Hawks . The Canadiens then defeated Boston in five games and Bouchard won his third Stanley Cup . 
 Eventually injuries began to take their toll and at the conclusion of the 1954 – 55 season he considered retirement . Toe Blake , who had taken over as coach , talked him into playing one more season to assist the younger players . Bouchard recognized Blake 's value as a " player 's coach " and used his leadership as captain to ease the transition and encourage Blake 's acceptance by the Canadiens players . Due to physical problems Bouchard was forced to miss the last half of the season and the playoffs . However , in the deciding game of the Stanley Cup final against Detroit , Blake dressed Bouchard . As the final seconds counted down , with Montreal up 3 – 1 , Blake put Bouchard on the ice and he was able to end his career with one more Stanley Cup celebration . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1947 , Bouchard married Marie @-@ Claire Macbeth , a painter . They had five children , Émile Jr . , Jean , Michel , Pierre and Susan . 
 In the 1970s , his son Pierre Bouchard , also a defenceman , played for the Montreal Canadiens . While father Émile participated in the birth of the Montreal Canadiens ' dynasty , thirty years later son Pierre played a part in continuing the Canadien dynasty into the 1970s . With Butch 's four and Pierre 's five they have the distinction of winning the most Stanley Cups of any father @-@ son combination in NHL history . Bobby and Brett Hull are the only other father and son to have won the Cup . 
 In retirement Bouchard remained as active as he was during his NHL career . He received coaching offers soon after his retirement , but his business interests prevented him from leaving Montreal . Bouchard owned a popular restaurant Chez Émile Bouchard which operated for many years in Montreal . On March 22 , 1953 , while Bouchard was traveling to Detroit for the last game of the season , the restaurant was gutted by a fire started in a basement at 3 : <unk> soon after employees and patrons had left . He was also president of the Montreal Royals Triple @-@ A baseball club , elected to the Longueuil municipal council , on the board of directors of Ste . Jeanne @-@ d 'Arc Hospital , president of the Metropolitan Junior " A " Hockey League among other activities . 
 Bouchard was unafraid to speak his mind when he felt the occasion demanded . In 1957 , after an International League game in Toronto between his Montreal Royals and the Maple Leafs baseball team President Bouchard complained about Toronto 's excessive conference trips to the mound . He called the Leafs " <unk> " and then said , for the entire press room to hear , " They 're a lot of punks , just like in hockey ! " 
 Bouchard was a tough opponent even outside of hockey . When the Mafia of the day in Montreal attempted to intimidate him into hiring their people for his restaurant , Bouchard invited the head man to Chez Butch Bouchard for dinner . Bouchard 's wife , Marie @-@ Claire , recalled he told them , " Il lui a dit over my dead body . Je n <unk> jamais un de <unk> hommes . " which translates " Over my dead body , I will never hire one of your men . " 
 A reporter once asked the canny Bouchard what he thought of coaching methods in the NHL . He replied , " Hockey should be more like football , with a coach for the defence , one for the offence and maybe one for the goalies . " Indicative of his usual foresight it would be many years before such practices would become common in the NHL . 
 He died in 2012 at the age of 92 .

 Bouchard was one of nine players and one builder elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966 . On October 15 , 2008 , the Montreal Canadiens celebrated their 100th season by unveiling the Ring of Honour , an exhibit along the wall of the upper deck of the Bell Centre , paying tribute to their 44 players and 10 builders who are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame . Bouchard along with Elmer Lach , the two oldest surviving members , were on hand to drop the ceremonial puck at centre ice . 
 In 2008 , a grass roots movement had begun to pressure Canadien management to retire Bouchard 's # 3 . During the Quebec provincial election Independent candidate Kevin Côté made one of his platforms to force Canadiens into retiring the number . By March 2009 it reached the Quebec National Assembly where a motion was presented and carried " That the National Assembly support the steps taken and supported by the population of Québec in order that Montreal Canadians management retire the sweater of Émile " Butch " Bouchard eminent defenceman from 1941 to 1956 . " 
 On December 4 , 2009 , as part of an 85 minute pre @-@ game ceremony celebrating the Canadiens ' 100th anniversary , Bouchard 's No. 3 and Elmer Lach 's No. 16 were retired . They become the 16th and 17th Canadien players to have their numbers retired . 
 On June 18 , 2008 , Bouchard received the National Order of Quebec ( L 'Ordre national du Québec ) presented to him by the Premier of Quebec Jean Charest . On December 30th , 2009 , he was made a Member of the Order of Canada " for his contributions to sports , particularly professional hockey , and for his commitment to his community " .

 = German cruiser Lützow ( 1939 ) = 
 Lützow was a heavy cruiser of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine , the fifth and final member of the Admiral Hipper class , but was never completed . The ship was laid down in August 1937 and launched in July 1939 , after which the Soviet Union requested to purchase the ship . The Kriegsmarine agreed to the sale in February 1940 , and the transfer was completed on 15 April . The vessel was still incomplete when sold to the Soviet Union , with only half of her main battery of eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns installed and much of the superstructure missing . 
 Renamed Petropavlovsk in September 1940 , work on the ship was delayed by poor German @-@ Soviet co @-@ operation in crew training and provision of technical literature to enable completion of the ship , which was being carried out in the Leningrad shipyards . Still unfinished when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the ship briefly took part in the defense of Leningrad by providing artillery support to the Soviet defenders . She was heavily damaged by German artillery in September 1941 , sunk in April 1942 , and raised in September 1942 . After repairs were effected , the ship was renamed Tallinn and used in the Soviet counter @-@ offensive that relieved Leningrad in 1944 . After the end of the war , the ship was used as a stationary training platform and as a floating barracks before being broken up for scrap sometime between 1953 and 1960 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Lützow was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen . Lützow was originally designed as a light cruiser version of the Admiral Hipper class heavy cruisers , armed with twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns instead of the Admiral Hipper 's eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns . The Kriegsmarine decided , however , to complete the ship identically to Admiral Hipper on 14 November 1936 . Her keel was laid on 2 August 1937 , under construction number 941 . The ship was launched on 1 July 1939 , but was not completed . 
 Lützow was 210 meters ( 690 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 21 @.@ 80 m ( 71 @.@ 5 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 90 m ( 25 @.@ 9 ft ) . The ship had a design displacement of 17 @,@ 600 t ( 17 @,@ 300 long tons ; 19 @,@ 400 short tons ) and a full load displacement of 20 @,@ 100 t ( 19 @,@ 800 long tons ; 22 @,@ 200 short tons ) . Lützow was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines , which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra @-@ high pressure oil @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's top speed was 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , at 132 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 98 @,@ 000 kW ) . As designed , her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1 @,@ 340 enlisted men . 
 Lützow 's primary armament was eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) SK L / 60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets , placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft . Her anti @-@ aircraft battery was to have consisted of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 guns , twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and eight 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . The ship also would have carried a pair of triple 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure . The ship was to have been equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult . Lützow 's armored belt was 70 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick ; her upper deck was 12 to 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 to 1 @.@ 18 in ) thick while the main armored deck was 20 to 50 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 1 @.@ 97 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick faces and 70 mm thick sides .

 In October 1939 , the Soviet Union approached Germany with a request to purchase the then unfinished Admiral Hipper @-@ class cruisers Lützow , Seydlitz , and Prinz Eugen , along with plans for German capital ships , naval artillery , and other naval technology . The Kriegsmarine denied the request for Seydlitz and Prinz Eugen , but agreed to sell Lützow , as well as 38 cm ( 15 in ) gun turrets and other weaponry . The price for the heavy cruiser was set at 150 million Reichsmarks , nearly double the original cost of the vessel , which was 83 @,@ 590 @,@ 000 Reichsmarks . Complete technical specifications , the results of engine trials , and spare parts were included in the sale . Eighty percent of the material was to be provided within twelve months of the transfer , with the remainder to be provided within fifteen months . Lützow was renamed " L " , her original contract name , for the transfer to the Soviet Union . 
 In February 1940 , when the agreement was concluded , Lützow was fitting @-@ out in Bremen . Her main battery guns had been transferred to the German army and placed on railway mountings ; they had to be dismantled and returned to Bremen . The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company . The two navies agreed that Germany would be responsible for naval escort , which included destroyers and smaller vessels . Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation Feige then led an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship . 
 At the time the ship arrived in Leningrad , only the two forward gun turrets had been installed and the bridge superstructure was incomplete . The only secondary guns installed were the 3 @.@ 7 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns . The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940 , and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83 . The vessel 's design provided the basis for a planned heavy cruiser , designated Projekt 82 , although this ship was canceled before work began . Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious ; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany , while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union . Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort . 
 Sea trials for Petropavlovsk were scheduled to begin sometime in late 1941 , and according to the training program , the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials . It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941 , and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials . German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine @-@ room personnel . At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk , the relevant German training and technical manuals would be sent to the Soviet Navy , albeit in German only . 
 By the time Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Petropavlovsk was still incomplete . She was nevertheless used as a floating battery in the defense of Leningrad in August of that year . Several other ships , including the cruiser Maxim Gorky , joined Petropavlovsk in shelling the advancing Germans . On 7 September , the ship fired on German forces encircling the city ; she fired forty salvos from her forward main battery turrets — the only two operational — expending some 700 rounds of ammunition during the attack . On 17 September 1941 , the ship was disabled by German heavy artillery ; after being hit 53 times , the ship was forced to beach herself to avoid sinking . 
 On 4 April 1942 , the I Fliegerkorps launched a major attack on the Soviet naval forces in Leningrad : 62 Ju 87s , 33 Ju 88s , and 37 He 111s struck the ships in the harbor . Petropavlovsk was hit once , suffering serious damage . The Soviet Navy raised the ship on 17 September 1942 and towed her to the Neva where she was repaired . Renamed Tallinn in 1943 , the ship returned to service to support the Soviet counter @-@ offensive to relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944 . The ship was never completed , and was used as a stationary training ship after the end of the war . She was later used as a floating barracks in the Neva , and renamed Dniepr in 1953 . The date of her disposal is uncertain ; Erich Gröner reports the ship survived until being broken up for scrap in 1960 , while Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships states that the vessel was scrapped in 1958 – 59 . Tobias Philbin reports that the ship was broken up in 1953 . 
 = 2015 Copa del Rey Final = 
 The 2015 Copa del Rey Final was a football match on 30 May 2015 to decide the winner of the 2014 – 15 Copa del Rey , the 113th edition of the Copa del Rey , Spain 's primary football cup . 
 It was played between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona , at the Camp Nou , the latter club 's home ground . Barcelona won the match 3 – 1 , achieving their record 27th title in the competition . Lionel Messi and Neymar gave Barcelona a 2 – 0 lead at half time , and although Athletic replied with a goal by Iñaki Williams , Messi scored another goal late on to confirm his team 's victory . This was the second part of Barcelona 's treble , with the team going on to win the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final a week later . 
 Messi 's first goal , in which he ran past a number of opponents , was the runner @-@ up in the FIFA Puskás Award for the year 's best goal . Neymar was criticised for his showboating in the final minutes of the match , with Barcelona manager Luis Enrique excusing his Brazilian striker for cultural reasons . Both teams and the Royal Spanish Football Federation were given fines by the nation 's government for security breaches and allowing separatist demonstrations at the match . As Barcelona won the 2014 – 15 La Liga , Athletic qualified automatically as the cup representative in the 2015 Supercopa de España . 
 = = Venue = = 
 Before the semi @-@ final second leg , Barcelona 's board requested the final be held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium , home of their fierce rivals Real Madrid , as it is the largest stadium in Spain apart from their own Camp Nou . At the same time , according to Barcelona @-@ based newspaper La Vanguardia , the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( RFEF ) , Ángel María Villar , wanted the final at the San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao . That decision would have given Athletic Bilbao home advantage , but could have been challenged by potential finalist Espanyol , whose team bus was vandalised on their last visit there . 
 On 25 March , the RFEF confirmed that it would be held at Barcelona 's Camp Nou . Real Madrid refused to let the final be played at their stadium , and the Camp Nou was chosen at an RFEF meeting ahead of the San Mamés , with Sevilla 's Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium and Valencia 's Mestalla Stadium eliminated in an earlier round of voting . 
 = = Background = = 
 Barcelona had previously played 36 Copa del Rey Finals , a record bettered only by Real Madrid with 39 . However , Barcelona had won the competition a record 26 times . Their most recent appearance in the final was the previous year 's edition , in which they lost 1 – 2 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla in Valencia . Their most recent win was in 2012 , beating Athletic Bilbao 3 – 0 at the Vicente Calderón Stadium in Madrid . Their only previous final at the Camp Nou was a victory in 1963 . The last team to play a Copa del Rey Final at their own ground was Real Madrid , who lost in 2013 to Atlético Madrid and 2002 to Deportivo de La Coruña at their Santiago Bernabéu Stadium . 
 Athletic Bilbao had previously played in 35 finals , winning 23 , with only Barcelona winning more . Their most recent final was in 2012 , and their most recent victory in the tournament was in 1984 , beating Barcelona 1 – 0 at the Bernabéu . 
 Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao had played each other in seven previous finals of the tournament . Barcelona won in 1920 , 1942 , 1953 , 2009 and 2012 , and Athletic Bilbao won in 1932 and 1984 . 
 The two teams played each other twice during the 2014 – 15 La Liga season . In the first instance , at the Camp Nou on 13 September 2014 , Barcelona won 2 – 0 with two goals from Neymar in the last 11 minutes of the game . On 8 February 2015 at Athletic Bilbao 's San Mamés Stadium , Barcelona won 5 – 2 . Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez gave them a 2 – 0 half @-@ time lead . Four goals came between the 59th and 66th minutes : Mikel Rico scored for Athletic , his teammate Óscar de Marcos scored an own goal , Neymar achieved a fourth for Barcelona and <unk> Aduriz a second for Athletic . Later on in the game , Xabier Etxeita was sent off for the hosts and Pedro netted a fifth for the visitors . 
 The final was jeopardised due to a dispute over the sharing of television revenue between Spanish clubs , with all football in the country due to be suspended from 16 May . However , two days before the intended suspension , this action was deemed unlawful by the Spanish High Court , and the season continued .

 The conduct of Neymar , who performed tricks with the ball in the closing stages of Barcelona 's victory , was a talking point after the match . His opponent Iraola decried Neymar , saying that his actions were unsporting , while Barcelona manager Luis Enrique said that Neymar 's actions were common in Brazil , even though frowned upon in Spain , and would have to change . However , Neymar himself did not apologise and said that he would repeat his behaviour in the future . 
 In July 2015 , the Spanish Sports Council levied fines against both clubs and the RFEF , with all three entities deemed to have taken insufficient action against security breaches and planned protests of Basque and Catalan separatist supporters who jeered the Spanish national anthem and King Felipe VI . Barcelona were laden with a € 66 @,@ 000 fine , Athletic with € 18 @,@ 000 and the RFEF € 123 @,@ 000 . Barcelona claimed that the fines were punishment of freedom of expression .

 " Right Round " is a song performed by American singer / rapper Flo Rida . It was released as the lead single from his second studio album , R.O.O.T.S. ( 2009 ) . The song features guest vocals from American singer Kesha . It was released to radio on 27 January 2009 and was digitally released on 10 February by Poe Boy Entertainment and Atlantic Records . The song heavily samples the chorus of the 1984 Dead or Alive song " You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) " in its hook . According to one of the song 's writers , the chorus refers to oral sex . Kesha contributed guest vocals to the song , but was uncredited in the United States and Canada during the run atop the charts . 
 Despite receiving mostly negative reviews , with critics claiming it was kitschy and misogynistic , the song was a commercial success , reaching the top ten of the charts in nineteen countries worldwide . In the United States , it became Flo Rida 's second number @-@ one single ( staying at # 1 for six consecutive weeks ) and broke the record for first @-@ week sales ( 636 @,@ 000 downloads ) when it was released to digital retailers ; eventually , this record was broken by Adele 's " Hello " , which sold 1 @.@ 11 million copies in its first week . The single 's accompanying music video was directed by Malcolm Jones and nominated for an MTV Video Music Award . The song has been used in several movies , such as The Hangover , The Ugly Truth and the Telugu movie Pilla <unk> . In the movie Pitch Perfect , the song is performed by the a cappella group the <unk> . This song is the second track on Now 31 . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 " Right Round " was written by Flo Rida , Dr. Luke , Kool Kojak , DJ Frank E , Philip Lawrence , Bruno Mars , Aaron Bay @-@ Schuck , and Dead or Alive , the band whose 1984 song , " You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) " is sampled in the chorus . The track was produced by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha , ( who was not credited on the American release of the single ) . At the end of 2008 , Luke was working on a track with Flo Rida called " Right Round " and the two decided they needed a female hook . Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals . According to Flo Rida , the song is about " a young lady , she might be in the strip club and she 's got my head spinning round , [ ... ] Or any young lady that I might see walking past me that 's getting my attention . She got it going on ! I 'm going crazy over her . " 
 Flo Rida explained that he listened to " You Spin Me Round ( Like A Record ) " and similar records growing up as a result of the varying music genres his seven sisters listened to . Ultimately , his A & R Aaron Bay @-@ Schuck came up with the idea to sample " You Spin Me Round ( Like A Record ) " in a song . Bay @-@ Schuck told HitQuarters that he had been listening to a shuffle beat produced by DJ Frank E on a CD of potential beats and had kept hearing in his head the melody of the Dead or Alive song over the top of it . Co @-@ A & R Mike Caren then brought the sample to the attention of Flo Rida . 
 As R.O.O.T.S. was Flo Rida 's second studio album , he wanted to show listeners musical growth by " broaden [ ing ] my horizons , " which was why he decided to record the song . After Luke produced the sample , the song was recorded . In the same night the song was written Aaron Bay @-@ Schuck , Bruno Mars and Philip Lawrance decided to go to the studio and make the initially recording . It was recorded primarily at Conway Studios in Hollywood , California , with additional recording at Atlantic Studios , also located in Hollywood . 
 This is the first of three collaborations between Flo Rida and Dr. Luke . The songs " Who Dat Girl " and " Good Feeling " would follow . Also , with the use of the DJ Frank E shuffle beat in the song 's production , this is the first of four collaborations between Flo Rida and DJ Frank E. The two would later actually meet together and collaborate on the songs " Me & U " , " Turn Around ( 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ) " , and more famously , " Whistle " .

 Musically , " Right Round " uses the recurring pop rap themes of Flo Rida 's music ; specifically , similarities were noted between the song and " Low " ( 2007 ) , with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling " Right Round " its " heir apparent " . The song is " swaggering " and " bass @-@ heavy " , according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly . The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing money at a woman performing a striptease . Additionally , the chorus line " You spin my head right round , right round / When you go down , when you go down , down " can be interpreted as a reference to fellatio . Bruno Mars , co @-@ writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song 's chorus was referring to oral sex . Philip Lawrence , also co @-@ writer , confessed the song was " almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out . " It was him , Bruno Mars , and Aaron Bay @-@ Schuck . Bay @-@ Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted to come up with something big for Flo Rida , and they were just throwing out 80 's ideas . The song 's sexual themes have been compared to those of " If U Seek Amy " ( 2009 ) by Britney Spears . 
 " Right Round " is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 125 beats per minute . It is written in the key of A @-@ minor with a chord progression of Am @-@ C @-@ G @-@ Am @-@ D @-@ G , and the breakdown of C @-@ G @-@ Am @-@ C @-@ D @-@ E.

 Reviews for " Right Round " were mostly negative . A reviewer for The New York Times called the song " [ b ] ionic and empty " . In a review of R.O.O.T.S. , Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe stated , " His music is pure ear candy that must make Britney [ Spears ] envious , yet he wants to come off as a thug . " He continued that it is unlikely that " Right Round " would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the ' 80s , calling it " as hard as Jell @-@ O. " Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song , " It 's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic , but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here . " He added that " Right Round " is " [ f ] <unk> with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens ' club " , and called it " an unpleasant affair that 's only saved from the trashcan by its sample . " Fletcher concluded , " The fuzzy synths , electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves . But sadly it 's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things . " Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song " a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive 's ' You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) . ' " Noting that the song was , at the time , the number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 , he added , " What does all this say about us as a society ?

 There were also a few positive reviews . One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC , who opened , " It 's one of the fundamental laws of pop , anything which tips a nod to ' You Spin Me Round ( Like A Record ) ' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen . " He continued , " Even though this is just a song written from the perspective of a randy man watching a pole @-@ dancer and bragging about how much money he has [ ... ] in a manner which would make Akon blush , there 's just something kind of cute about the whole thing . " McAlpine attributed this to the song 's " Tigger @-@ beat " , explaining , " How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they 're on <unk> ? " Bill Lamb of About.com commented , " You will hear echoes of another pop classic , but the new song stands on its own feet . " However , he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it , hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it , and he added that " [ i ] t 's not groundbreaking by any means " .

 = Olivia Pope = 
 Olivia Carolyn Pope is a fictional character portrayed by Kerry Washington ( and as a child by Yara <unk> ) , created by Shonda Rhimes and partially based on Judy Smith for the political drama television series Scandal . Pope is a Washington , D.C.-based crisis manager who runs her own firm , Pope & Associates , that specializes in political situations . The character has become a widely @-@ watched fashion and style trendsetter . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 Pope is loosely based on Judy Smith , who served as George H. W. Bush 's Deputy Press Secretary and represented Monica Lewinsky during the Clinton @-@ Lewinsky scandal . On Scandal , she is a revered fixer who helped United States President Fitzgerald Grant ( played by Tony Goldwyn ) win office . Pope is a former lawyer and White House aide . Pope " thinks fast and effectively " . Her delivery is through what The New York Times 's Alessandra Stanley describes as admonitory , staccato sentences . Among her secrets is her affair with President Grant . Some of her employees have law degrees , but do not serve as lawyers . Instead , they are " gladiators in suits " who mollify or avert a wide array of crises . 
 The role is regarded as groundbreaking . According to Felicia Lee of The New York Times , Pope is the only dramatic protagonist role played by a black woman on American network television since 1974 , when Teresa Graves starred as Christie Love in Get Christie Love ! for one series . Among her prominent comedic predecessors , Diahann Carroll played the title role in Julia from 1968 to 1971 . Pope is regarded as a post @-@ racial character , yet possibly the most complex black female lead in television history . Although the show does not touch upon race that often , regarding her much publicized affair with Grant , Pope once said " I 'm feeling a little , I don 't know , Sally Hemings @-@ Thomas Jefferson about all this . " Pope has given Washington a role as a standard bearer for middle @-@ class and upper middle @-@ class , educated black women . 
 Among women of all races , Washington 's Pope is in the stark minority as a female protagonist of a television series who are " emotionally strong , professionally powerful , and personally complicated " . Her leadership of a hodge podge crew is compared to that of Brenda Leigh Johnson of The Closer . Pope 's " intensity " infuses her team with a " sense of urgency " that gives the show its pace . Her strong , professional but feminine leadership style is accentuated by her fashion . 
 Pope 's wardrobe is designed by Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo ( who does or has done costume design for The West Wing , ER and Shameless ) , and it has caught the attention of the Vogue staff . In 2014 , Washington 's portrayal of Pope and her promotion of Pope 's style earned her acclaim as a style <unk> from the Accessories Council . Paolo attempted to make Pope stand apart from the black , gray and dark blue colors of DC by outfitting her in " chic pastels " going so far as to put her in pink pants or Louboutin shoes at times . Some of her most respected wardrobe pieces are from notable fashion houses such as Ferragamo , Burberry , Gucci , Armani , Prada , Valentino , Tory Burch , and Michael Kors . The Valentino was saved for the season 1 finale . In addition to the luxurious elements of her wardrobe that are on loan from designers , Pope wears modest elements that Paolo picks up from Nordstrom Rack , Bloomingdale 's and Loehmann 's . The Pope character has become somewhat of a style icon . Harper 's Bazaar and Glamour analyze her wardrobe every week in a dedicated fashion watch columns . Time describes her as " a real @-@ world lifestyle tastemaker " , pointing out that the Crate & Barrel wine glasses that she drinks from on the show sold out at the store . Washington and Paolo curated a Saks Fifth Avenue installation of Pope fashions in October 2013 . That season , Pope 's attire was part of a special collection at Saks Fifth Avenue . In September 2014 , an Olivia Pope Scandal collection was set to debut at The Limited , in what was publicized as " the first design collaboration between a national retailer and a top @-@ rated network TV show , its costume designer and star " . The collaboration included " tops , pants , jackets and outerwear " and incorporated items priced as low as $ 49 . The collaboration includes 42 pieces . Vulture dedicated a feature to presenting every outfit Pope wore during season 2 . When her wardrobe changed to more colorful and asymmetric looks in season 3 , The Huffington Post dedicated a feature to this issue . During season 3 , Entertainment Weekly ranked Pope 's ten best outfits . Because Pope 's wardrobe is pricey , there are features and websites dedicated to cheap alternatives to the exact wardrobe elements . Paolo suggests that the Pope style be purchased at Zara and Ann Taylor . In terms of jewelry , Pope wears long necklaces and exclusively wears <unk> watches . She also generally uses one of her modest collection of Prada purses . 
 When the Obama administration needed a spokesman for its Affordable Care Act , it had Jennifer Hudson spoof Pope .

 " Olivia Pope has the <unk> personal life of any character in prime time . And that ’ s why you ’ ll probably fall in love with her ... " wrote Mark Perigard of The Boston Herald of Pope 's character . Time ranked her second on their list of the 11 most influential fictional characters in 2013 . 
 Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post wrote " Washington does a good job of carrying every story along in her energetic wake , and even if Scandal isn 't quite as instantly addictive as Grey 's Anatomy ... " Washington 's simultaneous " emotionally and intellectually acute " presentations are usually showcased in a " fast @-@ talking ... eloquent , pointed ... ultimatum ( or two ) to a client or a nemesis <unk> over a deal .

 Stanley says her voice patterns are reminiscent of a salesman in Glengarry Glen Ross . According to Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara , saying the supernaturally empowered Pope is based on Smith is " like saying Willie Wonka [ sic ] is based on Milton Hershey " . McNamara also says " Olivia Pope is not just the ultimate fixer , she also manages to work only on the side of the angels , " although she has the sole flaw of loving the married president . 
 Slate critic Troy Patterson describes her as intellectually comparable to contemporary protagonists Adrian Monk and Gregory House due to her genius powers of intuition , which enable her to judge guilt and veracity by scales in her gut . However , Patterson compares her emotionally to Roy Lichtenstein 's romantic subjects such as Drowning Girl despite her angelic swagger and chutzpah . 
 Staff writer David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer , calls Pope " one of the strongest ( in every sense ) female characters to hit prime time in recent memory " . The Washington Post 's Hank Stuever says Pope is a " much @-@ feared " character delivered with a watchability that is " <unk> but complex " . 
 David Dennis of The Guardian stated that Pope was " a home wrecker " and expressed disdain for the character 's lack of morals . He went on to say that Pope 's actions were so destructive that she was " barely an anti @-@ hero , much less a hero . " Writer Meghan Gallagher of The <unk> considered Pope to be groundbreaking for being among the " first female antiheroes to grace primetime television .

 = Sistine Chapel ceiling = 
 The Sistine Chapel ceiling , painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 , is a cornerstone work of High Renaissance art . 
 The ceiling is that of the Sistine Chapel , the large papal chapel built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV , for whom the chapel is named . It was painted at the commission of Pope Julius II . The chapel is the location for papal conclaves and many important services . 
 The ceiling 's various painted elements form part of a larger scheme of decoration within the Chapel , which includes the large fresco The Last Judgment on the sanctuary wall , also by Michelangelo , wall paintings by several leading painters of the late 15th century including Sandro Botticelli , Domenico Ghirlandaio and Pietro Perugino , and a set of large tapestries by Raphael , the whole illustrating much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church . 
 Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known , having an iconic standing equalled only by Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa , the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations . The complex design includes several sets of individual figures , both clothed and nude , which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since . 
 = = Context and history = = 
 Pope Julius II was a " warrior pope " who in his papacy undertook an aggressive campaign for political control , to unite and empower Italy under the leadership of the Church . He invested in symbolism to display his temporal power , such as his procession , in the Classical manner , through a triumphal arch in a chariot after one of his many military victories . It was Julius who began the rebuilding of St. Peter 's Basilica in 1506 , as the most potent symbol of the source of papal power . 
 In the same year 1506 , Pope Julius conceived a program to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel . The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier . The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was ( and sometimes still is ) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael . The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life of Moses on the left side . It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters : Botticelli , Ghirlandaio , Perugino , <unk> , Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli . The upper level of the walls contains the windows , between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty @-@ two popes . A draft by Matteo d <unk> indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars , possibly representing the zodiacal constellations . It is probable that , because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance , it was Pope Julius ' intention and expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning . 
 Michelangelo , who was not primarily a painter but a sculptor , was reluctant to take on the work . Also , he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope 's own tomb . The pope was adamant , leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept . But a war with the French broke out , diverting the attention of the pope , and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting . The tomb sculptures , however , were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling . The contract was signed on 10 May 1508 . 
 The scheme proposed by the pope was for twelve large figures of the Apostles to occupy the pendentives . However , Michelangelo negotiated for a grander , much more complex scheme and was finally permitted , in his own words , " to do as I liked " . His scheme for the ceiling eventually comprised some three hundred figures and took four years to execute , being completed in 1512 . It is unknown and is the subject of much speculation among art historians as to whether Michelangelo was really able to " do as he liked " . It has been suggested that the Augustinian friar and cardinal , Giles of Viterbo , was a consultant for the theological aspect of the work . Many writers consider that Michelangelo had the intellect , the Biblical knowledge , and the powers of invention to have devised the scheme himself . This is supported by Ascanio <unk> 's statement that Michelangelo read and reread the Old Testament while he was painting the ceiling , drawing his inspiration from the words of the scripture , rather than from the established traditions of sacral art . There was a total of 343 figures painted on the ceiling . 
 = = Method = = 
 To reach the chapel 's ceiling , Michelangelo designed his own scaffold , a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall near the top of the windows , rather than being built up from the floor . Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber . According to Michelangelo 's pupil and biographer Ascanio <unk> , the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen , possibly cloth , was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips , dust , and splashes of paint . Only half the building was <unk> at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages . The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes . The holes were re @-@ used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration . 
 Contrary to popular belief , he painted in a standing position , not lying on his back . According to Vasari , " The work was carried out in extremely uncomfortable conditions , from his having to work with his head tilted upwards " . Michelangelo described his physical discomfort in a humorous sonnet accompanied by a little sketch . 
 The painting technique employed was fresco , in which the paint is applied to damp plaster . Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio , one of the most competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters , at the time that the latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel . At the outset , the plaster , intonaco , began to grow mold because it was too wet . Michelangelo had to remove it and start again . He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants , Jacopo l <unk> , which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition . 
 Because he was painting fresco , the plaster was laid in a new section every day , called a <unk> . At the beginning of each session , the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down . The edges between <unk> remain slightly visible ; thus , they give a good idea of how the work progressed . It was customary for fresco painters to use a full @-@ sized detailed drawing , a cartoon , to transfer a design onto a plaster surface — many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto , outlining the figures . Here Michelangelo broke with convention ; once confident the intonaco had been well applied , he drew directly onto the ceiling . His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces , while on others a grid is evident , indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing . 
 Michelangelo painted onto the damp plaster using a wash technique to apply broad areas of colour , then as the surface became drier , he revisited these areas with a more linear approach , adding shade and detail with a variety of brushes . For some textured surfaces , such as facial hair and <unk> , he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb . He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations , combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio . 
 The work commenced at the end of the building furthest from the altar , with the latest of the narrative scenes , and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation . The first three scenes , from the story of Noah , contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels . This is partly because of the subject matter , which deals with the fate of Humanity , but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling , including the prophets and Ignudi , are smaller than in the central section . As the scale got larger , Michelangelo 's style became broader , the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day . 
 The bright colours and broad , cleanly defined outlines make each subject easily visible from the floor . Despite the height of the ceiling , the proportions of the Creation of Adam are such that when standing beneath it , " it appears as if the viewer could simply raise a finger and meet those of God and Adam " . Vasari tells us that the ceiling is " unfinished " , that its unveiling occurred before it could be reworked with gold leaf and vivid blue lapis lazuli as was customary with frescoes and in order to better link the ceiling with the walls below it which were highlighted with a great deal of gold . But this never took place , in part because Michelangelo was reluctant to set up the scaffolding again , and probably also because the gold and particularly the intense blue would have distracted from his painterly conception . 
 Some areas were , in fact , decorated with gold : the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls . It seems very likely that the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo 's original scheme , since they are painted to resemble a certain type of parade shield , a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold . 
 Section reference . 
 Michelangelo wrote a poem describing the arduous conditions under which he worked 
 I 've grown a goitre by dwelling in this den – 
 As cats from stagnant streams in Lombardy , 
 Or in what other land they <unk> to be – 
 Which drives the belly close beneath the chin : 
 My beard turns up to heaven ; my nape falls in , 
 Fixed on my spine : my breast @-@ bone visibly 
 Grows like a harp : a rich embroidery 
 <unk> my face from brush @-@ drops thick and thin . 
 My loins into my paunch like levers grind : 
 My buttock like a <unk> bears my weight ; 
 My feet unguided wander to and fro ; 
 In front my skin grows loose and long ; behind , 
 By bending it becomes more taut and strait ; 
 <unk> I strain me like a Syrian bow : 
 Whence false and quaint , I know , 
 Must be the fruit of squinting brain and eye ; 
 For ill can aim the gun that bends awry . 
 Come then , Giovanni , try 
 To succour my dead pictures and my fame ; 
 Since foul I fare and painting is my shame .

 The overt subject matter of the ceiling is the doctrine of humanity 's need for Salvation as offered by God through Jesus . It is a visual metaphor of Humankind 's need for a covenant with God . The Old Covenant of the Children of Israel through Moses and the New Covenant through Christ had already been represented around the walls of the chapel . Some experts , including Benjamin Blech and Vatican art historian Enrico <unk> , have also noted less overt subject matter , which they describe as being " concealed " and " forbidden . " 
 The main components of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis , of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi . At either end , and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve men and women who prophesied the birth of Jesus . On the crescent @-@ shaped areas , or lunettes , above each of the chapel 's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures . Above them , in the triangular spandrels , a further eight groups of figures are shown , but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters . The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives , each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story . 
 The narrative elements of the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it , that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God . Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace , and was punished by the Great Flood . Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity , Christ Jesus . The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world . The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine . Traditionally , the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament . Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect of the life of Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist . Jonah , for example , was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus ' death and resurrection . 
 While much of the symbolism of the ceiling dates from the early church , the ceiling also has elements that express the specifically Renaissance thinking that sought to reconcile Christian theology with the philosophy of Renaissance Humanism . During the 15th century in Italy , and in Florence in particular , there was a strong interest in Classical literature and the philosophies of Plato , Socrates and other Classical writers . Michelangelo , as a young man , had spent time at the Humanist academy established by the Medici family in Florence . He was familiar with early Humanist @-@ inspired sculptural works such as Donatello 's bronze David and had himself responded by carving the enormous nude marble David , which was placed in the piazza near the Palazzo Vecchio , the home of Florence 's council . The Humanist vision of humanity was one in which people responded to other people , to social responsibility , and to God in a direct way , not through intermediaries , such as the Church . This conflicted with the Church 's emphasis . While the Church emphasized humanity as essentially sinful and flawed , Humanism emphasized humanity as potentially noble and beautiful . These two views were not necessarily irreconcilable to the Church , but only through a recognition that the unique way to achieve this " elevation of spirit , mind and body " was through the Church as the agent of God . To be outside the Church was to be beyond Salvation . In the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , Michelangelo presented both Catholic and Humanist elements in a way that does not appear visually conflicting . The inclusion of " non @-@ biblical " figures such as the Sibyls or Ignudi is consistent with the rationalising of Humanist and Christian thought of the Renaissance . This rationalisation was to become a target of the Counter Reformation . 
 The iconography of the ceiling has had various interpretations in the past , some elements of which have been contradicted by modern scholarship . Others , such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels , continue to defy interpretation . Modern scholars have sought , as yet unsuccessfully , to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned whether or not it was entirely devised by the artist himself , who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius . Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo 's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the artistic expression of the ceiling . One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs .

 The Sistine Chapel is 40 @.@ 9 metres long and 14 metres wide . The ceiling rises to 13 @.@ 4 metres above the main floor of the chapel . The vault is of quite a complex design and it is unlikely that it was originally intended to have such elaborate decoration . Pier Matteo d <unk> provided a plan for its decoration with the architectural elements picked out and the ceiling painted blue and dotted with gold stars , similar to that of the Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua . 
 The chapel walls have three horizontal tiers with six windows in the upper tier down each side . There were also two windows at each end , but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo 's Last Judgement was painted , obliterating two lunettes . Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault . Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window . Above the height of the pendentives , the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal . This is the real architecture . Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture . 
 = = = Illusionary = = = 
 The first element in the scheme of painted architecture is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault . Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings . These have two repeating motifs , a formula common in Classical architecture . Here , one motif is the acorn , the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV , who built the chapel , and Pope Julius II , who commissioned Michelangelo 's work . The other motif is the scallop shell , one of the symbols of the Madonna , to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483 . The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels , to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling , separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets , Sibyls , and Ancestors , who literally and figuratively support the narratives . Ten broad painted <unk> of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces , a grid that gives all the figures their defined place . 
 A great number of small figures are integrated with the painted architecture , their purpose apparently purely decorative . These include two faux marble putti below the cornice on each rib , each one a male and female pair ; stone rams @-@ heads are placed at the apex of each spandrel ; copper @-@ skinned nude figures in varying poses , hiding in the shadows , propped between the spandrels and the ribs like animated bookends ; and more putti , both clothed and unclothed strike a variety of poses as they support the nameplates of the Prophets and Sibyls . Above the cornice and to either side of the smaller scenes are an array of round shields , or <unk> . They are framed by a total of twenty more figures , the so @-@ called Ignudi , which are not part of the architecture but sit on inlaid plinths , their feet planted convincingly on the fictive cornice . <unk> , the Ignudi appear to occupy a space between the narrative spaces and the space of the chapel itself . ( see below )

 = = = Nine scenes from the Book of Genesis = = = 
 Along the central section of the ceiling , Michelangelo depicted nine scenes from the Book of Genesis , the first book of the Bible . The pictures are organized into three groups of three alternating large and small panels . 
 The first group shows God creating the Heavens and the Earth . The second group shows God creating the first man and woman , Adam and Eve , and their disobedience of God and consequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden where they have lived and where they walked with God . The third group of three pictures shows the plight of Humanity and in particular the family of Noah . 
 The pictures are not in strictly chronological order . If they are perceived as three groups , then the pictures in each of the three units inform upon each other , in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass . The three sections of Creation , Downfall , and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order , when read from the entrance of the chapel . However , each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar . This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault . Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace . However , the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology . 
 The scenes , from the altar toward the main door , are ordered as follows : 
 The Separation of Light and Darkness 
 The Creation of the Sun , Moon and Earth 
 The Separation of Land and Water 
 The Creation of Adam 
 The Creation of Eve 
 The Temptation and Expulsion 
 The Sacrifice of Noah 
 The Great Flood 
 The Drunkenness of Noah 
 = = = = Creation = = = = 
 The three Creation pictures show scenes from the first chapter of Genesis , which relates that God created the Earth and all that is in it in six days , resting on the seventh day . In the first scene , the First Day of Creation , God creates light and separates light from darkness . Chronologically , the next scene takes place in the third panel , in which , on the Second Day , God divides the waters from the heavens . In the central panel , the largest of the three , there are two representations of God . On the Third Day , God creates the Earth and makes it sprout plants . On the Fourth Day , God puts the Sun and the Moon in place to govern the night and the day , the time and the seasons of the year . According to Genesis , on the Fifth Day , God created the birds of the air and fish and creatures of the deep , but we are not shown this . Neither do we see God 's creation of the creatures of the earth on the Sixth Day . 
 These three scenes , completed in the third stage of painting , are the most broadly conceived , the most broadly painted and the most dynamic of all the pictures . Of the first scene Vasari says " ... Michelangelo depicted God dividing Light from Darkness , showing him in all his majesty as he rests self @-@ sustained with arms outstretched , in a revelation of love and creative power . "
