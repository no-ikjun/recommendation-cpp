 In 1996 , Townshend , Entwistle and Daltrey performed Quadrophenia with guests and Starkey on drums at Hyde Park . The performance was narrated by Daniels , who had played Jimmy in the 1979 film . Despite technical difficulties the show led to a six @-@ night residency at Madison Square Garden and a US and European tour through 1996 and 1997 . Townshend played mostly acoustic guitar , but eventually was persuaded to play some electric . In 1998 , VH1 ranked the Who ninth in their list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of Rock ' n ' Roll " .

 In late 1999 , the Who performed as a five @-@ piece for the first time since 1985 , with Bundrick on keyboards and Starkey on drums . The first show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena was partially broadcast on TV and the Internet and released as the DVD The Vegas Job . They then performed acoustic shows at Neil Young 's Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View , California , followed by gigs at the House of Blues in Chicago and two Christmas charity shows at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London . Critics were delighted to see a rejuvenated band with a basic line @-@ up comparable to the tours of the 1960s and 1970s . Andy Greene in Rolling Stone called the 1999 tour better than the final one with Moon in 1976 . 
 The band toured the US and UK from June to October 2000 , to generally favourable reviews , culminating in a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer trust with guest performances from Paul Weller , Eddie Vedder , Noel Gallagher , Bryan Adams and Nigel Kennedy . Stephen Tomas Erlewine described the gig as " an exceptional reunion concert " . In 2001 the band performed the Concert for New York City at Madison Square Garden for families of firefighters and police who had lost their lives following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center , and were honoured with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . 
 The Who played concerts in the UK in early 2002 in preparation for a full US tour . On 27 June , the day before the first date , Entwistle was found dead of a heart attack at 57 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas . Cocaine was a contributing factor .

 Entwistle 's son , Christopher , gave a statement supporting the Who 's decision to carry on . The US tour began at the Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino . Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle , and ended with a montage of pictures of him . The tour lasted until September . The loss of a founding member of the Who caused Townshend to re @-@ evaluate his relationship with Daltrey , which had been strained over the band 's career . He decided their friendship was important , and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material . 
 To combat bootlegging , the band began to release the Encore Series of official soundboard recordings via <unk> An official statement read : " to satisfy this demand they have agreed to release their own official recordings to benefit worthy causes " . 
 In 2004 , the Who released " Old Red Wine " and " Real Good Looking Boy " ( with Palladino and Greg Lake , respectively , on bass ) on a singles anthology , The Who : Then and Now , and went on an 18 @-@ date tour of Japan , Australia , the UK and the US , including a return appearance at the Isle of Wight . Later that year , Rolling Stone ranked the Who No. 29 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time . 
 The Who announced in 2005 that they were working on a new album . Townshend posted a novella called The Boy Who Heard Music on his blog , which developed into a mini @-@ opera called Wire & Glass , forming the basis for the album . Endless Wire , released in 2006 , was the first full studio album of new material since 1982 's It 's Hard and contained the band 's first mini @-@ opera since " Rael " in 1967 . The album reached No. 7 in the US and No. 9 in the UK . Starkey was invited to join Oasis in April 2006 and the Who in November 2006 , but he declined and split his time between the two . 
 In November 2007 , the documentary Amazing Journey : The Story of the Who was released , featuring unreleased footage of the 1970 Leeds appearance and a 1964 performance at the Railway Hotel when the group were The High Numbers . Amazing Journey was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award . 
 The Who toured in support of Endless Wire , including the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London in 2006 , headlining the 2007 Glastonbury Festival , a half @-@ time appearance at the Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 and being the final act at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games . In November 2012 , the Who released Live at Hull , an album of the band 's performance night after the Live at Leeds gig .

 In 2010 the Who performed Quadrophenia with parts played by Vedder and Tom Meighan at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust series of 10 gigs . A planned tour for early 2010 was jeopardised by the return of Townshend 's tinnitus . He experimented with an in @-@ ear monitoring system that was recommended by Neil Young and his <unk> . 
 The Quadrophenia and More tour started in November 2012 in Ottawa with keyboardists John Corey , Loren Gold and Frank <unk> , the latter of whom was also musical director . In February 2013 , Starkey pulled a tendon and was replaced for a gig by Scott <unk> who performed with less than four hours ' notice . The tour moved to Europe and the UK , and ended at the Wembley Arena in July 2013 .

 In October 2013 , Townshend announced the Who would stage their final tour in 2015 , performing in locations they have never played before . Daltrey clarified that the tour is unrelated to the band 's 50th anniversary — which occurred in 2013 — and indicated that he and Townshend were considering recording new material but would be emphasising their hits in their final stadium tour . Daltrey stated , " We can 't go on touring forever ... it could be open @-@ ended , but it will have a finality to it . " 
 In June 2014 , Jones reunited with the Who at a charity gig for Prostate Cancer UK his <unk> Polo Club , alongside Jeff Beck , Procol Harum , and Mike Rutherford . Later that month , the Who announced plans for a world tour with a possible accompanying album . In September , the Who released the song " Be Lucky " , which was included on the compilation The Who Hits 50 ! in October . That November , the group released a virtual reality app co @-@ designed by Daltrey 's son , Jamie , featuring events and images from the band 's history . 
 In June 2015 , the Who headlined that year 's Hyde Park Festival , and two days later , the Glastonbury Festival . Townshend suggested to Mojo that it could be the group 's last UK gig . To coincide with The Who 's 50th anniversary , all studio albums , including the new compilation , The Who Hits 50 ! , were reissued on vinyl . In September 2015 , all remaining US tour dates were cancelled after Daltrey contracted viral meningitis . Then Townshend promised the band would come back " stronger than ever " .

 = = Musical style and equipment = = 
 The Who have been regarded primarily as a rock band , yet have taken influence from several other styles of music during their career . The original group played a mixture of trad jazz and contemporary pop hits as the Detours , and R & B in 1963 . The group move to a mod sound the following year , particularly after hearing the Small Faces fuse Motown with a harsher R & B sound . The group 's early work was geared towards singles , though it was not straightforward pop . In 1967 , Townshend coined the term " power pop " to describe the Who 's style . Like their contemporaries , the group were influenced by the arrival of Hendrix , particularly after the Who and the Experience met at Monterey . This and lengthy touring strengthened the band 's sound . In the studio , they began to develop softer pieces , particularly from Tommy onwards , and turned their attention towards albums more than singles . 
 From the early 1970s , the band 's sound included synthesizers , particularly on Who 's Next and Quadrophenia . Although groups had used synthesizers before , the Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure . In By Numbers the group 's style had scaled back to more standard rock , but synthesisers regained prominence on Face Dances . 
 Townshend and Entwistle were instrumental in making extreme volumes and distortion standard rock practices . The Who were early adopters of Marshall Amplification . Entwistle was the first member to get two 4 × 12 speaker cabinets , quickly followed by Townshend . The group used feedback as part of their guitar sound , both live and in the studio . In 1967 , Townshend changed to using Sound City amplifiers , customised by Dave Reeves , then in 1970 to Hiwatt . The group were the first to use a 1000 watt PA systems for live gigs , which led to competition from bands such as the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd . 
 Throughout their careers , the members of the Who have said their live sound has never been captured as they wished on record . Live gigs and the audience have always been important to the group . " Irish " Jack Lyons said , " The Who weren 't a joke , they were fucking real , and so were we . " 
 = = = Vocals = = = 
 Daltrey initially based his style on Motown and rock and roll , but from Tommy onwards he tackled a wider range of styles . His trademark sound with the band , as noted in 1983 , has been a characteristic scream , as heard at the end of " Won 't Get Fooled Again " . 
 Group backing vocals are prominent in the Who . After " I Can 't Explain " used session men for backing vocals , Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases , producing strong backing harmonies . Daltrey , Townshend and Entwistle sang lead on various songs , and occasionally Moon joined in . Who 's Next featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocals on several songs , and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltrey 's strong , guttural baritone and Townshend 's higher and gentler tenor to be one of the album 's highlights . 
 Daltrey 's voice is negatively affected by marijuana smoke , to which he says he is allergic . On 20 May 2015 , during a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum , he smelled a joint burning and told the smoker to put it out or " the show will be over ” . The fan obliged , without taking Pete Townshend 's advice that " the quickest way " to extinguish a joint is " up your fucking arse " . 
 = = = Guitars = = = 
 Townshend considered himself less technical than guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck and wanted to stand out visually instead . His playing style evolved from the banjo , favouring down strokes and using a combination of the plectrum and fingerpicking . His rhythm playing frequently used seventh chords and suspended fourths , and he is associated with the power chord , an easy @-@ to @-@ finger chord built from the root and fifth interval that has since become a fundamental part of the rock guitar vocabulary . Townshend also produced noises by manipulating controls on his guitar and by allowing the instrument to feedback . 
 In the group 's early career , Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as they allowed him to fret rhythm guitar chords easily and move the neck back and forwards to create vibrato . From 1968 to 1973 , he favoured a Gibson SG Special live , and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings . 
 In the studio for Who 's Next and thereafter , Townshend used a 1959 Gretsch <unk> Chet Atkins hollow @-@ body guitar , a Fender Bandmaster amp and an Edwards volume pedal , all gifts from Joe Walsh . Townshend started his career with an acoustic guitar and has regularly recorded and written with a Gibson J @-@ 200 . 
 = = = Bass = = = 
 A distinctive part of the original band 's sound was Entwistle 's lead bass playing , while Townshend concentrated on rhythm and chords . Entwistle 's was the first popular use of <unk> strings in 1966 , trying to find a piano @-@ like sound . His bassline on " Pinball Wizard " was described by Who biographer John Atkins as " a contribution of its own without diminishing the guitar lines " ; he described his part on " The Real Me " from Quadrophenia , recorded in one take , as " a bass solo with vocals " . Entwistle 's basses include a " Frankenstein " assembled from five Fender Precision and Jazz basses , and Warwick , Alembic , Gretsch and Guild basses . 
 = = = Drums = = = 
 Moon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums . His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks ' Mick Avory and The Shadows ' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom @-@ toms necessary for rock music . Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966 . He avoided the hi @-@ hat , and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals . 
 Jones ' drumming style was in sharp contrast to Moon 's . The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer , though Townshend later stated , " we 've never really been able to replace Keith . " Starkey knew Moon from childhood and Moon gave him his first drum kit . Starkey has been praised for his playing style which echoes Moon 's without being a copy . 
 = = = Songwriting = = = 
 Townshend focused on writing meaningful lyrics inspired by Bob Dylan , whose words dealt with subjects other than boy – girl relationships that were common in rock music ; in contrast to Dylan 's intellectualism , Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things kids could relate to . Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences , which Townshend said was a result of " searching for [ his ] niche " . By The Who Sell Out , he began to work narrative and characters into songs , which he fully developed by Tommy , including spiritual themes influenced by Baba . From the mid @-@ 1970s onwards , his songs tended to be more personal , which influenced his decision to go solo . 
 Entwistle 's songs , by contrast , typically feature black humour and darker themes . His two contributions to Tommy ( " Cousin Kevin " and " Fiddle About " ) appeared because Townshend did not believe he could write songs as " nasty " as Entwistle 's . 
 = = Personal relationships = = 
 The Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship . In the original band , Sandom had been the peacemaker and settled disputes . Moon , by contrast , was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend . Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments . The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically " because we always disagreed " . 
 The only genuine friendship in the Who during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon . The pair enjoyed each other 's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing . Journalist Richard Green noted a " chemistry of <unk> that would go beyond <unk> " . Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967 , though they still socialised on tour . When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels , Entwistle confessed he " was standing behind him with the matches " . 
 The group regularly argued in the press , though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things . Tommy mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey 's standing in the band because of the former 's songwriting and the latter 's stage presence , yet even this did not make them close friends . The pair quarrelled , particularly in the mid @-@ 1970s , over the group 's direction . During his time with the band , Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey . 
 Entwistle 's death came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey , and caused them to re @-@ evaluate their relationship . Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends . In 2015 , Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong , adding their acceptance of each other 's differences " brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship , which can only be described as love . " 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 The Who are one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century . Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the " rock opera " . As of October 2014 , the group has sold over 100 million records worldwide . 
 The group 's contributions to rock include the power chord , windmill strum and the use of non @-@ musical instrument noise such as feedback . The band had an impact on fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing . The guitar @-@ smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of Rolling Stone magazine 's " 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock ' n ' Roll " . 
 Pink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966 , inspired by the Who , whom they considered a formative influence . Shortly after arriving in London in 1966 , Hendrix visited Marshall 's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend 's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered . The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid @-@ 1960s . In 1965 , Paul McCartney said the Who " are the most exciting thing around " and was inspired to write " Helter Skelter " in the group 's " heavy " style ; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in " Pinball Wizard " for " Polythene Pam " . 
 The loud volume of the band 's live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal . Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5 , the Stooges , the Ramones the Sex Pistols , the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence . The Who inspired mod revival bands , particularly the Jam , which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular . In the mid @-@ 1990s , Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who . The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic ! at the Disco . 
 The Who have inspired many tribute bands ; Daltrey has endorsed the <unk> , who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust . Many bands have covered Who songs ; Elton John 's version of " Pinball Wizard " reached No. 7 in the UK . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 During the Who 's hiatuses in the 1980s and 90s , Townshend developed his skills as a music publisher to be financially successful from the Who without recording or touring . He countered criticism of " selling out " by saying that licensing the songs to other media allows a wider exposure and widens the group 's appeal . 
 The American forensic drama CSI ( CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , CSI : Miami , CSI : NY , and CSI : Cyber ) feature Who songs as theme music , " Who Are You " , " Won 't Get Fooled Again " , " Baba O 'Riley " and " I Can See for Miles " respectively . The group 's songs have featured in other popular TV series such as The Simpsons , and Top Gear , which had an episode where the presenters were tasked with being roadies for the band . 
 Rock @-@ orientated films such as Almost Famous , School of Rock and Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny refer to the band and feature their songs , and other films have used the band 's material in their soundtracks , including Apollo 13 ( which used " I Can See For Miles " ) and Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me ( which used a take of " My Generation " recorded for the BBC ) . Several of the band 's tracks have appeared in the video game Rock Band and its sequels . 
 = = = Awards and nominations = = = 
 The Who have received many awards and accolades from the music industry for their recordings and their influence . They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988 , and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001 . 
 The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 where their display describes them as " prime contenders , in the minds of many , for the title of World 's Greatest Rock Band " , and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 . Seven of the group 's albums appeared on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003 , more than any act except the Beatles , Bob Dylan , the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen .

 Diabolus in Musica is the eighth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer . Released on June 9 , 1998 , it is the second studio album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph . Although receiving mixed critical reviews , the album sold 46 @,@ 000 copies in its first week to peak at number 31 on the Billboard 200 . 
 Guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote most of the album 's content which has been described as Slayer 's most experimental album . It is the band 's first studio album to be played mostly in C ♯ tuning . The album 's title is a Latin term for " The Devil in Music " , a musical interval known for its dissonance . Lyrical themes explored on the album include religion , cultural deviance , death , insanity , war , and homicide . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman described the writing process as , " When we were writing this album I was looking for something to beat ; I wanted something to beat , but nothing impresses me right now . Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it , so I just had to come up with my own shit . " The album was produced by Rick Rubin and was recorded at Oceanway Studios . 
 Adrien Begrand of PopMatters felt Slayer introduced characteristics to its music including tuned down guitars , murky chord structures , and churning beats . He believed these characteristics were adopted in response to the then @-@ burgeoning nu metal scene . Drummer Paul Bostaph claims the album is his favorite as he thought the album was " as experimental as Slayer got " . This included incorporating groove metal elements and strange vocal effects as said by an interview for High Times . Bostaph returned to Slayer after his short @-@ lived side project The Truth About Seafood , and the band entered the recording studio four months later . 
 = = Album title and lyrical themes = = 
 Diabolus in Musica is a Latin term for " The Devil in Music " or tritone . Medieval musical rules did not allow this particular dissonance . According to one mythology , the interval was considered sexual and would bring out the devil ; Slayer vocalist and bassist Tom Araya jokingly said that people were executed for writing and using the interval . 
 Araya held concern about the lyrics that King penned to " In the Name of God " , voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman . King 's viewpoint was ; " It 's like , ' C 'mon , man , you 're in Slayer . You 're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album ! ' You can 't draw the line like that . Whether he agrees with it or not , he didn 't write it — I wrote it . So you have to say , ' Well , it 's just a part of being in this band . ' Now Jeff and I , we don 't give a fuck . If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with , I would never even raise a fucking finger . I 'd be like , ' Fuck yeah , let 's do it ! Gonna piss someone off ? Alright ! ' "

 Following the release of the album the band commenced the Diabolus in Musica tour . From 1998 to 1999 Slayer toured with Sepultura , System of a Down , Fear Factory , Kilgore , Clutch , Meshuggah and Sick of It All . Slayer released a promotional 3 track album called Diabolus in Musica Tour Sampler . The album features 3 tracks , one from Diabolus in Musica ( " Stain of Mind " ) , " Ship of Gold " off <unk> Clutch 's The Elephant Riders and " Suite @-@ Pee " ( Clean Version ) from the debut album by System of a Down . It was released on CD and Cassette .

 Diabolus in Musica was released on June 9 , 1998 by American Recordings . In its first week of release , the album sold 46 @,@ 000 copies in the United States and debuted at number 31 on the Billboard 200 Chart . As of August 16 , 2006 the album has sold 290 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . Reviewing 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse , Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dubbed the album " a unique record [ ... ] It 's as if they 're stepping in to show the young bands how to do it right , as songs like ' Bitter Peace ' , ' Death 's Head ' , and the terrific ' Stain of Mind ' blow away anything that young pretenders have put out . " 
 However , not all reviewers were so positive . Reviewing Slayer 's 2001 album God Hates Us All , Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin described Diabolus in Musica as " a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group 's sound , the presence of which elevated the band 's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output . " In a 1998 review , The New York Times ' Ben Ratliff complained : " Eight of the 11 songs on Diabolus in Musica , a few of which were played at the show , are in the same gray key , and the band 's rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too . " Songs from the album are rarely played live following the return of drummer Dave Lombardo in 2002 , with " Stain of Mind " being the only constant .

 = SMS Budapest = 
 SMS Budapest ( " His Majesty 's Ship Budapest " ) was a Monarch @-@ class coastal defense ship built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in the 1890s . After their commissioning , Budapest and the two other Monarch @-@ class ships made several training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in the early 1900s . Budapest and her sisters formed the 1st Capital Ship Division of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy until they were replaced by the newly commissioned Habsburg @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships at the turn of the century . In 1906 the three Monarchs were placed in reserve and only recommissioned during the annual summer training exercises . After the start of World War I , Budapest was recommissioned and assigned to 5th Division together with her sisters . 
 The division was sent to Cattaro in August 1914 to attack Montenegrin and French artillery that was bombarding the port , and they remained there until mid @-@ 1917 . Budapest and her sister Wien were sent to Trieste in August and bombarded Italian fortifications in the Gulf of Trieste . The ship was briefly decommissioned in early 1918 and became an accommodation ship , but she was fitted with a large siege howitzer for shore bombardment shortly afterwards and recommissioned . A shortage of ammunition caused the gun to be removed before it could be used , and Budapest reverted to her previous role . The ship was awarded to Great Britain by the Paris Peace Conference in 1920 . The British sold her for scrap , and she was broken up in Italy beginning in 1921 . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 At only 5 @,@ 785 tonnes ( 5 @,@ 694 long tons ) maximum displacement , the Monarch class was less than half the size of the battleships of other major navies at the time and were officially designated as coast defense ships . The Austro @-@ Hungarian government believed that the role of its navy was solely to defend her coast . 
 Budapest had an overall length of 99 @.@ 22 meters ( 325 ft 6 in ) , a beam of 17 meters ( 55 ft 9 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 4 meters ( 21 ft 0 in ) . Her two 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines produced a total of 9 @,@ 100 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 800 kW ) using steam from 16 Belleville boilers . These gave the ship a maximum speed of 17 @.@ 8 knots ( 33 @.@ 0 km / h ; 20 @.@ 5 mph ) . Budapest 's maximum load of 500 metric tons ( 490 LT ) of coal gave her a range of 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ; 4 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She was manned by 26 officers and 397 enlisted men , a total of 423 personnel . 
 The armament of the Monarch class consisted of four 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) Krupp K / 94 guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . The ships carried 80 rounds for each gun . Their secondary armament was six 150 @-@ millimeter ( 6 in ) Škoda guns located in casemates in the superstructure . Defense against torpedo boats was provided by ten quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Škoda guns and four 47 @-@ millimeter QF Hotchkiss guns . The ships also mounted two 450 @-@ millimeter ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . Each torpedo tube was provided with two torpedoes . 
 The ship 's nickel @-@ steel waterline armor belt was 120 – 270 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 – 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and the gun turrets were protected by 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The casemates had 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides while the conning tower had 220 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) of armor . Budapest 's deck armor was 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . 
 The Monarch @-@ class ships were ordered in May 1892 with Budapest and Wien to be built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste . Both ships were laid down on 16 February 1893 , the first ships in the class to be laid down . Budapest was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie <unk> @-@ Andrássy , wife of the Governor of Fiume , and commissioned on 12 May 1898 .

 Budapest and her sisters formed the Navy 's 1st Capital Ship Division ( I. Schwere Division ) , and Budapest conducted the first wireless telegraphy trials in the Navy when she was briefly fitted with a Marconi radio in December 1898 . In late 1899 the division made a training cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean where they made port visits in Greece , Lebanon , Turkey and Malta . In early 1902 they made another training cruise to the Western Mediterranean with port visits in Algeria , Spain , France , Italy , Corfu , and Albania . The ship was fitted with a Siemens @-@ Braun radio early the following year . The ships of the division were inspected by Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the throne , in March 1903 at Gravosa . Shortly afterwards , Budapest , Wien , the battleship Habsburg and the destroyer Magnet made a cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean . In 1904 , the Monarch @-@ class ships formed the 2nd Capital Ship Division , and they took part in the 1904 cruise of the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas as well as training exercises in which the three Habsburg @-@ class battleships engaged the Budapest and her sisters in simulated combat . Those maneuvers marked the first time two homogeneous squadrons consisting of modern battleships operated in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . 
 The Monarchs were relegated to the newly formed Reserve Squadron on 1 January 1906 and were only recommissioned for the annual summer exercises . They participated in a fleet review by Archduke Franz Ferdinand in September conducted in the <unk> Channel near Šipan . The ships were briefly recommissioned at the beginning of 1913 as the 4th Division after the start of the Second Balkan War , but were decommissioned again on 10 March .

 With the beginning of World War I the three Monarchs were recommissioned as the 5th Division . They were sent to the Bay of Kotor in August 1914 to attack Montenegrin artillery batteries on Mount Lovćen bombarding the Austro @-@ Hungarian naval base at Cattaro and the fortifications defending it . Budapest and her sisters arrived on 13 August , but their guns could not elevate enough to engage all of the enemy artillery , which was reinforced by eight French guns on 19 October . The battleship Radetzky was summoned to deal with the guns two days later , and she managed to knock out several French guns and forced the others to withdraw by 27 October . The Monarchs remained at Cattaro until mid @-@ 1917 to deter any further attacks . In August , Budapest and Wien were transferred to Trieste to serve as guard ships against Italian commando raids . Each ship was fitted with a 66 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) anti @-@ aircraft gun after their arrival on 26 August to counter intense Italian air attacks . Wien was damaged by a near miss on 5 September , and both ships withdrew to Pola on 12 September . 
 They returned to Trieste on 30 October and sortied into the Gulf of Trieste on 16 November to attack Italian coastal defenses at <unk> , near the mouth of the Piave River . Budapest and Wien opened fire at 10 : 35 at a range of about 9 – 10 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 6 – 6 @.@ 2 mi ) and knocked out most of the Italian guns after about a half @-@ hour . Their bombardment was interrupted by several unsuccessful Italian air attacks before a more coordinated attack was made by five MAS torpedo boats and five aircraft around 13 : 30 . This was also unsuccessful , and the last Italian coast defense gun was knocked out an hour later . The ships had sustained only minor damage from several hits and near @-@ misses , and not a single sailor was wounded . 
 Emperor Karl inspected Budapest on 19 November at Trieste . Anxious to revenge themselves against the Austro @-@ Hungarians , the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) planned an attack on the two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia , near Trieste , by MAS boats . On the night of 9 / 10 December , two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected , and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest . The torpedoes fired at the Budapest struck the mole of the seaplane station , but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes , killing 46 of the crew . 
 Budapest was scheduled for a shore bombardment on 12 December , but was postponed for a week by bad weather . Escorted by the light cruiser Admiral Spaun , six destroyers , nine torpedo boats and a dozen minesweepers , Budapest and the pre @-@ dreadnought Árpád bombarded the <unk> fortifications on 19 December . The ship transferred to Pola two days later , and she was decommissioned on 11 March 1918 . She became the accommodation ship for the submarine staff ( <unk> der U @-@ <unk> ) . Just over a week later , Admiral Franz von Keil proposed that a 38 @-@ centimeter siege howitzer be installed to bombard the <unk> fortifications . Little time was wasted , and removal of the forward gun turret and its barbette began on 26 March . The installation of the 38 @-@ centimeter ( 15 in ) gun was completed on 4 April although testing did not begin until 5 June when three shots were fired . The ship was recommissioned two days later with a reduced crew , and a practice shoot was conducted with unsatisfactory results on 6 August . Another training exercise scheduled for 20 August had to be cancelled for lack of ammunition . The howitzer was removed on 11 October and sent to the Army on 17 October . Budapest resumed her former role and remained at Pola . She was handed over to Great Britain as war reparations in January 1920 and broken up for scrap in Italy in 1921 . 
 = Eugene Wigner = 
 Eugene Paul " E. P. " Wigner ( Hungarian : Wigner Jenő Pál ; November 17 , 1902 – January 1 , 1995 ) , was a Hungarian @-@ American theoretical physicist and mathematician . He received half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 " for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles , particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles " . 
 A graduate of the Technical University of Berlin , Wigner worked as an assistant to Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin , and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen . Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics , particularly the theory of symmetry in physics . Along the way he performed ground @-@ breaking work in pure mathematics , in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems . In particular , Wigner 's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics . He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus . In 1930 , Princeton University recruited Wigner , along with John von Neumann , and he moved to the United States . 
 Wigner participated in a meeting with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein @-@ Szilard letter , which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs . Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first . During the Manhattan Project , he led a team whose task was to design nuclear reactors to convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium . At the time , reactors existed only on paper , and no reactor had yet gone critical . Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors , not just their construction . He became Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory ( now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ) in early 1946 , but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the Atomic Energy Commission , and returned to Princeton . 
 In the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies , including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951 , the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954 , the physics panel of the National Science Foundation , and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964 . In later life , he became more philosophical , and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences , his best @-@ known work outside of technical mathematics and physics . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wigner Jenő Pál was born in Budapest , Austria @-@ Hungary on November 17 , 1902 , to middle class Jewish parents , Elisabeth ( Einhorn ) and Anthony Wigner , a leather tanner . He had an older sister , Bertha , known as <unk> , and a younger sister Margit , known as <unk> , who later married British theoretical physicist Paul Dirac . He was home schooled by a professional teacher until the age of 9 , when he started school at the third grade . During this period , Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems . At the age of 11 , Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be tuberculosis . His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a sanatorium in the Austrian mountains , before the doctors concluded that the diagnosis was mistaken . 
 Wigner 's family was Jewish , but not religiously observant , and his Bar Mitzvah was a secular one . From 1915 through 1919 , he studied at the secondary grammar school called <unk> <unk> Gimnázium , the school his father had attended . Religious education was compulsory , and he attended classes in Judaism taught by a rabbi . A fellow student was János von Neumann , who was a year behind Wigner . They both benefited from the instruction of the noted mathematics teacher László <unk> . In 1919 , to escape the Béla Kun communist regime , the Wigner family briefly fled to Austria , returning to Hungary after Kun 's downfall . Partly as a reaction to the prominence of Jews in the Kun regime , the family converted to Lutheranism . Wigner explained later in his life that his family decision to convert to Lutheranism " was not at heart a religious decision but an anti @-@ communist one " . On religious views , Wigner was an atheist . 
 After graduating from the secondary school in 1920 , Wigner enrolled at the Budapest University of Technical Sciences , known as the <unk> . He was not happy with the courses on offer , and in 1921 enrolled at the Technische Hochschule Berlin ( now Technical University of Berlin ) , where he studied chemical engineering . He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the German Physical Society . These colloquia featured such luminaries as Max Planck , Max von Laue , Rudolf Ladenburg , Werner Heisenberg , Walther Nernst , Wolfgang Pauli , and Albert Einstein . Wigner also met the physicist Leó Szilárd , who at once became Wigner 's closest friend . A third experience in Berlin was formative . Wigner worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry ( now the Fritz Haber Institute ) , and there he met Michael Polanyi , who became , after László <unk> , Wigner 's greatest teacher . Polanyi supervised Wigner 's DSc thesis , Bildung und <unk> von <unk> ( " Formation and Decay of Molecules " ) . 
 = = Middle years = = 
 Wigner returned to Budapest , where he went to work at his father 's tannery , but in 1926 , he accepted an offer from Karl Weissenberg at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin . Weissenberg wanted someone to assist him with his work on x @-@ ray crystallography , and Polanyi had recommended Wigner . After six months as Weissenberg 's assistant , Wigner went to work for Richard Becker for two semesters . Wigner explored quantum mechanics , studying the work of Erwin Schrödinger . He also delved into the group theory of Ferdinand Frobenius and Eduard Ritter von Weber . 
 Wigner received a request from Arnold Sommerfeld to work at the University of Göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert . This proved a disappointment , as the aged Hilbert 's abilities were failing , and his interests had shifted to logic . Wigner nonetheless studied independently . He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D @-@ matrix . Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics . The latter had written a standard text , Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics ( 1928 ) , but it was not easy to understand , especially for younger physicists . Wigner 's Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra ( 1931 ) made group theory accessible to a wider audience . 
 In these works , Wigner laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics . Wigner 's theorem proved by Wigner in 1931 , is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics . The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations , translations , and <unk> symmetry are represented on the Hilbert space of states . According to the theorem , any symmetry transformation is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and <unk> transformation of Hilbert space . The representation of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation . 
 In the late 1930s , Wigner extended his research into atomic nuclei . By 1929 , his papers were drawing notice in the world of physics . In 1930 , Princeton University recruited Wigner for a one @-@ year lectureship , at 7 times the salary that he had been drawing in Europe . Princeton recruited von Neumann at the same time . Jenő Pál Wigner and János von Neumann had collaborated on three papers together in 1928 and two in 1929 . They anglicized their first names to " Eugene " and " John " , respectively . When their year was up , Princeton offered a five @-@ year contract as visiting professors for half the year . The Technische Hochschule responded with a teaching assignment for the other half of the year . This was very timely , since the Nazis soon rose to power in Germany . At Princeton in 1934 , Wigner introduced his sister <unk> to the physicist Paul Dirac , whom she married . 
 Princeton did not rehire Wigner when his contract ran out in 1936 . Through Gregory Breit , Wigner found new employment at the University of Wisconsin . There he met his first wife , Amelia Frank , who was a physics student there . However she died unexpectedly in 1937 , leaving Wigner distraught . He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there . Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8 , 1937 , and he brought his parents to the United States . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 Although he was a professed political amateur , on August 2 , 1939 , he participated in a meeting with Leó Szilárd and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein – Szilárd letter , which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs . Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first , and even refused to have his fingerprints taken because they could be used to track him down if Germany won . " Thoughts of being murdered , " he later recalled , " focus your mind wonderfully . " 
 On June 4 , 1941 , Wigner married his second wife , Mary Annette Wheeler , a professor of physics at Vassar College , who had completed her Ph.D. at Yale University in 1932 . After the war she taught physics on the faculty of Rutgers University 's Douglass College in New Jersey until her retirement in 1964 . They remained married until her death in November 1977 . They had two children , David Wigner and Martha Wigner Upton . 
 During the Manhattan Project , Wigner led a team that included Alvin M. Weinberg , Katharine Way , Gale Young and Edward Creutz . The group 's task was to design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium . At the time , reactors existed only on paper , and no reactor had yet gone critical . In July 1942 , Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design , with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling . Wigner was present at a converted rackets court under the stands at the University of Chicago 's abandoned Stagg Field on December 2 , 1942 , when the world 's first atomic reactor , Chicago Pile One ( CP @-@ 1 ) achieved a controlled nuclear chain reaction . 
 Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors , not just their construction . He threatened to resign in February 1943 , but was talked out of it by the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory , Arthur Compton , who sent him on vacation instead . As it turned out , a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem . Without the additional tubes , the reactor could have been run at 35 % power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power ; but this would have set the project back a year . During the 1950s , he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site . Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project , and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier . 
 An important discovery Wigner made during the project was the Wigner effect . This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation . The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post @-@ war period , and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely . It was eventually discovered that it could be overcome by controlled heating and annealing . 
 Through Manhattan project funding , Wigner and Leonard Eisenbud also developed an important general approach to nuclear reactions , the Wigner – Eisenbud R @-@ matrix theory , which was published in 1947 . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Wigner accepted a position as the Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory ( now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ) in Oak Ridge , Tennessee in early 1946 . Because he did not want to be involved in administrative duties , he became co @-@ director of the laboratory , with James Lum handling the administrative chores as executive director . When the newly created Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) took charge of the laboratory 's operations at the start of 1947 , Wigner feared that many of the technical decisions would be made in Washington . He also saw the Army 's continuation of wartime security policies at the laboratory as a " meddlesome oversight " , interfering with research . One such incident occurred in March 1947 , when the AEC discovered that Wigner 's scientists were conducting experiments with a critical mass of uranium @-@ 235 when the Director of the Manhattan Project , Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of Louis Slotin at the Los Alamos Laboratory . Wigner argued that Groves 's order had been superseded , but was forced to terminate the experiments , which were completely different from the one that killed Slotin . 
 Feeling unsuited to a managerial role in such an environment , he left Oak Ridge at the end of summer in 1947 and returned to Princeton University , although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for many years . In the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies , including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951 , the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954 , the physics panel of the National Science Foundation , and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964 . He also contributed to civil defense . 
 Near the end of his life , Wigner 's thoughts turned more philosophical . In 1960 , he published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics , which has become his best @-@ known work outside of technical mathematics and physics , The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences . He argued that biology and cognition could be the origin of physical concepts , as we humans perceive them , and that the happy coincidence that mathematics and physics were so well matched , seemed to be " unreasonable " and hard to explain . His original paper has provoked and inspired many responses across a wide range of disciplines . These included Richard Hamming in Computer Science , Arthur <unk> in Molecular Biology , Peter Norvig in data mining , Max Tegmark in Physics , Ivor Grattan @-@ Guinness in Mathematics , and Vela <unk> in Economics . 
 Wigner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 " for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles , particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles " . The prize was shared that year , with the other half of the award divided between Maria Goeppert @-@ Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen . Wigner professed that he had never considered the possibility that this might occur , and added : " I never expected to get my name in the newspapers without doing something wicked . " He also won the Franklin Medal in 1950 , the Enrico Fermi award in 1958 , the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959 , the Max Planck Medal in 1961 , the National Medal of Science in 1969 , the Albert Einstein Award in 1972 , and the eponymous Wigner Medal in 1978 . In 1968 he gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture . 
 Mary died in November 1977 . In 1979 , Wigner married his third wife , Eileen Clare @-@ Patton ( Pat ) Hamilton , the widow of physicist Donald Ross Hamilton , the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University , who had died in 1972 . In 1992 , at the age of 90 , he published his memoirs , The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner with Andrew <unk> . In it , Wigner said : " The full meaning of life , the collective meaning of all human desires , is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp . As a young man , I chafed at this state of affairs . But by now I have made peace with it . I even feel a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery . " In his collection of essays Symmetries and Reflections – Scientific Essays ( 1995 ) , he commented : " It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness . " 
 Wigner died of pneumonia at the University Medical Center in Princeton , New Jersey on 1 January 1995 . He was survived by his wife Eileen and children Erika , David and Martha , and his sisters Bertha and Margit .

 = Interstate 270 ( Colorado ) = 
 Interstate 270 ( I @-@ 270 ) is a 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 11 km ) highway in the northeastern part of the Denver – Aurora Metropolitan Area in the U.S. state of Colorado . It overlaps U.S. Highway 36 ( US 36 ) for its entire length . The western terminus of I @-@ 270 is at the interchange with I @-@ 25 and US 36 . It heads eastward to an interchange with I @-@ 76 , where the mileposts reset because of a previous freeway extension . The freeway heads southeast and comes to meet Vasquez Boulevard , where it enters Commerce City . The road crosses Quebec Street before ending at I @-@ 70 . 
 Ground was broken on the first segment of I @-@ 270 in 1965 , and the freeway was completed three years later , stretching from I @-@ 70 to Vasquez Boulevard . The road was then extended to I @-@ 76 two years later . The section between I @-@ 25 and I @-@ 76 was completed in 1999 . Since completion , this section has undergone much construction to renew bridges over Clear Creek and Washington Street . Because the western end of I @-@ 270 is close to the junction of I @-@ 25 and I @-@ 76 , some traffic movements to I @-@ 25 can only be made by using I @-@ 76 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 270 begins at an interchange with I @-@ 25 in Welby , and is concurrent with US 36 . The speed limit through the first section is 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . The freeway heads southeastward for about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , crossing over Washington Street and State Highway 224 ( SH 224 ) , but access is not provided to either road . Mileposts along I @-@ 270 reset to zero at the I @-@ 76 interchange because it was the original western end of the Interstate . Since the I @-@ 76 interchange is close to both I @-@ 270 's western end and to the I @-@ 25 / I @-@ 76 interchanges , some movements in the interchange are missing . Eastbound I @-@ 270 traffic cannot access westbound I @-@ 76 , nor can eastbound I @-@ 76 traffic access westbound I @-@ 270 . However , traffic on I @-@ 25 can access both westbound I @-@ 76 and eastbound I @-@ 270 , thus completing the missing movements . The three interchanges work together by eliminating bottlenecks caused by redundant interchanges . 
 Beyond the I @-@ 76 interchange , the speed limit increases to 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . The freeway heads southeast and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with York Street , and crosses the South Platte River into a commercial area in Adams County . I @-@ 270 enters the city of Commerce City , running roughly parallel with the nearby Sand Creek and crossing over SH 265 without an exit . Continuing through the city , the route comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Vasquez Boulevard , which carries US 85 , SH 2 , and US 6 . The freeway heads eastward into Denver , where it has an exit at SH 35 , a short highway which continues northward along Quebec Street for one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) . Quebec Street provides access for traffic heading to westbound I @-@ 70 . The route ends shortly thereafter when it merges into I @-@ 70 . 
 The freeway is maintained by the Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) , who is responsible for maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in Colorado , including highways . As part of this role , CDOT periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2009 , CDOT calculated that as few as 56 @,@ 500 vehicles used I @-@ 270 daily east of its western terminus at I @-@ 25 , and as many as 89 @,@ 600 vehicles used I @-@ 270 daily southeast of York Street in Commerce City . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire route is listed on the National Highway System , a system of roads that are important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 I @-@ 270 was constructed in several phases , beginning with a section from I @-@ 70 to Vasquez Boulevard . Following this section was another part of the freeway from Vasquez Boulevard west to I @-@ 76 , and finally a section from US 36 to I @-@ 76 . This last segment has undergone much more construction , including new bridges and ramps at interchanges .

 Construction on I @-@ 270 began in 1965 . The first portion cost about $ 2 @.@ 7 million . It opened in 1968 , connecting I @-@ 70 to Vasquez Boulevard . Two years later , another two @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) segment connected the portion already in service to I @-@ 80S . I @-@ 80S became I @-@ 76 in 1976 . Construction began on the section between I @-@ 76 and I @-@ 25 in April 1993 and was finished in September 1999 , costing $ 11 @.@ 4 million . The mileposts were already established when construction took place , so the route was not assigned new mileposts . Completion of this portion largely decreased traffic problems in the area .

 The bridges along westbound I @-@ 270 over Washington Street were replaced and finished in the late 1990s , costing $ 12 million . By the end of 1998 , the bridges over Clear Creek near the I @-@ 76 interchange were completed . In February 2000 , a connection between westbound I @-@ 270 and westbound US 36 was completed , as was access between I @-@ 76 westbound and I @-@ 270 westbound . The eastbound section between US 36 and I @-@ 76 , including new bridges over Washington Street and Clear Creek , was completed in March 2002 and totaled $ 8 @.@ 5 million . Three years later , a flyover ramp was constructed connecting I @-@ 25 southbound to I @-@ 270 eastbound . However , access between I @-@ 270 eastbound and I @-@ 76 westbound still does not exist .

 = Let 's Kill Hitler = 
 " Let 's Kill Hitler " is the eighth episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , and was first broadcast on BBC One , Space and BBC America on 27 August 2011 . " Let 's Kill Hitler " was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Richard Senior . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) and his companions Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) and her husband Rory Williams ( Arthur Darvill ) crash land in 1938 Berlin when the TARDIS is hijacked by Amy and Rory 's childhood friend , Mels ( Nina Toussaint @-@ White ) . They accidentally save Adolf Hitler ( Albert Welling ) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta , a time @-@ travelling justice department . When shot by Hitler , Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song , the grown version of Amy and Rory 's child who had been taken away from them . As River is a criminal herself due to her future execution of the Doctor , the Teselecta pursue her instead , whilst the Doctor faces death from her poisoned lipstick . 
 Moffat intended for " Let 's Kill Hitler " to be more lighthearted than the series opener , and he intended to make fun of Hitler . The episode concludes many elements of River Song 's arc . The episode was filmed around March and April 2011 , although the opening sequence , set in a cornfield , was filmed much later in the final scenes shot for the series as they had to wait for the corn to grow . Much of Berlin was filmed in Swansea , Wales while The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was also used as a location . In the UK , the episode attracted 8 @.@ 10 million viewers , the second most @-@ watched episode of the series . Critical reception was mostly positive , though some were critical of the Teselecta and various aspects of the setting and characters .

 On 15 August 2011 , the BBC released a short " prequel " to " Let 's Kill Hitler " , written by Steven Moffat . In the prequel , Amy calls the Doctor and leaves a message for the Doctor on the TARDIS 's answer phone , begging him to find her child , Melody . Though Amy knows Melody will grow up to be River Song , she does not want to miss seeing her grow up . As she ends her message , it is revealed that a very upset Doctor was listening but did not pick up the phone , even though Amy had pleaded for him to . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 In modern @-@ day Leadworth , Amy and Rory create a crop circle to gain the Doctor 's attention via its newspaper coverage . He arrives with his TARDIS , but they are soon joined by Mels , Amy and Rory 's childhood friend who knows of Amy 's " raggedy Doctor " and was responsible for Amy and Rory 's relationship ; Amy had subsequently named her daughter Melody after Mels . On the run from the police after stealing a car , Mels brandishes a gun and coerces them to escape in the TARDIS and " kill Hitler " . Inside , she fires the gun , hitting the central console which fills the time machine with a poisonous gas and sends it out of control . 
 Back in 1938 Berlin , " Justice Vehicle <unk> " , a Teselecta , a <unk> , human @-@ looking robot manned by a human crew from the future miniaturised inside it , is seeking to deliver justice on major criminals from the past . They do this by using the Teselecta 's weapons to torture the criminal , near the end of their timeline . Having taken on the appearance of a Wehrmacht officer to meet with Hitler , they are surprised when the TARDIS crashes into Hitler 's office . Hitler , already panicked , fires on the Teselecta , but his aim is poor and strikes Mels . As Rory punches Hitler and locks him in a cupboard , the TARDIS crew finds Mels regenerating , becoming the woman they know as River Song — Melody as a grown woman . River , having been trained by her captors to kill the Doctor , makes several attempts but the Doctor has taken precautions to nullify these . Instead , River kisses him and — before disappearing into the streets of Berlin — reveals that her lipstick is poison ( from the " Judas Tree " ) , which will kill the Doctor within the hour and prevent his regeneration . The Doctor orders Amy and Rory to follow River , passing Amy his sonic screwdriver , while he returns to the TARDIS to try to discover a cure . The Teselecta , aware that the Doctor 's death on 22 April 2011 is a " fixed point in time " ( " The Impossible Astronaut " ) , instead follows Amy and Rory in chasing down River , having identified her as their most wanted war criminal , responsible for the Doctor 's death . 
 Amy and Rory chase River to a café at the Hotel Adlon , but the Teselecta arrives , bringing them aboard as allies , and takes on Amy 's appearance , allowing the robot to get close to River to attack her . Before they can complete the attack , the TARDIS materialises ; the Doctor , spurred on by the TARDIS ' " voice interface " hologram of Amy 's younger self , Amelia , has found time to dress for the period and stops the attack , now aware of the Teselecta 's nature . The captain speaks to the Doctor , informing him that River has been trained to kill him by the Silence , a religious order that believes that when " the oldest question in the universe " is asked , silence will fall across the universe . When the crew refuse to back down from attacking River , Amy uses the sonic screwdriver to turn the robot 's " antibodies " — its security robots — against the crew . The crew abandon the robot by being teleported away by their mothership , leaving Amy and Rory to face the antibodies . 
 The Doctor finds himself too weak from the poison 's effects to pilot the TARDIS to rescue his companions ; River is inspired by the Doctor 's sympathy , and finds herself guided by the TARDIS itself to pilot the ship , and rescues Amy and Rory in time . On returning to the café , the trio finds the Doctor near death ; he asks River to find " River Song " and give her a message , then whispers something in her ear before he passes away . River , who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond , asks Amy who River Song is ; Amy uses the Teselecta to show River her form stored in the robot 's database of who she is to become . With this , River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life , and passes out . The Doctor , Amy , and Rory take her to a hospital in the far future , leaving the TARDIS @-@ shaped diary as a gift by her bedside , and depart . Later , River is shown becoming an archaeologist so she can find the Doctor herself . Aboard the TARDIS , the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta , but does not reveal this knowledge to Amy or Rory . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 This episode reveals the origins to several facets of the River Song character . Before transforming into River , Mels states that she was the young girl seen regenerating at the end of " Day of the Moon " , becoming " a toddler " who presumably grew up to become Mels . River 's worn TARDIS @-@ coloured diary , which the Doctor and his companions have seen in her relative future , is given to her brand @-@ new by the Doctor . The Doctor introduces her to the concept of " spoilers " , seen originally in the 10th Doctor story " Silence in the Library " / " Forest of the Dead " , and becoming a virtual catchphrase for River . River 's aptitude for flying the TARDIS — having been taught how by the machine itself — is demonstrated in " The Time of Angels " ; River explains she " had lessons from the very best " ( which the Doctor assumes refers to himself ) and that the Doctor was " busy that day " . The Teselecta crew consider River a wanted , dangerous criminal ; River is shown being in prison in her personal future in " The Time of Angels " for killing " the best man I ever knew " . In this episode 's epilogue , River joins the Luna University to become an archaeologist , in order to find the Doctor . Her previous appearances ( events which take place later in River 's personal timeline ) show that she will / has acquired her degrees . When River wakes up in hospital , the Doctor says " Rule One : The Doctor lies " . This rule is ' repeated ' by River herself in " The Big Bang " , a future event in her own personal timeline . 
 While activating the voice interface aboard the TARDIS , the Doctor is shown holograms of his former companions Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) , Martha Jones ( Freema Agyeman ) and Donna Noble ( Catherine Tate ) . He rejects these , as they all cause him guilt . He eventually settles on the young Amelia ( " The Eleventh Hour " ) , who also appears ( in flashback scenes of Amy 's past ) interacting with a younger Mels and Rory . The young Amelia voice interface brings up " fish fingers and custard " , an allusion to the Doctor 's meal with the real Amelia in " The Eleventh Hour " . The concept of " fixed points in time " has been explored before , such as in " The Fires of Pompeii " . The supposed " state of temporal grace " within the TARDIS was previously asserted by the Fourth Doctor during The Hand of Fear .

 Serving as the mid @-@ series premiere , it is the opposite of the tone of the opening story " The Impossible Astronaut " / " Day of the Moon " , which was " grim and dark " . Writer Steven Moffat wanted to show Hitler in a comedic light and " take the mickey out of him " instead of making him " an icon of evil " . He compared it to a scene in an Indiana Jones film which made fun of Hitler . 
 Moffat enjoyed writing Mels ' regeneration scene , finding comedy in her checking out her new body . He asserts that the episode is the beginning of River 's story and shows how she became the woman the Doctor met in previous episodes . During the moments after her regeneration , River reenacts the iconic scene between Mrs Robinson ( Anne Bancroft ) and Benjamin ( Dustin Hoffman ) from the movie The Graduate , calling out to the Doctor " Hello , Benjamin " . The camera angle is also a tribute to the film . The Doctor previously likened River to Mrs Robinson in " The Impossible Astronaut " . 
 The cast and crew felt that the costume and make @-@ up artists did a good job with Albert Welling , as he looked so much like Hitler it was a " surreal " experience . Ella <unk> , who plays Harriet in this episode , later appeared in the Fourth Doctor audio drama The Wrath of the Iceni where she played Boudica . Darvill was pleased that his character , Rory , was more of an " action hero " in the episode . Before broadcast , Smith stated that it was " maybe [ his ] favorite episode to date ... it just rockets along " . Smith 's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket , a long dark @-@ green military overcoat , for the first time in this episode . In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor 's costume , executive producer Piers Wenger said , " I think he 'd really like to evolve it next series . He 's really keen to have a coat . " Smith explained that he wanted a coat because of the cold weather . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 The read @-@ through for " Let 's Kill Hitler " took place on 21 March 2011 . The opening scene in the cornfield were the last shots filmed of the series on 11 July 2011 . The scene was filmed last because the crew had to wait for the corn to grow ; Moffat had written the scene in February . Much of Berlin was filmed in Swansea . Vintage vehicles from the period were used ; Darvill loved the motorbike , although he was not allowed to ride it as it was the job of the stuntman . The Temple of Peace in Cardiff used in the episode for the German dinner party was also used for Gillan 's first Doctor Who appearance , when she played a <unk> in " The Fires of Pompeii " . Smith , Gillan , and Darvill had previously filmed in the Temple of Peace for " Cold Blood " of the previous series . Hitler 's office was one of the biggest sets that had been built for the show . Typically it would have been filmed in a real building , but the TARDIS had to crash through the wall and thus the set had to be destroyed with an air cannon . The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was the inspiration for the design of the Teselecta corridors . 
 One scene involving the Teselecta ( disguised as a German soldier ) chasing Amy and Rory on motorcycles through Berlin was cut from filming due to budget issues . AT & T , who wanted to advertise in the United States broadcast of the episode on BBC America as a tie @-@ in to their " Rethink possible " slogan , brought the idea of using a motion comic to create a bridging scene within the advertising break where this scene would have been placed . AT & T and BBC America worked with Moffat and Senior to create the 60 second scene , which was animated by Double Barrel Motion Labs .

 " Let 's Kill Hitler " was first broadcast on 27 August 2011 on BBC One in the United Kingdom . Internationally , it was broadcast in America on sister station BBC America on 27 August as well as on Space in Canada . Overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 6 @.@ 2 million viewers on BBC One , the second most viewed show of the day behind The X Factor . The episode also came in at number one on the BBC iPlayer service the day after it aired as well as topping the requests on the service for the month of August with 0 @.@ 99 million views . The episode also received an Appreciation Index of 85 , considered " excellent " . Final viewing figures came in at 8 @.@ 10 million , the eleventh most watched programme of the week . It was also the second most @-@ watched episode of the sixth series , behind " The Impossible Astronaut " . 
 Some viewers complained to the BBC believing they heard a German guard say the profanity " where the fuck is he ? " However , the BBC stated he said , " Halt , was machen Sie ? " , which means " Stop , what are you doing ? " in German . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . Dan Martin , writing for The Guardian , was more pleased with " Let 's Kill Hitler " as an opener than " A Good Man Goes to War " as a finale , and said it was " an energetic , timey @-@ wimey tour de force with gags and flourishes like the car and the crop circles that still maintained a strong sense of what it was about " . He also commended Alex Kingston 's performance , saying that " she got to steal her every scene even more completely than usual , masterfully swerving the episode into a properly emotional final act " . Martin later rated it the sixth best episode of the series , though the finale was not included in the list . He commented that it may be " divisive " amongst fans as it was criticised for not making sense to casual viewers of the programme , but Martin said he " loved it " . Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode four out of five stars , praising it for being " jam @-@ packed full of ideas , twists , turns and wibbly @-@ wobbly time @-@ bending stuff " and " giddily thrilling entertainment , albeit rather exhausting " . He also praised the way it allowed Rory to " finally find his niche " . 
 Writing for The Independent , Neela Debnath praised the lighter mood and " great slapstick moments " . Though she thought the identity of Mels was " obvious to everyone but the characters " , she said that Toussaint @-@ White was " excellent " and that " it was shame that she regenerated so early on because she brought a different energy to the character " . Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern , unlike Debnath , admitted that Mels ' true identity " took [ him ] completely by surprise " . He thought that a plot hole was generated in terms of what Melody did in between regenerating in 1969 and joining Amy and Rory , still as a child , 20 years later , but said that " the episode moves too fast for such quibbles to stick , and it is hilarious " . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called it " a marvelously energetic , funny , clever , noble mid @-@ season start " and praised the acting of Smith , Gillan , Darvill , and particularly Kingston , as well as the emotion that developed in the episode . 
 IGN 's Matt Risley gave the episode a score of 9 out of 10 , saying that it was " arguably Moffat 's most unashamedly fun Time Lord romp yet " . While he praised the humour , plot , and character development , he was critical of the Teselecta ; though they " score [ ed ] high on the sci @-@ fi kitsch factor " they were " anything but memorable " . SFX magazine critic Richard Edwards gave " Let 's Kill Hitler " five out of five stars , thinking it " has to rank among the cleverest Who episodes Moffat has ever written " . While he praised Kingston 's performance , he wrote that " it 's Matt Smith who steals the show , in one of his finest performances as the Doctor ... he 's utterly magnificent , whether acting the joker , or living out 32 minutes ( ish ) of death scene . The mix of optimism ... and sadness is a tricky thing to pull off , yet Smith does it in a quintessentially Doctor way " . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B + , saying that he was " a bit divided " . He praised Moffat 's River Song arc , which made " the mind [ reel ] ... in a good way " , as well as the dialogue and " big concepts " . On the other hand , he did not think the Teselecta 's mission was developed and " as characters they seem kind of bland " . What " really [ troubled ] " him was that it did not have the " impact " of some previous episodes and he thought it unlikely that Amy and Rory were willing to quickly accept that they were meant to raise their daughter as a school friend . 
 Jim Shelley of The Daily Mirror was also negative about the episode , especially towards Alex Kingston , who appeared to be acting while " the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly naturally " . The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller said that Moffat " delivered a pacy romp " and praised the concept of the Teselecta , but was disappointed with the " wasted opportunity " of the setting . He thought that the setting offered " great dramatic potential " but was " little more than window dressing for the story " . He also felt using Hitler as a comic relief " struck a wrong note given the nature of the man and the regime he led " and that it was " an odd way to treat such an historically significant character " . He was also critical of Moffat 's " seeming keenness to kill the regular cast in some way , shape or form " . However , Entertainment Weekly 's Tucker thought that it " didn 't need Hitler to be an excellent [ Doctor Who ] episode " .

 The 2000 CECAFA Cup was the 24th edition of the football tournament , which involves teams from Southern and Central Africa . The matches were played in Uganda , a decision which Tanzania protested , but to no avail . Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA , the world football governing body . The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000 . Prior to the tournament , Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties , but re @-@ entered . Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew , but stayed out . The reasoning behind their withdrawal was unknown . 
 Nine teams entered the tournament , as opposed to the twelve teams competing at the previous tournament in 1999 . However , there were only eight different nations competing in the tournament as Uganda entered two teams : Uganda ( A ) and Uganda ( B ) . Uganda ( A ) was in Group A , and Uganda ( B ) was in Group B , enabling the two the correct set @-@ up to be able to meet each other in the final , as occurred here . Both <unk> topped their respective groups , and progressed to the knockout stages along with Ethiopia and Rwanda . Uganda ( A ) beat Rwanda , and Uganda ( B ) beat Ethiopia to mean that " the Cranes " ( Uganda [ A ] ) and " the Lions " ( Uganda ( B ) ) would meet in the final . In the final , Uganda ( A ) captained by George <unk> of Express , won 2 – 0 . Ethiopia finished third after beating Rwanda on penalties 4 – 2 after the match finished 0 – 0 .

 The CECAFA Cup is considered Africa 's oldest football tournament , and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa . The tournament was originally named the Gossage Cup , contested by the four nations of Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika ( modern day Tanzania ) , and Zanzibar ; it ran from 1929 until 1965 . In 1967 , this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup , often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup , which was competed for five years , until 1971 , before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973 . The 1999 champions were Rwanda ( B ) , in 2000 they emerged from their group second , after Uganda ( B ) , 5 points behind but 2 points ahead of the next team , Eritrea . They were then knocked out in the semi @-@ finals against Uganda ( A ) . The 2000 champions , Uganda , were knocked out in the 1999 semi @-@ finals by none other than Rwanda .

Due to there being an odd number of teams , Group A contained more matches and an additional team , with a total of 5 to Group B 's 4 teams . 
 = Smallville = 
 Smallville is an American television series developed by writer @-@ producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar , based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster . The series , initially broadcast by The WB , premiered on October 16 , 2001 . After Smallville 's fifth season , The WB and UPN merged to form The CW , the series ' later United States broadcaster . Smallville , which ended its tenth and final season on May 13 , 2011 , follows Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) in the fictional town of Smallville , Kansas , before he becomes known as Superman . The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high school . After season five Smallville ventures into adult settings , eventually focusing on his career at the Daily Planet and introducing other DC comic @-@ book superheroes and villains . 
 Before the series ' production Bruce Wayne , chronicling the young protagonist 's journey toward Batman , was proposed ; although that series failed to generate interest , it inspired Smallville . Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their " no tights , no flights " rule to the president of Warner Bros. Television , reducing Superman to the bare essentials and examining what led Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel . After seven seasons with the show , Gough and Millar departed with little explanation . Smallville was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver , British Columbia , with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations . Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by Mark Snow , who incorporated elements of John Williams 's musical score from the Superman film series . In season seven , Louis Febre ( who worked with Snow from the beginning ) became the series ' primary composer . 
 Smallville was generally positively received when it began . Former Superman star Christopher Reeve expressed approval for the series , making two guest appearances before his death . The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut , with 8 @.@ 4 million viewers . Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4 @.@ 34 million viewers per episode , with season two the highest @-@ rated at 6 @.@ 3 million . By the end of its run , Smallville passed Stargate SG @-@ 1 as the longest @-@ running North American science @-@ fiction series . Since its first season , the series received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards . Smallville spawned a series of young @-@ adult novels , a DC Comics bimonthly comic book , soundtrack recordings and series @-@ related merchandise . All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1 , 2 and 4 . In April 2012 , it continued in comic @-@ book form with a storyline resuming shortly after the series finale , and ended in November 2014 . 
 = = Series overview = = 
 The regular cast is introduced in season one , with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure . The one @-@ episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar . Smallville 's first season primarily dealt with Clark 's coming to terms with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the death of Lana Lang 's parents . After the first season the series had fewer villain @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week episodes , focusing instead on individual @-@ character story arcs and exploring Clark 's origins . Major storylines include Clark 's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex 's escalating conflict with his father , Lionel . The disembodied voice of Clark 's father , Jor @-@ El , is introduced ; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship , setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark 's earthly destiny . In a fourth @-@ season arc Clark , instructed by Jor @-@ El , searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude . Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod , and must capture ( or destroy ) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals . His cousin Kara arrives , and Lex Luthor discovers Clark 's secret . The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome ( Smallville 's version of Doomsday ) , and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor . Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen ( Green Arrow ) after being a recurring guest in season six . In the ninth season Major Zod ( Callum Blue ) and other members of Zod 's military group are revived ( without their Kryptonian powers ) by Tess Mercer , and their efforts to regain their powers are the season 's central conflict . The final season revolves around Clark 's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be , while confronting his biggest challenges : the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Tom Welling plays Clark Kent , a young man with superhuman abilities who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an alien and uses his powers to help those in danger . Clark 's season @-@ one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life . After months of scouting , Welling was cast as Clark . Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor 's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script , after reading the script Welling agreed to audition . 
 Kristin Kreuk plays Lana Lang , the girl next door . Grieving the loss of her parents , she has empathy for everyone and feels connected to Clark . Kreuk was the first to be cast , after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent . Although she left the series after the seventh season , she returned for five episodes in season eight as a guest star . 
 Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor , a billionaire 's son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant . After Clark saves his life , they become fast friends . As the series progresses , Lex 's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies . The role was difficult to cast ; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and , feeling that he did not take his first audition seriously enough , outlined a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ page scene indicating where to be funny , charismatic or menacing . His second audition went so well that he was hired . Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons , reprising his role for the series finale . 
 Allison Mack plays Chloe Sullivan , one of Clark 's best friends , who is in love with him ( although her feelings are not reciprocated ) . Editor of the school newspaper , her journalistic curiosity and desire to " expose falsehoods " and " know the truth " create tension with her friends ( especially when she investigates Clark 's past ) . After learning about Smallville from casting director Dee Dee Bradley , Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan . The character was created just for the series , and was intended to have an " ethnic background " before Mack was hired . She has since appeared in the comic book . 
 Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross , another best friend of Clark 's and the first person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret . Although he is in love with Chloe , he does not admit it because of the Clark @-@ Lana @-@ Chloe love triangle already in place . Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three , but made a guest appearance in season seven . Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast , with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot . In the comics Ross is Caucasian , but the producers chose to cast Jones ( who is African @-@ American ) . 
 Annette O 'Toole plays Martha Kent , Clark 's adoptive mother . She and her husband , Jonathan , give Clark wise advice about coping with his increasing abilities . In season five Martha takes a state @-@ senate seat , and in season six she leaves the show . Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent , during filming everyone ( including Ettinger ) realized that she was not right for the part . O 'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot . Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent The Huntress was canceled , allowing O 'Toole to join the cast . The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III . 
 John Schneider plays Jonathan Kent , Clark 's adoptive father , who goes to great lengths to protect his son 's secret ; according to Schneider , Jonathan is " perfectly willing to go to jail , or worse , to protect his son . " Schneider was written out of the show in the series ' 100th episode , with Jonathan dying of a heart attack the night of his election victory . Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville ; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard , which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm . 
 Eric Johnson plays Whitney Fordman , Lana 's boyfriend in season one , who becomes jealous of Clark and Lana 's budding friendship and hazes him . He reconciles with Clark before joining the Marines and going to Afghanistan . Although Whitney was written out of the show in the first @-@ season finale , he made cameo appearances in the season @-@ two episode " Visage " ( where it is disclosed that he was killed in action ) and the season @-@ four episode " Façade " ( during a flashback to Clark 's freshman year of high school ) . Johnson , who auditioned for Lex and Clark before he was cast as Whitney , was pleased that the writers gave his character a hero 's exit . 
 John Glover plays Lionel Luthor , Lex 's father . Lionel is responsible for the Kents ' adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins . Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to " toughen [ Lex ] up " , and saw the character as a rich , powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son . Lionel was created for Smallville to parallel the Kents and as an " experiment in extreme parenting . " A recurring first @-@ season guest , Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex near the end of the seventh season . Lionel returns in a parallel @-@ universe version , also portrayed by Glover , during the final season in a recurring role . 
 Jensen Ackles plays Jason Teague , Lana 's love interest , in season four . He follows Lana to Smallville from Paris , taking a job as the school 's assistant football coach , but is fired when their relationship comes to light . By the end of the season , it is disclosed that he was working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge . Before he was cast as Jason , Ackles was second in line for the role of Clark Kent . Although he received top billing for season four and was contracted for season five , he was written out of the show in the season @-@ four finale because of his commitment to Supernatural . 
 Erica Durance plays Lois Lane , Chloe 's cousin who comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe 's supposed death and stays with the Kents . Durance , a recurring guest in season four , became a series regular . The producers wanted to bring Lois Lane to the series , and Chloe 's supposed death in the season @-@ three finale provided the opportunity . Durance was cast three days before filming began ; although she could initially appear in only four episodes , according to the film division of Warner Bros. , after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances . 
 Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen , Chloe 's photographer boyfriend who works at the Daily Planet . Ashmore , a recurring guest in season six , became a regular cast member in season seven . He called his casting a welcome surprise : " I auditioned for [ the role ] and I put myself on tape . I hadn 't heard anything , and a couple of weeks later , all of the sudden ( sic ) , I got the call saying , ' You 're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville . ' It 's a dream come true , really . " After three seasons on the series ( two as a regular ) , Ashmore 's character was killed off . Although Ashmore 's Jimmy Olsen was murdered , he said his character was not the " real " Jimmy Olsen ; Jimmy 's younger brother , who appears briefly in the season @-@ eight finale , is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois . Ashmore returns as the real , younger Jimmy in the series finale . 
 Laura Vandervoort plays Kara , Clark 's Kryptonian cousin . Sent to look after Kal @-@ El ( Clark ) , she was in suspended animation for eighteen years . When the dam confining Kara 's ship broke in the season @-@ six finale , " Phantom " , she was set free . She has Clark 's abilities , including flight . At the end of the seventh season , Kara was trapped in the Phantom Zone . Although Vandervoort did not return regularly for the eighth season , she had guest appearances to wrap up her storyline in season eight 's " Bloodline " and season ten 's " Supergirl " and " Prophecy " . 
 Justin Hartley plays Oliver Queen ( Green Arrow ) , the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes . Hartley , a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons , became a series regular in season eight and was the producers ' first choice to play Oliver Queen . He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime . 
 Samuel Witwer plays Davis Bloome in season eight . A " charismatic " paramedic struggling with inner darkness , Davis Bloome is Smallville 's version of Doomsday ( the only character to kill Superman ) . Davis would come to resemble his comic @-@ book counterpart over the course of the season . Brian Peterson said that with Michael Rosenbaum 's departure , the new executive producers were looking for a villain " as great as Lex " and Doomsday fit the bill . 
 Cassidy Freeman plays Tess Mercer , Lex 's handpicked successor as LuthorCorp CEO in season eight . Her name is an homage to two Superman characters , Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves . Freeman described her character as " fierce " , " fun " , and " intelligent " , with finding Lex her primary season @-@ eight goal . Tess believes that Clark will be able to help her . In the season @-@ ten episode " Abandoned " , it is disclosed that her birth name is <unk> Lena Luthor and she is Lionel 's illegitimate daughter . 
 Callum Blue plays Zod , an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was sent to the Phantom Zone prison . His character is first mentioned in season five , when Brainiac uses Lex 's body as a vessel for Zod 's spirit , and he appears in a Kryptonian sphere in the season @-@ eight finale . Smallville 's executive producers called this incarnation " Major Zod " ( as opposed to the typical " General Zod " ) , and in season nine " the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters " .

 Tollin / Robbins Productions originally wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne , but the feature @-@ film division of Warner Bros. decided to develop an origin movie for Batman and did not want to compete with a television series . In 2000 Tollin / Robbins approached Peter Roth , president of Warner Bros. Television , about developing a series on a young Superman . That year , Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film Eraser . After watching the pilot , Roth approached Gough and Millar about developing a pilot about a young Superman ; the two made a " no tights , no flights " rule that Clark would not fly or wear the Superman suit during the series . 
 Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman to his " bare essence " , exploring why Clark Kent became the Man of Steel . They felt that because they were not comic @-@ book fans or familiar with the universe , they would have an unbiased approach to the series . Gough and Millar learned about the characters , researching the comics and choosing what they liked . They pitched their idea to The WB and Fox on the same day . A bidding war between the networks followed , with The WB committing to thirteen episodes . 
 Although Roth , Gough and Millar knew the show would be action @-@ oriented , they wanted to reach 7th Heaven 's " middle America iconography " . To create atmosphere , the team decided the meteor shower bringing Clark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show . The primary source of his life on Earth and the super @-@ powered beings Clark must fight , it would take away the parents of the girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark path . Roth appreciated Clark 's conflict in dealing with the fact that his arrival caused so much pain . 
 The creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people . They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive him to reach out to the teenagers , a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana . Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor , Lex 's father , whom they saw as conducting an " experiment in extreme parenting . " They wanted a younger Kent couple , to be involved in Clark 's life and help him on his journey . Chloe Sullivan ( another character created for the series ) was considered the " outsider " the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville rather than a " precursor to Lois Lane " . 
 Smallville has been described by Warner Bros. as a from @-@ the @-@ roots reinterpretation of Superman mythology . Since the November 2004 reacquisition of Superboy by the Siegel family , a copyright infringement dispute has arisen over ownership of the fictional town of Smallville and a claimed similarity between Superboy and Smallville 's Clark Kent . According to the Siegel heirs , " Smallville is part of the Superboy copyright " ( which they hold ) .

 On April 3 , 2008 , after seven seasons with the series , Gough and Millar announced that they were leaving Smallville . The developers thanked the cast and crew for their work , acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as " their vision " of the show . A reason for their departure was not provided . Gough and Millar were replaced as showrunners by Todd Slavkin , Darren Swimmer , Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson . All began writing for the series at the start of the second season , and were executive producers by the seventh season . On February 6 , 2009 , after one season , the L.A. Times confirmed that Swimmer and Slavkin would take over the new CW series Melrose Place and not return for Smallville 's ninth season ; Souders and Peterson would continue as showrunners . On July 24 , 2009 , it was reported Tom Welling was a co @-@ executive producer of the series . On March 26 , 2010 , The Hollywood Reporter disclosed that Millar , Gough and co @-@ producer Tollin / Robins Productions filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and The CW charging that Hollywood 's " vertical integration " cost Millar and Gough millions of dollars . The suit claimed that Warner Bros. failed to " maximize profits " in marketing Smallville , misrepresented production costs and sold the show to foreign markets at " well below the value of the series " , not specifying the amount of compensation sought by the plaintiffs . In a May 20 , 2010 press release from The CW , Tom Welling was appointed an executive producer for Smallville 's tenth season . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The series was produced at BB Studios in Burnaby , British Columbia . Although production was initially planned for Australia , Vancouver had more of a " Middle America landscape " . The city provided a site for the Kent farm , doubled for Metropolis , provided a cheaper shooting location and was in the Los Angeles time zone . Smallville 's Main Street is a combination of two locations in the town of Merritt and Cloverdale . 
 Vancouver Technical School doubled as the exterior for Smallville High , since the school had the " mid @-@ American largess " wanted by the filmmakers and was in keeping with Millar 's idea that Smallville should be the epitome of " Smalltown , USA " . Templeton Secondary School was used for Smallville High 's interior . During season one , the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville High 's red and yellow and distributed large Smallville High Crows logos ; so much of the school was painted that it adopted red and yellow as its school colors . The students became accustomed to the film crew ( which had to shoot when school was in session ) , and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the students could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next class . 
 The Kent farm is a working farm in <unk> . Owned by the <unk> , the crew painted their home yellow for the show . Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at Hatley Castle in Victoria . The interiors were filmed at Shannon Mews in Vancouver , also the set for the Dark Angel pilot and the film Along Came a Spider . <unk> Cinema , in Cloverdale was used for exteriors of the Talon , Smallville 's coffeehouse . 
 The story is told from Clark 's point of view , so color schemes and camera selection illustrate how he interprets his environment . When he is safe at home , the colors are " warm and gentle " earth tones and the camera movement is " very gentle " . When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger , the lighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile . When danger is present , the lighting becomes colder and the camera is handheld to allow for more " extreme angles " . In Metropolis " clean , hard @-@ lined architecture " predominates , with blues , purples and reflective metals the dominant scheme . The same concept is used for the characters ; Lex usually has a " glass , steel background " , and Lionel has a white or " clinical blue " background . Lex typically wears black , grey and " cool tones " ( purples and blues ) . Clark is represented by red , yellow and blue , similar to the traditional Superman costume , and " All @-@ American " red , white and blue . From season two onward , Entity FX produced all of the visual effects for Smallville , including the view of the Metropolis skyline . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composer Mark Snow worked with producer Ken Horton to create Smallville 's score . Snow composed music as he watched the picture , and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings . He then sent the music to the producers , who sent it back for recomposition if needed . Individual episodes have their own soundtrack , comprising one ( or more ) songs . Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade @-@ Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack . Their choices were discussed by the producers , who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights . Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a " typical action @-@ adventure " television show , " the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional , orchestral approach to the score " . 
 The main Smallville theme was not composed by Snow , although he composed opening themes for other shows ( including The X @-@ Files ) . The series ' opening music is " Save Me " by Remy Zero . Snow composed the closing @-@ credits music , which was intended as Smallville 's theme . During the first two seasons , the closing @-@ credits music was a potential theme for the series ( before " Save Me " was selected ) ; it was more " heroic " and " in @-@ your @-@ face " . Snow was told during season two that the closing credits needed new music , since the show had evolved and the existing music was no longer suitable , and he created a new , toned @-@ down score with a more " melodic " sound . Snow has also reworked music from the previous Superman films . John Williams ' musical score for the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of Superman was used in season two 's " Rosetta " ( which featured a guest appearance by Christopher Reeve ) and several times in the season @-@ two finale . To save money Snow recorded his version of Williams ' score , since using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams ' orchestra . 
 In an interview with Randall Larson on May 23 , 2008 Snow said that he would not be returning to Smallville , citing the joint workload of Smallville and Ghost Whisperer , but would return for Ghost Whisperer . Reminiscing about his work on the show , Snow said that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was " more [ about ] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes " . Louis Febre , who worked closely with Snow from the beginning , became the sole composer for Smallville in season seven . Febre said that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to " thematic development " in the score , paralleling the characters ' growth : " As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex , I found a need to comment musically on his growth , and as he drew closer to his Superman persona , it became obvious that a ' Superman ' theme would be required . " 
 The creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode 's storyline . Pyken and Wade @-@ Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre 's scores were not used . In season three 's " Slumber " , producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode . During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested , and Pyken and Wade @-@ Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode 's featured band with its story ( which revolved around REM sleep ) . That season , Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash 's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song " Hurt " for the final scene of " Shattered " ( when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one @-@ way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium ) as soon as he read the episode 's script . Cash died while Wade @-@ Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs , believing that the song 's use in the episode would honor his memory , gave Smallville the rights . 
 For season three 's " Resurrection " and " Memoria " , songs were chosen as symbolism for the characters . In " Resurrection " , The Rapture 's " Infatuation " was used during a scene with Lex and Lana to symbolize the question , " Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other ? " For " Memoria " Gough wanted to use Evanescence 's " My Immortal " for the episode 's final scene , telling Wade @-@ Reed that he saw the song as being about mothers . In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother , Lara . 
 Season three 's " Velocity " provided the music editors with the opportunity to use hip @-@ hop , rarely used in the series . The episode , similar to The Fast and the Furious , focused on Pete . Wade @-@ Reed heard of British hip @-@ hop artist Dizzee Rascal , and was the first person in the United States to secure the rights to Rascal 's album . Greg Beeman directs episodes , and sometimes scenes , with particular songs in mind . For " Vortex " in season two , he used Coldplay 's " In My Place " for the final scene . In the season @-@ two finale " Exodus " , Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up at the Kent barn before Lex 's wedding to Matthew Good 's " Weapon " . The lyrics speak of an angel and devil " by my side " , and Beeman timed specific shots to the song 's lyrics .

 = = = Reception = = = 
 Smallville set a WB record as its highest @-@ rated series debut , with 8 @.@ 4 million viewers tuned in for the pilot . Its premiere set a WB record for adults aged 18 – 34 and finished first among viewers aged 12 – 34 , with Warner Bros. president Jordan Levin crediting the series with invigorating the network 's Tuesday @-@ night lineup . Smallville appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly as one of five new shows to watch . After its first season , the series was sixth on the Parents Television Council 's 10 @-@ best list of broadcast programs . Levin , acknowledging early concerns that Smallville had become a villain of the week series , said that season two would introduce " smaller mini @-@ arcs over three to four episodes " and become less of a " serialized show " . According to Gough , although each succeeding season relied more on season @-@ long story arcs , an occasional villain @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week story was necessary . The villain @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week stories were more harshly criticized by fans of the Superman mythology , but Gough wanted to please them and The WB 's general audience ( teenagers who preferred villain @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week stories over episodes focusing on the Superman mythology ) . 
 Christopher Reeve , star of the Superman films , expressed his approval of the show : 
 I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [ Smallville ] at first , but I must say the writing , the acting , and the special effects are quite remarkable . In 1977 , a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film — it 's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show . It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series . I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology , and Tom is doing a good job following the tradition . 
 According to MTV 's Karl <unk> , Smallville 's Clark Kent was a better representation of the original material and remained " true to the heart of the story " by showing Clark 's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations . However , <unk> wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville ( including Lex Luthor ) recognized Clark when he put on the suit . TV Guide 's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television , but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told : " No @-@ one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne 's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman , so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt @-@ wearing Clark Kent bucking hay ?

 Smallville 's first venture into comics was " Elemental " , a one @-@ off story by Gough and Millar which appeared in TV Guide during the series ' first season and set in that period . Before the start of season two , DC Comics published a one @-@ off comic based on the series . Entitled Smallville : The Comic , it has two stories . The first , " Raptor " by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez , is about an abused boy who mutates into a raptor ( thanks to kryptonite ) and tries to get revenge on the Luthor family . Michael Green and John Paul Leon wrote " Exile and The Kingdom " , with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father offers him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one . DC Comics then began publishing a bimonthly comic with stories about Smallville characters . Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic @-@ book line a companion to the series rather than a non @-@ canonical version . According to Carpenter , the comic @-@ book line expands on events in the series ( such as season @-@ ending cliffhangers ) and gives " additional depth " to characters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed additional explanation . 
 Carpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic ; Mark Verheiden , who co @-@ wrote the one @-@ off comic , was originally intended to be in charge of the bimonthly series . Verheiden 's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books , so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on . Although the comic @-@ book series was intended to expand on the TV series , there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series . In one instance , the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season @-@ three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs . The comic @-@ book series tied into the TV series , the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville @-@ related webpages , with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes ' production . The comic @-@ book series ended in January 2005 , with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut .

Although Clark is generally accepted by the public , some distrust him ( including Lex Luthor , despite his memory loss after his encounter with Tess Mercer ) .

 Allison Mack 's character , Chloe Sullivan , has starred in two promotional tie @-@ in series : Smallville : Chloe Chronicles , and Vengeance Chronicles . Two volumes of Chloe Chronicles totaled eleven mini @-@ episodes . In the first volume Chloe investigated events leading to the death of Earl Jenkins , who held Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first @-@ season episode " Jitters " . It aired from April 29 to May 20 , 2003 to AOL subscribers . After the first volume received positive responses from viewers , the second volume was created as a continuation with Sam Jones III as Pete Ross . This volume used the Smallville comic books as a secondary tie @-@ in to the series . Viewers could watch Smallville , Chloe 's Chronicles and finish with the Smallville comic book , which would provide an " enhanced backstory to the online segments " . The later series , Vengeance Chronicles , is a spinoff of the fifth @-@ season episode " Vengeance " . In this series Chloe joins a costumed vigilante , whom she calls the " Angel of Vengeance " , to expose Lex Luthor 's Level 33 @.@ 1 experiments on meteor @-@ infected people . 
 The idea for an online show about Chloe originated with Mark Warshaw , who ran the show 's website and was in charge of the DVDs . The series intended to wrap up " unfinished business " from the television show . Although Smallville : Chloe Chronicles began on AOL , it made its way to the United Kingdom 's Channel 4 website . According to Lisa Gregorian , senior vice president for television of Warner Bros. Marketing Services , " Our goal is to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience , just as music videos did for record promotion . " Allison Mack described the show as " very Nancy Drew and mysterious " : " I think it 's a bit more like The X @-@ Files or NYPD Blue . The Chronicles are like a detective story , with Chloe following clues and interviewing people , going from spot to spot , figuring things out . " The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell ; Mack was given script approval for the series , allowing her to review and make changes to the script . Warshaw communicated with Gough and Millar to expand Smallville stories in Chloe 's Chronicles .

 = Joust ( video game ) = 
 Joust is an arcade game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1982 . While not the first game to feature two @-@ player cooperative play , Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept . The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich . The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards . 
 John Newcomer led the development team , which included Bill <unk> , Jan Hendricks , Python Anghelo , Tim Murphy , and John Kotlarik . Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with cooperative two @-@ player gameplay , but wanted to avoid a space theme , which was popular at the time . Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware ( originally developed two years earlier for Williams ' first game , Defender ) , excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals . 
 The game was well received in arcades and by critics , who praised the gameplay , the mechanics of which influenced titles by other developers . Joust was followed by a sequel four years later , and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Joust is a platforming game where the player controls a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich or stork , from a third @-@ person perspective . Using the two @-@ way directional joystick and the button for flapping the ostrich 's wings , the player flies the knight amidst the floating rock platforms and above pools of lava ; when maneuvering off the screen to either side , the player will continue its path reappearing from the opposite side . The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward , hover , or slowly descend . Home console versions use game controllers with directional pads or analog sticks , while computer ports use the keyboard . 
 The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level , referred to as a " wave " . Upon completing a wave , a subsequent , more challenging wave begins . 
 Players navigate the knight to collide with enemies . The elevation of an enemy in relation to the player 's knight determines the outcome of the collision . If the protagonist is higher than the enemy , the villain is defeated and vice versa . A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other . A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen , which a player can collect for points . An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight ; if the player does not pick him up , he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again . 
 The game features three types of enemy knights — <unk> , Hunter , and Shadow Lord — that are worth different amounts of points . A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time frame to hunt the hero . 
 A second player , controlling a blue knight on a stork , can join the game . The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies . 
 = = Development = = 
 Joust was developed by Williams Electronics , with John Newcomer as the lead designer . Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him . Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design . The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19 inch color CRT monitor . Like other Williams arcade games , Joust was programmed in assembly language . A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game 's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet . The cabinet artwork , by Anghelo , is stenciled on a wooden frame . Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials ; one such flyer featured archaic English , which was also incorporated into the game 's on @-@ screen instructions . 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Following the success of the 1981 title Defender , Williams searched for new creative staff . Believing video games to be the future of entertainment , Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff . After a few days , he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust , Newcomer 's top two choices . Technical specifications dictated the selection ; Newcomer 's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible , but Joust could be accomplished with Williams ' available hardware . A development team was formed , which decided to create the game using Defender 's hardware . 
 Newcomer conceived Joust as a " flying game " with cooperative two @-@ player gameplay ; however , he did not wish to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like Asteroids and Defender . To that end , Newcomer made a list of things that could fly : machines , animals , and fictional characters . After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea , he chose birds , believing that they would have a wide appeal . Newcomer also felt that birds were a good fit as he was familiar with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds . To further increase his understanding , Newcomer went to the library to study mythology . He felt that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird . The first choice was an eagle , but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded the designer . Instead , Newcomer chose an ostrich because he thought a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle . To differentiate between the first and second player characters , the developers picked a stork , believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players . Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies , believing that they would be recognizably evil . Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design . 
 = = = Creative and technical design = = = 
 The decision to use birds prompted Newcomer to deviate from the then standard eight @-@ direction joystick . He implemented a " flapping " mechanism to allow players to control the character 's ascent and descent . With the vertical direction controlled via the arcade cabinet 's button , a two @-@ way joystick was added to dictate horizontal direction . Though other Williams employees were concerned over the design , Newcomer believed that a direct control scheme for flight would strengthen the connection between the player and the character . The combat is devised to allow for higher levels of strategy than traditional shooting games . Because flying became an integral gameplay element , he chose to have characters collide as a means of combat . Newcomer felt that the characters ' heights on the screen were the best way to determine a victor . 
 The developers created the game using <unk> of memory , which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use . The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters . The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand @-@ animated . To animate the birds , Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge 's book Animals In Motion as a reference . Given the limited memory , she had to balance the number of frames to minimize file size , while maintaining realistic animation . Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards , but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16 colors to create the visuals . Once the colors were decided for the character sprites , Newcomer finalized the look of the platforms . The hardware had limited audio capabilities , and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics . Working with these restrictions , Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay . He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy . Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap , other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl , collisions , and hatching eggs were considered important as well . 
 In designing the levels , Newcomer added platforms to the environment after the combat was devised . A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase visual textures applied to the platforms . The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling , and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players . The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters too close to the bottom . Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter 's enemy artificial intelligence ( AI ) , which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements . The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior . <unk> fly around the environment randomly , occasionally reacting to the protagonist . Hunters seek the player 's character in an effort to collide . Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer to the top of the screen . Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord 's chances of victory against the player . The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat . The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame . Newcomer and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform . This was done to prevent an easy defeat of the enemy . When processing the graphics , the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies . As a result , enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on @-@ screen sprites increases . 
 While playtesting the game , the team discovered an animation bug they described as a " belly flop " . The flaw allows players to force the ostrich or stork sprite through an otherwise impassable small gap between two adjacent platforms of very close elevation . Because it provided an interesting method to perform a sneak attack on an opponent below the gap , the developers decided to keep the defect rather than fix it . Newcomer also attributed the inclusion to excessive playtesting that limited the time available to find a solution . 
 A second bug , which allows the pterodactyl to be easily defeated , was discovered after the game was first distributed . Newcomer designed the game and its AI with each sprite 's dimension in mind . A day before the game was finished , however , the pterodactyl 's sprite was altered to improve the appearance . The new sprite allowed the pterodactyl to be easily defeated an unending number of times . The player could sit on the center ledge , with a single enemy knight caught indefinitely in the hand of the " lava troll " , and kill an unlimited number of pterodactyls simply by turning to face them as they entered the screen in a rapid , never @-@ ending sequence . Using this flaw , the player could quickly accumulate a very high score and a large cache of lives , with no significant skill required . Upon learning of the flaw , Williams shipped a new ROM for the arcade cabinets to assuage distributors ' complaints . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Given the different control scheme , Williams was concerned that the game would be unsuccessful . Though arcades were hesitant to purchase the game for the same reason , Joust sold well . Williams eventually shipped 26 @,@ 000 units , and Electronic Games in 1983 described it as " tremendously popular " . A cocktail table version was later released , engineered by Leo <unk> . It differs from other cocktail games in that it features side @-@ by @-@ side seating rather than opposing sides . This setup allowed Williams to use the same ROM chip as in the upright cabinets . The cabinets have since become collector 's items . Though the upright cabinets are common , the cocktail version is a rare , sought after game . Between 250 and 500 units were manufactured . 
 = = Popular culture = = 
 Joust has been parodied in popular culture . References appear in the Robot Chicken episode " <unk> Mountain " , the Code Monkeys episode " Just One of the Gamers " , and the video games Mortal Kombat 3 and World of Warcraft : Cataclysm . 
 Author Steve Kent considered Joust one of the more memorable games of its time . Author David Ellis agreed , and stated that the game remains enjoyable to this day . In 2008 , Guinness World Records listed it as the number sixty @-@ nine arcade game in technical , creative , and cultural impact . A writer for Video Gaming Illustrated called Joust exotic and praised the animation as lifelike . Kevin Bowen of GameSpy 's Classic Gaming wrote that despite a concept he described as " incredibly stupid " , Joust is an appealing game with good controls and competitive gameplay . Bowen further commented that the multiplayer aspect differentiated the game from others at the time . He described it as " one of the first really fun multiplayer games " and a precursor to the video game deathmatch . Retro Gamer writer Mike Bevan praised the game 's physics , calling them " beautifully realised " , and described Joust as one of Williams ' " most remarkable and well @-@ loved titles " . A Computer and Video Games writer called the game " weird and wonderful " . Author John Sellers praised the competitive two @-@ player gameplay , and attributed the game 's appeal to the flapping mechanism . In 2004 , Ellis described Joust as an example of innovative risk absent in the then @-@ current video game industry . In retrospect , Newcomer commended Williams ' management for taking a risk on him and the game . The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well . Jeff Peters of <unk> Games lauded the gameplay , describing it as unique and intuitive . Fusion Learning Systems ' Jeff <unk> praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of Microsoft enjoyed the multi @-@ player aspect . 
 Joust features prominently in the book Ready Player One , a 2011 science fiction and dystopian novel by Ernest Cline . The game is one of many games and other cultural artifacts from the 1980s that populate the vast virtual universe called OASIS that is the setting for the story . 
 = = Sequels and remakes = = 
 A pinball version was released in 1983 , designed by Barry Oursler and Constantino Mitchell . The game includes artwork and themes from the arcade version . In addition to single player gameplay , it features competitive two @-@ player gameplay with the players on opposing sides of the machine . Fewer than 500 machines were produced . 
 An arcade sequel , Joust 2 : Survival of the Fittest , was released in 1986 . It features similar gameplay with new elements on a vertical screen . 
 Joust was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System — programmed by Satoru Iwata — and to several Atari platforms : the Atari 2600 , Atari 5200 , Atari 7800 , and Atari Lynx consoles , as well as Atari 8 @-@ bit and Atari ST home computers . Entertainment Weekly called Joust one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013 . Apple II , Macintosh and MS @-@ DOS versions were also released . Tiger Electronics released a small keychain version of Joust in 1998 . A mobile phone version was released in 2005 , but omitted the flapping control scheme . In 2000 , a web @-@ based version of Joust , along with nine other classic arcade games , was published on <unk> 
 Four years later , Midway Games also launched a website featuring the Shockwave versions . The game was included in several multi @-@ platform compilations : the 1996 Williams Arcade 's Greatest Hits , the 2000 Midway 's Greatest Arcade Hits , and the 2003 Midway Arcade Treasures . Other compilation titles are the 1995 Arcade Classic 4 for the Game Boy and the 2005 Midway Arcade Treasures : Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable . Joust was released via digital distribution on GameTap , Xbox Live Arcade , and the PlayStation Network . In 2012 , Joust was included in the compilation Midway Arcade Origins . 
 Other remakes were in development , but never released . Previously unreleased Atarisoft prototypes of Joust for the ColecoVision surfaced in 2001 at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas . An adaptation with three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphics ( and a port of the original Joust as a bonus ) was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD . Titled Dactyl Joust , it was eventually canceled . Newcomer pitched an updated version of the arcade game for the Game Boy Advance to Midway Games . The company , however , did not sanction it . The prototype featured multi @-@ directional scrolling , more detailed graphics based on 3D renders , and new gameplay mechanics . 
 Midway Games optioned Joust 's movie rights to CP Productions in 2007 . Michael <unk> and Christine Peters of CP Productions planned to expand on a game element for the film 's premise . <unk> described the script by Marc Gottlieb as " Gladiator meets Mad Max " , set 25 years in the future , and Peters commented that the action oriented film would appeal to a general audience . The movie was planned as a tent @-@ pole movie , with a graphic novel by Steven @-@ Elliot Altman as part of the media franchise 's release . Midway Games also considered a video game adaptation of the film . Joust 's expected release date was set in June 2008 and then later pushed back to 2009 . The video game company , however , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 . Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment purchased most of Midway 's assets , including Joust , with the intent to develop movie adaptations .

 = World Series of Poker bracelet = 
 The World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) bracelet is considered the most coveted non @-@ monetary prize a poker player can win . Since 1976 , a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP . Even if the victory occurred before 1976 , WSOP championships are now counted as " bracelets " . During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year . In 1990 , there were only 14 bracelet events . By 2000 , that number increased to 24 . As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s , the number of events has likewise increased . In 2011 , 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP , seven at the World Series of Poker Europe ( WSOPE ) , and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion . This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959 . Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia @-@ Pacific ( WSOP APAC ) in Melbourne , Australia . 
 After the conclusion of the 2014 WSOP APAC , there have been 1083 bracelets awarded , 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets , with all of the other bracelets being won by one @-@ time winners . This includes ( up to this point ) 17 Main Event winners : Hal Fowler , Bill Smith , Mansour <unk> , Brad Daugherty , Jim Bechtel , Russ Hamilton , Noel Furlong , Robert <unk> , Chris Moneymaker , Greg Raymer , Joe <unk> , Jamie Gold , Jerry Yang , Peter Eastgate , Pius Heinz , Ryan Riess and Martin Jacobson . 
 Since Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 Main Event , ( through the completion of Event # 58 in 2015 ) only two players have won and followed it up with a win in another bracelet event , Jonathan Duhamel and Joe Cada .

 The 1976 bracelet looked " like gold nuggets kind of hammered flat . " The bracelet in 1976 cost approximately $ 500 . In the 1980s , Las Vegas jeweler Mordechai Yerushalmi became the exclusive manufacturer of WSOP bracelets until Harrah 's Entertainment bought the rights to the WSOP in 2004 . According to 2003 WSOP Champion Chris Moneymaker , the design of the bracelet remained relatively unchanged under Yerushalmi . In 2005 , Gold and Diamond International based in Memphis , TN won the bid from Harrah 's Entertainment to manufacture the 2005 WSOP bracelets . The company also manufactures the WSOP circuit rings . 
 In 2006 , Frederick Goldman , Inc. made the WSOP bracelets while luxury watch maker Corum introduced some commemorative watches as part of the prize package . In 2006 , the Champion 's bracelet had 259 stones including 7 @.@ 2 carats ( 1 @.@ 4 g ) of diamonds , 120 grams of white and yellow gold . It also used rubies to represent the heart and diamond suits , a sapphire to represent the spade and three black diamonds to represent the clubs . 
 In 2007 , Corum became the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP . Some of the 2007 WSOP champions received both a watch and a bracelet from Corum . Corum designed four variations for the 2007 World Series of Poker Bracelets . The standard version that is presented to 53 winners features 53 diamonds . The Ladies World Champion receives a bracelet that is adorned with four black diamonds , two rubies and 87 blue sapphires . The $ 50 @,@ 000 HORSE Champion Bracelet has 91 black diamonds and two rubies . The World Series of Poker Main Event Bracelet has 120 diamonds on 136 grams of 18 carat ( 75 percent ) white gold . The value of the 2007 bracelets have not been released , but the typical price of a Corum watch ranges from $ 1 @,@ 500 – $ 30 @,@ 000 + . 
 In 2008 , the Main Event Bracelet had 291 diamonds , totalling 2 @.@ 81 carats set in 168 grams of <unk> white gold . The other 54 event bracelets consisted of 55 diamonds , totalling 0 @.@ 25 carats set in 80 grams of <unk> yellow gold . 
 In 2010 , an Australian @-@ based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi @-@ year contract to become the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP . OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design would return to the tradition of the 70 's and 80 's where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal . American jewelry designer Steve <unk> was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets . The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day . In 2011 , OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings . 
 In 2012 , Jason <unk> , famed jewelry designer and owner of Jason of Beverly Hills was chosen as the official bracelet manufacturer of the WSOP . <unk> had designed the championship rings for the 2009 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers and the 2011 Green Bay Packers , among others . The Main Event bracelet will feature each suit in the deck in either rubies or black diamonds . In terms of sheer mass , it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds . 
 A special platinum bracelet was awarded at the 2012 WSOP to the winner of The Big One for One Drop , Antonio <unk> . The event was a $ 1 million buy @-@ in tournament created as a fundraiser for the One Drop Foundation , a charity established by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté .

 At first , the bracelets did not have much prestige . Ten @-@ time bracelet winner Doyle Brunson said that his first bracelet " didn 't mean anything " to him and that he did not even pick up two of them . 
 Some professional poker players believe that there are two types of poker players ; those who have won a bracelet and those who have not . Those who have belong to an exclusive club . " It 's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously , " stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling . " It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in football . " 
 Many professional poker players desire the recognition that is associated with the bracelet . Former Celebrity Poker Showdown host and poker star Phil Gordon said , " I want that bracelet more than anything . " Freddy Deeb said that he did not appreciate his first bracelet because he did not recognize what it meant . He said his 2007 bracelet , however , " means everything to me " . Jennifer Tilly says that winning her 2005 Women 's Championship bracelet was " better than an Oscar " . When the World Poker Tour decided to offer a prize to its event champions , they decided to present them with WPT Bracelets . In so doing , WPT Founder , President and CEO Steve Lipscomb said , " The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect , and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [ the founder of the WSOP ] began over 30 years ago . "

 Bracelets have not always been awarded for winning events . In 1970 , the first WSOP Champion received nothing but a silver cup and whatever cash he won during the event . From 1971 – 1974 , according to Becky <unk> ( the daughter of WSOP founder Benny Binion ) , the winner received an undescribed " corny trophy " . In 1975 , the winners received a sterling plate . The following year , 1976 , the WSOP started the tradition of issuing bracelets to the event winners . 
 In 1980 and 1981 , one did not have to win a WSOP event to win a gold bracelet . In 1980 and 1981 , H.D. " Oklahoma Johny " Hale and Chip Reese received a gold bracelet for being the " Best All Around Player " at the WSOP , respectively . These bracelets , however , are not considered in the count of WSOP championship bracelets . 
 In 2007 , Thomas Bihl became the first person to ever win a WSOP bracelet outside Las Vegas , Nevada . Bihl won the £ 2 @,@ 500 World Championship <unk> at the World Series of Poker Europe in London , England . Days later , Annette <unk> became the youngest player to ever win a WSOP bracelet at 18 years , 364 days , also becoming the first woman to win a World Series Main Event ( WSOPE ) . Caesars Entertainment ( known until 2010 as Harrah 's Entertainment ) , the owner of the WSOP , considers the WSOP Europe bracelet to be the same in prestige as those awarded every year in Las Vegas . 
 In 2008 , Jesper <unk> became the first person to have won both a WSOP and WSOPE bracelet . 
 In 2011 , a World Series of Poker bracelet was awarded for the first time to the WSOP Circuit National Championship winner in the 100 @-@ qualifier event from May 27 – 29 . The following year , the Circuit National Championship moved to New Orleans , where it will also be held in 2013 .

 = Pará @-@ class monitor = 
 The Pará class monitors were a group of six wooden @-@ hulled ironclads named after Brazilian states and built in Brazil for the Brazilian Navy during the Paraguayan War in the late 1860s . The first three ships finished , Pará , Alagoas and Rio Grande , participated in the Passagem de Humaitá in February 1868 . Afterwards the remaining ships joined the first three and they all provided fire support for the army for the rest of the war . The ships were split between the newly formed Upper Uruguay ( Portuguese : Alto Uruguai ) and Mato Grosso Flotillas after the war . Alagoas was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s and participated in the Fleet Revolt of 1893 – 94 .

 The Pará @-@ class river monitors were designed to meet the need of the Brazilian Navy for small , shallow @-@ draft armored ships capable of withstanding heavy fire during the Paraguayan War , which saw Argentina and Brazil allied against Paraguay . The two foreign @-@ built river monitors already in service drew enough water that they could not operate on the shallower rivers in Paraguay . The monitor configuration was chosen as a turreted design did not have the same problems engaging enemy ships and fortifications as did the casemate ironclads already in Brazilian service . The oblong gun turret sat on a circular platform that had a central pivot . It was rotated by four men via a system of gears ; 2 @.@ 25 minutes were required for a full 360 ° rotation . A bronze ram was fitted to these ships as well . The hull was sheathed with Muntz metal to reduce biofouling . 
 The ships measured 39 meters ( 127 ft 11 in ) long overall , with a beam of 8 @.@ 54 meters ( 28 ft 0 in ) . They had a draft between of 1 @.@ 51 – 1 @.@ 54 meters ( 4 ft 11 in – 5 ft 1 in ) and displaced 500 metric tons ( 490 long tons ) . With only 0 @.@ 3 meters ( 1 ft 0 in ) of freeboard they had to be towed between Rio de Janeiro and their area of operations . Their crew numbered 43 officers and men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Pará @-@ class ships had two direct @-@ acting steam engines , each driving a single 1 @.@ 3 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 3 in ) propeller . Their engines were powered by two tubular boilers at a working pressure of 59 psi ( 407 kPa ; 4 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 180 indicated horsepower ( 130 kW ) which gave the monitors a maximum speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) in calm waters . The ships carried enough coal for one day 's steaming . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The first three ships carried a single 70 @-@ pounder Whitworth rifled muzzle loader ( RML ) in their gun turret , but the last three ships substituted a 120 @-@ pounder Whitworth RML . The 70 @-@ pdr gun had a maximum elevation of 15 ° , but the larger gun 's elevation was reduced because of its longer barrel . Both guns had a similar maximum range of 5 @,@ 540 meters ( 6 @,@ 060 yd ) . The 70 @-@ pdr gun weighed 8 @,@ 582 pounds ( 3 @,@ 892 @.@ 7 kg ) and fired a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) shell that weighed 81 pounds ( 36 @.@ 7 kg ) .

Most unusually the guns ' Brazilian @-@ designed iron carriage was designed to pivot vertically at the muzzle ; this was done to minimize the size of the gunport through which splinters and shells could enter .

 The hull of the Pará @-@ class ships was made from three layers of wood that alternated in orientation . It was 457 millimeters ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) thick and was capped with a 102 @-@ millimeter ( 4 in ) layer of peroba hardwood . The ships had a complete wrought iron waterline belt , 0 @.@ 91 meters ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) high . It had a maximum thickness of 102 millimeters amidships , decreasing to 76 millimeters ( 3 in ) and 51 millimeters ( 2 in ) at the ship 's ends . The curved deck was armored with 12 @.@ 7 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) of wrought iron . 
 The gun turret was shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners . It was built much like the hull , but the front of the turret was protected by 152 millimeters ( 6 in ) of armor , the sides by 102 millimeters and the rear by 76 millimeters . Its roof and the exposed portions of the platform it rested upon were protected by 12 @.@ 7 millimeters of armor . The armored pilothouse was positioned ahead of the turret .

 The first three ships finished , Pará , Alagoas and Rio Grande , participated in the Passagem de Humaitá on 19 February 1868 . For the engagement the three river monitors were lashed to the larger ironclads in case any engines were disabled by the Paraguayan guns . Barroso led with Rio Grande , followed by Bahia with Alagoas and Tamandaré with Pará . Both Alagoas , which had taken an estimated 200 hits , and Pará had to be beached after passing the fortress to prevent them from sinking . Alagoas was under repair at São José do Cerrito until mid @-@ March , although Pará joined a squadron to capture the town of <unk> on 27 February . Rio Grande continued upstream with the other undamaged ships and they bombarded Asunción on 24 February with little effect . On 23 March Rio Grande and Barroso sank the <unk> steamer Igurey and both ships were boarded by Paraguayan soldiers on the evening of 9 July , although they managed to repel the boarders . 
 For the rest of the war the river monitors bombarded Paraguayan positions and artillery batteries in support of the army , notably at Angostura , Timbó and along the Tebicuary and Manduvirá Rivers . After the war the ships were divided between the newly formed Upper Uruguay and Mato Grosso Flotillas . Alagoas was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s and participated in the Fleet Revolt of 1893 – 94 . The ships were disposed of during the last two decades of the 19th century , although Rio Grande was docked for reconstruction in 1899 . However , the work was never completed and she was eventually scrapped in 1907 .

 = Richard Nixon = 
 Richard Milhous Nixon ( January 9 , 1913 – April 22 , 1994 ) was the 37th President of the United States , serving from 1969 to 1974 when he became the only U.S. president to resign the office . Nixon had previously served as a U.S. Representative and Senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 . 
 Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California . After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College , he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law . He and his wife , Pat Nixon , moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government . He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II . Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti @-@ communist , and elevated him to national prominence . He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president . He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962 . In 1968 he ran again for the presidency and was elected when he defeated Hubert Humphrey . 
 Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home . At the same time , he ended military draft . Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated détente and the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year . His administration generally transferred power from Washington to the states . He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days , enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing , which signaled the end of the moon race . He was reelected by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972 , when he defeated George McGovern . 
 The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo , gasoline rationing , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal . The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office . After his resignation , he was issued a pardon by his successor , Gerald Ford . In retirement , Nixon 's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image . He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9 , 1913 in Yorba Linda , California , in a house his father built . He was the son of Hannah ( Milhous ) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon . His mother was a Quaker and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith ; Nixon 's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time , such as refraining from alcohol , dancing , and swearing . Nixon had four brothers : Harold ( 1909 – 33 ) , Donald ( 1914 – 87 ) , Arthur ( 1918 – 25 ) , and Edward ( born 1930 ) . Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England ; Richard , for example , was named after Richard the Lionheart . 
 Nixon 's early life was marked by hardship , and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood : " We were poor , but the glory of it was we didn 't know it " . The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922 , and the family moved to Whittier , California . In an area with many Quakers , Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station . Richard 's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness . At the age of twelve , Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and , with a family history of tuberculosis , he was forbidden to play sports . Eventually , the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia . 
 = = = Primary and secondary education = = = 
 Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School , where he was president of his eighth @-@ grade class . His parents believed that attendance at Whittier High School had caused Richard 's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis ( he died of the disease in 1933 ) . Instead , they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School . He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year and he received excellent grades . Later , he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week . He played junior varsity football , and seldom missed a practice , even though he was rarely used in games . He had greater success as a debater , winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton 's Head of English , H. Lynn <unk> . Nixon later remembered <unk> 's words , " Remember , speaking is conversation ... don 't shout at people . Talk to them . Converse with them . " Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible . 
 His parents permitted Richard to transfer to Whittier High School for his junior year , beginning in September 1928 . At Whittier High , Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat , for student body president . He generally rose at 4 a.m. , to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market . He then drove to the store to wash and display them , before going to school . Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year ; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health , the demands on Richard increased , causing him to give up football . Nevertheless , Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207 students . 
 = = = Collegiate and law school education = = = 
 Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University , but Harold 's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store . He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College , his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather . Nixon played for the basketball team ; he also tried out for football , but lacked the size to play . He remained on the team as a substitute , and was noted for his enthusiasm . Instead of fraternities and sororities , Whittier had literary societies . Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men , the Franklins ; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families but Nixon was not . He responded by helping to found a new society , the <unk> Society . In addition to the society , schoolwork , and work at the store , Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities , becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker . In 1933 , he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch , daughter of the Whittier police chief . The two broke up in 1935 . 
 After his graduation from Whittier in 1934 , Nixon received a full scholarship to attend Duke University School of Law . The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships . It paid high salaries to its professors , many of whom had national or international reputations . The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third @-@ year students , forcing recipients into intense competition . Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association , inducted into the Order of the Coif , and graduated third in his class in June 1937 . 
 = = Early career and marriage = = 
 After graduating from Duke , Nixon initially hoped to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation . He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired , but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts . Instead , he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937 . He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier , working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters , as well as on wills . In later years , Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney . Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases , disliking frank sexual talk from women . In 1938 , he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra , California , and became a full partner in the firm the following year . 
 In January 1938 , Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower . There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma " Pat " Ryan . Nixon described it in his memoirs as " a case of love at first sight " — for Nixon only , as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him . Once they began their courtship , Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon ; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal . They wed at a small ceremony on June 21 , 1940 . After a honeymoon in Mexico , the Nixons began their married life in Whittier . They had two daughters , Tricia ( born 1946 ) and Julie ( born 1948 ) . 
 = = World War II = = 
 In January 1942 , the couple moved to Washington , D.C. , where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration . In his political campaigns , Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor , but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941 . Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier . He was assigned to the tire rationing division , where he was tasked with replying to correspondence . He did not enjoy the role , and four months later , applied to join the United States Navy . As a birthright Quaker , he could have claimed exemption from the draft ; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service . But instead of exploiting his circumstance , Nixon opted to enlist in the Navy . His application to enlist was successful , and was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S Naval Reserve ( U.S. Navy Reserve ) on June 15 , 1942 . 
 In October 1942 , he was assigned as aide to the commander of the Naval Air Station Ottumwa in Iowa until May 1943 . On October 1 , 1943 , Nixon was promoted to lieutenant . Seeking more excitement , he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command , supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater ; he was the Officer in Charge of the Combat Air Transport Command at Guadalcanal in the Solomons and in March 1944 at Green Island ( Nissan island ) just north of Bougainville . His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for C @-@ 47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo aircraft . For this service , he received a Navy Letter of Commendation ( awarded a Navy Commendation Ribbon which was later updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal ) from his commanding officer for " meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command " . Upon his return to the U.S. , Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station in California . In January 1945 , he was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics office in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts , and received his second letter of commendation , from the Secretary of the Navy for " meritorious service , tireless effort , and devotion to duty " . Later , Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore . On October 3 , 1945 , he was promoted to lieutenant commander . On March 10 , 1946 , he was relieved of active duty . He resigned his commission on New Year 's Day 1946 . On June 1 , 1953 , he was promoted to commander . He retired in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 6 , 1966 .

 In 1945 , Republicans in California 's 12th congressional district , frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic Congressman Jerry Voorhis , sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him . They formed a " Committee of 100 " to decide on a candidate , hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories . After the committee failed to attract higher @-@ profile candidates , Herman Perry , Whittier 's Bank of America branch manager , suggested Nixon , a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war . Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore . After a night of excited talk between the Nixons , the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm . Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee . When he left the Navy at the start of 1946 , Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier , where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning . He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis 's endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views . Nixon won the election , receiving 65 @,@ 586 votes to Voorhis ' 49 @,@ 994 . 
 In Congress , Nixon supported the Taft – Hartley Act of 1947 , a federal law that monitors the activities and power of labor unions , and served on the Education and Labor Committee . He was part of the Herter Committee , which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid . Nixon was the youngest member of the committee , and the only Westerner . Advocacy by Herter Committee members , including Nixon , led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan . 
 Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation , as a member of the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , broke the Alger Hiss spy case . While many doubted Whittaker Chambers ' allegations that Hiss , a former State Department official , had been a Soviet spy , Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation . Under suit for defamation filed by Hiss , Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations . These included paper and microfilm copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field ; they became known as the " Pumpkin Papers " . Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers . In 1948 , Nixon successfully cross @-@ filed as a candidate in his district , winning both major party primaries , and was comfortably reelected . 
 In 1949 , Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent , Sheridan Downey , and entered the race in November of that year . Downey , faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas , announced his retirement in March 1950 . Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue . Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas ' liberal voting record . As part of that effort , a " Pink Sheet " was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that , as Douglas ' voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio ( believed by some to be a communist ) , their political views must be nearly identical . Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points . During this campaign , Nixon was first called " Tricky Dick " by his opponents for his campaign tactics . 
 In the Senate , Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism , traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat . He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti @-@ communist , the controversial Wisconsin senator , Joseph McCarthy , but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy 's allegations . Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman 's handling of the Korean War . He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii , voted in favor of civil rights for minorities , and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia . He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions , benefits for illegal immigrants , and public power . 
 = = = Vice Presidency = = = 
 General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952 . He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate , and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a " smoke @-@ filled room " and recommended Nixon to the general , who agreed to the senator 's selection . Nixon 's youth ( he was then 39 ) , stance against communism , and political base in California — one of the largest states — were all seen as vote @-@ winners by the leaders . Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft , New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen . On the campaign trail , Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country , leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate . 
 In mid @-@ September , the Republican ticket faced a major crisis . The media reported that Nixon had a political fund , maintained by his backers , which reimbursed him for political expenses . Such a fund was not illegal , but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest . With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon 's resignation from the ticket , the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23 , 1952 . The address , later termed the Checkers speech , was heard by about 60 million Americans — including the largest television audience up to that point . Nixon emotionally defended himself , stating that the fund was not secret , nor had donors received special favors . He painted himself as a man of modest means ( his wife had no mink coat ; instead she wore a " respectable Republican cloth coat " ) and a patriot . The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received , but which he would not give back : " a little cocker spaniel dog … sent all the way from Texas . And our little girl — Tricia , the 6 @-@ year @-@ old — named it Checkers . " The speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon . Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket , which proved victorious in the November election . 
 Eisenhower gave Nixon responsibilities during his term as vice president — more than any previous vice president . Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent . A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center . He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina . On his return to the United States at the end of 1953 , Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations . 
 Biographer Irwin Gellman , who chronicled Nixon 's congressional years , said of his vice presidency : 
 Eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office . The vice president welcomed the president 's initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish White House objectives . Because of the collaboration between these two leaders , Nixon deserves the title , " the first modern vice president " . 
 Despite intense campaigning by Nixon , who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats , the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections . These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term . On September 24 , 1955 , President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack ; his condition was initially believed to be life @-@ threatening . Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks . The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution had not yet been proposed , and the Vice President had no formal power to act . Nonetheless , Nixon acted in Eisenhower 's stead during this period , presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power . According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose , Nixon had " earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis ... he made no attempt to seize power " . 
 His spirits buoyed , Nixon sought a second term , but some of Eisenhower 's aides aimed to displace him . In a December 1955 meeting , Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration . Nixon , however , believed such an action would destroy his political career . When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956 , he hedged on the choice of his running mate , stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated . Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower , Nixon received a substantial number of write @-@ in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election . In late April , the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate . Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election . 
 In the spring of 1957 , Nixon undertook another major foreign trip , this time to Africa . On his return , he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress . The bill was weakened in the Senate , and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it . Nixon advised the President to sign the bill , which he did . Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957 , and Nixon gave a press conference , assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower 's brief illness . 
 On April 27 , 1958 , Richard and Pat Nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of South America . In Montevideo , Uruguay , Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus , where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy . The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima , Peru , where he was met with student demonstrations . Nixon went to the campus , got out of his car to confront the students , and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects . At his hotel , Nixon faced another mob , and one demonstrator spat on him . In Caracas , Venezuela , Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti @-@ American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe @-@ wielding mob . According to Ambrose , Nixon 's courageous conduct " caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect " . 
 In July 1959 , President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the Soviet Union for the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow . On July 24 , while touring the exhibits with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev , the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the " Kitchen Debate " . 
 = = = 1960 and 1962 elections ; wilderness years = = = 
 In 1960 , Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States . He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. as his running mate . His Democratic opponent was John F. Kennedy , and the race remained close for the duration . Nixon campaigned on his experience , but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower – Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S. in ballistic missiles ( the " missile gap " ) . A new political medium was introduced in the campaign : televised presidential debates . In the first of four such debates , Nixon appeared pale , with a five o 'clock shadow , in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy . Nixon 's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television , though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won . Nixon lost the election narrowly , with Kennedy ahead by only 120 @,@ 000 votes ( 0 @.@ 2 percent ) in the popular vote . 
 There were charges of vote fraud in Texas and Illinois , both states won by Kennedy ; Nixon refused to consider contesting the election , feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world , and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests . At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961 , Nixon and his family returned to California , where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book , Six Crises , which included coverage of the Hiss case , Eisenhower 's heart attack , and the Fund Crisis , which had been resolved by the Checkers speech . 
 Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election . Despite initial reluctance , Nixon entered the race . The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping @-@ stone for another presidential run , some opposition from the far @-@ right of the party , and his own lack of interest in being California 's governor . Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation 's leading active Republican politician , and ensure he remained a major player in national politics . Instead , he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points , and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career . In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election , Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent , saying , " You won 't have Nixon to kick around anymore because , gentlemen , this is my last press conference " . The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11 , 1962 , episode of ABC 's Howard K. Smith : News and Comment entitled " The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon " . Alger Hiss appeared on the program , and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president . The furor drove Smith and his program from the air , and public sympathy for Nixon grew . 
 The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963 , where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited . The family moved to New York City , where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon , Mudge , Rose , Guthrie & Alexander . Nixon had pledged , when announcing his California campaign , not to run for president in 1964 ; even if he had not , he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy , or after his assassination , Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon Johnson . In 1964 , he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president ; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination , Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention . Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win , Nixon campaigned for him loyally . The election was a disaster for the Republicans ; Goldwater 's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors . 
 Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results , and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections . He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election . 
 = = 1968 presidential election = = 
 At the end of 1967 , Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time . Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life ( for example , she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech ) , she was supportive of her husband 's ambitions . Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War , a Republican had a good chance of winning , although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960 . 
 One of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched , followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary ; it concluded with the assassination of one of the Democratic candidates , Senator Robert F. Kennedy , just moments after his victory in the California primary . On the Republican side , Nixon 's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney , though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention . Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot . He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate , a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party , appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats . 
 Nixon 's Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice President Hubert Humphrey , who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests . Throughout the campaign , Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval . He appealed to what he later called the " silent majority " of socially conservative Americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the anti @-@ war demonstrators . Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups , solidifying Nixon 's position with the right . 
 Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign , meeting with supporters in front of cameras . He stressed that the crime rate was too high , and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States ' nuclear superiority . Nixon promised " peace with honor " in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that " new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific " . He did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war , resulting in media intimations that he must have a " secret plan " . His slogan of " Nixon 's the One " proved to be effective . 
 Johnson 's negotiators hoped to reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election . Nixon received astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger , then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman , and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault in Saigon . She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu not to go to Paris to join the talks , hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected . Johnson was aware of what was going on , as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged , and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy . On October 31 , with no agreement , Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing , and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6 , the day after Election Day . On November 2 , after speaking with Chennault again , Thieu stated he would not go to Paris . Johnson telephoned Nixon , who denied any involvement ; the President did not believe him . Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault 's involvement , which had been obtained by wiretapping , but told Humphrey , who chose not to use the information . 
 In a three @-@ way race between Nixon , Humphrey , and independent candidate former Alabama Governor George Wallace , Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500 @,@ 000 votes ( seven @-@ tenths of a percentage point ) , with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace . In his victory speech , Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together . Nixon said : " I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President , congratulating me for winning the election . I congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds . I also told him that I know exactly how he felt . I know how it feels to lose a close one . " 
 = = Presidency ( 1969 – 74 ) = = 
 Nixon was inaugurated as president on January 20 , 1969 , sworn in by his onetime political rival , Chief Justice Earl Warren . Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2 : 4 , which reads , " They shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks . " In his inaugural address , which received almost uniformly positive reviews , Nixon remarked that " the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker " — a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone . He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity : 
 In these difficult years , America has suffered from a fever of words ; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver ; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds ; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading . We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another , until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices .

 Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president , writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election : " There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation . " Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State , Henry Kissinger , with whom the President worked closely , bypassing Cabinet officials . With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir — border clashes between the two took place during Nixon 's first year in office — Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations . A breakthrough came in early 1971 , when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players . Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials . On July 15 , 1971 , it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon ( on television and radio ) that the President would visit China the following February . The announcements astounded the world . The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact . 
 In February 1972 , Nixon and his wife traveled to China . Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation . Upon touching down , the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai . Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou 's hand , something which then @-@ Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva . Over 100 television journalists accompanied the president . On Nixon 's orders , television was strongly favored over printed publications , as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print . It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised . 
 Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao 's official private residence , where they discussed a range of issues . Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon , whom he considered forthright , unlike the leftists and the Soviets . He said he was suspicious of Kissinger , though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his " encounter with history " . A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People . The following day , Nixon met with Zhou ; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China , and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification . When not in meetings , Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City , Ming Tombs , and the Great Wall . Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon , who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes , schools , factories , and hospitals . 
 The visit ushered in a new era of Sino @-@ American relations . Fearing the possibility of a Sino @-@ American alliance , the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for détente with the United States . 
 = = = = Vietnam War = = = = 
 When Nixon took office , about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam , and the war was broadly unpopular in the United States , with violent protests against the war ongoing . The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions , but this agreement never fully took force . According to Walter Isaacson , soon after taking office , Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly . Conversely , Black argues that Nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate North Vietnam through the " Madman theory " . Nixon sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw , while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack . 
 Nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese and allied Khmer Rouge positions in Cambodia in March 1969 ( code @-@ named Operation Menu ) , a policy begun under Johnson . These operations resulted in heavy bombing of Cambodia ; by one measurement more bombs were dropped over Cambodia under Johnson and Nixon than the Allies dropped during World War II . In mid @-@ 1969 , Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese , sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders , and peace talks began in Paris . Initial talks , however , did not result in an agreement . In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation . 
 In July 1969 , Nixon visited South Vietnam , where he met with his U.S. military commanders and President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu . Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout , he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops with Vietnamese troops , known as " Vietnamization " . He soon instituted phased U.S. troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into Laos , in part to interrupt the Ho Chi Minh trail , used to supply North Vietnamese forces , that passed through Laos and Cambodia . Nixon announced the ground invasion of Cambodia to the American public on April 30 , 1970 . His responses to protesters included an impromptu , early morning meeting with them at the Lincoln Memorial on May 9 , 1970 . Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot 's then @-@ second @-@ in @-@ command , Nuon Chea . Nixon 's campaign promise to curb the war , contrasted with the escalated bombing , led to claims that Nixon had a " credibility gap " on the issue . 
 In 1971 , excerpts from the " Pentagon Papers " , which had been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg , were published by The New York Times and The Washington Post . When news of the leak first appeared , Nixon was inclined to do nothing ; the Papers , a history of United States ' involvement in Vietnam , mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations . He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared , and the President tried to prevent publication . The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers . 
 As U.S. troop withdrawals continued , conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended ; the armed forces became all @-@ volunteer . After years of fighting , the Paris Peace Accords were signed at the beginning of 1973 . The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops ; however , it did not require the 160 @,@ 000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw . Once American combat support ended , there was a brief truce , before fighting broke out again , this time without American combat involvement . North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975 .

 Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis ; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president , Fidel Castro . He maintained close relations with the Cuban @-@ American exile community through his friend , Bebe Rebozo , who often suggested ways of irritating Castro . These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans , who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis . In August 1970 , the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding ; despite his hard line against Castro , Nixon agreed . The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970 . A minor confrontation ensued , which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles . The final round of diplomatic notes , reaffirming the 1962 accord , were exchanged in November . 
 The election of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 spurred Nixon and Kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende , first designed to convince the Chilean congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup . Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents . It was even alleged that " Nixon personally authorized " $ 700 @,@ 000 in covert funds to print anti @-@ Allende messages in a prominent Chilean newspaper . Following an extended period of social , political , and economic unrest , General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d 'état on September 11 , 1973 ; among the dead was Allende . 
 = = = = Soviet Union = = = = 
 Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace . Following the announcement of his visit to China , the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union . The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22 , 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev , the General Secretary of the Communist Party ; Alexei Kosygin , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers ; and Nikolai Podgorny , the head of state , among other leading Soviet officials . 
 Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev . Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties : SALT I , the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers , and the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Treaty , which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles . Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of " peaceful coexistence " . A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin . 
 Seeking to foster better relations with the United States , both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily . Nixon later described his strategy : 
 I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist , if possible , the help of the Soviets and the Chinese . Though rapprochement with China and détente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves , I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war . At worst , Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing . At best , if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry , Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept . 
 Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations , Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974 . He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony , cheering crowds , and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening . Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta , where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact , détente , and <unk> . While he considered proposing a comprehensive test @-@ ban treaty , Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it . There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations . 
 = = = = Middle Eastern policy = = = = 
 As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the U.S. would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible , instead giving them assistance to defend themselves , the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East — particularly Israel , Iran and Saudi Arabia — during the Nixon administration . The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel , an American ally in the Middle East , but the support was not unconditional . Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it . The president believed that — except during the Suez Crisis — the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel , and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table . However , the Arab @-@ Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon 's attention during his first term — for one thing , he felt that no matter what he did , American Jews would oppose his reelection . 
 On October 6 , 1973 , an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria , supported with tons of arms and materiel by the Soviet Union , attacked Israel in what was known as the Yom Kippur War . Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses , cutting through inter @-@ departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations . More than a week later , by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce , Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory . The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis ; when Israel gained the upper @-@ hand , Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint <unk> peacekeeping mission , which the U.S. refused . When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily , Nixon ordered the U.S. military to <unk> , placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war . This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis . Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon 's actions . 
 Because Israel 's victory was largely due to U.S. support , the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S. , resulting in the 1973 oil crisis . The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973 , and was eventually ended by the oil @-@ producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold . 
 After the war , and under Nixon 's presidency , the U.S. reestablished relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967 . Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restart the stalled Middle East Peace Negotiations ; he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20 : 
 I believe that , beyond a doubt , we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East . I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by ... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves . 
 Nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the Middle East in June 1974 , and became the first President to visit Israel .

 = = = = Economy = = = = 
 At the time Nixon took office in 1969 , inflation was at 4 @.@ 7 percent — its highest rate since the Korean War . The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson , which , together with the Vietnam War costs , was causing large budget deficits . Unemployment was low , but interest rates were at their highest in a century . Nixon 's major economic goal was to reduce inflation ; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war . This could not be accomplished overnight , and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970 , contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections ( Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon 's presidency ) . According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon 's economic record , the new president did little to alter Johnson 's policies through the first year of his presidency . 
 Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies , but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition , and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection . As part of his " New Federalism " views , he proposed grants to the states , but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process . However , Nixon gained political credit for advocating them . In 1970 , Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes , though the Democratic majorities , knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career , did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority . With inflation unresolved by August 1971 , and an election year looming , Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David . He then announced temporary wage and price controls , allowed the dollar to float against other currencies , and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold . Bowles points out , 
 by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation 's defeat , Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents ... to criticize him . His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself . 
 Nixon 's policies dampened inflation through 1972 , although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration . 
 After he won reelection , Nixon found inflation returning . He reimposed price controls in June 1973 . The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople , who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy . The controls produced food shortages , as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss . Despite the failure to control inflation , controls were slowly ended , and on April 30 , 1974 , their statutory authorization lapsed .

 Nixon advocated a " New Federalism " , which would devolve power to state and local elected officials , though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them . He eliminated the Cabinet @-@ level United States Post Office Department , which in 1971 became the government @-@ run United States Postal Service . 
 Nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement . Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election ; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject . He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject , and sought to use that to his benefit ; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech ; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) ; the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects . Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972 — objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them , which he deemed excessive . After Congress overrode his veto , Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable . 
 In 1971 , Nixon proposed health insurance reform — a private health insurance employer mandate , federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children , and support for health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) . A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973 . In 1974 , Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform — a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of Medicaid by state @-@ run health insurance plans available to all , with income @-@ based premiums and cost sharing . 
 Concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam , Nixon called for a War on Drugs , pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad , and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities . 
 As one policy initiative , Nixon called for more money for sickle @-@ cell research , treatment , and education in February 1971 and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16 , 1972 . While Nixon called for increased spending on such high @-@ profile items as sickle @-@ cell disease and for a War on Cancer , at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health .

 The Nixon presidency witnessed the first large @-@ scale integration of public schools in the South . Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats , whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites . Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972 , he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then . Soon after his inauguration , he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force , which worked with local leaders — both white and black — to determine how to integrate local schools . Agnew had little interest in the work , and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz . Federal aid was available , and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees . By September 1970 , less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools . By 1971 , however , tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities , with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance . Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use . 
 In addition to desegregating public schools , Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970 — the first significant federal affirmative action program . He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification . Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968 , though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election . Nevertheless , he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had .

 After a nearly decade @-@ long national effort , the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20 , 1969 , with the flight of Apollo 11 . Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk . He called the conversation " the most historic phone call ever made from the White House " . 
 Nixon , however , was unwilling to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) at the high level seen through the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon . NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981 . Nixon , however , rejected both proposals due to the expense . Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969 , because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more cost @-@ effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective . 
 On March 7 , 1970 , Nixon announced the end of the Kennedy @-@ Johnson era 's massive efforts in the space race , stating " We must think of [ space activities ] as part of a continuing process ... and not as a series of separate leaps , each requiring a massive concentration of energy . Space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities ... What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us . " He then cancelled the last three planned Apollo lunar missions to place Skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the Space Shuttle . 
 On May 24 , 1972 , Nixon approved a five @-@ year cooperative program between NASA and the Soviet space program , culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an American Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft linking in space .

 Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment . The Democratic " Solid South " had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions . Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners . Nixon 's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace 's candidacy . Through his first term , he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies , such as his desegregation plans , that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites , encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the Civil Rights era . He nominated two Southern conservatives , Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court , but neither was confirmed by the Senate . 
 Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5 , 1972 , effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection . Virtually assured the Republican nomination , the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy ( brother of the late president ) , but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident . Instead , Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner , with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place . 
 On June 10 , McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination . The following month , Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention . He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive . McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights . With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization , McGovern was perceived as standing for " amnesty , abortion and acid " . McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate , Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton , dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression . Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle , and was reelected on November 7 , 1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history . He defeated McGovern with over 60 percent of the popular vote , losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia . 
 = = = = Watergate = = = = 
 The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration . Those activities included " dirty tricks , " or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures . The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington , D.C. on June 17 , 1972 . The Washington Post picked up on the story ; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as " Deep Throat " — later revealed to be Mark Felt , associate director at the FBI — to link the men to the Nixon administration . Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics , calling news articles biased and misleading . A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re @-@ elect President Nixon , and later the White House , was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats . Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution ; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing . 
 In July 1973 , White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office . These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox ; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes , citing executive privilege . With the White House and Cox at loggerheads , Nixon had Cox fired in October in the " Saturday Night Massacre " ; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski . In November , Nixon 's lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations , held in the White House on June 20 , 1972 , featured an 18 ½ minute gap . Rose Mary Woods , the President 's personal secretary , claimed responsibility for the gap , alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape , though her tale was widely mocked . The gap , while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President , cast doubt on Nixon 's statement that he had been unaware of the cover @-@ up . 
 Though Nixon lost much popular support , even from his own party , he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office . He insisted that he had made mistakes , but had no prior knowledge of the burglary , did not break any laws , and did not learn of the cover @-@ up until early 1973 . On October 10 , 1973 , Vice President Agnew resigned — unrelated to Watergate — and was convicted on charges of bribery , tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland . Nixon chose Gerald Ford , Minority Leader of the House of Representatives , to replace Agnew . 
 On November 17 , 1973 , during a televised question and answer session with the press , Nixon said , " People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook . Well , I 'm not a crook . I 've earned everything I 've got . " 
 The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974 , and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1 @,@ 200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides . The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9 , 1974 , which were televised on the major TV networks . These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment . On July 24 , the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes , not just selected transcripts , must be released . 
 The scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the President , ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes ; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due , and paid $ 465 @,@ 000 in back taxes in 1974 . 
 Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations , Nixon hoped to fight the charges . However , one of the new tapes , recorded soon after the break @-@ in , demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place , and had approved plans to thwart the investigation . In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the " Smoking Gun Tape " on August 5 , 1974 , Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement , stating that he had a lapse of memory . He met with Republican congressional leaders soon after , and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and had , at most , only 15 votes in his favor in the Senate — far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office . 
 = = = = Resignation = = = = 
 In light of his loss of political support and the near @-@ certainty of impeachment , Nixon resigned the office of the presidency on August 9 , 1974 , after addressing the nation on television the previous evening . The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television . Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president , Gerald Ford . Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency , especially in foreign policy . He defended his record as president , quoting from Theodore Roosevelt 's 1910 speech Citizenship in a Republic : 
 Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed , but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena , " whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood , who strives valiantly , who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming , but who does actually strive to do the deed , who knows the great enthusiasms , the great devotions , who spends himself in a worthy cause , who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst , if he fails , at least fails while daring greatly " . 
 Nixon 's speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators , with only Roger Mudd of CBS stating that Nixon had not admitted wrongdoing . It was termed " a masterpiece " by Conrad Black , one of his biographers . Black opined that " What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president , Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue . He left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office . "

 = = = Pardon and illness = = = 
 Following his resignation , the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente , California . According to his biographer , Aitken , after his resignation , " Nixon was a soul in torment " . Congress had funded Nixon 's transition costs , including some salary expenses , though reducing the appropriation from $ 850 @,@ 000 to $ 200 @,@ 000 . With some of his staff still with him , Nixon was at his desk by 7 a.m. — with little to do . His former press secretary , Ron Ziegler , sat with him alone for hours each day . 
 Nixon 's resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished . The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon , though it would be unpopular in the country . Nixon , contacted by Ford emissaries , was initially reluctant to accept the pardon , but then agreed to do so . Ford , however , insisted on a statement of contrition ; Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document . Ford eventually agreed , and on September 8 , 1974 , he granted Nixon a " full , free , and absolute pardon " , which ended any possibility of an indictment . Nixon then released a statement : 
 I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate , particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy . No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency , a nation I so deeply love , and an institution I so greatly respect . 
 In October 1974 , Nixon fell ill with phlebitis , the inflammation of the walls of a vein . Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die , a reluctant Nixon chose surgery , and President Ford visited him in the hospital . Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides — Dean , Haldeman , and John Ehrlichman — and The Washington Post , disbelieving his illness , printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the " wrong foot " . Judge John <unk> excused Nixon 's presence despite the defendants ' objections . Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon 's presidential papers — beginning a three @-@ decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate . Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held , and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43 seats in the House and three in the Senate . 
 = = = Return to public life = = = 
 In December 1974 , Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill @-@ will against him in the country . He wrote in his diary , referring to himself and Pat , 
 So be it . We will see it through . We 've had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now . That is perhaps what we were made for — to be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office . This is a test of character and we must not fail the test . 
 By early 1975 , Nixon 's health was improving . He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home , at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day ; he mainly worked on his memoirs . He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs ; the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly . He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February , which compelled him to part with many of his staff , including Ziegler . In August of that year , he met with British talk @-@ show host and producer David Frost , who paid him $ 600 @,@ 000 for a series of sit @-@ down interviews , filmed and aired in 1977 . They began on the topic of foreign policy , recounting the leaders he had known , but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate . Nixon admitted that he had " let down the country " and that " I brought myself down . I gave them a sword and they stuck it in . And they twisted it with relish . And , I guess , if I 'd been in their position , I 'd have done the same thing . " The interviews garnered 45 – 50 million viewers — becoming the most @-@ watched program of their kind in television history . 
 The interviews helped improve Nixon 's financial position — at one point in early 1975 he had only $ 500 in the bank — as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo . In February 1976 , Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao . Nixon had wanted to return to China , but chose to wait until after Ford 's own visit in 1975 . Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan . Ford won , but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election . The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia , causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation . 
 In 1976 , Nixon was disbarred in the state of New York for obstruction of justice in the Watergate affair . Nixon chose not to present any defense . In early 1978 , Nixon went to the United Kingdom . He was shunned by American diplomats and by most ministers of the James Callaghan government . He was welcomed , however , by the Leader of the Opposition , Margaret Thatcher , as well as by former prime ministers Lord Home and Sir Harold Wilson . Two other former prime ministers , Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath declined to meet him . Nixon addressed the Oxford Union regarding Watergate : 
 Some people say I didn 't handle it properly and they 're right . I screwed it up . Mea culpa . But let 's get on to my achievements . You 'll be here in the year 2000 and we 'll see how I 'm regarded then . 
 = = = Author and elder statesman = = = 
 In 1978 , Nixon published his memoirs , RN : The Memoirs of Richard Nixon , the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement . The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response . Nixon journeyed to the White House in 1979 , invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping . Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon , but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited . Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid @-@ 1979 . 
 On August 10 , 1979 , the Nixons purchased a New York City townhouse at 817 Fifth Avenue after being rejected by two Manhattan co @-@ ops . When the former Shah of Iran died in Egypt in July 1980 , Nixon defied the State Department , which intended to send no U.S. representative , by attending the funeral . Though Nixon had no official credentials , as a former president he was seen as the American presence at its former ally 's funeral . Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in 1980 , making television appearances portraying himself as , in biographer Stephen Ambrose 's words , " the senior statesman above the fray " . He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan 's victory . After eighteen months in the New York City townhouse , Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to Saddle River , New Jersey . 
 Throughout the 1980s , Nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing , traveled , and met with many foreign leaders , especially those of Third World countries . He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat . On a trip to the Middle East , Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya , which attracted significant U.S. media attention ; The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon 's " rehabilitation " . Nixon journeyed to the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Mikhail Gorbachev . Following this trip , Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world . 
 In 1986 , Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers , impressing his audience with his tour d 'horizon of the world . At the time , political pundit Elizabeth Drew wrote , " Even when he was wrong , Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory , as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority , enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times . " Newsweek ran a story on " Nixon 's comeback " with the headline " He 's back " . 
 On July 19 , 1990 , the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda , California opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance . They were joined by a large crowd of people , including Presidents Ford , Reagan , and George H. W. Bush , as well as their wives , Betty , Nancy , and Barbara . In January 1991 , the former president founded the Nixon Center ( today the Center for the National Interest ) , a Washington policy think tank and conference center . 
 Pat Nixon died on June 22 , 1993 , of emphysema and lung cancer . Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace . Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a moving tribute to her inside the library building . 
 = = = Death and funeral = = = 
 Nixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18 , 1994 , while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge , New Jersey home . A blood clot resulting from the atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart , broken off , and traveled to his brain . He was taken to New York Hospital – Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan , initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg . Damage to the brain caused swelling ( cerebral edema ) , and Nixon slipped into a deep coma . He died at 9 : 08 p.m. on April 22 , 1994 , with his daughters at his bedside . He was 81 years old . 
 Nixon 's funeral took place on April 27 , 1994 in Yorba Linda , California . <unk> at the Nixon Library ceremony included President Bill Clinton , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole , California Governor Pete Wilson , and the Reverend Billy Graham . Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford , Carter , Reagan , George H. W. Bush , and their wives . 
 Richard Nixon is buried beside his wife Pat on the grounds of the Nixon Library . He was survived by his two daughters , Tricia and Julie , and four grandchildren . In keeping with his wishes , his funeral was not a full state funeral , though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service . Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly , wet weather to pay their respects . At its peak , the line to pass by Nixon 's casket was three miles long with an estimated 42 @,@ 000 people waiting to pay their respects . 
 John F. Stacks of Time magazine said of Nixon shortly after his death , 
 An outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self @-@ created disaster that he faced . To reclaim a respected place in American public life after his resignation , he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world 's leaders ... and by the time Bill Clinton came to the White House [ in 1993 ] , Nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman . Clinton , whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach Nixon , met openly with him and regularly sought his advice . 
 Tom Wicker of The New York Times noted that Nixon had been equalled only by Franklin Roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and , quoting Nixon 's 1962 farewell speech , wrote , 
 Richard Nixon 's <unk> , beard @-@ shadowed face , the ski @-@ jump nose and the widow 's peak , the arms <unk> in the V @-@ sign , had been so often pictured and caricatured , his presence had become such a familiar one in the land , he had been so often in the heat of controversy , that it was hard to realize the nation really would not ' have Nixon to kick around anymore ' . 
 Ambrose said of the reaction to Nixon 's death , " To everyone 's amazement , except his , he 's our beloved elder statesman . " 
 Upon Nixon 's death , almost all of the news coverage mentioned Watergate , but for the most part , the coverage was favorable to the former president . The Dallas Morning News stated , " History ultimately should show that despite his flaws , he was one of our most farsighted chief executives . " This offended some ; columnist Russell Baker complained of " a group conspiracy to grant him absolution " . Cartoonist Jeff <unk> of the Omaha World @-@ Herald depicted History before a blank canvas , his subject Nixon , as America looks on eagerly . The artist urges his audience to sit down ; the work will take some time to complete , as " this portrait is a little more complicated than most " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Historian and political scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon , " How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president , so brilliant and so morally lacking ? " Nixon 's biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history . According to Ambrose , " Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished . What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation . " Irwin Gellman , who chronicled Nixon 's congressional career , suggests that " he was remarkable among his congressional peers , a success story in a troubled era , one who steered a sensible anti @-@ Communist course against the excess of McCarthy " . Aitken feels that " Nixon , both as a man and as a statesman , has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues . Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism , no simple verdict is possible . " 
 Nixon 's Southern Strategy is credited by some historians as causing the South to become a Republican stronghold , though others deem economic factors more important to the change . Throughout his career , he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists , and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism . According to his biographer , Herbert Parmet , " Nixon 's role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course , somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers , the <unk> , and the Reagans . " 
 Nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs , which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation . Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment , points to Nixon 's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act , stating that " though unsought and unacknowledged , Richard Nixon 's environmental legacy is secure . " 
 Nixon saw his policies regarding Vietnam , China , and the Soviets as key to his place in history . George McGovern , Nixon 's onetime opponent , commented in 1983 , " President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers , China and the Soviet Union , than any other president since World War II ... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam , Nixon really will get high marks in history . " Political scientist Jussi M. <unk> disagrees , saying Nixon 's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment , using diplomatic rather than military means . Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that " Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena . While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making , Nixon 's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both Communist China and the Soviet Union . " 
 Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a negative legacy : fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate . During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 , both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage : Republicans suggested that Clinton 's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon 's , while Democrats contended that Nixon 's actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent . Another legacy , for a time , was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate . Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9 / 11 attacks restored the president 's power . 
 = = Personality and public image = = 
 Nixon 's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public 's perception of it . Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms , to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred . He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls , slumped shoulders , and a furrowed , sweaty brow . 
 Nixon had a complex personality , both very secretive and awkward , yet strikingly reflective about himself . He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects , wearing a coat and tie even when home alone . Nixon biographer Conrad Black described him as being " driven " though also " uneasy with himself in some ways " . According to Black , Nixon 
 thought that he was doomed to be traduced , double @-@ crossed , unjustly harassed , misunderstood , underappreciated , and subjected to the trials of Job , but that by the application of his mighty will , tenacity , and diligence , he would ultimately prevail . 
 Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a " smart , talented man , but most peculiar and haunted of presidents " . In his account of the Nixon presidency , author Richard Reeves described Nixon as " a strange man of uncomfortable shyness , who functioned best alone with his thoughts " . Nixon 's presidency was doomed by his personality , Reeves argues : 
 He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them ... He clung to the idea of being ' tough ' . He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness . But that was what betrayed him . He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness . 
 Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president . Even Bebe Rebozo , by some accounts his closest friend , did not call him by his first name . Nixon stated of this , 
 Even with close friends , I don 't believe in letting your hair down , confiding this and that and the other thing — saying , ' Gee , I couldn 't sleep ' ... I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself . That 's just the way I am . Some people are different . Some people think it 's good therapy to sit with a close friend and , you know , just spill your guts ... [ and ] reveal their inner psyche — whether they were breast @-@ fed or bottle @-@ fed . Not me . No way . 
 When told that most Americans , even at the end of his career , did not feel they knew him , Nixon replied , " Yeah , it 's true . And it 's not necessary for them to know . "

 Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam ( Christ our Lord came to the Jordan ) , BWV 7 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Leipzig for the Feast of St. John the Baptist and led its first performance on 24 June 1724 . 
 It is the third cantata Bach composed for his chorale cantata cycle , the second cycle he started after being appointed Thomaskantor in 1723 . The cantata is based on the seven stanzas of Martin Luther 's hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " , about baptism . The first and last stanza of the chorale were used for the outer movements of the cantata , while an unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas of the hymn into the text for the five other movements . The first movement , a chorale fantasia , is followed by a succession of arias alternating with recitatives , leading to a four @-@ part closing chorale . 
 The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists ( alto , tenor and bass ) , a four @-@ part choir , two oboes d 'amore , two solo violins , strings and basso continuo .

 Bach composed this cantata for St John 's Day 24 June 1724 in Leipzig , as the third cantata of his second annual cycle ( the chorale cantata cycle ) , which had begun about two weeks earlier on the first Sunday after Trinity . The cycle was devoted to Lutheran hymns , typically rendered by keeping their text of the first and last stanza , while a contemporary poet reworded the inner stanzas . 
 The prescribed readings for the feast of the birth of John the Baptist were from the Book of Isaiah , " the voice of a preacher in the desert " ( Isaiah 40 : 1 – 5 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , the birth of John the Baptist and the Benedictus of Zechariah ( Luke 1 : 57 – 80 ) . Martin Luther 's hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( To Jordan came our Lord the Christ ) is associated with the feast . Its topic , differing from that of the readings , is baptism , which is treated based on biblical accounts , starting from Christ 's baptism by John the Baptist in the river Jordan . The hymn tune is " Es woll [ t ] uns Gott genädig sein " , Zahn No. <unk> . 
 Bach used the text of the first stanza of Luther 's hymn for the first movement of his cantata , with its chorale melody sung as cantus firmus . The final movement of the cantata is a four @-@ part chorale setting of the seventh stanza , on the hymn tune . The five arias and recitatives between these choral movements are settings of text paraphrased from the hymn 's other stanzas .

 The cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists ( alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir ( SATB ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two solo violins ( Vs , the second one only introduced in a later performance ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) .

 The seven @-@ movement cantata begins with a chorale fantasia and ends , after a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives , with a closing chorale as a four @-@ part setting .

 In the opening chorus , " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( Christ our Lord came to the Jordan ) , the tenor has the melody as a cantus firmus , while the other voices sing free counterpoint . In the first cantata of the chorale cantata cycle , O Ewigkeit , du Donnerwort , BWV 20 , Bach had given the cantus firmus of the chorale tune to the soprano , and in the second , Ach Gott , vom Himmel <unk> <unk> , BWV 2 , to the alto . 
 The opening chorus resembles an Italian violin concerto . The musicologist Julian Mincham likens the " solo violin 's persistent , rocking , wave @-@ like idea " to the waves of the Jordan River . Alfred Dürr compares the vocal sections , all with the solo violin , to the solo sections of a violin concerto , as opposed to the tutti sections with the orchestra . John Eliot Gardiner interprets the movement as a French overture , " replete with grandiloquent baroque gestures to suggest both the processional entrance of Jesus and the powerful flooding of the River Jordan " . Klaus Hofmann notes that the movement combines the old style of motet writing with the new type of solo concerto , and observes that " the main violin solo episodes ... are at first linked to the choral entries , but gradually assume larger proportions and greater independence as the movement progresses " .

 The first aria , " <unk> und <unk> , ihr <unk> " ( Mark and hear , you humans ) , is accompanied by the continuo alone . Mincham observes that a characteristic fast motif of five notes , repeated abundantly in the cello , always flows downward , while Bach usually also inverses motifs , such as in his Inventions . Mincham concludes that it represents the " pouring of the baptismal waters " .

 The following recitative is given to the tenor as an Evangelist : " Dies hat Gott <unk> mit <unk> " ( This God has clearly provided with words ) , narrating the biblical command to baptise .

 The central aria is sung by the tenor , accompanied by two violins , marked " solo " in a later performance , " Des <unk> Stimme <unk> sich hören " ( The Father 's voice can be heard ) . Gardiner notes that the music " describes , through its pair of soaring violins , the circling flight of the Holy Spirit as a dove " . Hofmann notes the character of the movement as a gigue , and several appearances of the number 3 as a symbol of the Trinity : it is a trio for voice and two violins , " in triple time – and markedly so : not only is the time signature 3 / 4 , but also the <unk> are each divided into triplets " , and in a form of three solo sections as " all variants of a single model that is presented in the opening and concluding ritornellos " . Hofmann concludes : " The sequence that this creates – three different forms of the same musical substance – is evidently to be understood as a symbol of the Holy Trinity . "

 A recitative for bass , the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) , " Als Jesus dort nach seinen Leiden " ( As Jesus there , after His passion ) , speaks of Jesus after his passion and resurrection . It is accompanied by the strings , similar to the words of Jesus in Bach 's St Matthew Passion .

 The last aria is sung by the alto with rich accompaniment : " Menschen , <unk> doch dieser <unk> " ( People , believe this grace now , ) . The two oboes d 'amore double the first violin when human beings are requested to accept the grace of God to not " perish in the pit of hell " .

 The closing chorale is the final stanza of the hymn , with the instruments playing colla parte : " Das Aug allein das Wasser <unk> " ( The eye sees only water , ) , a summary of Luther 's teaching about baptism .
