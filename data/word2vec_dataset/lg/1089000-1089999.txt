 By the end of the 1960s , the regional policy of bringing firms into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy . This policy , begun in 1934 , was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications , most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London . It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period ; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years . 
 The first referendum , in 1979 , in which the Welsh electorate voted on the creation of an assembly for Wales resulted in a large majority for the " no " vote . However in 1997 a referendum on the same issue secured a " yes " , although by a very narrow majority . The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 ( under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) and has the power to determine how the central government budget for Wales is spent and administered , although the UK parliament reserves the right to set limits on the powers of the Welsh Assembly . 
 The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country . The Welsh Government says : " Wales is not a Principality . Although we are joined with England by land , and we are part of Great Britain , Wales is a country in its own right . " The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne , currently Prince Charles . However the Prince of Wales has no constitutional role in modern Wales . According to the Welsh Government : " Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles , who is the present heir to the throne . But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales , even though his title might suggest that he does . "

 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . Constitutionally , the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons – the lower house of the UK government – Wales is represented by 40 MPs ( of 650 ) from Welsh constituencies . Labour MPs hold 26 of the 40 seats , the Liberal Democrats hold three seats , Plaid Cymru three and the Conservatives eight . A Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet and is responsible for representing matters pertaining to Wales . The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government , responsible for Wales . Alun Cairns has been Secretary of State for Wales since March 2016 . 
 Referendums held in Wales and Scotland in 1997 chose to establish a form of self @-@ government in both countries . In Wales , the consequent process of devolution began with the Government of Wales Act 1998 , which created the National Assembly for Wales ( Welsh : Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) . Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999 , granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government 's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered . The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 which enhanced the Assembly 's powers , giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Assembly has 60 members , known as Assembly Members ( <unk> y Cynulliad ) . Members ( AMs ( <unk> ) ) are elected for four @-@ year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the AMs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system . The remaining twenty AMs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies , using the d 'Hondt method of proportional representation . The Assembly must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . 
 Labour remained the largest Assembly party following the 2007 election , winning 26 of the 60 seats . Having insufficient support to form a government , the Labour Party entered into the ' One Wales ' agreement with Plaid Cymru , forming a coalition , with the Labour leader as First Minister . Carwyn Jones has been First Minister and leader of Welsh Labour since Rhodri Morgan retired from office in December 2009 , after nine years and ten months as First Minister . Ieuan Wyn Jones , Deputy First Minister in the coalition government , was leader of Plaid Cymru , the second @-@ largest party in the Assembly with 14 of the 60 seats . Under the ' One Wales ' agreement , a referendum on giving the Welsh assembly full law @-@ making powers was promised " as soon as practicable , at or before the end of the assembly term ( in 2011 ) " and both parties have agreed " in good faith to campaign for a successful outcome to such a referendum " . 
 Welsh Labour again remained the largest party within the Assembly following the National Assembly for Wales election , 2011 winning 30 of the 60 seats . Other parties represented in the assembly are the Welsh Conservatives , the loyal opposition with 14 seats , Plaid Cymru which have 11 seats and the Welsh Liberal Democrats with five seats . Carwyn Jones remained First Minister following the election , this time leading a Welsh Labour ministerial team . The Presiding Officer of the Assembly is Rosemary Butler of Welsh Labour . 
 The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government , known as " subjects " , include agriculture , economic development , education , health , housing , local government , social services , tourism , transport and the Welsh language . On its creation in 1999 , the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers . However , since the Government of Wales Act 2006 ( <unk> 2006 ) came into effect in 2007 , the Assembly had power to pass primary legislation as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility . Further matters have been added subsequently , either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order ( <unk> ) ; a request from the National Assembly for additional powers . The <unk> 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum . 
 A referendum on extending the law @-@ making powers of the National Assembly was accordingly held on 3 March 2011 . It asked the question : " Do you want the Assembly now to be able to make laws on all matters in the 20 subject areas it has powers for ? " 63 @.@ 49 % of the voters voted ' yes ' , and 36 @.@ 51 % voted ' no ' . Consequently , the Assembly is now able to make laws , known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas , without needing the UK Parliament 's agreement . 
 Wales is also a distinct UK electoral region of the European Union represented by four Members of the European Parliament . 
 = = = Local government = = = 
 For the purposes of local government , Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996 . These " principal areas " are responsible for the provision of all local government services , including education , social work , environment and roads services . 
 Note : Wales has six cities . In addition to Cardiff , Newport and Swansea , the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Law and order = = 
 By tradition , Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland circa 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950 . The ' law of Hywel Dda ' ( Welsh : <unk> Hywel ) , as it became known , codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries . Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim , or the victim 's kin , rather than on punishment by the ruler . Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords , Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 . Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute . Marcher Law and Welsh Law ( for civil cases ) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 – 1542 ( often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543 ) , after which English law applied to the whole of Wales . The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales ( and the Anglo @-@ Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise ; this act , with regard to Wales , was repealed in 1967 . English law has been the legal system of Wales and England since 1536 , and continues to be , albeit there is now a growing body of contemporary Welsh law since devolution to Wales since 1999 . 
 English law is regarded as a common law system , with no major codification of the law , and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive . 
 The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases . The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates ' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region ( known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005 ) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North @-@ Western England Region . From that point Wales became a legal unit in its own right , although remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . 
 The Welsh Assembly has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales . Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011 , it is able to pass primary legislation known as Acts of the Assembly in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education . Through this primary legislation , the Welsh Government can then also draft more specific secondary legislation . 
 Wales is served by four regional police forces , Dyfed @-@ Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . Four prisons are in Wales ; all in the southern half of the country . As well as no northern provision for Welsh prisoners , Wales has no women 's prisons ; female inmates are imprisoned in England . 
 = = Geography and natural history = = 
 Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . It is about 170 miles ( 270 km ) north – south and 60 miles ( 97 km ) east – west . The oft @-@ quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20 @,@ 779 km2 ( 8 @,@ 023 sq mi ) . Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions : the Irish Sea to the north and west , St George 's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south . Wales has about 1 @,@ 680 miles ( 2 @,@ 700 km ) of coastline ( along the mean high water mark ) , including the mainland , Anglesey and Holyhead . Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland ; the largest being Anglesey , in the north @-@ west . 
 Much of Wales ' diverse landscape is mountainous , particularly in the north and central regions . The mountains were shaped during the last ice age , the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ) , of which five are over 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , at 1 @,@ 085 m ( 3 @,@ 560 ft ) . The 14 Welsh mountains , or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf – often discounted because of its low topographic prominence – over 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 metres ) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north @-@ west . 
 The highest outside the 3000s is Aran <unk> , at 905 metres ( 2 @,@ 969 feet ) , in the south of Snowdonia . The Brecon Beacons ( <unk> Brycheiniog ) are in the south ( highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres ( 2 @,@ 907 feet ) ) , and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales . The highest point being Pumlumon at 752 metres ( 2 @,@ 467 feet ) . 
 Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia , Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey , the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Llŷn Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , in 1956 . Forty two percent of the coastline of south and west Wales is designated as Heritage Coast , with 13 specific designated strips of coastline maintained by Natural Resources Wales ( successor body to the Countryside Council for Wales ) . As from 2012 the coastline of Wales has 43 Blue Flag beaches and five Blue Flag marinas . Despite its heritage and award winning beaches ; the south and west coasts of Wales , along with the Irish and Cornish coasts , are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies / south westerlies that , over the years , have sunk and wrecked many vessels . On the night of 25 October 1859 , over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales when a hurricane blew in from the Atlantic . More than 800 lives were lost across Britain because of the storm , but the greatest tragedy was the sinking of the Royal Charter off the coast of Anglesey in which 459 people died . The number of shipwrecks around the coast of Wales reached a peak in the 19th century with over 100 vessels lost and an average loss of life of about 78 sailors per year . Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead , Milford Haven and Swansea . Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands , Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks , most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996 . 
 The first border between Wales and England was zonal , apart from around the River Wye , which was the first accepted boundary . Offa 's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn , who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke . The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye . Even after the Act of Union , many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881 , which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law . 
 The Seven Wonders of Wales is a list in doggerel verse of seven geographic and cultural landmarks in Wales probably composed in the late 18th century under the influence of tourism from England . All the " wonders " are in north Wales : Snowdon ( the highest mountain ) , the Gresford bells ( the peal of bells in the medieval church of All Saints at Gresford ) , the Llangollen bridge ( built in 1347 over the River Dee ) , St Winefride 's Well ( a pilgrimage site at Holywell ) in Flintshire , the Wrexham ( <unk> ) steeple ( 16th @-@ century tower of St Giles ' Church , Wrexham ) , the Overton yew trees ( ancient yew trees in the churchyard of St. Mary 's at Overton @-@ on @-@ Dee ) and Pistyll Rhaeadr – a tall waterfall , at 240 ft ( 73 m ) . The wonders are part of the rhyme : 
 Pistyll Rhaeadr and Wrexham steeple , 
 Snowdon 's mountain without its people , 
 Overton yew trees , St Winefride 's Wells , 
 Llangollen bridge and Gresford bells .

 The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era , the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants . In evolutionary studies the Cambrian is the period when most major groups of complex animals appeared ( the Cambrian explosion ) . The older rocks underlying the Cambrian rocks in Wales lacked fossils which could be used to differentiate their various groups and were referred to as Pre @-@ <unk> . 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , two prominent geologists , Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick ( who first proposed the name of the Cambrian period ) , independently used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era , the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison 's and Sedgwick 's work . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Wales lies within the north temperate zone . It has a changeable , maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe . Welsh weather is often cloudy , wet and windy , with warm summers and mild winters . The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales ' northerly latitudes ( between 53 ° 43 ′ N and 51 ° 38 ′ N ) . Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country 's west coast , has nearly 17 hours of daylight at the summer solstice . Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven and a half hours . The country 's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine , rainfall and temperature . Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10 @.@ 5 ° C ( 51 ° F ) and in low lying inland areas , 1 ° C ( 1 @.@ 8 ° F ) lower . It becomes cooler at higher altitudes ; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0 @.@ 5 ° C ( 0 @.@ 9 ° F ) each 100 metres ( 330 feet ) of altitude . Consequently , the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) . Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current , bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes , has a similar effect on most of north @-@ west Europe . As well as its influence on Wales ' coastal areas , air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds . 
 At low elevations , summers tend to be warm and sunny . Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22 ° C ( 66 and 72 ° F ) . Winters tend to be fairly wet , but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing . Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) – also the average annual daytime temperature . 
 The sunniest time of year tends to be between May and August . The south @-@ western coast is the sunniest part of Wales , averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually . Wales ' sunniest town is Tenby , Pembrokeshire . The dullest time of year tends to be between November and January . The least sunny areas are the mountains , some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually . The prevailing wind is south @-@ westerly . Coastal areas are the windiest , gales occur most often during winter , on average between 15 and 30 days each year , depending on location . Inland , gales average fewer than six days annually . 
 Rainfall patterns show significant variation . The further west , the higher the expected rainfall ; up to 40 % more . At low elevations , rain is unpredictable at any time of year , although the showers tend to be shorter in summer . The uplands of Wales have most rain , normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months ( December to February ) , falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months ( June to August ) . Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 120 in ) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 200 in ) ( Snowdon 's summit ) . The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) , and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year . Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas , but is relatively uncommon around the coast . Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 39 in ) . Met Office statistics show Swansea to be the wettest city in Great Britain , with an average annual rainfall of 1 @,@ 360 @.@ 8 millimetres ( 53 @.@ 57 in ) . This has led to the old adage " If you can see Mumbles Head it is going to rain – if you can 't , it is raining " . Cardiff is Great Britain 's fifth wettest city , with 908 millimetres ( 35 @.@ 7 in ) . Rhyl is Wales ' driest town , its average annual rainfall 640 millimetres ( 25 in ) . 
 Highest maximum temperature : 35 @.@ 2 ° C ( 95 ° F ) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990 . 
 Lowest minimum temperature : − 23 @.@ 3 ° C ( − 10 ° F ) at Rhayader , Radnorshire ( now Powys ) on 21 January 1940 . 
 Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month : 354 @.@ 3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955 . 
 Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month : 2 @.@ 7 hours at <unk> , Brecknockshire in January 1962 . 
 Maximum rainfall in a day ( 0900 UTC – 0900 UTC ) : 211 millimetres ( 8 in ) at Rhondda , Glamorgan , on 11 November 1929 . 
 Wettest spot – an average of 4 @,@ 473 millimetres ( 176 in ) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia , Gwynedd ( making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom ) .

 Wales ’ wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions . Because of its long coastline Wales hosts a variety of seabirds . The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison , with 60 % of Wales above the 150m contour , the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds , including raven and ring ouzel . Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife . In total , more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors . 
 The larger Welsh mammals died out during the Norman period , including the brown bear , wolf and the wildcat . Today , mammals of note include shrews , voles , badgers , otters , hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat . Two species of small rodent , the yellow @-@ necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area . Other animals of note include , otter , stoat and weasel . The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting , has not been officially recorded since the 1950s . The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain , but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading . Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia . 
 The waters of south @-@ west Wales of Gower , Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals , including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles , dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish , crabs and lobsters . Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion in particular are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK . River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , <unk> and Arctic char , whilst the <unk> is unique to Wales , found only in Bala Lake . Wales is also known for its shellfish , including cockles , limpet , mussels and <unk> . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country 's <unk> . 
 The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre @-@ glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily – Gagea serotina – and other alpine species such as Saxifraga <unk> , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales also hosts a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK including the spotted rock @-@ rose <unk> guttata on Anglesey and Draba <unk> on the Gower . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Over the last 250 years , Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial , and now a post @-@ industrial economy . Since the Second World War , the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs , a feature typifying most advanced economies . Total headline Gross Value Added ( GVA ) in Wales in 2010 was £ 45 @.@ 5 billion , or £ 15 @,@ 145 per head of population ; 74 @.@ 0 per cent of the average for the UK total , the lowest GVA per head in the UK . In the three months to July 2010 , the employment rate for working @-@ age adults in Wales was 67 per cent , compared to 70 @.@ 7 per cent across the UK as a whole . 
 From the middle of the 19th century until the post @-@ war era , the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry . At its peak of production in 1913 , nearly 233 @,@ 000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal . Cardiff was once the largest coal @-@ exporting port in the world and , for a few years before the First World War , handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool . In the 1920s , over 40 % of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression " devastated Wales " , north and south , because of its " overwhelming dependence on coal and steel " . From the mid @-@ 1970s , the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services . In the late 1970s and early 1980s , Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK . However , much of the new industry was essentially of a " branch factory " ( " screwdriver factory " ) type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is located in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are retained elsewhere . 
 Because of poor @-@ quality soil , much of Wales is unsuitable for crop @-@ growing and livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of agriculture . The Welsh landscape ( protected by three national parks ) and 45 Blue Flag beaches , as well as the unique culture of Wales , attract large numbers of tourists , who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas . Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value @-@ added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development , attributable in part to a comparative lack of ' economic mass ' ( i.e. population ) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre . The lack of high value @-@ added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90 % of the <unk> average and around 80 % of the UK average . In June 2008 , Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . 
 The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales . Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century . The last bank to do so closed in 1908 ; since then , although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries , the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales . The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971 , was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002 . The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK , have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980 . Since decimalisation , in 1971 , at least one of the coins in UK circulation has depicted a Welsh design , e.g. the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin ( above ) . However , Wales has not been represented on any coin minted from 2008 . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The main road artery along the south Wales coast is the M4 motorway . It also provides a link to southern England , terminating in London . The section of the motorway managed by the Welsh Government runs from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham , Carmarthenshire , connecting the cities of Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast , connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire . It also links to north @-@ west England , principally Chester . The main north @-@ south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . 
 Cardiff International Airport is the only large and international airport in Wales . Providing links to European , African and North American destinations , it is about 12 miles ( 19 km ) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan . Intra @-@ Wales flights run between Anglesey ( Valley ) and Cardiff , operated by Isle of Man airline <unk> Other internal flights operate to northern England , Scotland and Northern Ireland . 
 The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales . Cardiff Central is Wales ' busiest railway station , with over four times as much passenger traffic as any other station in Wales . The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east @-@ west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland . Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . All trains in Wales are diesel @-@ powered , since no lines have been electrified . However , the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea , is undergoing electrification . 
 Wales has four commercial ferry ports . Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service , cancelled in 2006 , was reinstated in March 2010 , but is again under threat of closure in 2012 . 
 = = Education = = 
 A distinct education system has developed in Wales . Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite . The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge . One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s ; believed to have taught half the country 's population to read . In the 19th century , with increasing state involvement in education , Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non @-@ conformist , Welsh @-@ speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south . In some schools , to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school , the Welsh Not was used ; a policy seen as a hated symbol of English oppression . The " not " , a piece of wood hung round the neck by string , was given to any child overheard speaking Welsh , who would pass it to a different child if overheard speaking Welsh . At the end of the day , the wearer of the " not " would be beaten . The extent of its practice , however , is difficult to determine . State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which , following Brad y <unk> <unk> ( the Treachery of the Blue Books ) , was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children . 
 The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872 . Cardiff and Bangor followed , and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools . The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907 , which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution . A resurgence in Welsh @-@ language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh . In schools where English is the first language , Welsh is a compulsory subject until the age of 16 . However , there has never been a Welsh @-@ language college , and in the University of Wales , at the start of the 21st century only 100 of its 5000 academic staff were teaching through the medium of Welsh . In 2006 there were 33 nursery , 1555 primary , 244 secondary comprehensive and 43 special schools with 56 independent schools in Wales . In 2004 the country had 505 @,@ 208 pupils taught by 27 @,@ 378 teachers . 
 = = Healthcare = = 
 Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ) , which was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales created by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969 . In turn , responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Assembly and Executive under devolution in 1999 . Historically , Wales was served by smaller ' cottage ' hospitals , built as voluntary institutions . As newer more expensive diagnostic techniques and treatments became available through medical advancement , much of the clinical work of the country has been concentrated in newer , larger district hospitals . In 2006 , there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales , although none situated in Powys . NHS Wales provides public healthcare in Wales and employs some 90 @,@ 000 staff , making it Wales ’ biggest employer . The Minister for Health and Social Services is the person within the Welsh Government who holds cabinet responsibilities for both health and social care in Wales . 
 A 2009 Welsh health survey , conducted by the Welsh Assembly , reported that 51 % of adults reported their health good or excellent , while 21 % described their health as fair or poor . The survey also recorded that 27 % of Welsh adults had a long @-@ term chronic illness , such as arthritis , asthma , diabetes and heart disease . Enquiries into health @-@ related lifestyle choices report 27 % of the adult population are smokers , 45 % admit drinking alcohol above recommended guidelines at least once a week , while 29 % undertake the recommended weekly physical activity .

 The 2011 census showed Wales ' population to be 3 @,@ 063 @,@ 456 , the highest in its history . In 2011 , 27 % ( 837 @,@ 000 ) of the total population of Wales were not born in Wales , including 636 @,@ 000 people ( 21 % of the total population of Wales ) who were born in England . The main population and industrial areas are in south Wales , including the cities of Cardiff , Swansea and Newport and the nearby valleys , with another significant population in the north @-@ east around Wrexham and Flintshire . 
 According to the 2001 census , 96 % of the population was White British , and 2 @.@ 1 % non @-@ white ( mainly of British Asian origin ) . Most non @-@ white groups were concentrated in Cardiff , Newport and Swansea . Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War . In the early 21st century , parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland ; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom . 
 The 2001 UK census was criticised in Wales for not offering ' Welsh ' as an option to describe respondents ' national identity . Partly to address this concern , the 2011 census asked the question " How would you describe your national identity ? " . Respondents were instructed to " tick all that apply " from a list of options that included Welsh . The outcome was that 57 @.@ 5 % of Wales ' population indicated their sole national identity to be Welsh ; a further 7 @.@ 1 % indicated it to be both Welsh and British . No Welsh national identity was indicated by 34 @.@ 1 % . The proportion giving their sole national identity as British was 16 @.@ 9 % , and another 9 @.@ 4 % included British with another national identity . No British national identity was indicated by 73 @.@ 7 % . 11 @.@ 2 % indicated their sole national identity as English and another 2 @.@ 6 % included English with another national identity . 
 The 2011 census showed Wales to be less ethnically diverse than any region of England . Of the Wales population , 93 @.@ 2 % classed themselves as White British ( including Welsh , English , Scottish or Northern Irish ) , with 2 @.@ 4 % as " Other White " ( including Irish ) , 2 @.@ 2 % as Asian ( including Asian British ) , 1 % as Mixed , and 0 @.@ 6 % as Black ( African , Caribbean , or Black British ) . The lowest proportion of White British ( 80 @.@ 3 % ) was in Cardiff . 
 In 2001 , a quarter of the Welsh population were born outside Wales , mainly in England ; about 3 % were born outside the UK . The proportion of people who were born in Wales differs across the country , with the highest percentages in the south Wales valleys and the lowest in mid Wales and parts of the north @-@ east . In both Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil , 92 % were Welsh @-@ born , compared to only 51 % and 56 % in the border counties of Flintshire and Powys . Just over 1 @.@ 75 million Americans report themselves to have Welsh ancestry , as did 440 @,@ 965 Canadians in Canada 's 2006 census . 
 The total fertility rate ( TFR ) in Wales was 1 @.@ 90 in 2011 , which is below the replacement rate of 2 @.@ 1 . The majority of births are to unmarried women ( 58 % of births in 2011 were outside of marriage ) . About one in 10 births ( 10 @.@ 7 percent ) in 2011 were to foreign @-@ born mothers , compared to 5 @.@ 2 % in 2001 . 
 A 2010 study estimated that 35 % of the Welsh population have surnames of Welsh origin ( 5 @.@ 4 % of the English and 1 @.@ 6 % of the Scottish population also bore ' Welsh ' names ) . However , many modern surnames derived from old Welsh personal names actually arose in England .

 In his 1707 work Archaeologia Britannica Edward Lhuyd , keeper of the Ashmolean Museum , noted the similarity between the two Celtic language families : Brythonic or P – Celtic ( Breton , Cornish and Welsh ) ; and Goidelic or Q – Celtic ( Irish , Manx and Scottish Gaelic ) . He argued that the Brythonic languages originated in Gaul ( France ) , and that the Goidelic languages originated in the Iberian Peninsula . Lhuyd concluded that as the languages had been of Celtic origin , the people who spoke those languages were Celts . ( According to a more recent hypothesis , also widely embraced today , Goidelic and Brythonic languages , collectively known as Insular Celtic languages , evolved together for some time separately from Continental Celtic languages such as Gaulish and Celtiberian . ) From the 18th century , the peoples of Brittany , Cornwall , Ireland , Isle of Man , Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts , and they are regarded as the modern Celtic nations today . 
 The Bible translations into Welsh helped to maintain the use of Welsh in daily life . The New Testament was translated by William <unk> in 1567 followed by the complete Bible by William Morgan in 1588 . 
 The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality . English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the de facto main language . Code @-@ switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms , though none is recognised by professional linguists . " <unk> " is the Welsh English language dialect . It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh . According to John Davies , <unk> has " been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh " . Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population , and English learnt as a second language . The 2011 Census showed 562 @,@ 016 people , 19 @.@ 0 % of the Welsh population , were able to speak Welsh , a decrease from the 20 @.@ 8 % returned in the 2001 census . Although <unk> in young children continues , life @-@ long <unk> in Welsh is recognised to be a thing of the past . 
 Road signs in Wales are generally in both English and Welsh ; where place names differ in the two languages , both versions are used ( e.g. " Cardiff " and " Caerdydd " ) , the decision as to which is placed first being that of the local authority . During the 20th century , a number of small communities of speakers of languages other than Welsh or English , such as Bengali or Cantonese , established themselves in Wales as a result of immigration . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The largest religion in Wales is Christianity , with 57 @.@ 6 % of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census . The Church in Wales with 56 @,@ 000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations . It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at <unk> in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811 . 
 The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43 @,@ 000 adherents . Non @-@ Christian religions are small in Wales , making up approximately 2 @.@ 7 % of the population . The 2011 census recorded 32 @.@ 1 % of people declaring no religion , while 7 @.@ 6 % did not reply to the question . The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ) , with Saint David 's Day ( <unk> Gŵyl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March . 
 In 1904 , there was a religious revival ( known by some as the 1904 – 1905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival ) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to nonconformist and Anglican Christianity , sometimes whole communities . Roberts ' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . The Apostolic Church holds its annual Apostolic Conference in Swansea each year , usually in August . 
 Islam is the largest non @-@ Christian religion in Wales , with more than 24 @,@ 000 ( 0 @.@ 8 % ) reported Muslims in the 2011 census . 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff , is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . 
 There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport , Cardiff and Swansea , while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . Judaism was the first non @-@ Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times , though by 2001 the community has declined to approximately 2 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Wales has a distinctive culture including its own language , customs , holidays and music . 
 Wales has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . 
 = = = Mythology = = = 
 The remnants of the native Celtic mythology of the pre @-@ Christian Britons was passed down orally , in much altered form , by the <unk> ( the early poets ) . Some of their work survives in much later medieval Welsh manuscripts , known as : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin ( both 13th @-@ century ) ; the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch ( both 14th @-@ century ) ; and the Red Book of <unk> ( c . 1400 ) . The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion , a title given to them by their first translator , Lady Charlotte Guest , and also used by subsequent translators . Poems such as Cad <unk> ( The Battle of the Trees ) and mnemonic list @-@ texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material . These texts also include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post @-@ Roman Britain . 
 Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th @-@ century Latin historical compilation Historia <unk> ( the History of the Britons ) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th @-@ century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae ( the History of the Kings of Britain ) , as well as later folklore , such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas . 
 = = = Literature in Wales = = = 
 Wales can claim one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe . The literary tradition of Wales stretches back to the sixth century and includes Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded by historian John Davies as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages . The earliest body of Welsh verse , by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form , but in medieval versions and have undergone significant linguistic changes . Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages , through the era of the Poets of the Princes ( c . 1100 – 1280 ) and then the Poets of the Gentry ( c . 1350 – 1650 ) . The Poets of the Princes were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to the Welsh princes while the Poets of the Gentry were a school of poets that favoured the <unk> metre . The period is notable for producing one of Wales ' greatest poets , Dafydd ap Gwilym . After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined . 
 Despite the extinction of the professional poet , the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits . <unk> such as William <unk> and John Davies brought Renaissance ideals from English universities when they returned to Wales . While in 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh , from Greek and Hebrew . From the 16th century onwards the proliferation of the ' free @-@ metre ' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry , but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular . By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic , fuelled by the eisteddfod , became an obsession with Welsh @-@ language writers . The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality . Initially the eisteddfod was askance with the religious denominations , but in time these bodies came to dominate the competitions , with the bardic themes becoming increasingly scriptural and didactic . The period is notable for the adoption by Welsh poets of bardic names , made popular by the eisteddfod movement . 
 Major developments in 19th @-@ century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation of the Mabinogion , one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology , into English . 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language . The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long @-@ winded Victorian Welsh prose , with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work <unk> Arthur . The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry @-@ Williams and R. Williams Parry . The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape . Though the inter @-@ war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays , poetry and criticism . 
 The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two , including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954 . Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time . Gwyn Thomas became the voice of the English @-@ speaking Welsh valleys with his humorous take on grim lives . 
 The attitude of the post @-@ war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation , in that they were more sympathetic to Welsh nationalism and to the Welsh language . The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Lleyn Peninsula in 1936 , along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II . In poetry R. S. Thomas ( 1913 – 2000 ) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century . While he " did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English " , he wanted the Welsh language to be made the first language of Wales , and the official policy of bilingualism abolished . 
 The major novelist in the second half of the twentieth century was <unk> Humphreys ( 1919 ) . , who during his long writing career published over twenty novels , which surveys the political and cultural history of twentieth @-@ century Wales . Another novelist of the post @-@ Second @-@ World @-@ War era was Raymond Williams ( 1921 – 88 ) . Born near Abergavenny , Williams continued the earlier tradition of writing from a left @-@ wing perspective on the Welsh industrial scene in his trilogy " Border Country " ( 1960 ) , " Second Generation " ( 1964 ) , and " The Fight for Manod " ( 1979 ) . He also enjoyed a reputation as a cultural historian .

 The National Museum [ of ] Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country , including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001 , the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly , and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001 – 2002 by 87 @.@ 8 % to 1 @,@ 430 @,@ 428 . 
 Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales , including the John William 's Library and the <unk> Castle collection . As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs , ephemera such as postcards , posters and Ordnance Survey maps .

 Many works of Celtic art have been found in Wales . In the Early Medieval period , the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive , of which the 8th century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels are the most notable . The 11th century <unk> Psalter ( now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh , made in St David 's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence . 
 The best of the few Welsh artists of the 16th – 18th centuries tended to leave the country to work , many of them moving to London or Italy . Richard Wilson ( 1714 – 82 ) is arguably the first major British landscapist . Although more notable for his Italian scenes , he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London . By the late 18th century , the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns , allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland . Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery , at first because of the Celtic Revival . Then in the early 19th century , the Napoleonic Wars preventing the Grand Tour to continental Europe , travel through Wales came to be considered more accessible . 
 An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865 . Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work , but Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists ' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881 . The sculptor Sir William <unk> John made many works for Welsh commissions , although he had settled in London . Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh , was also based in London . Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew <unk> had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France . Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin but spent little time in Wales . 
 Many Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe . Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris . However , the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives , while remaining in touch with the wider art world . Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London . He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales , including Eric Gill , the London @-@ Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea , which also included the painter Alfred Janes . 
 South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the <unk> Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century . In the 18th and 19th centuries , with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery ( 1764 – 1870 , also known as " Swansea pottery " ) and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff , which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920 . Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams @-@ Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams @-@ Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent , England .

 The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y <unk> Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white . It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 after which it was carried in state to St. Paul 's Cathedral . The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent . It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959 . The British Union Flag incorporates the flags of Scotland , Ireland and England , but has no Welsh representation . Technically Wales is represented by the flag of England , as the Laws in Wales Act of 1535 annexed Wales to England , following the 13th @-@ century conquest . 
 The daffodil and the leek are also symbols of Wales . The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century , while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century , encouraged by David Lloyd @-@ George . This is attributed to confusion ( or association ) between the Welsh for leek , <unk> , and that for daffodil , <unk> <unk> or St. Peter 's leek . A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek , which has appeared on British pound coins . 
 The Prince of Wales ' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales . The badge , known as the Prince of Wales 's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet . A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien ( I serve ) . Several Welsh representative teams , including the Welsh rugby union , and Welsh regiments in the British Army ( the Royal Welsh , for example ) use the badge , or a stylised version of it . The Prince of Wales has claimed that only he has the authority to use the symbol . 
 " Hen Wlad fy Nhadau " ( English : Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales , and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Welsh Assembly and other official occasions . " God Save the Queen " , the national anthem of the United Kingdom , is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection .

 More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales . Most of those involved in competitive sports select , organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries . Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympics Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland , England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team . 
 Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness . The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions : Scarlets ; Cardiff Blues ; Newport Gwent Dragons ; and the Ospreys . The Welsh regional teams play in the Magners League , the Anglo @-@ Welsh Cup ( LV Cup ) , the European Heineken Cup and the European ( <unk> ) Challenge Cup . 
 Wales has had its own football league , the Welsh Premier League , since 1992 . For historical reasons , six Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham , Colwyn Bay and Merthyr Town . Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs and Gareth Bale . 
 In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team , administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) , called the England cricket team , or simply ' England ' . Occasionally , a separate Wales team play limited @-@ overs competitions . Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship . 
 Wales has produced several world @-@ class participants of individual sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage , including the 110 @-@ metre hurdler Colin Jackson who is a former world record holder and the winner of numerous Olympic , World and European medals as well as Tanni Grey @-@ Thompson who has won 11 Paralympic gold medals . Wales also has a tradition of producing world @-@ class boxers .

 About 78 % of the land surface of Wales is given over to agricultural use . However , very little of this is arable land ; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows . Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely , especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire , Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking . 
 Traditional dishes include laverbread ( made from laver ( <unk> <unk> ) , an edible seaweed ) ; bara brith ( fruit bread ) ; cawl ( a lamb stew ) ; cawl <unk> ( leek soup ) ; Welsh cakes ; and Welsh lamb . Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread . 
 Although Wales has its own traditional food , and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England , Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country 's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway .

 Wales is often referred to as " the land of song " , and is notable for its harpists , male choirs , and solo artists . The principal Welsh festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod echoes the National Eisteddfod but provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform . Traditional music and dance in Wales is supported by a myriad of societies . The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes . 
 Traditional instruments of Wales include <unk> <unk> ( triple harp ) , fiddle , <unk> , <unk> ( hornpipe ) and other instruments . The <unk> <unk> Society promotes its specific singing art primarily through an annual one @-@ day festival . 
 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally . The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world . 
 Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers , including Sir Geraint Evans , Dame Gwyneth Jones , Dame Anne Evans , Dame Margaret Price , Sir Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Katherine Jenkins , Meic Stevens , Dame Shirley Bassey , Marina and the Diamonds and Duffy . 
 Popular bands that emerged from Wales include the Beatles @-@ nurtured power pop group Badfinger in the 1960s , Man and Budgie in the 1970s and the Alarm in the 1980s . Many groups emerged during the 1990s , led by Manic Street Preachers , followed by the likes of the Stereophonics and Feeder ; notable during this period were Catatonia , Super Furry Animals , and Gorky 's <unk> <unk> who gained popular success as dual @-@ language artists . Recently successful Welsh bands include Lostprophets , Bullet for My Valentine , Funeral for a Friend and Kids in Glass Houses . The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers and bands such as Carreg <unk> , Fernhill , Siân James and the <unk> . 
 Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century and continue today . Originally these choirs where formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs , and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day . Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales , singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs . 
 = = = = Drama = = = = 
 The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri <unk> o <unk> ( " The three Kings from Cologne " ) and Y <unk> a 'r <unk> ( " The Passion and the Resurrection " ) . A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century , in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets . The larger Welsh towns began building theatres during the 19th century , and attracted the likes of James Sheridan Knowles and William Charles Macready to Wales . Along with the playhouses , there existed mobile companies at visiting fairs , though from 1912 most of these travelling theatres settled , purchasing theatres to perform in . 
 Drama in the early 20th century thrived , but the country failed to produce a Welsh National Theatre company . After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two thirds . The increasing competition from television in the 1950s and 1960s led to a need for greater professionalism in the theatre . As a result , plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged , while Welsh actors , including Richard Burton , Rachel Roberts , Donald Houston and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents . Anthony Hopkins was an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , and has since starred in Hollywood films . Other Welsh actors to have crossed the Atlantic more recently include : Ioan Gruffudd ; Rhys Ifans ; Matthew Rhys ; Michael Sheen ; and Catherine Zeta @-@ Jones .

 Dancing is a popular pastime in Wales ; traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th @-@ century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out ; this is attributed to the influence of Nonconformists and their belief that any physical diversion was worthless and satanic , especially mixed dancing . These ancient dances , orally passed down , were almost single @-@ handedly rescued by Lois Blake ( 1890 – 1974 ) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets , recording both steps and music . In a similar vein , clog dancing was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood ( 1882 – 1967 ) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages . Clog dancing , traditionally a male dominated art , is now a common part of eisteddfodau . In 2010 , a 30 @-@ year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end due to a lack of participants , though clog dancing has seen a revival in the 21st century . 
 The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949 ; it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material . Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s ; one of the earliest companies , Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973 . Diversions was formed in 1983 , eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre . Conversely , Wales does not have its own national ballet company . 
 = = = Festivals = = = 
 As well as celebrating many of the traditional religious festivals of Great Britain , such as Easter and Christmas , Wales has its own unique celebratory days . An early festivity was <unk> , when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church . This celebration died out in the 19th century , to be replaced by Saint David 's Day , which is celebrated on 1 March throughout Wales , and by Welsh <unk> around the world . 
 Commemorating the patron saint of friendship and love , <unk> <unk> Dwynwen 's popularity has been increasing recently . It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine 's Day : by exchanging cards and by holding parties and concerts . 
 Calan <unk> , associated with the supernatural and the dead , is observed on 1 November ( All Saints Day ) . It has largely been replaced by Hallowe 'en . Other festivities include Calan Mai ( May Day ) , celebrating the beginning of summer ; Calan <unk> ( Lammas Day ) ; and Gŵyl Fair y <unk> ( Candlemas Day ) . 
 = Caesium fluoride = 
 Caesium fluoride or cesium fluoride is an inorganic compound usually encountered as a hygroscopic white solid . It is used in organic synthesis as a source of the fluoride anion . Caesium has the highest electropositivity of all non @-@ radioactive elements and fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements . 
 = = Synthesis and properties = = 
 Caesium fluoride can be prepared by the reaction of caesium hydroxide ( CsOH ) with hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) . The resulting salt can then be purified by recrystallization . The reaction is shown below : 
 CsOH ( aq ) + HF ( aq ) → CsF ( aq ) + H2O ( l ) 
 Another way to make caesium fluoride is to react caesium carbonate ( <unk> ) with hydrofluoric acid . The resulting salt can then be purified by recrystallization . The reaction is shown below : 
 <unk> ( aq ) + 2 HF ( aq ) → 2 CsF ( aq ) + H2O ( l ) + CO2 ( g ) 
 In addition , elemental fluorine and caesium can be used to form caesium fluoride as well , but doing so is very impractical because of the expense . While this is not a normal route of preparation , caesium metal reacts vigorously with all the halogens to form caesium halides . Thus , it burns with fluorine gas , F2 , to form caesium fluoride , CsF according to the following reaction : 
 2 Cs ( s ) + F2 ( g ) → 2 CsF ( s ) 
 CsF is more soluble than sodium fluoride or potassium fluoride . It is available in anhydrous form , and if water has been absorbed it is easy to dry by heating at 100 ° C for two hours in vacuo . CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 <unk> at 825 ° C , 10 kPa at 999 ° C , and 100 kPa at 1249 ° C. 
 CsF chains with a thickness as small as one or two atoms can be grown inside carbon nanotubes . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Caesium fluoride has the halite structure , which means that the Cs + and F − pack in a cubic closest packed array as do Na + and Cl − in sodium chloride . 
 = = Applications in organic synthesis = = 
 Being highly dissociated it is a more reactive source of fluoride than related salts . CsF is less hygroscopic alternative to tetra @-@ n @-@ <unk> fluoride ( <unk> ) and TAS @-@ fluoride ( <unk> ) when anhydrous " naked " fluoride ion is needed . 
 = = = As a base = = = 
 As with other soluble fluorides , CsF is moderately basic , because HF is a weak acid . The low nucleophilicity of fluoride means it can be a useful base in organic chemistry . CsF gives higher yields in Knoevenagel condensation reactions than KF or NaF . 
 = = = Formation of C @-@ F bonds = = = 
 Caesium fluoride is also a popular source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry . For example , CsF reacts with <unk> to form a caesium <unk> salt , which is stable up to 60 ° C , unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt . It will convert electron @-@ deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides ( <unk> reaction ) . 
 = = = <unk> agent = = = 
 Due to the strength of the Si – F bond , fluoride ion is useful for <unk> reactions ( removal of Si groups ) in organic chemistry ; caesium fluoride is an excellent source of anhydrous fluoride for such reactions . Removal of silicon groups ( <unk> ) is a major application for CsF in the laboratory , as its anhydrous nature allows clean formation of water @-@ sensitive intermediates . Solutions of caesium fluoride in THF or <unk> attack a wide variety of organosilicon compounds to produce an organosilicon fluoride and a carbanion , which can then react with electrophiles , for example : 
 <unk> is also useful for the removal of silyl protecting groups . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Single crystals of the salt are transparent into the deep infrared . For this reason it is sometimes used as the windows of cells used for infrared spectroscopy . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Like other soluble fluorides , CsF is moderately toxic . Contact with acid should be avoided , as this forms highly toxic / corrosive hydrofluoric acid . The caesium ion ( Cs + ) and caesium chloride are generally not considered toxic . 
 = Guy de Beauchamp , 10th Earl of Warwick = 
 Guy de Beauchamp , 10th Earl of Warwick ( c . 1272 – 12 August 1315 ) was an English magnate , and one of the principal opponents of King Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston . Guy de Beauchamp was the son of William de Beauchamp , the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick , and succeeded his father in 1298 . He distinguished himself at the Battle of Falkirk and subsequently , as a capable servant of the crown under King Edward I. After the succession of Edward II in 1307 , however , he soon fell out with the new king and the king 's favourite Piers Gaveston . Warwick was one of the main architects behind the Ordinances of 1311 , that limited the powers of the king and banished Gaveston into exile . 
 When Gaveston returned to England in 1312 – contrary to the rulings of the Ordinances – he was taken into custody by the Aymer de Valence , 2nd Earl of Pembroke . Warwick abducted Gaveston and , together with the Thomas , 2nd Earl of Lancaster , had him executed . The act garnered sympathy and support for the king , but Warwick and Lancaster nevertheless managed to negotiate a royal pardon for their actions . After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 , King Edward 's authority was once more weakened , and the rebellious barons took over control of government . For Warwick the triumph was brief ; he died the next year . 
 Guy de Beauchamp is today remembered primarily for his part in the killing of Gaveston , but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning . He owned what was for his time a large collection of books , and his advice was often sought by many of the other earls . Next to Lancaster , he was the wealthiest peer in the nation , and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son , Thomas de Beauchamp , 11th Earl of Warwick . 
 = = Family background = = 
 Guy de Beauchamp was the first son and heir of William de Beauchamp , 9th Earl of Warwick , ( c . 1238 – 1298 ) . His mother was Maud FitzJohn , daughter of John fitz Geoffrey , who was Justiciar of Ireland and a member of the council of fifteen that imposed the Provisions of Oxford on King Henry III . William was the nephew of William Maudit , 8th Earl of Warwick , and when his uncle died without issue in 1268 , he became the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick . In 1271 or 1272 his first son was born , and in reference to the new family title , William named his son after the legendary hero Guy of Warwick . William de Beauchamp was a capable military commander , who played an important part in the Welsh and Scottish wars of King Edward I. 
 A marriage between Guy and Isabel de Clare , daughter of Gilbert de Clare , 6th Earl of Hertford , was contemplated , or possibly even took place and then annulled . It was not until early 1309 that Guy married Alice de <unk> , a wealthy Hertfordshire heiress . By this time Guy had already succeeded as Earl of Warwick , after his father 's death in 1298 . By Alice , Guy had two sons , including his heir and successor , Thomas , and five daughters : 
 Maud de Beauchamp ( died 1366 ) ; married Geoffrey de Say , 2nd Lord Say , by whom she had issue . 
 Isabella de Beauchamp ; married John Clinton . 
 Emma de Beauchamp ; married Rowland Odingsells . 
 Thomas de Beauchamp , 11th Earl of Warwick ( 14 February 1313 / 1314 – 13 November 1369 ) , married Katherine Mortimer , by whom he had fifteen children . 
 Lucia de Beauchamp ; married Robert de <unk> . 
 John de Beauchamp , Lord Beauchamp KG ( 1315 – 2 December 1360 ) ; carried the royal standard at the Battle of <unk> . 
 Elizabeth de Beauchamp ( c . 1316 – 1359 ) ; married in 1328 Thomas Astley , 3rd Lord Astley , by whom she had a son , William Astley , 4th Lord Astley . 
 = = Service to Edward I = = 
 Edward I knighted Guy de Beauchamp at Easter 1296 . Warwick 's career of public service started with the Falkirk campaign in 1298 . Here he distinguished himself , and received a reward of Scottish lands worth 1000 marks a year . At this point his father was already dead , but it was not until 5 September that Guy did homage to the king for his lands , and became Earl of Warwick and hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire for life . He continued in the king 's service in Scotland and elsewhere . In 1299 he was present at the king 's wedding to Margaret of France at Canterbury , and in 1300 he took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock . The next year he was a signatory to a letter to the Pope , rejecting Rome 's authority over the Scottish question , and also participated in negotiations with the French over the release of the Scottish King John Balliol . He was present at the Siege of Stirling in 1304 , serving under Edward , the Prince of Wales . In March 1307 he made preparations to accompany Prince Edward to France , but this journey never took place . 
 Early in 1307 , Edward I made his last grant to Warwick , when he gave him John Balliol 's forfeited lordship of Barnard Castle in County Durham . On 7 July that year , near Burgh by Sands in Cumberland , Warwick was present when King Edward died . Together with Thomas , Earl of Lancaster , and Henry de Lacy , Earl of Lincoln , he carried the ceremonial swords at the coronation of King Edward II on 25 February 1308 . 
 = = Conflict with Edward II = = 
 Before his death , the old king had exiled Prince Edward 's favourite Piers Gaveston , and Warwick was among those charged with preventing Gaveston 's return . The new king , however , not only recalled his favourite , but soon also gave him the title of earl of Cornwall . Warwick was the only one of the leading earls who did not seal the charter , and from the start took on an antagonistic attitude to Edward II . Gaveston was a relative upstart in the English aristocracy , and made himself unpopular among the established nobility by his arrogance and his undue influence on the king . He gave mocking nicknames to the leading men of the realm , and called Warwick the " Black Dog of Arden " . 
 Gaveston was once more forced into exile , but Edward recalled him in less than a year . The king had spent the intervening time gathering support , and at the time , the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick . With time , however , opposition to the king grew . Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father 's Scottish campaigns , a policy that opened the Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots . This affected Warwick greatly , with his extensive landed interest in the north . Tensions grew to the point where the king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms . They still did , and at the parliament of March 1310 , the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government . 
 The leaders of these so @-@ called Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey , Archbishop of Canterbury , on the side of the clergy , and Warwick , Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls . Henry de Lacy , Earl of Lincoln , was the most experienced of the earls , and took on a modifying role in the group . Thomas of Lancaster , who was Lincoln 's son @-@ in @-@ law and heir , was the king 's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm , but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement . Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers ; he was certainly the most aggressive . The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king 's financial freedom , and his right to appoint his own ministers . It also – once more – ordered Gaveston to be exiled , to return only at the risk of excommunication . 
 = = Gaveston 's death = = 
 Gaveston 's third and final exile was of even shorter duration , and after two months he was reunited with Edward in England . Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston , as the Ordinances had stipulated . Lancaster , who had by this time inherited his father @-@ in @-@ law Lincoln , had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition . A number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston while the king left for York . Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle , and on 19 May 1312 agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence , Earl of Pembroke , as long as his security would be guaranteed . 
 Pembroke lodged his prisoner in Deddington in Oxfordshire . On 10 June , while Pembroke was away , Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle . Here , in the presence of Warwick , Lancaster and other magnates , Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court . On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hill – on Lancaster 's lands – and decapitated . According to the Annales <unk> chronicle , four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick , but he refused to accept it , and ordered them to take it back to where they found it . Gaveston 's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars , and in 1315 , King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley . 
 The brutality and questionable legality of the earls ' act helped garner sympathy for the king in the political community . Pembroke was particularly offended , as he had been made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston , and his chivalric honour had been damaged . From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict . The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies , but found himself unable to move against them immediately , partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston . A settlement was reached in October , whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon . The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events , while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised . This all changed in 1314 , when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots . Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate in the campaign , which ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June . This led to another political <unk> , and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances , and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons . 
 = = Death and historical assessment = = 
 In mid @-@ July Warwick had to withdraw from government to his estates , due to illness . Political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster , when Warwick died on 12 August 1315 . The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had him poisoned . He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire , an establishment to which his family had served as benefactors . In value , his possessions were second only to those of the earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England . His lands , though primarily centred on Warwickshire and Worcestershire , were spread out over nineteen counties as well as Scotland and the Welsh Marches . His heir was his oldest son , whom he had named Thomas after the earl of Lancaster . Thomas , born probably on 14 February 1314 , did not succeed to his father 's title until 1326 , as Thomas de Beauchamp , 11th Earl of Warwick . In the meanwhile his possessions went into the king 's hand , who donated his hunting dogs to the earl of Pembroke . A younger son , named John , also became a peer , as John de Beauchamp , 1st Baron Beauchamp . Like his older brother , he distinguished himself in the French wars , and was a founding member of the Order of the Garter . 
 Guy de Beauchamp is probably best remembered by posterity for his opposition to King Edward II , and for his part in the death of Gaveston . To contemporaries , however , he was considered a man of considerable learning and wisdom . His library , of which he donated 42 books to Bordesley Abbey during his lifetime , was extensive . It contained several saints ' lives as well as romances about Alexander and King Arthur . As mentioned , Edward I entrusted the supervision of his son with Warwick . Likewise , when the earl of Lincoln died in 1311 , he supposedly instructed his son @-@ in @-@ law Thomas of Lancaster to heed the advice of Warwick , " the wisest of the peers " . Chronicles also praised Warwick 's wisdom ; the Vita Edwardi Secundi said that " Other earls did many things only after taking his opinion : in wisdom and council he had no peer " . Later historians have reflected this view , in the 19th century William Stubbs called Warwick " a discriminating and highly literate man , the wisdom of whom shone forth through the whole kingdom " . He was politically and economically well connected by traditional ties of kinship and marriage . 
 Warwick 's death came at an inconvenient time ; Thomas of Lancaster proved unequal to the task of governing the nation , and further years of conflict and instability followed . Nevertheless , the problems of Edward II 's reign were deep , and in the words of Michael Hicks : " one must doubt whether even Warwick could have brought unity as one chronicler supposed " . 
 = Le Règne Animal = 
 Le Règne Animal ( The Animal Kingdom ) is the most famous work of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier . It sets out to describe the natural structure of the whole of the animal kingdom based on comparative anatomy , and its natural history . 
 The work appeared in four octavo volumes in 1817 ; a second edition in five volumes was brought out in 1829 – 1830 and a third , written by twelve " disciples " of Cuvier , in 1836 – 1849 . In this classic work , Cuvier presented the results of his life 's research into the structure of living and fossil animals . With the exception of the section on insects , in which he was assisted by his friend Pierre André Latreille , the whole of the work was his own . It was translated into English many times , often with substantial notes and supplementary material updating the book in accordance with the expansion of knowledge . It was also translated into German , Italian and other languages , and abridged in versions for children . 
 Le Règne Animal was influential in being widely read , and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals , such as the living elephants and the extinct mammoths , providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including Charles Darwin , although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution . 
 = = Context = = 
 As a boy , Georges Cuvier ( 1769 @-@ 1832 ) read the Comte de Buffon 's Histoire Naturelle from the previous century , as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius . He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire in 1795 , not long after the French Revolution . He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d 'Histoire Naturelle , surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy . Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method . He demonstrated that animals had become extinct . 
 In an earlier attempt to improve the classification of animals , Cuvier transferred the concepts of Antoine @-@ Laurent de Jussieu 's ( 1748 @-@ 1836 ) method of natural classification , which had been presented in 1789 in Genera plantarum , from botany to zoology . In 1795 , from a " <unk> " perspective ( denying the possibility of evolution ) , Cuvier divided Linnaeus 's two unsatisfactory classes ( " insects " and " worms " ) into six classes of " white @-@ blooded animals " or invertebrates : molluscs , crustaceans , insects and worms ( differently understood ) , echinoderms and zoophytes . Cuvier divided the molluscs into three orders : cephalopods , gastropods and <unk> . Still not satisfied , he continued to work on animal classification , culminating over twenty years later in the Règne Animal . 
 For the Règne Animal , using evidence from comparative anatomy and palaeontology — including his own observations — Cuvier divided the animal kingdom into four principal body plans . Taking the central nervous system as an animal 's principal organ system which controlled all the other organ systems such as the circulatory and digestive systems , Cuvier distinguished four types of organisation of an animal 's body : 
 I. with a brain and a spinal cord ( surrounded by parts of the skeleton ) 
 II. with organs linked by nerve fibres 
 III. with two longitudinal , ventral nerve cords linked by a band with two ganglia positioned below the oesophagus 
 IV. with a diffuse nervous system which is not clearly discernible 
 Grouping animals with these body plans resulted in four " <unk> " or branches ( vertebrates , molluscs , the <unk> that he claimed were natural ( arguing that insects and annelid worms were related ) and zoophytes ( radiata ) ) . This effectively broke with the mediaeval notion of the continuity of the living world in the form of the great chain of being . It also set him in opposition to both Saint @-@ Hilaire and Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck . Lamarck claimed that species could transform through the influence of the environment , while Saint @-@ Hilaire argued in 1820 that two of Cuvier 's branches , the molluscs and radiata , could be united via various features , while the other two , <unk> and vertebrates , similarly had parallels with each other . Then in 1830 , Saint @-@ Hilaire argued that these two groups could themselves be related , implying a single form of life from which all others could have evolved , and that Cuvier 's four body plans were not fundamental .

 The twelve " disciples " who contributed to the 3rd edition were Jean Victor Audouin ( insects ) , Gerard Paul <unk> ( molluscs ) , Alcide d 'Orbigny ( birds ) , Antoine Louis <unk> ( arachnids ) , Georges Louis Duvernoy ( reptiles ) , Charles Léopold <unk> ( mammals in part ) , Henri Milne Edwards ( crustaceans , annelids , zoophytes , and mammals in part ) , Francois Desire Roulin ( mammals in part ) , Achille Valenciennes ( fishes ) , Louis Michel Français <unk> ( insects ) , Charles Émile Blanchard ( insects , zoophytes ) and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de <unk> ( annelids , arachnids etc . ) . 
 The work was illustrated with tables and plates ( at the end of Volume IV ) covering only some of the species mentioned . A much larger set of illustrations , said by Cuvier to be " as accurate as they were elegant " was published by the entomologist Félix Édouard Guérin @-@ Méneville in his <unk> du Règne Animal de G. Cuvier , the nine volumes appearing between 1829 and 1844 .

 Le Règne Animal was translated into languages including English , German and Italian . 
 Many English translations and abridged versions were published and reprinted in the nineteenth century ; records may be for the entire work or individual volumes , which were not necessarily dated , while old translations were often brought out in " new " editions by other publishers , making for a complex publication history . A translation was made by John Edward Gray and published by Whittaker , Treacher and Co. in 1824 ; another by Edward Griffith and others was published by G. B. Whittaker in 1827 – 1832 and many times reprinted ( up to 2012 and eBook format ) ; another by Henry <unk> was published by G. Henderson in 1834 – 1837 . A translation was made and published by the ornithologist William MacGillivray in Edinburgh in 1839 – 1840 . Another version by Edward Blyth and others was published by William S. Orr and Co. in 1840 . An abridged version by an " experienced teacher " was published by Longman , Brown , Green and Longman in London , and by Stephen Knapp in Coventry , in 1844 . Kraus published an edition in New York in 1969 . Other editions were brought out by H.G. Bohn in 1851 and W. Orr in 1854 . An " easy introduction to the study of the animal kingdom : according to the natural method of Cuvier " , together with examination questions on each chapter , was made by Annie Roberts and published in the 1850s by Thomas <unk> .

 = = = Approach = = = 
 Each section , such as on reptiles at the start of Volume II ( and the entire work ) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology . In the case of the reptiles , the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs ; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement , next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds , and that none of them incubate their eggs . 
 Next , Cuvier identifies the taxonomic divisions of the group , in this case four orders of reptiles , the <unk> ( tortoises and turtles ) , <unk> ( lizards ) , <unk> ( snakes ) and <unk> ( amphibians , now considered a separate class of vertebrates ) , describing each group in a single sentence . Thus the <unk> are said to have a heart with a single atrium , a naked body ( with no scales ) , and to pass with age from being fish @-@ like to being like a quadruped or biped . 
 There is then a section heading , in this case " The first order of Reptiles , or The <unk> " , followed by a three @-@ page essay on their zoology , starting with the fact that their hearts have two atria . The structure then repeats at a lower taxonomic level , with what Cuvier notes is one of Linnaeus 's genera , Testudo , the tortoises , with five sub @-@ genera . The first sub @-@ genus comprises the land tortoises ; their zoology is summed up in a paragraph , which observes that they have a domed carapace , with a solid bony support ( the term being " <unk> " , commonly used of the structure of wooden beams that support a roof ) . He records that the legs are thick , with short digits joined for most of their length , five toenails on the forelegs , four on the hind legs . 
 Then ( on the ninth page ) he arrives at the first species in the volume , the Greek tortoise , Testudo graeca . It is summed up in a paragraph , Cuvier noting that it is the commonest tortoise in Europe , living in Greece , Italy , Sardinia and ( he writes ) apparently all round the Mediterranean . He then gives its distinguishing marks , with a highly domed carapace , raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling , and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail . He gives its size — rarely reaching a foot in length ; notes that it lives on leaves , fruit , insects and worms ; digs a hole in which to pass the winter ; mates in spring , and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon . The species is illustrated with two plates .

 The entomologist William Sharp Macleay , in his 1821 book Horae <unk> which put forward the short @-@ lived " <unk> " system of classification into 5 groups , each of 5 subgroups , etc . , asserted that in the Règne Animal " Cuvier was notoriously deficient in the power of legitimate and intuitive generalization in arranging the animal series " . The zoologist William John Swainson , also a <unk> , added that " no person of such transcendent talents and ingenuity , ever made so little use of his observations towards a natural arrangement as M. Cuvier . " 
 The Magazine of Natural History of 1829 expressed surprise at the long interval between the first and second editions , surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France , apart from those in Paris itself ; it notes that while the first volume was little changed , the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II , while the section on the Articulata was greatly enlarged ( to two volumes , IV and V ) and written by M. Latreille . It also expressed the hope that there would be an English equivalent of Cuvier 's work , given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of Thomas Bewick ( A History of British Birds 1797 – 1804 ) and George Montagu ( Ornithological Dictionary , 1802 ) . The same review covers Félix Édouard Guérin @-@ Méneville 's <unk> du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier , which offered illustrations of all Cuvier 's genera ( except for the birds ) . 
 The Foreign Review of 1830 broadly admired Cuvier 's work , but disagreed with his classification . It commented that " From the comprehensive nature of the Règne Animal , embracing equally the structure and history of all the existing and extinct races of animals , this work may be viewed as an epitome of M. Cuvier 's zoological labours ; and it presents the best outline , which exists in any language , of the present state of zoology and comparative anatomy . " The review continued less favourably , however , that " We cannot help thinking that the science of comparative anatomy is now so far advanced , as to afford the means of distributing the animal kingdom on some more uniform and philosophical principles , — as on the modifications of those systems or functions which are most general in the animal economy " . The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column , " a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy " ; it found the basis of the <unk> on " the general softness of the body " no better ; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either , in the third division ; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme , it did not apply " to the <unk> , <unk> , and infusoria , which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division . " But the review notes that " the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M. Cuvier in this work , are founded on a more extensive and minute survey of the organization than had ever before been taken , and many of the most important distinctions among the orders and families are the result of his own researches . " 
 Writing in the Monthly Review of 1834 , the pre @-@ Darwinian evolutionist surgeon Sir William Lawrence commented that " the <unk> Animal of Cuvier is , in short , an abridged expression of the entire science . He carried the lights derived from his zoological researches into kindred but obscure parts of nature . " Lawrence calls the work " an arrangement of the animal kingdom nearly approaching to perfection ; grounded on principles so accurate , that the place which any animal occupies in this scheme , already indicates the leading circumstances in its structure , economy , and habits . " 
 The book was in the library of HMS Beagle for Charles Darwin 's voyage . In The Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , in a chapter on the difficulties facing the theory , Darwin comments that " The expression of conditions of existence , so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier , is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection . " Darwin continues , reflecting both on Cuvier 's emphasis on the conditions of existence , and Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck 's theory of acquiring heritable characteristics from those <unk> conditions : " For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life ; or by having adapted them during long @-@ past periods of time : the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse , being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life , and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth . Hence , in fact , the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law ; as it includes , through the inheritance of former adaptations , that of Unity of Type . "

 The palaeontologist Philippe Taquet wrote that " the Règne Animal was an attempt to create a complete inventory of the animal kingdom and to formulate a natural classification underpinned by the principles of the ' correlation of parts ' .. " He adds that with the book " Cuvier introduced clarity into natural history , accurately reproducing the actual ordering of animals . " Taquet further notes that while Cuvier rejected evolution , it was paradoxically " the precision of his anatomical descriptions and the importance of his research on fossil bones " , showing for instance that mammoths were extinct elephants , that enabled later naturalists including Darwin to argue convincingly that animals had evolved . 
 = USAHS Blanche F. Sigman = 
 USAHS Blanche F. Sigman was a United States Army hospital ship during World War II . The ship was completed in April 1943 as Liberty ship SS Stanford White . When selected for conversion to a hospital ship , she was originally assigned the name USAHS Poppy , but never operated under that name . After being decommissioned as a hospital ship , she became U.S. Army transport USAT Blanche F. Sigman . 
 SS Stanford White , named in honor of American architect Stanford White , was built by California Shipbuilding Corporation of Los Angeles for the United States Maritime Commission in early 1943 . Laid down in March 1943 and launched the following month , the ship was assigned to United States Lines , Inc. for merchant operation by the War Shipping Administration ( WSA ) . Stanford White made her way from California to New York and from that port made one transatlantic round trip to Liverpool . 
 In November 1943 , the WSA allocated the ship to the U.S. Army , which converted her to a hospital ship . Though initially assigned the name Poppy , she was instead named in honor of First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman , a U.S. Army nurse killed in action in Italy . The hospital ship was initially based in Charleston , South Carolina , and made multiple voyages to ports in England , the Mediterranean , and France . After her homeport was changed to New York in December 1945 , she made several more runs to Europe as a hospital ship , then converted to USAT Blanche F. Sigman in April 1946 . As a transport , the ship made numerous trips bringing home nurses and military personnel prior to entering the National Defense Reserve Fleet in 1948 . The ship was declared surplus by the Army in 1949 , and sold for scrapping in 1974 . 
 = = Liberty ship = = 
 Stanford White ( MC Hull No. 738 ) was laid down on 9 March 1943 on ship way 7 at California Shipbuilding Corp. ( <unk> ) of Los Angeles as a standard Liberty ship . The ship was launched on Monday , 5 April 1943 ( the same day as another <unk> @-@ built Liberty , Benjamin Cardozo ) , and delivered 17 April 1943 , taking 39 days from start to delivery . The ship was initially to be launched on Saturday , 3 April , but had suffered minor damage from a fire the day before . 
 Though it is not known where Stanford White spent the first five months of her merchant career , she spent the last two in the Atlantic . She sailed from Galveston , Texas on 12 September 1943 and arrived in Key West on 16 September . The ship departed the same day for New York and arrived there on 22 September . On 28 September the ship , carrying a general cargo , joined a convoy headed to Liverpool , where it arrived on 13 October . Five days later , the Stanford White set out for New York , arriving back there on 4 November . 
 = = Hospital ship = = 
 In late November 1943 the ship was transferred by the WSA to the War Department for operation as a Hague Convention hospital ship by the U.S. Army . The ship put into the Todd Hoboken Shipyard at the Port of New York for conversion , remaining there until completion on 30 June 1944 . The ship was initially assigned the name Poppy , under the then @-@ current policy of naming Army hospital ships after flowers , but never operated under that name . The ship was instead named after First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman , a U.S. Army nurse killed in action on 7 February 1944 on the beachhead during Operation Shingle , the Allied landings at Anzio . 
 After sailing for the Clyde and back to New York in July on its first mercy mission , Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944 . Sailing later that month , the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool . In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar , Oran , and Leghorn . In December , it repeated its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well , eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945 . Throughout 1945 , the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks , visiting Marseille three times , Naples , Oran , Gibraltar , Milford Haven , Wales , Avonmouth , Cherbourg , and Horta . The Sigman 's sixth mission of the year was a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York . 
 From New York , Blanche F. Sigman made three sojourns , calling at Cherbourg for a third time , Bremerhaven three times , The Downs , and Le Havre . While in Europe during the third trip , the ship was decommissioned as a hospital ship in April 1946 and returned to New York with a load of Army and Red Cross nurses , and members of the Women 's Army Corps . Throughout 1947 and into 1948 , the Sigman made numerous trips for the Army , primarily between Bremerhaven and New York . 
 On 22 November 1948 , Blanche F. Sigman entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet ( <unk> ) at the James River in Virginia . Loaded with permanent ballast of 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of pig iron and 490 long tons ( 500 t ) of concrete blocks , the former hospital ship sat in mothballs for 25 years before being offered for disposal in late 1973 . The ship was awarded to Max Wender for scrapping on 23 January 1974 for $ 145 @,@ 115 , and was withdrawn from the <unk> and delivered to Wender on 17 May 1974 . 
 = Alpha Andromedae = 
 Alpha Andromedae ( Alpha And , α And , α Andromedae ) , which has the traditional names Alpheratz ( or <unk> from the Arabic word <unk> ) and Sirrah ( or Sirah ) , is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda . Located immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus , it is the northeastern star of the Great Square of Pegasus . Ptolemy considered Alpha Andromedae to be shared by Pegasus , and Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations : Alpha Andromedae ( α And ) and Delta Pegasi ( δ Peg ) . When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930 , the latter designation dropped from use . 
 It is located 97 light @-@ years from Earth . Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star , with overall apparent visual magnitude + 2 @.@ 06 , it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit . The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury @-@ manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury , manganese , and other elements , including gallium and xenon . It is the brightest mercury @-@ manganese star known . 
 = = System = = 
 The radial velocity of a star away from or towards the observer can be determined by measuring the red shift or blue shift of its spectrum . The American astronomer Vesto Slipher made a series of such measurements from 1902 to 1904 and discovered that the radial velocity of α Andromedae varied periodically . He concluded that it was in orbit in a spectroscopic binary star system with a period of about 100 days . A preliminary orbit was published by Hans Ludendorff in 1907 , and a more precise orbit was later published by Robert Horace Baker . 
 The fainter star in the system was first resolved <unk> by <unk> Pan and his coworkers during 1988 and 1989 , using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory , California , United States . This work was published in 1992 . Because of the difference in luminosity between the two stars , its spectral lines were not observed until the early 1990s , in observations made by Jocelyn <unk> , <unk> Pan , and James K. McCarthy between 1991 and 1994 and published in 1995 . 
 The two stars are now known to orbit each other with a period of 96 @.@ 7 days . The larger , brighter star , called the primary , has a spectral type of <unk> , a mass of approximately 3 @.@ 6 solar masses , a surface temperature of about 13 @,@ 800 K , and , measured over all wavelengths , a luminosity of about 200 times the Sun 's . Its smaller , fainter companion , the secondary , has a mass of approximately 1 @.@ 8 solar masses and a surface temperature of about 8 @,@ 500 K , and , again measured over all wavelengths , a luminosity of about 10 times the Sun 's . It is an early @-@ type A star whose spectral type has been estimated as A3V . 
 = = = Chemical peculiarities = = = 
 In 1906 , Norman Lockyer and F. E. <unk> reported that α Andromedae had a number of unusual lines in its spectrum . In 1914 , <unk> pointed out that most of the unusual lines came from manganese , and that similar lines were present in the spectrum of μ <unk> . In 1931 , W. W. Morgan identified 12 additional stars with lines from manganese appearing in their spectra . Many of these stars were subsequently identified as part of the group of mercury @-@ manganese stars , a class of chemically peculiar stars which have an excess of elements such as mercury , manganese , phosphorus , and gallium in their atmospheres . , § 3 @.@ 4 . In the case of α Andromedae , the brighter primary star is a mercury @-@ manganese star which , as well as the elements already mentioned , has excess xenon . 
 In 1970 , Georges Michaud suggested that such chemically peculiar stars arose from radiative diffusion . According to this theory , in stars with unusually calm atmospheres , some elements sink under the force of gravity , while others are pushed to the surface by radiation pressure . , § 4 . This theory has successfully explained many observed chemical peculiarities , including those of mercury @-@ manganese stars . , § 4 . 
 = = = Variability of primary = = = 
 α Andromedae has been reported to be slightly variable , but observations from 1990 to 1994 found its brightness to be constant to within less than 0 @.@ 01 magnitude . However , Adelman and his co @-@ workers have discovered , in observations made between 1993 and 1999 and published in 2002 , that the mercury line in its spectrum at 398 @.@ 4 nm varies as the primary rotates . This is because the distribution of mercury in its atmosphere is not uniform . Applying Doppler imaging to the observations allowed Adelman et al. to find that it was concentrated in clouds near the equator . Subsequent Doppler imaging studies , published in 2007 , showed that these clouds drift slowly over the star 's surface . 
 = = Etymology and cultural significance = = 
 The names Alpheratz and Sirrah both derive from the Arabic name , <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ <unk> " the navel of the mare " . ( <unk> alone is <unk> . ) The word horse reflects the star 's historical placement in Pegasus . Another term for this star used by medieval astronomers writing in Arabic was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ mar 'a al @-@ <unk> " the head of the woman in chains " , the chained woman here being Andromeda . Other Arabic names include al @-@ kaff al @-@ <unk> and kaff al @-@ <unk> . 
 In the Hindu lunar zodiac , this star , together with the other stars in the Great Square of Pegasus ( α , β , and γ Pegasi ) , makes up the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and Uttara <unk> . 
 In Chinese , <unk> ( Bì <unk> ) , meaning wall , refers to an asterism consisting of α Andromedae and γ Pegasi . Consequently , α Andromedae itself is known as <unk> ( Bì <unk> <unk> , English : the second star of the wall . ) 
 It is also known as one of the " Three Guides " that mark the prime meridian of the heavens , the other two being Beta Cassiopeiae and Gamma Pegasi . It was believed to bless those born under its influence with honour and riches .

 The location of α Andromedae in the sky is shown on the left . It can be seen by the naked eye and is theoretically visible at all latitudes north of 60 ° S. During evening from August to October , it will be high in the sky as seen from the northern midlatitudes .

 The binary system described above has an optical visual companion , discovered by William Herschel on July 21 , 1781 .

Although by coincidence it appears near to the other two stars in the sky , it is not close to them in space . 
 = Saint Croix macaw = 
 The Saint Croix macaw ( Ara <unk> ) is an extinct species of parrot . The last populations lived on the Caribbean islands Saint Croix and Puerto Rico . It was originally described by Alexander Wetmore in 1937 based on a subfossil limb bone unearthed by L. J. Korn in 1934 from a kitchen midden at an Amerindian archeological site on Saint Croix . A second specimen was described by Storrs L. Olson and Edgar J. Máiz López based on various limb and shoulder bones excavated from a similar site on Puerto Rico , while a possible third specimen from Montserrat has been reported . The species is one of two medium @-@ sized macaws of the Caribbean , the other being the smaller Cuban red macaw ( Ara tricolor ) . Its bones are distinct from Amazon parrots as well as from the other medium @-@ sized but geographically distant Lear 's macaw ( Anodorhynchus <unk> ) and blue @-@ throated macaw ( Ara <unk> ) . The natural range is unknown because parrots were regularly traded between islands by indigenous people . Like other parrot species in the Caribbean , the extinction of the Saint Croix macaw is believed to be linked to the arrival of humans in the region . 
 = = Name and etymology = = 
 Alexander Wetmore named the species <unk> . An alternative incorrect spelling is autochthones , which comes from the Ancient Greek word <unk> ( <unk> — autos " self " and <unk> — <unk> " earth " ) meaning " born of the earth " . <unk> of a name are termed as lapsus ( an accidental misspelling ) . An obvious error in the original publication containing the description of a species may be corrected by a later " emendation " with suitable justification . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Wetmore placed the Saint Croix macaw in the macaw genus Ara based on a single tibiotarsus , a placement confirmed by Olson who reexamined the bone . The discovery of a second specimen by Máiz López at Puerto Rico consisting of several bones confirmed this placement . The Saint Croix macaw is distinguished from other macaws because of the intermediate size of the tibiotarsus and carpometacarpus . Olson and Máiz López determined that the size of this species is only comparable to geographically distant macaws , namely the Lear 's macaw ( Anodorhynchus <unk> ) from Brazil and the blue @-@ throated macaw ( Ara <unk> ) from Bolivia . Their detailed analysis of these and the other bones showed distinct differences from those species , particularly from the genus Anodorhynchus . Based on this , authorities generally recognize the Saint Croix macaw as a valid species . 
 The Saint Croix macaw and the smaller Cuban red macaw ( Ara tricolor ) are the only two Caribbean macaw species that have been described based on physical remains . In addition , seven entirely hypothetical extinct macaw species from various Caribbean islands have been described based only on written accounts . Of the hypothetical species , the geographically nearest range is of the Lesser Antillean macaw ( Ara guadeloupensis ) from Guadeloupe . According to Wetmore , taxonomic affinities with these hypothetical extinct species are unknown . 
 = = Description = = 
 The subfossil left tibiotarsus ( holotype , USNM <unk> ) described by Wetmore was of an immature but full @-@ grown bird . Wetmore described the bone as similar to the tibiotarsus of Ara tricolor , with a larger transverse width , but more slender compared with larger macaws . The slender proportions of the bone and more elongated ridges about the proximal end distinguish the species from the Amazon parrots . 
 The bones found by Máiz López ( USNM <unk> ) include the left coracoid ( missing a portion of the bone 's head ) , the proximal and distal ends of the left humerus , the proximal end of the right radius , the left carpometacarpus ( missing one metacarpal ) , the left femur ( lacking the distal end ) , the right tibiotarsus ( lacking part of the proximal articular surface ) , and the proximal fragment and worn distal portion of the left tibiotarsus . 
 Olson and Máiz López examined the bones and showed that they differed from Amazon parrot bones . The tibiotarsus has a narrower internal condyle ( the round prominences at the end of a bone ) and a distinctive inner cnemial crest ( a ridge at the front side of the head ) that is more pointed and extends further proximally . The carpometacarpus is proportionally much longer with a process on the alular metacarpal that is not curved proximally . The femur has a proportionally larger head while the <unk> process ( a bony elevation ) and the attachment of pronator brevis ( one of the two pronation muscles in the wing ) on the humerus are more proximal . The elongated coracoid has a relatively narrow shaft and the ventral lip of the glenoid facet ( equivalent to the glenoid fossa of mammals ) is more protruded . 
 Olson and Máiz López showed that the Saint Croix macaw is within the same size range as the blue @-@ throated macaw and the Lear 's macaw . The length of the tibiotarsus is shorter than in the blue @-@ throated macaw but longer than in the Lear 's macaw , while the lengths of the coracoid , carpometacarpus , and femur are smaller . In addition to the size , they observed that the pectoral attachment on the humerus is less excavated while the capital groove ( a groove separating two parts of the head of the humerus ) is wider ; the head of the femur is more massive and when seen from the posterior side , more excavated under the head , neck , and trochanter . Furthermore , the more robust shaft of the femur sets it specifically apart from the Lear 's macaw while the tibiotarsus is more robust with a flared distal extremity . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Bones of the species have been excavated at two islands in the Caribbean , Saint Croix and Puerto Rico . The location at Saint Croix is a pre @-@ Columbian Amerindian village site near the current town of Concordia , near the Southwest Cape . The bones from Puerto Rico were excavated from an inland village of the Saladoid Indians that was located at the eastern bank of the Río <unk> , north @-@ east of the current city of Ponce . A possible third location is Montserrat , where a nearly complete coracoid was excavated ( UF <unk> ) . The bone of this specimen is slightly smaller than the bone of the Puerto Rico specimen , and could therefore be within the range of the Cuban red macaw ( Ara tricolor ) ; it has not been assigned to either species . 
 Although the species had only been found in St. Croix and Puerto Rico , in both cases it was recovered from Amerindian village sites . Williams and Steadman consider it possible that the species may have been native to St. Croix , but Olson and Máiz López regard this as unlikely , noting that parrots , important to the indigenous people , were likely to have been transported between islands . This makes it difficult to determine the natural geographical origins of the parrots known only from subfossil remains found in the West Indian region . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 The extinction of birds in the Caribbean occurred during three periods . The first period was linked to the sea @-@ level rise after the end of the last ice age . The second period of extinction is linked to the arrival of the Amerindians , while the third extinction period is linked to the arrival of the Europeans . Although the exact causes of the extinction of the Saint Croix macaw are unknown , it is likely related to arrival of the humans in the region . The presence of the bones in kitchen middens suggests that the species was hunted for food . The bones found by Máiz López are dated to about 300 CE , which implies that the extinction of the Saint Croix macaw occurred after that . 
 = = Archeological context = = 
 The species was originally described by Wetmore based on material excavated in 1934 by L. J. Korn from a pre @-@ Columbian Amerindian kitchen midden ( dump for domestic waste ) near Concordia , Saint Croix , without specifying the age of the bone . 
 In 1987 , Máiz López found several bones of a single bird at the Hernández Colón archeological site on the eastern bank of the Río <unk> in south central Puerto Rico The archeological side in the semi @-@ arid southern foothills is a pre @-@ Columbian Saladoid village of approximately 15 @,@ 000 m2 ( 3 @.@ 7 acres ) situated on an alluvial terrace . Máiz López found the bones in a kitchen midden in the layer that corresponded with the base and beginning of the <unk> phase , which is stylistically related to the Hacienda Grande ceramic style that lasted globally from about 200 BCE to 400 CE . Radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples indicate that the <unk> phase started locally around 300 CE . 
 = 1873 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1873 FA Cup final was a football match between Wanderers and Oxford University on 29 March 1873 at Lillie Bridge in London . It was the second final of the world 's oldest football competition , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( known in the modern era as the FA Cup ) . Unusually , the final was held in the morning , so as to avoid a clash with the annual Oxford @-@ Cambridge Boat Race which was held on the same day . Wanderers reached the final without playing a match , as the original rules of the competition stated that the holders would receive a bye straight to the final and other teams would compete to gain the other place in the final and challenge the holders for the trophy . Oxford reached the final when their semi @-@ final opponents , Queen 's Park , dropped out of the competition 
 Both teams had key players absent for the final , including several who had represented Wanderers in the previous year 's final . The best player on the day was Arthur Kinnaird , who scored the first goal for Wanderers . Charles Wollaston added a second goal towards the end of the match to give Wanderers a 2 – 0 victory and a second consecutive FA Cup win . It was the only Cup final prior to 1893 not played at The Oval . 
 = = Route to the final = = 
 As the previous year 's FA Cup winners , Wanderers received a bye straight to the final in the 1872 – 73 . This was in keeping with the original concept of the competition being a " challenge cup " , in which the holders would qualify directly for the following season 's final and teams would compete for the other place in the final and the right to challenge them for the trophy . This was the only time this rule was used . 
 In the first round Oxford University played Crystal Palace ( a different club to the modern club of the same name ) and won 3 – 2 at home . In the second round , they played an away match against Clapham Rovers , winning 3 – 0 . 
 In the third round Oxford University were paired with the previous season 's runners @-@ up , the Royal Engineers . Oxford won 1 – 0 and went on to play Maidenhead in the quarter @-@ finals . Due to other teams receiving byes , this was the only match at the quarter @-@ final stage , and for the third consecutive round Oxford emerged victorious without conceding a goal , winning 4 – 0 . In the semi @-@ finals , Oxford 's opponents were set to be the leading Scottish club , Queen 's Park , who had received a bye straight to the semi @-@ finals to reduce the amount of travelling required to compete in a competition in which all the other entrants were from the south of England . Queen 's , however , decided to withdraw from the competition , giving Oxford a bye into the final . One modern source states that the Scottish club actually beat Oxford but then could not afford to travel to London for the final so withdrew at that point .

 = = = Summary = = = 
 As the match was scheduled for the same day as the annual Oxford @-@ Cambridge boat race , the decision was made to stage it in the morning , thereby allowing the spectators to witness both sporting events . Both teams were missing key players . Oxford 's first @-@ choice goalkeeper , Charles Nepean , was unavailable , as were four of Wanderers ' regular players , including Thomas Hooman , William Crake and Albert Thompson , all of whom had been in the cup @-@ winning team the year before . As cup @-@ holders , Wanderers were permitted to choose the stadium at which the match would be played . As the club had no official stadium of its own , its officials chose the Lillie Bridge ground in West Brompton . 
 Oxford dominated the early stages of the game due largely to the strong running of Arnold Kirke @-@ Smith . Newspaper The Sportsman commented that " the whole eleven work [ ed ] well together and with great energy " . Nonetheless , Wanderers came closer to scoring when William Kenyon @-@ Slaney got the ball into the goal , only for the umpires to disallow the goal due to an infringement of the offside rule . After 27 minutes , Wanderers captain Arthur Kinnaird , whom the press rated as the best player of the match due to his dribbling skills , gave his team the lead when he outpaced Oxford 's backs and kicked the ball between the goalposts . 
 In a desperate attempt to secure an equalising goal , Oxford took the unusual step of dispensing with the use of a goalkeeper and moved Andrew Leach , who had been playing in that position , upfield to play as a forward . This plan back @-@ fired at around the 80 @-@ minute mark , however , when Charles Wollaston broke through and scored a second goal for the Wanderers , who thereby retained the trophy which they had won in its inaugural year . The correspondent from The Field stated that the shot would easily have been saved had there been a player in goal .

 SMS Gazelle was the lead ship of the ten @-@ vessel light cruiser Gazelle class , built by the Imperial German Navy . She was built by the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , laid down in 1897 , launched in March 1898 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in June 1901 . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , Gazelle was capable of a top speed of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) . 
 Initially assigned to overseas service , Gazelle participated in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 . She returned to German waters in 1904 , and served with the fleet until 1914 . She was employed as a coastal defense ship after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . She served in this role until the night of 25 – 26 January 1916 , when she struck a mine off Cape Arkona . The Navy deemed Gazelle not worth repairing and reduced her to a mine storage hulk , a role she retained through the end of the war . In August 1920 , she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap .

The engines were powered by eight coal @-@ fired Niclausse boilers . Gazelle carried 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 570 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 610 km ; 4 @,@ 110 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men . 
 Gazelle 's armament consisted of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side @-@ by @-@ side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side @-@ by @-@ side aft .

 After her commissioning , Gazelle was sent overseas from 1902 to 1904 . She was assigned to the American Squadron ; starting in December 1902 , Gazelle participated in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 . An Anglo @-@ German naval force instituted a blockade of the Venezuelan coast to secure payment of foreign debts . Gazelle and the unprotected cruiser Falke were the German contribution to the blockading squadron ; they joined four British cruisers and three smaller vessels in enforcing the blockade . The Venezuelan gunboat <unk> was seized during the blockade . The Germans took her into service as SMS <unk> and put a crew from Gazelle on board under the command of Kapitänleutnant ( Captain Lieutenant ) Titus Türk . In February 1903 the Venezuelan government reached an agreement to pay its debts , concluding the confrontation . In January 1904 , Gazelle conducted a goodwill visit to the port of New Orleans , along with Vineta and two other warships . During this period she was commanded by then Korvettenkapitän Reinhard Scheer , the later commander of the High Seas Fleet . 
 After returning to Germany , she served with the High Seas Fleet until 1914 , when she was reduced to a coastal defense vessel . She served in the Baltic Sea in the first two years after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . On 17 November , while patrolling in the Baltic , Gazelle was attacked by the British submarine HMS E9 . The submarine fired a pair of torpedoes at the cruiser , but both missed . On the night of 25 – 26 January 1916 , she struck Russian mines to the north of Cape Arkona . The mine explosion tore off both of her screws and she had to be towed back to port . On 22 February , the German Navy decided the old cruiser was not worth repairing , and so she was placed out of service . She was converted into a hulk for minelayers , first at Danzig and then at Cuxhaven . In 1918 , she was moved to Wilhelmshaven . After the end of the war , Gazelle was formally stricken from the naval register on 28 August 1920 and broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven . 
 = Omayra Sánchez = 
 Omayra Sánchez Garzón ( August 28 , 1972 – November 16 , 1985 ) was a Colombian girl killed in Armero , department of Tolima , by the 1985 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano when she was 13 years old . Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive lahars ( volcanically induced mudslides , landslides , and debris flows ) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain , killing nearly 23 @,@ 000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages . 
 After a lahar demolished her home , Sánchez became pinned beneath the debris of her house , where she remained trapped in water for three days . Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony . Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers , who put great efforts into comforting her . After 60 hours of struggling , she died , likely as a result of either gangrene or hypothermia . Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano , contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims , despite inadequate supplies and equipment . 
 Sánchez became internationally famous through a photograph of her taken by the photojournalist Frank Fournier shortly before she died . When published worldwide it generated considerable controversy ; it was later designated the World Press Photo of the Year for 1986 . Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture , remembered through music , literature , and commemorative articles .

 On November 13 , 1985 , the Nevado del Ruiz volcano erupted . Pyroclastic flows exploding from the crater melted the mountain 's icecap , forming lahars ( volcanic mudflows and debris flows ) which cascaded into river valleys below . One lahar , consisting of three pulses , did most of the damage . Traveling at 6 meters ( 20 ft ) per second , the first pulse enveloped most of the town of Armero , killing up to 20 @,@ 000 people ; the two later pulses weakened buildings . Another lahar killed 1 @,@ 800 people in nearby Chinchiná . In total 23 @,@ 000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed . 
 Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities ' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger . There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845 , which contributed to complacency ; locals called the volcano the " Sleeping Lion " . 
 In September 1985 , as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area around the volcano , officials began planning for evacuation . A hazard map was prepared in October ; it highlighted the danger from falling ash and rock near Murillo , Santa Isabel , and <unk> , as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita , Guayabal , Chinchiná , and Armero . The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk : many survivors had never heard of it , though several major newspapers had featured it . Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars , but had " met with strong opposition from economic interests . " He said that the short time between the map 's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution . 
 The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering , and the government and army were preoccupied with the guerrilla campaign in Bogotá , the national capital , which was then at its height . 
 The death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings , unwise land use , as villages were built in the likely path of lahars , and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano . Colombia 's worst natural disaster , the Armero tragedy ( as it came to be known ) was the second @-@ deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century ( surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée ) . It was the fourth @-@ deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD . Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history . 
 = = Life = = 
 Omayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique , a rice and sorghum collector , and María Aleida , along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón . Prior to the eruption , her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business . The night of the disaster , Omayra and her family were awake , worrying about the ashfall from the eruption , when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar . After it hit , Omayra became trapped under her home 's concrete and other debris and could not free herself . When rescue teams tried to help her , they realized that her legs were trapped under her house 's roof . Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped . <unk> ( 2009 ) said she was " trapped up to her neck " , while Barragán ( 1987 ) said that she was trapped up to her waist . 
 Sánchez was immobilized from the waist down , but her upper body was free of the concrete and mud . For the first few hours after the mudflow hit , she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris . After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris , he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day . Once the girl was freed from the waist up , her rescuers attempted to pull her out , but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process . Each time a person pulled her , the water pooled around her , rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go , so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat . Divers discovered that Sánchez 's legs were caught under a door made of bricks , with her aunt 's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet . 
 = = Death = = 
 Despite her predicament , Sánchez remained relatively positive : she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán , a journalist who was working as a volunteer , asked for sweet food , drank soda , and agreed to be interviewed . At times , she was scared , and prayed or cried . On the third night , Sánchez began hallucinating , saying that she did not want to be late for school , and mentioned a maths exam . Near the end of her life , Sánchez 's eyes reddened , her face swelled , and her hands whitened . At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest . Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her , but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling , and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs . Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation , the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die . In all , Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights ( roughly 60 hours ) before she died at approximately 10 : 05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure , most likely from gangrene or hypothermia . 
 Her brother and mother survived the lahars ; her father and sister died . Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra 's death : " It is horrible , but we have to think about the living ... I will live for my son , who only lost a finger . " 
 As the public became aware of Sánchez 's situation through the media , her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved . Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers , disproving what officials had previously indicated : that they had used the best of their supplies . Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels , cutting tools , and stretchers ran out . The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization . An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized . Colombia 's Minister of Defense , Miguel Uribe , said he " understood criticism of the rescue effort " , but said that Colombia was " an undeveloped country " that did not " have that kind of equipment . " 
 = = Photograph = = 
 Frank Fournier , a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15 , took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days , titled " The Agony of Omayra Sánchez " . When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th , a farmer directed him to Sánchez , who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near @-@ deserted . Fournier later described the town as " very haunting , " with " eerie silence " punctuated by screaming . He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only " report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl " in his attempt to publicize the disaster 's need for relief efforts , feeling otherwise " powerless " . 
 At the time , there was international awareness of the disaster . Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath . The image captured international attention . According to an unnamed BBC reporter , " Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra 's life . " After the photo was published in Paris Match , many accused Fournier of being " a vulture . " He responded , 
 " I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction ; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it . ... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country 's leaders . " 
 The picture later won the World Press Photo of the Year for 1985 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the M @-@ 19 guerrilla group 's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6 , worsening an already chaotic situation . After Sánchez 's death , blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano 's eruption . 
 The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active , according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia . Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to 200 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 7 @.@ 06 × 109 cu ft ) — similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985 . Such lahars can travel up to 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) along river valleys in a few hours . Estimates show that up to 500 @,@ 000 people living in the Combeima , Chinchiná , Coello @-@ Toche , and Guali valleys are at risk , and 100 @,@ 000 of these are considered to be at high risk . The city of Armero no longer exists . The site was commemorated as a memorial with Christian crosses and a small monument to Sánchez . 
 In the years following the eruption , Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated , especially in newspapers like El Tiempo . Many victims of the disaster were commemorated , but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry , novels , and music . 
 For example , a punk rock band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez ; they express their " discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world " . Adiós , Omayra : La <unk> de Armero ( 1988 ) , written by Eduardo Santa as a response to the eruption , depicts the girl 's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe . In No <unk> ( 1994 ) , Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero , nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house . Isabel Allende 's short story , " And of Clay Are We Created " ( " De <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) , is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home . Allende later wrote , " Her [ Sánchez 's ] big black eyes , filled with resignation and wisdom , still pursue me in my dreams . Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost . " 
 To try to prevent repetition of such a disaster , the government of Colombia created the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres ( National Office for Disaster Preparedness ) , now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres ( Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness ) . All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters . 
 = Battle of Hwanggan = 
 The Battle of Hwanggan was an engagement between United States and North Korean forces that took place on July 23 – 29 , 1950 , on a road north of the village of Hwanggan in southern South Korea , early in the Korean War . The battle ended in a victory for the North Koreans after US troops were forced to withdraw south . 
 The US Army 's 27th Infantry Regiment , 25th Infantry Division , newly arrived in Korea , was moved to a road north of Hwanggan to block the North Korean People 's Army 's 2nd Division , advancing following the Battle of Taejon . In an unusually good first performance , the 27th Infantry was able to delay the North Korean division for almost a week , inflicting heavy casualties on it while suffering few casualties of their own . 
 The North Koreans eventually were able to overwhelm the US forces with sheer numbers , capturing Hwanggan and pushing the American units further south . However , the action solidified the 27th Infantry 's position as a valuable reserve unit for the US Eighth Army during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter . The 27th <unk> itself in several critical battles , including the Battle of the Bowling Alley .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea . The United States sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945 , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow follow @-@ on forces to arrive . The division was consequently outnumbered and outgunned for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans , making time for the 7th Infantry Division , 25th Infantry Division , 1st Cavalry Division , and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position . South Korean forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea 's east coast , with entire divisions being overrun by the North Koreans ' superior firepower and equipment . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , during the first battle between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force 's superior numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , being almost completely destroyed in the process but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops was roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region at around 70 @,@ 000 for each side , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 In the east , the North Koreans advanced immediately after taking Taejon . Four North Korean divisions split up and approached the UN lines along separate routes . The NK 15th Division was the first to move against the US 25th Infantry in the Battle of Sangju on July 20 , where the division 's US 24th Infantry would be quickly pushed back by the North Korean advance . In the meantime , the NK 3rd Division engaged the newly arrived US 1st Cavalry at the Battle of Yongdong on July 22 , where that division would also perform poorly . The NK 6th Division moved further south , where it would confront the US 29th Infantry Regiment at the Hadong Ambush on July 27 , effectively destroying one of the regiment 's battalions . The US units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against North Korean units , as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued the UN forces at this stage of the war .

 = = = 27th Infantry advance = = = 
 As other North Korean forces were closing on Yongdong , the NK 2nd Division continued its advance down the road from Hwanggan to Poun , having arrived in Taejon too late for the fight there . Its orders were to pass through that town and come out on the main Seoul – Pusan highway at Hwanggan , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) east of Yongdong , placing it in the rear of the 1st Cavalry Division and on its main supply road . 
 Responding to the threat , the Eighth Army ordered the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the US 25th Infantry Division to block the advance . After arriving in Korea , the regiment went to the <unk> area , 35 miles ( 56 km ) north of Taegu . On July 13 , it moved from there to Andong to support South Korean troops , but before it entered action in the fight in that city , it suddenly received orders to move to Sangju to assist the 25th Infantry Division 's other two regiments in that battle . En route , it received still other orders to change its destination to Hwanggan , and it closed there in an assembly area on the night of July 22 – 23 . The 27th Infantry 's mission at Hwanggan was to relieve the exhausted and decimated South Korean units retreating down the Poun road . In the meantime it lost large numbers of its experienced officers as they were shifted to the US 24th Infantry . 
 In carrying out Eighth Army 's orders to block the Poun road , regimental commander Colonel John H. Michaelis , a West Point graduate known as an effective commander , assigned the 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry , to make contact with the first North Korean attacks . On the morning of July 23 , Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert J. Check moved the 1st Battalion northward toward Poun from the Hwanggan assembly area . He took up defensive positions in the evening near the village of <unk> @-@ ni , south of Poun . The battalion assumed responsibility for that sector at 17 : 00 after South Korean troops fell back through its position . However , the battalion was unable to ascertain from the retreating soldiers the NK 2nd Division 's status or threat . 
 = = = North Korean attack = = = 
 In the evening of July 23 , 1st Battalion sent a 30 @-@ man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans . Near Poun , the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching . The platoon took up superior positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons . The North Koreans halted their advance , thinking they had encountered a major position , and held back until daylight . When they turned back , the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04 : 00 on July 24 . It suffered six men missing to an unknown number of North Korean casualties . 
 Check 's 1st Battalion was not attacked until 06 : 30 on July 24 , shortly after daybreak in a heavy fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach very close to the US positions before they were observed . Two US infantry companies on either side of the road on low ridges held the forward positions . North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there , and then T @-@ 34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached . North Korean infantry followed the tanks . Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry , the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company . This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer . A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process . 
 On the right flank , north of the road , the North Koreans overran the battalion observation post and B Company 's outpost line . This high ground changed hands three times during the day . While the infantry fight was in progress , and shortly after the first tank penetration , five more T @-@ 34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion . Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared . Three F @-@ 80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks , destroying three of them with 5 @-@ inch rockets . Altogether , bazooka , artillery , and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning , either within or on the edge of the 1st Battalion position . In its first engagement with American troops , the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju . 
 = = = US withdrawal to Hwanggan = = = 
 The fight continued into the evening , and after dark the 1st Battalion disengaged and withdrew through the 2nd Battalion immediately behind it . Both Check and the regimental commander , Michaelis , expected the North Koreans to encircle the 1st Battalion position during the night if it stayed where it was . 
 The North Koreans were apparently unaware of the 1st Battalion withdrawal , because the next morning , July 25 , two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before , but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch 's 2nd Battalion . There the North Koreans were caught in the open by the combined fire of American tanks , artillery , and mortar , and the 2nd Battalion 's automatic and small arms fire . The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack . Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion . The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners . 
 The NK 2nd Division pushed forward in spite of the casualties , and that afternoon elements of it were flanking the 27th Infantry 's main position . Michaelis issued an order about 22 : 00 for another withdrawal to high ground near Hwanggan . The withdrawal started near midnight with heavy fighting still in progress on the right flank . Murch took control of all nine US tanks and put them on line facing north , where they attacked North Korean troops approaching on the road . Mortar fire fell along the battalion line and the road behind it . F Company and the nine tanks covered the 2nd Battalion withdrawal . 
 = = = Second defensive line = = = 
 On July 26 , 1st Battalion , US 35th Infantry arrived on the 27th Infantry 's right flank . However , the next day the regimental left flank came under attack where a large gap existed between C Company , the westernmost unit of the 27th Infantry , and the US 7th Cavalry Regiment , the nearest unit of the US 1st Cavalry Division . C Company lost and regained a peak three times during the day . More than 40 casualties reduced its strength to approximately 60 men . B Company also lost heavily in action , falling to a strength of about 85 men . By the morning of July 28 the North Koreans had penetrated the 1st Battalion 's line , forcing C Company to withdraw in the face of heavy North Korean infantry attack . 
 At this point Colonel Michaelis went to the 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division . Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters and asked if he should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry , or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division 's area , move south to Kumch 'on , and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division . The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw , as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position . 
 Before dawn on July 29 , the 27th Infantry Regiment withdrew through the 1st Cavalry Division lines at Hwanggan to a position about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of Kumch 'on . That afternoon Michaelis received orders from Eighth Army to move to Waegwan on the Naktong River near Taegu , as army reserve , instead of joining the 25th Division in the Sangju area . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The 27th Infantry Regiment lost 53 men killed , 221 wounded , and 49 missing , a total of 323 battle casualties during the battles along the Hwanggan road . However , it was able to delay the North Korean division for five days in this effort . The NK 2nd Division suffered heavily during this time to US artillery and armor , some estimates placing its losses above 3 @,@ 000 men in the battles along the road . The US 1st Cavalry Division initially took the 27th Infantry 's place on the line , but retreated without engaging the NK 2nd Division after movement by the NK 3rd Division threatened to take Kumch 'on and block the US division 's route of supply . The division was driven to the Naktong River by July 31 , having taken 916 battle casualties at Hwanggan and Sangju in its first ten days on the line . Tactically , the North Koreans had been successful in pushing the US forces south and capturing the ground , but the American units had bought strategically valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter . 
 The battle set the standard for the 27th Infantry , which performed unusually well in the fight . In contrast , other units of both the 25th Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions in their first engagements at Yongdong and Sangju performed very poorly , prompting Walker to order the US forces to stop retreating , and " stand or die . " The US 27th Infantry was used as an emergency reserve during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , where it particularly distinguished itself at the Battle of the Bowling Alley . The regiment 's quality performance in the Hwanggan fight was crucial in the decision to make it a " fire brigade . " 
 = Albatrellus subrubescens = 
 Albatrellus subrubescens is a species of polypore fungus in the family <unk> . The fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) of the fungus have whitish to pale buff @-@ colored caps that can reach up to 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , and stems up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) long and 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . On the underside of the caps are tiny light yellow to pale greenish @-@ yellow pores , the site of spore production . When the fruit bodies are fresh , the cap and pores stain yellow where exposed , handled , or bruised . 
 The species is found in Asia , Europe , and North America , where it grows on the ground in deciduous or mixed woods , usually in association with pine trees . It is closely related , and physically similar , to the more common Albatrellus ovinus , from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised , and microscopically by the amyloid ( staining bluish @-@ black to black with Melzer 's reagent ) walls of the spores . The fruit bodies of A. subrubescens contain scutigeral , a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity . A. subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous , and consuming them will result in a short @-@ term gastrointestinal illness . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described as Scutiger subrubescens by American mycologist William Murrill in 1940 , based on collections that he found growing under oak near Gainesville , Florida , in November 1938 . In 1947 he transferred it to the genus Polyporus . Josiah Lincoln Lowe examined Murrill 's type material and thought that it did not differ from Albatrellus confluens . In 1965 , Zdeněk Pouzar made collections from Bohemia ( now the Czech Republic ) , and described it as a new species ( Albatrellus similis ) , unaware of the similarity to Murrill 's Florida specimens . Further study revealed that A. similis was identical to Murrill 's Scutiger subrubescens , and Pouzar transferred the latter epithet to Albatrellus . In 1974 , Pouzar recognized that Lowe 's species Albatrellus confluens was distinct from A. subrubescens . The specific epithet subrubescens , " tinted reddish " , is derived from the Latin words sub ( " less than " ) and rubescens ( " growing red " ) . 
 Four Albatrellus species were included in a large @-@ scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003 . Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences , the four form a clade , or monophyletic group ( that is , they derived from a single ancestor ) . Of the four tested species , A. ovinus was most closely related to A. subrubescens . The polypore <unk> lenta ( type species of the genus <unk> ) occurred on a single branch basal to the <unk> clade , implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended . In a more recent ( 2010 ) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge <unk> aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger , A. subrubescens grouped in a clade with A. ovinus and A. citrinus . According to <unk> , these species , in addition to A. <unk> and A. <unk> , are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics . Other Albatrellus species were transferred to segregate genera : A. <unk> and A. confluens to Albatrellopsis ; A. <unk> and A. <unk> to <unk> ; A. pes @-@ <unk> and A. <unk> to an amended Scutiger . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of A. subrubescens is between 6 to 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 5 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , with a central , eccentric ( away from the center ) , or rarely lateral ( attached to the edge of cap ) stem . Initially , the cap is convex with an involute margin , flattening out with age . The cap margin may be folded or flat . The cap surface in young specimens is smooth but soon forms appressed scale @-@ like spots , which may transform into scales in age . Initially , the cap has white margins and a brownish @-@ violet center with scale @-@ like spots ; the center later becomes orange @-@ brownish or ochraceous brown . According to Canadian mycologist James Ginns , who described North American Albatrellus species in 1997 , some North American specimens may be covered with blackish @-@ gray to purple @-@ gray fibrils , but this characteristic is not seen in European collections . The cap discolors yellowish when bruised . 
 The stem is 1 @.@ 6 to 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) long and 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick , cylindrical , irregular , and its base may be somewhat pointed , or bulbous . Initially white , the stem develops orange / violet spots and later brownish orange spots ; in old specimens the stem may be brownish brick red . The tubes on the pore surface ( underside of the cap ) are about 2 @.@ 5 – 3 mm long and decurrent in attachment . The pores are small , measuring about 2 – 3 per millimeter . They are initially greenish @-@ white , but later turn dark brown ; dried specimens can have pores that are tinted green . Fruit bodies have a " faintly fragrant , pleasant " odor ; in his original report on the species , Murrill noted that specimens left to dry in an oven developed a strong odor of burnt sugar . The taste of the mushroom has been described variously as indistinct , or " distinctly bitter " . The type material was noted by Murrill to taste bitter , an observation later corroborated by Pouzar with European collections . A. subrubescens mushrooms are mildly toxic : consumption causes a gastrointestinal illness that usually subsides one to four hours after ingestion . 
 In deposit , the spores are white . The spores are 3 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 7 by 2 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 4 µm , ellipsoid to ovoid in shape , and amyloid ( absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) . Most have a single large oil drop . The spore @-@ bearing cells ( the basidia ) are club @-@ shaped , 12 – 16 µm long by 5 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 7 µm thick , and have four thin , slightly curved sterigmata that are 3 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 3 µm long . The hymenium lacks any cystidia . The hyphal system is monomitic , meaning that the context is made of thin @-@ walled generative hyphae . These hyphae have lengths in the range of 3 @.@ 5 – 30 µm ( most commonly 6 – 17 µm ) , with thin walls ( up to 1 µm thick ) , and are hyaline ( translucent ) . Although they are inamyloid , some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish @-@ gray to black , which makes them appear collectively grayish @-@ black under the microscope . <unk> hyphae ( wide and thin @-@ walled with refractive contents ) are also scattered throughout the context , as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick @-@ walled and amyloid . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 In general , A. subrubescens can be distinguished from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised , its simple @-@ septate hyphae , small amyloid spores , and habitat under pines . In the field , Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A. subrubescens due to its similar appearance . A. ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A. subrubescens . Microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish the two species : the spores of A. subrubescens are amyloid , in contrast to those of A. ovinus , and A. ovinus spores are smaller , typically 3 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 6 by 3 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 5 µm . Other similar species include A. <unk> , described from the Altai Mountains in East @-@ Central Asia , and the Japanese species A. cantharellus . Unlike A. subrubescens , these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps , and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales . Also , the scales of A. subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales . Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A. subrubescens : those of A. cantharellus are 4 @.@ 5 – 7 by 4 – 5 @.@ 5 µm , while those of A. <unk> are 5 – 7 by 4 – 5 µm . 
 Albatrellopsis confluens has caps that are pinkish @-@ buff to pale orange , and white flesh that dries to a pinkish @-@ buff ; it has a taste that is bitter , or like cabbage . The spores of A. confluens are weakly amyloid . Additional differences distinguishing Albatrellopsis confluens from A. subrubescens include the presence of clamp connections in the context hyphae , and mycelium on the base of the stem . The European fungus A. citrinus , originally considered a morphotype of A. subrubescens , was described as a new species in 2003 . It is distinguished from A. subrubescens morphologically by its smaller caps ( up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter ) , the yellowish bruising of the caps with age or after handling , and the absence of violet spots on the cap . A. citrinus associates with spruce rather than pine , and requires calcareous ( lime @-@ rich ) soil . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Fruit bodies of A. subrubescens are usually solitary , but sometimes several ( typically between two and eight ) are stuck together by the stem bases or on the sides of their caps . A strictly terrestrial species , it is not found fruiting on wood . It prefers to grow in pine woods , but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe ; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine . It is suspected that A. subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three @-@ needle pines ( i.e. , those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three ) , although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty . Ginns , relating a personal communication with David Arora , wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine ( a three @-@ needle pine ) , manzanita , huckleberry and a few <unk> . 
 The species has been reported from a variety of locations in temperate regions of Asia , Europe , and North America . In North America , its distribution includes Alberta , Quebec , and the Northwest Territories in Canada . In the United States , it is found in Alabama , Arizona , California , Florida , New York , Texas , Washington , and Wisconsin . The North American distribution extends south to Mexico , in Chiapas . In Asia , the fungus has been recorded from Yunnan in southwest China , and Tibet . In Europe , collections have been reported from Austria , Czechoslovakia , Finland , Germany , Italy , Poland , Sweden , Switzerland , Yugoslavia , and the Ukraine . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Albatrellus subrubescens contains the bioactive compound scutigeral , which has antibiotic activity . This chemical — also found in the related species A. ovinus — may contribute to the mushroom 's toxicity by disturbing the body 's intestinal flora . <unk> interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily ( the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system , regulating neuronal growth and development , and mediating some behavioral responses ) . A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at <unk> receptors ( a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals ) ; specifically , that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia . Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity . One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human <unk> receptor <unk> , while another study published that year did not find any activity . 
 = Lockheed XF @-@ 104 = 
 The Lockheed XF @-@ 104 was a single @-@ engine , high @-@ performance , supersonic interceptor prototype for a United States Air Force ( USAF ) series of lightweight and simple fighters . Only two aircraft were built , one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed . Both prototypes were destroyed in accidents during testing . The XF @-@ 104 was the forerunner of over 2 @,@ 500 Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighters . 
 During the Korean War , USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG @-@ equipped Soviet pilots . Lockheed engineers , led by Kelly Johnson , designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force . The design was notable for its <unk> , particularly its thin wings and missile @-@ shaped fuselage , as well as a novel pilot ejection system . 
 The XF @-@ 104 's maiden flight came in February 1954 . The flight test program encountered problems , some of which were resolved ; however , the XF @-@ 104 performance proved better than estimates . Both prototypes were lost through accidents . Nevertheless , the USAF ordered 17 service @-@ test F @-@ <unk> . Internationally , the production F @-@ 104 Starfighters proved popular , serving as front @-@ line fighters with a number of countries . 
 = = Development = = 
 Clarence L. " Kelly " Johnson , chief engineer at Lockheed 's Skunk Works , visited Korea in December 1951 and talked to fighter pilots about what sort of aircraft they wanted . At the time , U.S. Air Force pilots were confronting the MiG @-@ 15 " <unk> " in their North American F @-@ 86 Sabres , and many of the pilots felt that the MiGs were superior to the larger and more complex American design . The pilots requested a small and simple aircraft with excellent performance . One pilot in particular , Colonel Gabby Gabreski was quoted as saying ; " I 'd rather sight with a piece of chewing gum stuck on the windscreen " and told Johnson that radar " was a waste of time " . 
 On his return to the U.S. , Johnson immediately started the design of just such an aircraft realising that an official requirement would soon be published . In March 1952 , his team was assembled , and they sketched several different aircraft proposals , ranging from small designs at 8 @,@ 000 lb ( 3 @.@ 6 t ) , to fairly large ones at 50 @,@ 000 lb ( 23 t ) . The L @-@ 246 as the design became known remained essentially identical to the " Model L @-@ 083 Starfighter " as eventually delivered . 
 The design was presented to the Air Force in November 1952 , who were interested enough to create a new proposal , inviting several companies to participate . Three additional designs were received : the Republic AP @-@ 55 , an improved version of its prototype XF @-@ 91 <unk> ; the North American NA @-@ 212 , which would eventually evolve into the F @-@ 107 ; and the Northrop N @-@ 102 Fang , a new General Electric J79 @-@ powered design . Although all were interesting , Lockheed had an insurmountable lead and was granted a development contract in March 1953 . 
 Test data from the earlier Lockheed X @-@ 7 unmanned ramjet / rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF @-@ 104 would share the general design of the X @-@ 7 's wing and tail . Experience gained from the Douglas X @-@ 3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF @-@ 104 . Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs ; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute . 
 The wooden mock @-@ up was ready for inspection at the end of April , and work started on two prototypes late in May . The J79 engine was not yet ready , so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65 , a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire . Construction of the first prototype XF @-@ 104 ( US serial number 53 @-@ 7786 , Buzz number FG @-@ 786 ) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed 's Burbank , California factory . This aircraft was powered by a non @-@ afterburning Buick @-@ built Wright J65 @-@ B @-@ 3 turbojet . The first prototype was completed by early 1954 , and started flying in March . The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year , a very short time even then , and unheard of today , when 10 – 15 years is more typical . Construction of the second prototype ( s / n 53 @-@ 7787 ) proceeded at a slower pace . 
 = = Design = = 
 In order to achieve the desired performance , Lockheed chose a minimalist approach : a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest , most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine . The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass . 
 The XF @-@ 104 had a radical wing design . Most supersonic jets use a swept or delta wing . This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance , lift , and internal space for fuel and equipment . However the most efficient shape for high @-@ speed , supersonic flight had been found to be a small , straight , mid @-@ mounted , trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading . The wing was extremely thin , with a thickness @-@ to @-@ chord ratio of only 3 @.@ 4 % . The leading edges of the wing were so thin ( 0 @.@ 016 in / 0 @.@ 41 mm ) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews , and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations . The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage . The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch ( 25 mm ) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument . The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed . The XF @-@ 104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft . 
 After extensive wind tunnel testing , the stabilator was mounted at the top of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis . Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective , it could act as a wing on rudder application ( a phenomenon known as " Dutch roll " ) . To offset this effect , the wings were angled downward to give 10 ° anhedral . The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin . 
 The fuselage of the XF @-@ 104 had a high fineness ratio , i.e. , tapering sharply towards the nose , and a small frontal area of 25 sq ft ( 2 @.@ 3 m2 ) . The fuselage was tightly packed , containing the cockpit , avionics , cannon , all internal fuel , landing gear , and engine . The air intakes , designed by Ben Rich , were of fixed geometry without inlet cones , since the J65 @-@ powered aircraft was incapable of Mach 2 performance . They were similar to those of the F @-@ 94 Starfire , being mounted slightly away from the fuselage , with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air . The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack , at which point induced drag became very high . 
 The XF @-@ 104 featured an unusual downward @-@ ejecting Stanley B seat . It was feared that contemporary ejection seat designs would not have enough explosive power to clear the high " T " tail assembly . In the event of the seat not firing , it was possible to manually release the lower fuselage hatch and then exit the aircraft via gravity . The F @-@ 104 series aircraft would later convert to upward @-@ ejecting seats but the fuselage hatch was retained as a useful maintenance feature .

 The first XF @-@ 104 ( Lockheed 083 @-@ 1001 , s / n 53 @-@ 7786 ) was transported to Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy during the night of 24 – 25 February , where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing . On 28 February 1954 , the XF @-@ 104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a high @-@ speed taxi , but its first official flight took place on 4 March . During that flight , the landing gear did not retract , and LeVier landed after a low @-@ speed flight of about 20 minutes . Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system . Bad weather kept the XF @-@ 104 on the ground until 26 March , when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally . 
 The second prototype ( Lockheed 083 @-@ 1002 , s / n 53 @-@ 7787 ) , fitted with the afterburning J65 from the start , first flew on 5 October . Since it was to be the armament test bed , it was fitted with the 20 mm ( .79 in ) M61 Vulcan cannon and was equipped with an AN / ASG @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 fire control system . XF @-@ 104 # 2 achieved a top speed of Mach 1 @.@ 79 at 60 @,@ 000 feet ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) on 25 March 1955 , piloted by Lockheed test pilot J. Ray <unk> . This was the highest speed achieved by the XF @-@ 104 . 
 XF @-@ 104 # 1 was subsonic in level flight when powered by the non @-@ afterburning J65 , but Mach 1 could be easily exceeded during a slight descent . In July 1954 , the J65 @-@ B @-@ 3 was replaced by the afterburning J65 @-@ W @-@ 7 turbojet . With this engine installed , the performance of the XF @-@ 104 was greatly improved . Maximum level speed was Mach 1 @.@ 49 at 41 @,@ 000 ft ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) , and an altitude of 55 @,@ 000 ft ( 17 @,@ 000 m ) could be attained in a zoom climb , while Mach 1 @.@ 6 could be attained in a dive . The first XF @-@ 104 was accepted by the USAF in November 1955 . 
 Initial aerial firing tests with the Vulcan cannon on the second aircraft were successful , but on 17 December , there was an explosion during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls . Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake . An investigation later showed that one of the 20 mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech , blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell . Jet fuel had run into the gun bay , and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake . The engine immediately flooded with fuel , causing the compressor stalls . 
 = = = Crashes = = = 
 XF @-@ 104 53 @-@ 7786 was lost in a crash on 11 July 1957 when it developed an uncontrollable tail flutter while flying chase for F @-@ 104A flight tests . The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe , and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject . Vertical fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds of no more than Mach 0 @.@ 95 at the time of the accident . Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum , arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties . 
 XF @-@ 104 53 @-@ 7787 was lost on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1 @,@ 000 flying hours when test pilot Herman Salmon was forced to eject during gun firing trials at 50 @,@ 000 ft ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) . The gun malfunctioned during a test firing , and severe vibrations began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit . Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon 's pressure suit inflating and covering his face so that he could not see . Recalling LeVier 's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December , Salmon believed that the same thing had happened to him and that he had no option but to eject . He later found out that he could have saved 53 @-@ 7787 by simply bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate . With the loss of the armament testbed , Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative , and armament trials were continued on a modified F @-@ <unk> Starfire . The two XF @-@ <unk> amassed an approximate total of 250 flight hours . 
 = = = Testing conclusions = = = 
 Flight testing proved that performance estimates were accurate and that even when fitted with the low powered J65 engine , the XF @-@ 104 flew faster than the other Century Series fighters being developed at the time . The XF @-@ 104 's ceiling at 60 @,@ 000 ft ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) was 7 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) higher than predicted , and it exceeded estimated speed and drag figures by two to three percent . It was noted however that the low thrust of the J65 engine did not enable the full performance potential of the type to be realized . 
 A number of minor problems surfaced , but were readily fixed . The yaw damper of the XF @-@ 104 was found to be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center , these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system . The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds ( remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F @-@ 104 ) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes . 
 During a later interview , Kelly Johnson was asked about his opinion on the aircraft , " Did it come up to my designs ? In terms of performance , yes . In terms of engine , we went through a great many engine problems , not with the <unk> but with the <unk> . " For his part in designing the F @-@ 104 airframe , Johnson was jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958 , sharing the honor with General Electric ( engine ) and the U.S. Air Force ( Flight Records ) .

 Official approval of the XF @-@ 104 design led to a contract for 17 YF @-@ 104A service test aircraft and a production run of over 2 @,@ 500 aircraft built both in the United States and under license worldwide . 
 Visible changes from the XF @-@ 104 to production versions of the Starfighter include a longer fuselage ( to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel ) and a forward @-@ retracting nose landing gear ( except two @-@ seat versions ) to increase clearance for the downward @-@ ejecting seat . A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF @-@ 104A test program . Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features . Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem . Since the internal fuel capacity was low limiting the useful range of the aircraft , extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage .

 = SEPECAT Jaguar = 
 The SEPECAT Jaguar is an Anglo @-@ French jet attack aircraft , originally used by the British Royal Air Force and the French Air Force in the close air support and nuclear strike role , and still in service with the Indian Air Force . 
 Originally conceived in the 1960s as a jet trainer with a light ground attack capability , the requirement for the aircraft soon changed to include supersonic performance , reconnaissance and tactical nuclear strike roles . A carrier @-@ based variant was also planned for French service , but this was cancelled in favour of the cheaper Dassault Super Étendard . The airframes were manufactured by SEPECAT ( Société Européenne de Production de l <unk> Ecole de Combat et d 'Appui Tactique ) , a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation , one of the first major joint @-@ Anglo @-@ French military aircraft programs . 
 The Jaguar was exported to India , Oman , Ecuador and Nigeria . With various air forces , the Jaguar was used in numerous conflicts and military operations in Mauritania , Chad , Iraq , Bosnia , and Pakistan , as well as providing a ready nuclear delivery platform for Britain , France , and India throughout the latter half of the Cold War and beyond . In the Gulf War , the Jaguar was praised for its reliability and was a valuable coalition resource . The aircraft served with the French Air Force as the main strike / attack aircraft until 1 July 2005 , and with the Royal Air Force until the end of April 2007 . It was replaced by the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF and the Dassault Rafale in the French Air Force .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The Jaguar programme began in the early 1960s , in response to a British requirement ( Air Staff Target 362 ) for an advanced supersonic jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat T1 and Hawker Hunter T7 , and a French requirement ( ECAT or École de Combat et d 'Appui Tactique , " Tactical Combat Support Trainer " ) for a cheap , subsonic dual role trainer and light attack aircraft to replace the <unk> Magister , Lockheed T @-@ 33 and Dassault Mystère IV . In both countries several companies tendered designs : BAC , Hunting , Hawker Siddeley and Folland in Britain ; Breguet , Potez , Sud @-@ Aviation , Nord , and Dassault from France . A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 1965 for the two countries to develop two aircraft , a trainer based on the ECAT , and the larger AFVG ( Anglo @-@ French Variable Geometry ) . 
 Cross @-@ channel negotiations led to the formation of SEPECAT ( Société Européenne de Production de l 'Avion d 'École de Combat et d 'Appui Tactique – the " European company for the production of a combat trainer and tactical support aircraft " ) in 1966 as a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation to produce the airframe . Though based in part on the Breguet Br.121 , using the same basic configuration and an innovative French @-@ designed landing gear , the Jaguar as built also incorporated major elements designed by BAC – notably the wing and high lift devices . Production of the aircraft components would be split between Breguet and BAC and these would be assembled on two production lines ; one in the UK and one in France , There would be no duplication of work ; each component for the aircraft had only one source . The British trainer requirement had been more demanding , requiring supersonic performance and superior avionics ; as a result , the Br.121 needed a thinner wing , increased weapon load and more power , the latter to meet the RAF 's required ferry range of 2 @,@ 600 miles ( 4 @,@ 200 km ) . A separate partnership was formed between Rolls @-@ Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour afterburning turbofan engine . The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca 's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR <unk> and their joint venture would use elements of both . The new engine , which would be used for the AFVG as well , would be built in Derby and <unk> . 
 Previous collaborative efforts between Britain and France had been complicated – the AFVG programme ended in cancellation , and controversy surrounded the development of the supersonic airliner Concorde . Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well , when Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs , such as the Super Étendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1 , for which it would receive more profit , over the Anglo @-@ French Jaguar . 
 The initial plan was for Britain to buy 150 Jaguar " B " trainers , with its strike requirements being met by the advanced BAC @-@ Dassault AFVG aircraft , with France to buy 75 " E " trainers ( école ) and 75 " A " single @-@ seat strike attack aircraft ( <unk> ) . Dassault favoured its own Mirage G aircraft above the collaborative AFVG , and in June 1967 , France cancelled the AFVG on cost grounds . This left a gap in the RAF 's planned strike capabilities for the 1970s ; at the same time as France 's cancellation of the AFVG , Germany was expressing a serious interest in the Jaguar , and thus the design became more oriented towards the low @-@ level strike role . 
 By October 1970 , the RAF 's requirements had changed to 165 single @-@ seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers . The Jaguar was to replace the McDonnell Douglas Phantom <unk> in the close air support , tactical reconnaissance and tactical strike roles , freeing the Phantom to be used for air defence . Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly , and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively . The French , meanwhile , had chosen the Jaguar to replace the Aeronavale 's Dassault Étendard IV , and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier @-@ capable maritime version of the Jaguar , the Jaguar M , for the Aeronavale . From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and entirely different aircraft : relatively high @-@ tech , supersonic , and optimised for ground @-@ attack in a high @-@ threat environment . 
 = = = Prototypes = = = 
 The first of eight prototypes flew on 8 September 1968 , a two @-@ seat design fitted with the first production model Adour engine . This aircraft later went supersonic on its third flight but was lost on landing on 26 March 1970 following an engine fire . The second prototype flew in February 1969 ; a total of three prototypes appeared in flight at the Paris Air Show that year . The first French " A " prototype flew in March 1969 . In October a British " S " conducted its first flight . 
 An " M " prototype flew in November 1969 . The " M " had a strengthened airframe , an arrestor hook and different undercarriage : twin nosewheel and single mainwheels . After testing in France it went to RAE at <unk> for carrier landing trials from their land based catapult . In July 1970 it made real take offs and landings from the French carrier Clemenceau . From these trials there were doubts about the throttle response in case of an aborted landing ; the shipboard testing has also revealed problems with the aircraft 's handling when flying on one engine , although planned engine improvements were to have rectified these problems . The " M " was considered a suitable replacement for the <unk> IV but the Aeronavale would only be able to purchase 60 instead of 100 aircraft . 
 Furthermore , the Jaguar M was expensive , limiting the size of the force the French Navy could afford . In 1971 , Dassault proposed the Super Étendard , claiming that it was a simpler and cheap development of the existing Étendard IV , and in 1973 , the French Navy agreed to order it instead of the Jaguar , although rising costs of the Super Étendard meant that only 71 of the planned 100 aircraft were purchased . The M was cancelled by the French government in 1973 .

The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10 @,@ 000 lb ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) , typical weapons fitted included the <unk> <unk> rocket pod , BAP 100 @-@ mm bombs , <unk> <unk> anti @-@ radar missiles , AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder missiles , and Rockeye cluster bombs . The RAF 's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War , including CRV7 high @-@ velocity rockets and American CBU @-@ 87 cluster bombs . Finally , the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons , or alternatively British Aden cannons . 
 The Jaguar International had the unusual optional provision for overwing pylons , used for short @-@ range air @-@ to @-@ air missiles , such as the Matra R550 Magic or the AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder . This option frees up the under @-@ wing pylons for other weapons and stores . RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990 , but French Jaguars were not modified . The RAF 's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of <unk> on the overwing launchers , but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts . 
 = = = Engine = = = 
 The SEPECAT Jaguar is powered by the Rolls @-@ Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofan engine , which was developed in parallel and primarily for the Jaguar . A separate partnership was formed between Rolls @-@ Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour , a two @-@ shaft turbofan engine equipped with afterburners . Twin engines were selected for survivability ; ease of maintenance was a major consideration , an engine change being possible within 30 minutes . For the Jaguars it needed a high @-@ bypass capable of high thrust for take @-@ off , supersonic flight and low level " dashes " . 
 When the first prototype Jaguar flew on 8 September 1968 , it was also the first flight for the engine . In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the afterburner system , and shipboard testing showed slow throttle response times , problematic in the situation of an aborted landing ; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service . In French service , the Jaguars were introduced using the original <unk> engine . RAF Jaguars entered service using the <unk> engine , mainly featuring better afterburner @-@ throttle control over the <unk> in 1974 , the RAF later had its Jaguars re @-@ engined around 1981 with improved Adour <unk> , and again in 1999 with the <unk> , each providing greater performance . 
 The Adour was developed into both afterburning and non @-@ afterburning models ; the BAE Hawk , which had beaten the Jaguar to fulfill the Air Staff Target 362 trainer requirement , also adopted the non @-@ afterburning Adour engine developed for the Jaguar . The Adour engine found use in several aircraft abroad , such as the McDonnell Douglas T @-@ 45 Goshawk , the Mitsubishi T @-@ 2 , and the Mitsubishi F @-@ 1 ( which resembles the Jaguar ) . Even following the Jaguar 's retirement in Europe , the Adour continues to be an active product with new variants being developed . As of Feb 2013 , the Indian Air Force was considering the fitting of 125 Jaguars with new Honeywell <unk> engines 
 = = = Avionics = = = 
 Although in operational theatres such as the Gulf War the Jaguar proved to be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado , the aircraft 's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions . Owing to the Jaguar 's original shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition , French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage <unk> reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides for the Jaguars . The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign , the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties , with no aircraft lost . Significant changes were made both during and shortly after the war . 
 Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required , both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receivers , a recent technology at the time . Prior to 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina known as Operation Deliberate Force , a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively . Shortly afterwards , the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet to a common standard , incorporating TIALD and the ability to use new reconnaissance pods . The interim GR3 ( Jaguar 96 ) upgrade added a new HUD , a new hand controller and stick top , integrated GPS and <unk> Terrain Referenced Navigation . The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A introduced the new EO <unk> ( <unk> ) digital reconnaissance pod , a helmet @-@ mounted sight , improved cockpit displays , a datalink , and improved night vision goggles compatibility . 
 A single Jaguar was converted into the Jaguar Active Control Technology ( ACT ) with fly @-@ by @-@ wire controls and aerodynamic alterations to the airframe ; the aerodynamic instability improved manoeuvrability and the test data was used in the development of the Eurofighter .

 The French Air Force took delivery of the first production Jaguar in 1973 , one of an eventual 160 single @-@ seat Jaguar As . For type conversion training , France also took 40 of the two @-@ seat Jaguar E. While the Jaguar was capable of carrying a single AN @-@ 52 nuclear bomb , the French government did not assign any Jaguars for use in the Force de frappe , France 's strategic nuclear deterrent ; this task was carried out by the Dassault Mirage IV , and the later Mirage 2000 @-@ N. Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the " Pre @-@ Strategic " role , to clear a path for the Strategic strike force . The AN @-@ 52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991 , when the formerly nuclear @-@ armed squadrons of Escadron de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack . French Jaguars also performed in the role of Electronic Counter Measures ( ECM ) aircraft , bearing the Martel anti @-@ radiation missile , capable of staying airborne to suppress enemy defences for long periods of time through mid air refuelling . 
 In French service , the Jaguar was frequently deployed in defence of national interests in Africa during the 1970s , a policy sometimes referred to as " Jaguar diplomacy " ( la <unk> du Jaguar ) . Jaguars made their combat debut against Polisario Front forces in Mauritania in December 1977 , as part of Opération <unk> . In August 1978 a conventionally armed rapid reaction squadron was established , intended to deploy in support of French forces and interests to anywhere in the world . One Jaguar was shot down in 1978 by an SA @-@ 7 missile of the Polisario Front . 
 France had been involved in the conflict in Chad for many years , and 2 @,@ 000 men of the Force d <unk> along with helicopters and Jaguars were deployed to defend central Chad in 1978 , further forces arriving later as part of Opération <unk> . The Jaguars were engaged in May and June 1978 , contributing significantly in halting an offensive by Goukouni Oueddei 's FROLINAT forces , who were routed . One aircraft was shot down , but the pilot was recovered by helicopter . 
 In support of the further military action in the region , known as Operation Manta , Jaguars were deployed to Bangui , Central African Republic , in 1983 , before being rebased inside Chad at N 'Djamena International Airport . On 25 January 1984 , Jaguars attacked a rebel column that was withdrawing after raiding the town of <unk> . One aircraft was shot down and the pilot , Captain Michel <unk> , was killed ; the Libyans denied involvement . The " Manta " forces were withdrawn in 1984 , as part of a de @-@ escalation agreement , whereby both Libyan and French forces were to be withdrawn from Chad . The Libyans did not respect the agreement , and Jaguars returned to Chad in 1986 , as part of Operation Epervier , this time with a more forceful role . On 16 February 1986 , 11 Jaguars , escorted by Mirage F @-@ 1 fighters and supported by C @-@ <unk> tankers and Breguet Atlantic aircraft , launched a raid on the airfield at Wadi Doum , which the Libyans had constructed in Northern Chad , using BAP @-@ 100 anti @-@ runway bombs . In response to Libyan incursions , another strike was carried out on 7 January 1987 , when a Jaguar destroyed a Libyan radar with a Martel missile . The Jaguars stationed at <unk> were a target for Libyan sabotage owing to their effectiveness against enemy forces , but the attempts were unsuccessful . 
 As France was not then a full member of NATO , joint operations with British Jaguars were limited in the 1980s . Jaguars from France were dispatched to participate in several coalition campaigns in the 1990s , from the 1991 Gulf War to the 1999 Kosovo conflict . In Operation Deliberate Force , the NATO bombing campaign over Bosnia in 1995 , six Jaguars , based in Italy , conducted 63 strike missions . The last Jaguars in French service were retired in 2005 , being replaced in the ground attack roles by the Dassault Rafale .

 The RAF accepted delivery of the first of 165 single @-@ seat Jaguar GR1s ( the service designation of the Jaguar S ) with 54 ( F ) squadron in 1974 . These were supplemented by 35 two @-@ seat trainers , the Jaguar T2 ( previously Jaguar B ) . The Jaguar S and B had a more comprehensive nav / attack system than the A and E models ( consisting of a Ferranti / Marconi NAVWASS ( <unk> and Weapon @-@ Aiming Sub @-@ System ) and a Plessey 10 Way Weapon Control System ) used by the French Air Force . RAF Jaguars were used for rapid deployment and regional reinforcement , and others flew in the tactical nuclear strike role , carrying the WE.177 bomb . 
 Beginning in 1975 with 6 Squadron , followed by 54 Squadron based at RAF Coltishall , and a ' Shadow squadron ' , 226 OCU ( a reserve unit with a peacetime training role ) based at RAF Lossiemouth , Jaguar squadrons were declared operational to SACEUR with the British nuclear weapon <unk> 14 Squadron and 17 Squadron based at RAF Bruggen followed by 1977 . 20 Squadron and 31 Squadron also based at RAF Bruggen brought the RAF Jaguar force to its peak strength of six squadrons plus the OCU , each of twelve aircraft equipped with eight WE.177 nuclear weapons . Two further squadrons , 2 Squadron and 41 Squadron based at RAF Laarbruch and RAF Coltishall respectively , were primarily tasked with tactical reconnaissance . From 1975 the OCU 's wartime role was as an operational squadron in the front line assigned to SACEUR with 12 Jaguar aircraft , eight WE.177 nuclear bombs , and a variety of conventional weapons . 
 In April 1975 , a single Jaguar was used to test the aircraft 's rough airstrip capacity , by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway , the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load ; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways might be the only runways left available in a large @-@ scale European conflict . In a high @-@ intensity European war , the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe , striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate . The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one @-@ third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase , leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs . 
 From December 1983 , 75 Jaguar GR1s and 14 T2s were updated to the GR1A and T2A standards with <unk> navigation and attack systems replacing the original NAVWASS . At about the same time , most were also re @-@ engined with Adour 104 engines and were fitted with the ability to carry Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles or AN @-@ ALQ @-@ 101 ( V ) -10 electronic countermeasures pods under the wings . 
 The RAF Jaguar force was altered in late 1984 , when 17 Squadron , 20 Squadron and 31 Squadron exchanged their Jaguars for Tornado GR1s , although their assignment to SACEUR and their wartime role remained unchanged . The two other RAF Germany units , 14 Squadron and 2 Squadron , followed suit in 1985 and 1989 respectively , which left the operational Jaguar force concentrated in 6 , 41 and 54 Squadrons at RAF Coltishall . 
 In 1991 , 12 RAF Jaguars participated in the Gulf War . In 1994 , in order to meet an urgent need to increase the number of aircraft able to designate targets for laser @-@ guided bombs , 10 GR1As and two <unk> were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively . TIALD equipped Jaguar <unk> were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces , being used to designate targets for RAF Harriers . During the Bosnian operations , a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before . 
 Following the success of the GR1B / T2B upgrade , the RAF launched a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard , incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War , together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods . The upgrade came in two parts ; the interim GR3 ( Jaguar 96 ) upgrade added a new HUD , a new hand controller and stick top , integrated GPS and <unk> Terrain Referenced Navigation . It was delivered in two standards , for recce and TIALD . The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A ( also known as Jaguar 97 ) introduced fleet @-@ wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO <unk> ( <unk> ) digital reconnaissance pod , a helmet mounted sight , improved cockpit displays , a datalink , and improved Night vision goggles compatibility . All <unk> were subsequently re @-@ engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan . 
 The Jaguars did not see service in the 2003 Iraq War ; they had been planned to operate from bases in Turkey , to the north of Iraq , but Turkey refused access to its airbases and the northern attack was cancelled . Demands by the UK Treasury to cut the defence budget led to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailing plans on 21 July 2004 to withdraw the Jaguar by 2007 . An expected date of October 2007 for the out of service date was brought forward at just five days notice to 30 April 2007 . On 20 December 2007 , a Jaguar operated by <unk> undertook the last ever British military Jaguar flight . 
 Following their retirement from flying service , many Jaguars continue to serve as ground instructional airframes , most notably at RAF Cosford , used in the training of RAF fitters . 
 = = = India = = = 
 India had been approached as a possible customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968 , but had declined , partly on the grounds that it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service . A decade later they would become the largest single export customer , with a $ 1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978 , the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process . The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton , and 120 licence @-@ built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ( HAL ) under the local name Shamsher ( " Sword of Justice " ) . 
 As an interim measure , 18 Royal Air Force Jaguars were loaned to the Indian Air Force , with the first two loaned aircraft operational with Western Air Command on 27 July 1979 . The second batch of aircraft for the Indian Air Force were 40 Jaguar Internationals built at Warton , the first aircraft being delivered in March 1981 . Batch Three was the assembly of another 45 aircraft by HAL of kits shipped from the United Kingdom , the first kit being shipped to India in May 1981 . In the following phases more aircraft would be built in India with less European content . 
 Indian Jaguars were used to carry out reconnaissance missions in support of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990 . They later played an active role in the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan , dropping both unguided and laser @-@ guided bombs , the IAF defining its role as a " deep penetrating strike aircraft " . The Jaguar is also used in small numbers for the anti @-@ ship role , equipped with the Sea Eagle missile . The Jaguar remains an important element of the Indian military as , along with the Mirage 2000 , the Jaguar has been described as one of the few aircraft capable of performing the nuclear strike role with reasonable chances of success . It has been alleged that the Indian military decided against developing the Jaguar into an active nuclear platform because of its lack of ground clearance for deploying India 's gravity @-@ dropped nuclear bombs . 
 As the aircraft aged , the avionics were viewed as lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission , such as terrain @-@ following radar , GPS navigation or modern night @-@ flight systems ; consequently , several upgrades were carried out in the mid @-@ 1990s , including the addition of the Litening targeting pod . India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001 – 2002 . The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics ( including multi mode radar , auto @-@ pilot and other changes ) as part of the <unk> III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines , Honeywell <unk> to improve performance , particularly at medium altitudes . 
 = = = Persian Gulf War = = = 
 Following the invasion of Kuwait , on 9 August 1990 the British government assigned an initial 12 Jaguar GR1A and 12 Tornado F3 aircraft to the Middle East in Operation Granby , these aircraft operated from bases in Oman and Bahrain . On 23 August 1990 , a squadron of Tornado GR1 interdictors were dispatched to the region as well , but the Tornado GR1 was difficult to keep operational in the high temperatures . Blackburn Buccaneers were dispatched in January 1991 to act as laser designators for the ground strike aircraft . The RAF 's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Persian Gulf War , including CRV7 high @-@ velocity rockets and American CBU @-@ 87 cluster bombs which were used because the RAF 's existing BL755 bombs were designed for low @-@ level release , and therefore unsuitable for higher @-@ altitude operations common over the Persian Gulf . The RAF 's detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties , with no aircraft being lost . <unk> " <unk> " flew 47 missions ; the highest number of missions of any aircraft . 
 France also committed military assets to the coalition ; in October 1990 , eight Jaguar A aircraft along with several Dassault Mirage <unk> reconnaissance aircraft were sent to the Middle East , with the Mirages , which had more advanced avionics , acting as guides for the Jaguars . Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required , both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers , RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent . The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up to a maximum of 28 aircraft , which carried out 615 combat sorties , with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface @-@ to @-@ air missile . Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units , Scud missile sites , and naval vessels . 
 On 15 January 1991 , 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base , Kuwait ; three were damaged in the attack but all returned to base . On 26 January , RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country . On the 30th , two RAF Jaguars destroyed a <unk> @-@ class landing ship with rockets and cannon . The Iraqi Republican Guard , entrenched on the Kuwait @-@ Saudi border , were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them , allied Jaguars forming a portion of the delivering aircraft . The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces . Both nations ' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991 , at the end of Desert Storm . 
 = = = Other operators = = = 
 Early in development , it was decided that the Jaguar should be offered for export . In 1969 , while still in the prototype stage of development , formal approaches had been made to Switzerland , India , Japan , Australia , the Netherlands , Belgium , and Germany , promoting the aircraft for sale . Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar , but these plans failed in part because of the high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT . A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition . Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders . Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s , but instead firmed up for <unk> . Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice , the LTV A @-@ 7 Corsair II , due to an arms embargo ; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s . 
 Jaguars were successfully sold to a number of overseas countries , India being the most prolific operator . The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador , Nigeria and Oman . The Ecuadorian Air Force , the only Latin American export customer , purchased 10 single- and 2 two @-@ seat variants , officially designated Jaguars ES and EB , respectively . The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977 . They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the <unk> War with Peru in 1995 , but the main part of the fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians . Nigeria ordered 13 single @-@ seat SN and 5 two @-@ seat BN variants ; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984 . A subsequent order for an 18 @-@ aircraft second batch was cancelled . Some of those in service were withdrawn from operations on the grounds of economy , with the remaining aircraft put up for re @-@ sale . The Royal Air Force of Oman , like Ecuador , ordered 10 single @-@ seat and 2 two @-@ seat variants , designated Jaguars OS and OB , respectively ; the first was delivered in March 1977 . A second identical 12 @-@ aircraft order was placed in the mid @-@ 1980s ; these were joined by two ex @-@ IAF and ex @-@ RAF examples . The last of the Omani aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014 .

 = Battle of Thermopylae = 
 The Battle of Thermopylae ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ MOP @-@ i @-@ lee ; Greek : Μάχη τῶν <unk> , Machē tōn <unk> ) was fought between an alliance of Greek city @-@ states , led by King Leonidas of Sparta , and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I over the course of three days , during the second Persian invasion of Greece . It took place simultaneously with the naval battle at Artemisium , in August or September 480 BC , at the narrow coastal pass of Thermopylae ( " The Hot Gates " ) . The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece , which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC . Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy , and set out to conquer all of Greece . The Athenian general Themistocles had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae , and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium . 
 A Greek force of approximately 7 @,@ 000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC . The Persian army , alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million , but today considered to have been much smaller ( various figures are given by scholars , ranging between about 100 @,@ 000 and 150 @,@ 000 ) , arrived at the pass in late August or early September . The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days ( including three of battle ) before the rear @-@ guard was annihilated in one of history 's most famous last stands . During two full days of battle , the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass . After the second day , a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines . Leonidas , aware that his force was being outflanked , dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans , 700 Thespians , 400 Thebans , and perhaps a few hundred others , most of whom were killed . 
 At Artemisium , the Greek navy , under the command of the Athenian politician Themistocles , received news of the defeat . Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held , and given their losses , it was decided to withdraw to Salamis . The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated Athens . The Greek fleet — seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada — attacked and defeated the invaders at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC . Fearful of being trapped in Europe , Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia ( losing most to starvation and disease ) , leaving Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece . However , the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea , thereby ending the Persian invasion . 
 Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil . The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training , equipment , and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Greek city @-@ states of Athens and Eretria had encouraged the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499 – 494 BC . The Persian Empire was still relatively young , and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples . Darius , moreover , was a usurper , and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule . 
 The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire , and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved ; especially the Athenians , " since he was sure that [ the Ionians ] would not go unpunished for their rebellion " . Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece . A preliminary expedition under Mardonius in 492 BC to secure the land approaches to Greece re @-@ conquered Thrace , and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia . 
 Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city @-@ states in 491 BC asking for a gift of " earth and water " in token of their submission to him . Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year , the majority of Greek cities duly obliged . In Athens , however , the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit ; in Sparta , they were simply thrown down a well . This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia . 
 Darius thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC , which attacked Naxos , before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands . The task force then moved on Eretria , which it besieged and destroyed . Finally , it moved to attack Athens , landing at the bay of Marathon , where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army . At the ensuing Battle of Marathon , the Athenians won a remarkable victory , which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia . 
 Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece ; however , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition . Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt , and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt , and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece . Since this was to be a full @-@ scale invasion , it required long @-@ term planning , stockpiling and conscription . Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe , and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos ( rounding which headland , a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC ) . These were both feats of exceptional ambition , which would have been beyond any other contemporary state . By early 480 BC , the preparations were complete , and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe , crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges . 
 The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid @-@ 480s BC , and in 482 BC the decision was taken , under the guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles , to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be essential for the Greeks to fight the Persians . However , the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on both land and sea ; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states . In 481 BC , Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for ' earth and water ' but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta . Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states . A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC , and a confederate alliance of Greek city @-@ states was formed . It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation . This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world , especially since many of the city @-@ states in attendance were still technically at war with each other . 
 The ' congress ' met again in the spring of 480 BC . A Thessalian delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe , on the borders of Thessaly , and thereby block Xerxes ' advance . A force of 10 @,@ 000 hoplites was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe , through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass . However , once there , being warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through <unk> Pass , and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming , the Greeks retreated . Shortly afterwards , they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont . 
 A second strategy was therefore suggested by Themistocles to the Greeks . The route to southern Greece ( Boeotia , Attica and the Peloponnesus ) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae . This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites , despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians . Furthermore , to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea , the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium . This dual strategy was adopted by the congress . However , the Peloponnesian cities made fall @-@ back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to that , whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The Persian army seems to have made slow progress through Thrace and Macedon . News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy . At this time of year the Spartans , de facto military leaders of the alliance , were celebrating the festival of Carneia . During the Carneia , military activity was forbidden by Spartan law ; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement . It was also the time of the Olympic Games , and therefore the Olympic truce , and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war . On this occasion , the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass , under one of its kings , Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard , the Hippeis . This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible , and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army . 
 The legend of Thermopylae , as told by Herodotus , has it that the Spartans consulted the Oracle at Delphi earlier in the year . The Oracle is said to have made the following prophecy : 
 O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad Lacedaemon ! Honor the festival of the Carneia ! ! Otherwise , Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of Perseus , Or , in exchange , must all through the whole Laconian country 
 Mourn for the loss of a king , descendant of great Heracles . 
 Herodotus tells us that Leonidas , in line with the prophecy , was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory , and so he selected only Spartans with living sons . 
 The Spartan force was reinforced en route to Thermopylae by contingents from various cities and numbered more than 7 @,@ 000 by the time it arrived at the pass . Leonidas chose to camp at , and defend , the ' middle gate ' , the narrowest part of the pass of Thermopylae , where the Phocians had built a defensive wall some time before . News also reached Leonidas , from the nearby city of Trachis , that there was a mountain track which could be used to outflank the pass of Thermopylae . Leonidas stationed 1 @,@ 000 Phocians on the heights to prevent such a manoeuvre . 
 Finally , in mid @-@ August , the Persian army was sighted across the Malian Gulf approaching Thermopylae . With the Persian army 's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war . Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus . The Phocians and Locrians , whose states were located nearby , became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help . Leonidas calmed the panic and agreed to defend Thermopylae . According to Plutarch , when one of the soldiers complained that " Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun " , Leonidas replied : " Won 't it be nice , then , if we shall have shade in which to fight them ? " Herodotus reports a similar comment , but attributes it to <unk> . 
 A Persian emissary was sent by Xerxes to negotiate with Leonidas . The Greeks were offered their freedom and the title " Friends of the Persian People " . Moreover , they would be re @-@ settled on land better than that they possessed . When these terms were refused by Leonidas , the ambassador carried a written message by Xerxes , asking him to " Hand over your arms " . Leonidas ' famous response was for the Persians to " Come and take them " ( Μολὼν λαβέ ) . With the Persian embassy returning empty @-@ handed , battle became inevitable . Xerxes delayed for four days , waiting for the Greeks to disperse , before sending troops to attack them .

 = = = Persian army = = = 
 The number of troops which Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece has been the subject of endless dispute , because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed . Herodotus claimed that there were , in total , 2 @.@ 6 million military personnel , accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel . The poet Simonides , who was a near @-@ contemporary , talks of four million ; Ctesias gave 800 @,@ 000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes . 
 Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic , and as a result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors . Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 70 @,@ 000 – 300 @,@ 000 . These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era , the sustainability of their respective base of operations , and the overall manpower constraints affecting them . Whatever the real numbers were , however , it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea . The number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force . For instance , it is unclear whether the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae , or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly . 
 = = = Greek army = = = 
 According to Herodotus , and Diodorus Siculus , the Greek army included the following forces : 
 Notes : 
 The number of Peloponnesians 
 Diodorus suggests that there were 1 @,@ 000 Lacedemonians and 3 @,@ 000 other Peloponnesians , for a total of 4 @,@ 000 . Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage , quoting an inscription by Simonides saying there were 4 @,@ 000 Peloponnesians . However , elsewhere , in the passage summarized by the above table , Herodotus tallies 3 @,@ 100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle . Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes ' public showing of the dead , " helots were also there for them to see " , but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served . Thus , the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing ( without proof ) that there were 900 helots ( three per Spartan ) present at the battle . If helots were present at the battle , there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans . Alternatively , Herodotus ' " missing " 900 troops might have been <unk> , and could therefore correspond to Diodorus ' 1 @,@ 000 Lacedemonians . 
 The number of Lacedemonians 
 Further confusing the issue is Diodorus ' ambiguity about whether his 1 @,@ 000 Lacedemonians include the 300 Spartans . At one point he says : " Leonidas , when he received the appointment , announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign ' " . However , he then says that : " There were , then , of the Lacedaemonians one thousand , and with them three hundred Spartiates " . It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point . 
 Pausanias ' account agrees with that of Herodotus ( whom he probably read ) except that he gives the number of Locrians , which Herodotus declined to estimate . Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance , they gave all the fighting men they had ; according to Pausanias 6 @,@ 000 men , which added to Herodotus ' 5 @,@ 200 would have given a force of 11 @,@ 200 . 
 Many modern historians , who usually consider Herodotus more reliable , add the 1 @,@ 000 Lacedaemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus ' 5 @,@ 200 to obtain 7 @,@ 100 or about 7 @,@ 000 men as a standard number , neglecting Diodorus ' <unk> and Pausanias ' Locrians . However , this is only one approach , and many other combinations are plausible . Furthermore , the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3 @,@ 000 men remained ( 300 Spartans , 700 Thespians , 400 Thebans , possibly up to 900 helots and 1 @,@ 000 Phocians stationed above the pass ; less the casualties sustained in the previous days ) . 
 = = Strategic and tactical considerations = = 
 From a strategic point of view , by defending Thermopylae , the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces . As long as they could prevent further Persian advance into Greece , they had no need to seek a decisive battle , and could thus remain on the defensive . Moreover , by defending two constricted passages ( Thermopylae and Artemisium ) , the Greeks ' inferior numbers became less of a factor . Conversely , for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant that the Persians could not remain in the same place for too long . The Persians therefore had to retreat or advance ; and advancing required the pass of Thermopylae to be forced . 
 Tactically , the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare . A hoplite phalanx would be able to block the narrow pass with ease , with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry . In the pass , the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry . The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae , and which would allow their position to be outflanked . Although probably unsuitable for cavalry , this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry ( many of whom were versed in mountain warfare ) . Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis , and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route . 
 = = = Topography of the battlefield = = = 
 At the time , the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time . On the southern side of the track stood the cliffs that overlooked the pass , and on the north side was the Malian Gulf . Along the path itself was a series of three constrictions , or " gates " ( <unk> ) , and at the center gate a short wall that had been erected by the Phocians in the previous century to aid in their defense against Thessalian invasions . The name " Hot Gates " comes from the hot springs that were located there . 
 The terrain of the battlefield was nothing that Xerxes and his forces were accustomed to . Although coming from a mountainous country , the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded . The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year , combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground . Vegetation is scarce and consists of low shrubs that are of the thorny type . The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush , some plants reaching 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . With a dangerous cliff to the ocean on one side and steep , impassable hills on the other , King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders . 
 Today , the pass is not near the sea , but is several kilometres inland because of sedimentation in the Malian Gulf . The old track appears at the foot of hills around the plain , flanked by a modern road . Recent core samples indicate that the pass was only 100 metres ( 330 ft ) wide and the waters came up to the gates ; " Little do the visitors realize that the battle took place across the road from the monument . " The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies , and British Commonwealth forces in World War II made a defense in 1941 against the Nazi invasion metres from the original battlefield .

 = = = First day = = = 
 On the fifth day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and the first day of the battle , Xerxes finally resolved to attack the Greeks . First , he ordered five thousand archers to fire a barrage of arrows , but they were ineffective ; they fired from at least 100 yards away , according to modern day scholars , and the Greeks ' bronze shields and helmets deflected the missiles . After that , Xerxes sent a force of ten thousand Medes and Cissians to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him . The Persians soon launched a frontal assault , in waves of around 10 @,@ 000 men , on the Greek position . The Greeks fought in front of the Phocian wall , at the narrowest part of the pass , which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible . Details of the tactics are scant ; Diodorus says " the men stood shoulder to shoulder " and the Greeks were " superior in valor and in the great size of their shields . " This probably describes the standard Greek phalanx , in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields , which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass . The weaker shields and shorter spears and swords of the Persians prevented them from effectively engaging the Greek hoplites . Herodotus says that the units for each city were kept together ; units were rotated in and out of the battle to prevent fatigue , which implies the Greeks had more men than necessary to block the pass . The Greeks killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have stood up three times from the seat from which he was watching the battle . According to Ctesias , the first wave was " cut to ribbons " , with only two or three Spartans killed in return . 
 According to Herodotus and Diodorus , the king , having taken the measure of the enemy , threw his best troops into a second assault the same day , the Immortals , an elite corps of 10 @,@ 000 men . However , the Immortals fared no better than the Medes , failing to make any headway against the Greeks . The Spartans apparently used a tactic of feigning retreat , and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them . 
 = = = Second day = = = 
 On the second day , Xerxes again sent in the infantry to attack the pass , " supposing that their enemies , being so few , were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist . " However , the Persians had no more success on the second day than on the first . Xerxes at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp , " totally perplexed " . 
 Late that day , however , as the Persian king was pondering what to do next , he received a windfall ; a <unk> named Ephialtes informed him of the mountain path around Thermopylae and offered to guide the Persian army . Ephialtes was motivated by the desire for a reward . For this act , the name of Ephialtes received a lasting stigma , his name coming to mean " nightmare " in the Greek language and becoming the archetypal traitor in Greek culture . 
 Herodotus reports that Xerxes sent his commander Hydarnes that evening , with the men under his command , the Immortals , to encircle the Greeks via the path . However , he does not say who those men were . The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day , so it is possible that Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including what was left of the Immortals , and indeed , according to Diodorus , Hydarnes had a force of 20 @,@ 000 for the mission . The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt . <unk> behind the cliffs that flanked the pass . It branched , with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at <unk> , first town of Locris .
