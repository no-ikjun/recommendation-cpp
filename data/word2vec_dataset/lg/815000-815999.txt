 The converted ship would have been 180 @.@ 4 meters ( 592 ft ) long at the waterline and 192 @.@ 5 m ( 632 ft ) long overall . She would have had a beam of 24 @.@ 4 m ( 80 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 6 m ( 18 ft ) as designed . Her designed displacement would have been 11 @,@ 400 long tons ( 11 @,@ 600 t ) . The ship 's propulsion system consisted of two sets of Rateau @-@ Bretagne geared steam turbines , with steam supplied by four Indret ultra @-@ high pressure boilers . The engines were rated at 10 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) and would have provided a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . The carrier would have had a range of 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at a cruising speed of 19 kn ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 As converted , the ship was to be armed with several anti @-@ aircraft guns . The heavy anti @-@ aircraft battery consisted of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) SK C / 33 guns in twin mountings . The mounts were the Dopp LC / 31 type , originally designed for earlier 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK C / 31 guns . The LC / 31 mounting was triaxially @-@ stabilized and capable of elevating to 80 ° . This enabled the guns to engage targets up to a ceiling of 12 @,@ 500 m ( 41 @,@ 000 ft ) . Against surface targets , the guns had a maximum range of 17 @,@ 700 m ( 58 @,@ 100 ft ) . The guns fired fixed ammunition weighing 15 @.@ 1 kg ( 33 lb ) ; the guns could fire HE and HE incendiary rounds , as well as illumination shells . Close @-@ range anti @-@ aircraft weaponry consisted of twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) SK C / 30 guns and twenty @-@ four 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Flak 38 guns . The 3 @.@ 7 cm gun was a single @-@ shot gun , with a rate of fire of around 30 rounds per minute . At its maximum elevation of 85 ° , the gun had a ceiling of 6 @,@ 800 m ( 22 @,@ 300 ft ) . The 2 cm gun was a magazine @-@ fed automatic weapon , firing at up to 500 rounds per minute . Twenty and forty @-@ round magazines were supplied for the guns ; 
 The ship 's aircraft facilities consisted of a 177 @.@ 5 m ( 582 ft ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) wide flight deck and two elevators . Aircraft were handled in a single hangar , which was 142 m ( 466 ft ) long and 18 @.@ 6 m ( 61 ft ) wide . The ship 's air complement was to have consisted of eleven Bf 109 fighters and twelve Ju 87 Stuka dive @-@ bombers . The Bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of the " E " model , designated as Bf 109T . Their wings were longer than the land @-@ based model to allow for shorter take @-@ off . The Ju 87s were to have been the " E " variant , which was a navalized version of the Ju 87D , and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear . 
 = Polish minority in the Czech Republic = 
 The Polish minority in the Czech Republic ( Polish : Polska <unk> <unk> w Republice Czeskiej , Czech : <unk> <unk> <unk> v České <unk> ) is a Polish national minority living mainly in the Zaolzie region of western Cieszyn Silesia . The Polish community is the only national ( or ethnic ) minority in the Czech Republic that is linked to a specific geographical area . Zaolzie is located in the north @-@ eastern part of the country . It comprises Karviná District and the eastern part of Frýdek @-@ <unk> District . Many Poles living in other regions of the Czech Republic have roots in Zaolzie as well . 
 Poles formed the largest ethnic group in Cieszyn Silesia in the 19th century , but at the beginning of the 20th century the Czech population grew . The Czechs and Poles collaborated on resisting Germanization movements , but this collaboration ceased after World War I. In 1920 the region of Zaolzie was incorporated into Czechoslovakia after the Polish – Czechoslovak War . Since then the Polish population demographically decreased . In 1938 it was annexed by Poland in the context of the Munich Agreement and in 1939 by Nazi Germany . The region was then given back to Czechoslovakia after World War II . Polish organizations were re @-@ created , but were banned by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia . After the Velvet Revolution Polish organizations were re @-@ created again and Zaolzie had adopted bilingual signs . 
 = = History = = 
 Historically , the largest ethnic group inhabiting the Zaolzie area was the Poles . During the 19th century the number of Germans grew . At the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 , the Czech population grew significantly ( mainly as a result of immigration and the assimilation of locals ) and the Poles became a minority , which they are to this day . 
 From 1848 , the national consciousness of the local people grew and from 1848 to the end of the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co @-@ operated , uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire , and later of Austria @-@ Hungary . Various Polish clubs were founded . Most schools were Polish , followed by German and Czech . At the end of the century , ethnic tensions appeared as the area 's economic significance grew . This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia , when about 60 @,@ 000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910 . They settled mainly in the <unk> region , but also in Zaolzie . The new immigrants were Polish and poor , about half of them being illiterate , and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy . For these people , the most important factor was material well @-@ being ; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled , more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia . The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines . Germans were economically strongest , mostly owners , Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials , and Poles were mostly manual workers , miners , and metallurgists . This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar , with 61 @.@ 5 % of Poles working as labourers . 
 = = = Decision time ( 1918 – 20 ) = = = 
 There was a very tense climate in 1918 – 1920 , a time of decision . It was decided that a plebiscite would be held in Cieszyn Silesia asking people which country the territory should join . Plebiscite commissioners arrived at the end of January 1920 and after analyzing the situation declared a state of emergency in the territory on 19 May 1920 . The situation in the territory remained very tense . Mutual intimidation , acts of terror , beatings , and even killings affected the area . A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere . On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision . Eventually 58 @.@ 1 % of the area of Cieszyn Silesia and 67 @.@ 9 % of the population was incorporated into Czechoslovakia on 28 July 1920 by a decision of the Spa Conference . This division was in practice what gave birth to the concept of the Zaolzie — which literally means " the land beyond the Olza River " ( looking from Poland ) . 
 = = = In Czechoslovakia ( 1920 – 38 ) = = = 
 Local Czech militants forced about 5 @,@ 000 local Poles , mostly from the northern part of the region , to flee to Poland already before July 1920 . 4 @,@ 000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim . About 12 @,@ 000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia . The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division . It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia . Estimates range from 110 @,@ 000 to 140 @,@ 000 people in 1921 . The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self @-@ declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits . Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities , but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different . The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship , while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school . Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped , thus inducing some Poles to send their children there . This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland . After a few years , the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co @-@ operated with the Czechs . Still , <unk> was supported by Prague , which did not abide by certain laws related to language , legislative , and organizational issues . Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put that issues on agenda . One way or the other , increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population . 
 = = = In Poland ( 1938 – 39 ) = = = 
 On 1 October 1938 Zaolzie was annexed by Poland following the Munich Conference . The Polish Army , commanded by General Władysław <unk> , annexed an area of 801 @.@ 5 km ² ( 309 @.@ 5 mi ² ) with a population of 227 @,@ 399 . The Polish side argued that Poles in Zaolzie deserved the same rights as Germans in the Munich Agreement . The vast majority of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change , seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice . But they quickly changed their mood . The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various positions from which Czechs had been dismissed . The Polish language became the sole official language . Rapid Polonization followed . Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited . Czech education ceased to exist . About 35 @,@ 000 Czechs emigrated to Czechoslovakia by choice or forcibly . The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czech authorities before 1938 . Two political factions appeared : socialists ( the opposition ) and rightists ( loyal to the new authorities ) . Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often dismissed from their jobs . The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie . Local Polish people continued to feel like second @-@ class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938 . Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only eleven months . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 During the war , strong Germanization was introduced by the Nazi authorities . The Jews were in the worst position , followed by the Poles . Poles received lower food rations , they were supposed to pay extra taxes , and were not allowed to enter theatres , cinemas , and other venues . Polish and Czech education ceased to exist , Polish organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited . The Nazis especially targeted the Polish intelligentsia and many functionaries died during the war . The German authorities introduced terror into Zaolzie . Mass killings , executions , arrests , taking locals to forced labour , and deportations to concentration camps all happened on a daily basis . The most notorious war crime was a murder of 36 villagers in and around Żywocice on 6 August 1944 . Most of the victims were Poles . This massacre is known as Tragedia <unk> ( the Żywocice tragedy ) . The resistance movement , mostly of Poles , was fairly strong in Zaolzie . 
 <unk> , documents introduced by the Nazi authorities were soon introduced during the war . A non @-@ German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it and refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp . Local people who signed the lists were later on enrolled in the Wehrmacht . Many local people with no German ancestry were also forced to sign them . The World War II death toll in Zaolzie is estimated at about 6 @,@ 000 people : about 2 @,@ 500 Jews , 2 @,@ 000 other citizens ( 80 % of them being Poles ) , and more than 1 @,@ 000 locals who died in the Wehrmacht ( those who signed the Volksliste ) . Also a few hundred Poles from Zaolzie were among those murdered by the Soviets in the Katyń massacre . Percentage @-@ wise , Zaolzie suffered the worst human loss out of the whole of Czechoslovakia – about 2 @.@ 6 % of the total population . 
 = = = Since 1945 and during the Communist Era ( 1948 – 89 ) = = = 
 Immediately after World War II , Zaolzie was returned to Czechoslovakia within its 1920 borders , although local Poles hoped it would again be given to Poland . The local Polish population again suffered discrimination , as many Czechs blamed them for the discrimination by the Polish authorities in 1938 – 1939 . Polish organizations were banned , and the Czech authorities made many arrests and dismissed many from their jobs . Polish property stolen by the Germans during the war was never returned . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was the only political party defending the rights of the Polish minority . In the 1946 elections , the majority of Poles voted for the communists . In Zaolzie , 51 % of elected communist officials were ethnic Poles . The situation of Poles improved somewhat when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in February 1948 . The Polish Cultural and Educational Union ( PZKO ) was created in 1947 . The creation of other Polish organizations was prohibited . This was the only Polish organization representing the Polish minority in the communist era , and was therefore under the strong influence of the Communist Party . It remains today the Polish organization with the largest membership . 
 During the communist era , rapid urbanization and growth of heavy industry occurred . Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity . These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles . Another cause of assimilation was the high rate of intermarriage . Besides Poles belonging to the minority , many more commuted across the border from Polish People 's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or to take advantage of the relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia . 
 During the 1960s , cultural life flourished . Polish books were published and Polish sections in Czech libraries were set up . For example , the state Czech Postal and Newspaper Service was delivering 72 magazines from Poland . During the Prague Spring , the more liberal atmosphere also contributed to the growth of cultural life . After 1968 , purges were conducted throughout Czechoslovak society , including the Polish minority . Reformists were fired from their positions . The so @-@ called " normalization " also affected the PZKO . From 1976 the law recommended the introduction of bilingual signs in some municipalities . Being only a recommended measure , it was not implemented . The Czechoslovak communist authorities tried to limit the influence of Poles , resident or not , considering the influence of Poles ( given that Polish communist regime was considered more liberal ) in the workplace a threat to the regime . 
 = = Present times = = 
 After the Velvet Revolution of 1989 , under democratic conditions , Polish organizations were quickly created . The Rada Polaków ( Council of Poles ) was created in 1990 . The founders of the Council argued that the PZKO was not fulfilling its function of representing the Poles . The organization was renamed " Kongres Polaków " ( Congress of Poles ) in 1991 . It is the main body representing the Polish minority in negotiations with the Czech government , etc . Local border crossings with Poland were opened in mid @-@ 1991 , two years after the fall of communism . 
 = = Language and culture = = 
 The primary language of the Polish population in Zaolzie is the Cieszyn Silesian dialect , with the vast majority of Poles using it in everyday communication . The dialect is very prestigious and contributes to the pride of local people . It is also used by some local Czechs . Local Poles also feel a strong regional identity . In the Zaolzie region , a few church services are conducted in Polish . 90 % of worshippers among Polish secondary school students are reported to pray in Polish . 
 Concerning literature , there is a great variety of authors , genres , and editions produced in Polish . For traditional music , many groups are united in the association Ars Musica ; this association also includes many choirs , such as Collegium <unk> , Collegium <unk> , and Canticum Novum . Many other choirs and traditional folk vocal and dance groups exist , including Olza , Bystrzyca , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , among others . Pop and rock bands include <unk> , Glider , P @-@ <unk> , Apatheia , <unk> and other groups . The Cieszyn Theatre in Czeski Cieszyn ( Český Těšín ) has a Polish Scene ( ensemble ) . It is the only professional Polish theatre outside Poland . 
 Many cultural , folk , and music festivals are organized each year . The largest folklore festival of the Polish community and also the largest folklore festival in the Zaolzie region is the annual <unk> <unk> ( lit . Highlander 's Festival ) organized in <unk> ( Jablunkov ) . <unk> ( harvest festivals ) are organized each year in several villages . Music festivals include <unk> in Bystrzyca , <unk> in Wędrynia and <unk> Kultury <unk> ( Days of Student Culture ) in Bystrzyca . 
 There is a 15 @-@ minute daily radio broadcast in Polish by Czech Radio Ostrava . Czech TV has been broadcasting in Polish for ten minutes a week since September 2003 ; television programmes from Poland can also be received . In 2003 , Czech Television 's studio in Ostrava launched a regular five @-@ minute news and current affairs weekly in Polish . The broadcast was shortened to four minutes in 2007 . The largest Polish newspaper in the country is Głos <unk> ; the largest magazine is <unk> . 
 = = Education = = 
 The Polish national minority has a network of schools including kindergartens , primary schools , grammar schools , and secondary modern schools , with Polish as a language of instruction . A number of the teachers have been educated at Polish universities . There are currently 25 Polish primary schools and three Polish high schools in Zaolzie , attended by 2 @,@ 347 students . Including students attending Polish classes in several Czech high schools , the figure comes to 2 @,@ 430 students ( Data from 12 September 2006 ) . There are also many Polish kindergartens in Zaolzie . Polish education is the only ethnic minority education in the Czech Republic to cover the complete cycle from kindergarten through high school . 
 Polish primary schools function in the following towns and villages : <unk> <unk> ( Dolní <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Bystrzyca ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Czeski Cieszyn ( Český Těšín ) , Czeski Cieszyn @-@ <unk> ( Český Těšín @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Gródek ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Jablunkov ) , <unk> @-@ <unk> ( Karviná @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> Dolna ( Dolní <unk> ) , <unk> Dolna ( Dolní <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> u <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Orlová ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , Trzyniec I ( <unk> I ) , Trzyniec VI ( <unk> VI ) , and Wędrynia ( <unk> ) . 
 The main and most prestigious Polish high school is the Polish Gymnasium in Český Těšín . Polish classes are open in the Technical School in Karviná , the Economic School in Český Těšín , and the Medical School in Karviná . In the past there were more Polish schools in the area , but the number is historically declining along with the demographic decline in the Polish population as a whole . 
 = = Sport = = 
 First Polish sport organizations have been founded in the 1890s . In the interwar period there was a plethora of organizations of all types in all Central European countries , the Zaolzie region wasn ’ t exception . Sport clubs there were often multi @-@ sport , associating several sport branches , mostly football , athletics , volleyball , table tennis etc . 
 The Sokół movement was active in Cieszyn Silesia even before World War I. After 1920 division of the region , Sokół became active in Czechoslovakia . At the beginning of the 1930s it associated 11 local branches and about 1 @,@ 500 members . After World War II , it hasn ’ t renewed its activity . 
 Another large sport organization was Siła ( Power ) . It was created in 1908 but established again in 1921 as Polskie Stowarzyszenie <unk> Siła ( Polish Workers ' Association ‘ Power ’ ) . The organization was of socialist and workers ' character and in 1937 associated 25 local branches . After World War II Siła operated half @-@ legally in 17 local branches , and after the communist takeover of power in 1948 was liquidated by Czechoslovak communist authorities . 
 Another large organization was Polskie Towarzystwo <unk> ‘ <unk> Śląski ’ ( Polish Tourist Association ‘ Silesian Beskids ’ ) established in 1910 . Initially it focused on organizing the Polish tourist movement and building mountain huts in the Beskids but later widened its activities to skiing , football , athletics and volleyball . In the 1930s it associated 27 local branches . After World War II it operated half @-@ legally and as Siła , was liquidated by Czechoslovak communist authorities after the Victorious February 1948 . It resumed its activity again in 1991 , after the fall of communism . 
 The last notable multi @-@ sport club was <unk> Kultura <unk> ( PFK , Proletarian Physical Culture ) . It was created in the mid @-@ 1920s and was of communist character . In the 1930s it associated about 40 active local branches . After the Zaolzie region was annexed in 1938 by Poland it was banned together with the communist party . 
 The most popular sport was football . Volleyball , athletics , table tennis and other sports were also popular . The club with most members was PKS Polonia <unk> , associating some 1 @,@ 000 members . Its football branch was the best Polish football club of Zaolzie . 
 After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity . After the communist takeover of power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of organizations in the country and tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations . Therefore , many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped their activity . The ones who still operated were subjected to rising pressure since 1951 . Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952 . 
 After 1952 the Polish sport life was organized through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union . Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date , hence after the fall of communism in 1989 only a few sport organizations resumed their activity . <unk> Śląski , the only notable one , focuses on tourism . No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie . 
 = = Legal issues = = 
 The erection of bilingual signs has technically been permitted since 2001 , if a minority constitutes 10 % of the population of a municipality . The requirement for a petition by the members of a minority has been abolished , thus simplifying the whole process .

For a list of all municipalities with a Polish population of at least 10 % , see Polish municipalities in the Czech Republic .

 The Polish population is historically declining . This is primarily caused by low natural birth rate , assimilation , high intermarriage rate ( the majority of Poles live in mixed relationships ) , and migration to other parts of the country as a result of job seeking .

 = National symbols of Belarus = 
 Upon the independence of Belarus from the Soviet Union , the country resurrected national symbols that were used before the Soviet era . These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback . These national symbols were replaced by Soviet @-@ era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote . Those two symbols , along with the national anthem , are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus . 
 = = Law = = 
 In the 1994 Constitution of Belarus , Article 19 lists the official symbols of the country . Article 19 reads : 
 Each national symbol is further defined by their respective laws . Uses of the national symbols are covered in the relevant law of each symbol . 
 = = National flag = = 
 The national flag has been in use since June 7 , 1995 , one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum . The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor , then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position . The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union . In the Soviet version , a hammer and sickle was placed near the top @-@ hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted . Several flags used by government officials and agencies were based on the national flag . 
 Despite being replaced , the former flag of Belarus is used by those who oppose current Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko . The former flag consisted of a white background with a red horizontal stripe in the middle . It was used by the Belarusian National Republic and immediately after independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 . 
 = = National emblem = = 
 The other national symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum was the national emblem . The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in the colors of the national flag , a map of Belarus , wheat ears and a red star . At the base of the ribbon , it says the country 's official name in the Belarusian language . The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR , designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950 . In the Soviet version , a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red . On the left and right ribbons , the Soviet motto Workers of the world , unite ! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages . 
 The national emblem that was used at the time of the <unk> and post @-@ Soviet independence was called the Pahonia ( the chase ) . On the base of a red shield , an armored white knight is mounted on a silver horse , with a sword drawn and charging to the left . On the shield of the knight , a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed . A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania . 
 = = National anthem = = 
 The only symbol that hasn 't changed over during independence is the national anthem . Adopted during the Soviet era , " My Belarusy " was used provisionally until 2002 . The only change that occurred was dropping the Soviet @-@ era lyrics and choosing just to use the music , composed by <unk> <unk> . On July 2 , 2002 , President Lukashenko issued a decree adopting new lyrics to the anthem , written by Uladzimir <unk> . Klimkovich also wrote the lyrics to the Anthem of the Byelorussian SSR . Not only the lyrics were chosen , a protocol guide related to the national anthem was released by Lukashenko . The reason that was given for keeping <unk> 's music was to keep the historic traditions of the country . While references to Lenin , the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the idea of Soviet brotherhood were dropped , the general idea of a " friendship of peoples " still remains present . According to the Belarusian Government , once the national anthem was adopted , the long process to adopt the three national symbols of Belarus was completed .

 = = Unofficial symbols = = 
 Other than the national flag , anthem and emblem , Belarus has several unofficial symbols . The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne , a 12th @-@ century relic which disappeared during the Second World War is considered a spiritual symbol of Belarus . The European bison , commonly called the wisent , is seen as a symbol of Belarus and the <unk> Forest . It is also featured on the symbols of Brest Oblast . An other widely known mascots of Belarus are stork and cornflower . 
 = Hugo Steinhaus = 
 Władysław Hugo <unk> Steinhaus / <unk> <unk> / ( January 14 , 1887 – February 25 , 1972 ) was a Polish mathematician and educator . Steinhaus obtained his PhD under David Hilbert at Göttingen University in 1911 and later became a professor at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów ( now Lviv , Ukraine ) , where he helped establish what later became known as the Lwów School of Mathematics . He is credited with " discovering " mathematician Stefan Banach , with whom he gave a notable contribution to functional analysis through the Banach – Steinhaus theorem . After World War II Steinhaus played an important part in the establishment of the mathematics department at Wrocław University and in the revival of Polish mathematics from the destruction of the war . 
 Author of around 170 scientific articles and books , Steinhaus has left his legacy and contribution in many branches of mathematics , such as functional analysis , geometry , mathematical logic , and trigonometry . Notably he is regarded as one of the early founders of game theory and probability theory which led to later development of more comprehensive approaches by other scholars . 
 = = Early life and studies = = 
 Steinhaus was born on January 14 , 1887 in Jasło , Austria @-@ Hungary to a family with Jewish roots . His father , Bogusław , was a local industrialist , owner of a brick factory and a merchant . His mother was Ewelina , née Lipschitz . Hugo 's uncle , Ignacy Steinhaus , was an activist in the Koło Polskie ( Polish Circle ) , and a deputy to the Galician Diet , the regional assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . 
 Hugo finished his studies at the gymnasium in Jasło in 1905 . His family wanted him to become an engineer but he was drawn to abstract mathematics and began to study the works of famous contemporary mathematicians on his own . In the same year he began studying philosophy and mathematics at the University of Lemberg . In 1906 he transferred to Göttingen University . At that University he received his Ph.D. in 1911 , having written his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of David Hilbert . The title of his thesis was Neue <unk> des Dirichlet <unk> <unk> ( " New applications to Dirichlet 's principle " ) . 
 At the start of World War I Steinhaus returned to Poland and served in Józef Piłsudski 's Polish Legion , after which he lived in Kraków . 
 He was an atheist .

 During the 1916 @-@ 1917 period and before Poland had regained its full independence , which occurred in 1918 , Steinhaus worked in Kraków for the Ministry of the Interior in the ephemeral puppet state of Kingdom of Poland . 
 In 1917 he started to work at the University of Lemberg ( later Jan Kazimierz University in Poland ) and acquired his habilitation qualification in 1920 . In 1921 he became a <unk> <unk> ( associate professor ) and in 1925 <unk> <unk> ( full professor ) at the same university . During this time he taught a course on the then cutting edge theory of Lebesgue integration , one of the first such courses offered outside France . 
 While in Lwów , Steinhaus co @-@ founded the Lwów School of Mathematics and was active in the circle of mathematicians associated with the Scottish cafe , although , according to Stanislaw Ulam , for the circle 's gatherings , Steinhaus would have generally preferred a more upscale tea shop down the street . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 In September 1939 after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded and occupied Poland , as a fulfillment of the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact they had signed earlier , Lwów initially came under Soviet occupation . Steinhaus considered escaping to Hungary but ultimately decided to remain in Lwów . The Soviets reorganized the university to give it a more Ukrainian character , but they did appoint Stefan Banach ( Steinhaus 's student ) as the dean of the mathematics department and Steinhaus resumed teaching there . The faculty of the department at the school were also strengthened by several Polish refugees from German occupied Poland . According to Steinhaus , during the experience of this period , he " acquired a insurmountable physical disgust in regard to all sorts of Soviet administrators , politicians and commissars " 
 During the interwar period and the time of the Soviet occupation , Steinhaus contributed ten problems to the famous Scottish Book , including the last one , recorded shortly before Lwów was captured by the Nazis in 1941 , during Operation Barbarossa . 
 Steinhaus , because of his Jewish background , spent the Nazi occupation in hiding , first among friends in Lwów , then in the small towns of <unk> , near Zamość and <unk> , near Kraków . The Polish anti @-@ Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier , by the name of Grzegorz <unk> . Under this name he taught clandestine classes ( higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation ) . Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans , Steinhaus , without access to any scholarly material , reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew , in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs , of which only a little part has been published . 
 Also while in hiding , and cut off from reliable news on the course of the war , Steinhaus devised a statistical means of estimating for himself the German casualties at the front based on sporadic obituaries published in the local press . The method relied on the relative frequency with which the obituaries stated that the soldier who died was someone 's son , someone 's " second son " , someone 's " third son " and so on . 
 According to his student and biographer , Mark Kac , Steinhaus told him that the happiest day of his life were the twenty four hours between the time that the Germans left occupied Poland and the Soviets had not yet arrived ( " They had left , and they had not yet come " ) . 
 = = = After World War II = = = 
 In the last days of World War II Steinhaus , still in hiding , heard a rumor that University of Lwów was to be transferred to the city of Breslau ( Wrocław ) , which Poland was to acquire as a result of the Potsdam agreement ( Lwów became part of Soviet Ukraine ) . Although initially he had doubts , he turned down offers for faculty positions in Łódź and Lublin and made his way to the city where he began teaching at University of Wrocław . While there , he revived the idea behind the Scottish Book from Lwów , where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution , by starting the New Scottish Book . It was also most likely Steinhaus who preserved the original Scottish Book from Lwów throughout the war and subsequently sent it to Stanisław Ulam , who translated it into English . 
 With Steinhaus ' help , Wrocław University became renowned for mathematics , much as the University of Lwów had been . 
 Later , in the 1960s , Steinhaus served as a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame ( 1961 – 62 ) and the University of Sussex ( 1966 ) . 
 = = Mathematical contributions = = 
 Steinhaus authored over 170 works . Unlike his student , Stefan Banach , who tended to specialize narrowly in the field of functional analysis , Steinhaus made contributions to a wide range of mathematical sub @-@ disciplines , including geometry , probability theory , functional analysis , theory of trigonometric and Fourier series as well as mathematical logic . He also wrote in the area of applied mathematics and enthusiastically collaborated with engineers , geologists , economists , physicians , biologists and , in Kac 's words , " even lawyers " . 
 Probably his most notable contribution to functional analysis was the 1927 proof of the Banach – Steinhaus theorem , given along with Stefan Banach , which is now one of the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics . 
 His interest in games led him to propose an early formal definition of a strategy , anticipating John von Neumann 's more complete treatment of a few years later . Consequently , he is considered an early founder of modern game theory . As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus , together with another of his students , Jan <unk> , proposed the Axiom of <unk> . 
 Steinhaus was also an early contributor to , and co @-@ founder of , probability theory , which at the time was in its infancy and not even considered an actual part of mathematics . He provided the first axiomatic measure @-@ theoretic description of coin @-@ tossing , which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov a decade later . Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be " independent " , as well as for what it means for a random variable to be " uniformly distributed " . 
 While in hiding during World War II , Steinhaus worked on the fair cake @-@ cutting problem : how to divide a heterogeneous resource among several people with different preferences such that every person believes he received a proportional share . Steinhaus ' work has initiated the modern research of the fair cake @-@ cutting problem . 
 Steinhaus was also the first person to conjecture the ham @-@ sandwich theorem , and one of the first to propose the method of k @-@ means clustering . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Steinhaus is said to have " discovered " the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1916 , after he overheard someone utter the words " Lebesgue integral " while in a Kraków park ( Steinhaus referred to Banach as his " greatest mathematical discovery " ) . Together with Banach and the other participant of the park discussion , Otto Nikodym , Steinhaus started the Mathematical Society of Kraków , which later evolved into the Polish Mathematical Society . He was a member of <unk> ( the Polish Academy of Learning ) and PAN ( the Polish Academy of Sciences ) , <unk> ( the Polish Mathematical Society ) , the <unk> Towarzystwo <unk> ( Wrocław Scientific Society ) as well as many international scientific societies and science academies . 
 Steinhaus also published one of the first articles in Fundamenta Mathematicae , in 1921 . He also co @-@ founded Studia Mathematica along with Stefan Banach ( 1929 ) , and <unk> <unk> ( Applications of Mathematics , 1953 ) , Colloquium Mathematicum , and <unk> <unk> ( Mathematical Monographs ) . 
 He received honorary doctorate degrees from Warsaw University ( 1958 ) , Wrocław Medical Academy ( 1961 ) , Poznań University ( 1963 ) and Wrocław University ( 1965 ) . 
 Steinhaus had full command of several foreign languages and was interestingly , known , for his aphorisms , to the point that a booklet of his most famous ones in Polish , French and Latin has been published posthumously . 
 In 2002 , the Polish Academy of Sciences and Wrocław University sponsored " 2002 , The Year of Hugo Steinhaus " , to celebrate his contributions to Polish and world science . 
 Notable mathematician Mark Kac , Steinhaus 's student , wrote : 
 " He was one of the architects of the school of mathematics which flowered miraculously in Poland between the two wars and it was he who , perhaps more than any other individual , helped to raise Polish mathematics from the ashes to which it had been reduced by the second World War to the position of new strength and respect which it now occupies . He was a man of great culture and in the best sense of the word a product of Western civilization . "

 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , also known as the bumblebee bat , is a vulnerable species of bat and the only extant member of the family <unk> . It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma , where it occupies limestone caves along rivers . 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat is the smallest species of bat and arguably the world 's smallest mammal . It has a reddish @-@ brown or grey coat , with a distinctive pig @-@ like snout . Colonies range greatly in size , with an average of 100 individuals per cave . The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn , foraging around nearby forest areas for insects . Females give birth annually to a single offspring . 
 Although the bat 's status in Burma is not well known , the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction . Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic , and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat is about 29 to 33 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 3 in ) in length and 2 g ( 0 @.@ 071 oz ) in <unk> hence the common name of " bumblebee bat " . It is the smallest species of bat and may be the world 's smallest mammal , depending on how size is defined . The main competitors for the title are small shrews ; in particular , the Etruscan shrew may be lighter at 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 7 g ( 0 @.@ 042 to 0 @.@ 095 oz ) but is longer , measuring 36 to 53 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 1 in ) from its head to the base of the tail . 
 The bat has a distinctive swollen , pig @-@ like snout with thin , vertical nostrils . Its ears are relatively large , while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur . Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat . The dental formula is 1 : 1 : 1 : 3 in the upper jaw and 2 : 1 : 2 : 3 in the lower jaw , with large upper incisors . 
 The bat 's upperparts are reddish @-@ brown or grey , while the underside is generally paler . The wings are relatively large and darker in colour , with long tips that allow the bat to hover . Despite having two caudal vertebrae , Kitti 's Hog @-@ nosed Bat has no visible tail . There is a large web of skin between the hind legs ( the uropatagium ) which may assist in flying and catching insects , although there are no tail bones or <unk> to help control it in flight . 
 = = Range and distribution = = 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat occupies the limestone caves along rivers , within dry evergreen or deciduous forests . In Thailand , Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat is restricted to a small region of the <unk> Hills in Sai Yok District , <unk> Province , within the drainage basin of the <unk> Noi River . While the Sai Yok National Park in the <unk> Hills contains much of the bat 's range , some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected . 
 Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma , at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops of the <unk> and Karen Hills outside the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers of <unk> and Mon States . The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical , but their echolocation calls are distinct . It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills , far from the entrance . While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals , the average group size is 100 , with a maximum of about 500 . Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes , far apart from each other . Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves . 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat has a brief activity period , leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn . These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures . During this period , the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees , within one kilometre of the roosting site . The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight , and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage . Nevertheless , most prey is probably caught in flight . Main staples of the bat 's diet include small flies ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) , hymenopterans , and <unk> . 
 Late in the dry season ( around April ) of each year , females give birth to a single offspring . During feeding periods , the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat is the only extant species in the family <unk> , which is grouped in the superfamily <unk> as a result of molecular testing . Based on this determination , the bat 's closest relatives are members of the families <unk> and <unk> . 
 Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat was unknown to the world at large prior to 1974 . Its common name refers to its discoverer , Thai zoologist Kitti Thonglongya . Thonglongya worked with a British partner , John E. Hill , in classifying bats of Thailand ; after Thonglongya died suddenly in February 1974 , Hill formally described the species , giving it the binomial name <unk> <unk> in honour of his colleague . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 As of the species ' most recent review in 2008 , Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat is listed by the IUCN as vulnerable , with a downward population trend . 
 Soon after the bat 's discovery in the 1970s , some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism , scientific collection , and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs . However , these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole , since many small colonies exist in hard @-@ to @-@ access locations , and only a few major caves were disturbed . Another potential risk is the activity of local monks , who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation . 
 Currently , the most significant and long @-@ term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas , which is most prevalent during the bat 's breeding season . In addition , the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact . Threats to the Burmese population are not well known . 
 In 2007 , Kitti 's hog @-@ nosed bat was identified by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project as one of its Top 10 " focal species " .

 Portland Center Stage ( PCS ) is a theater company based in Portland , Oregon , United States . Theater productions are presented at the Gerding Theater at the Armory in Portland 's Pearl District . PCS was founded in 1988 as the northern sibling of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland , Oregon . It became an independent theater in 1993 and in 1994 Elizabeth Huddle became producing artistic director . Chris Coleman took over in 2000 as the company 's fourth artistic director . Coleman hired design firm Sandstrom Design to help refocus the marketing strategy of PCS and increased the variety of productions . 
 The company began a capital campaign in 2004 , and in 2006 moved into the Portland Armory , which includes two theaters , production facilities and office space . PCS puts on between seven and ten productions annually between September and June , and productions include classical , contemporary and premiere pieces . PCS has received positive commentary in regional guidebooks including Best Places Northwest , Best Places Portland and Moon Handbooks Oregon .

 Portland Center Stage was founded in 1988 , and was the " northern sibling " of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival ( OSF ) in Ashland , Oregon , and continued as a branch of OSF until 1994 . The company was originally known as " Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland " . Its first production was Heartbreak House . Dennis Bigelow was PCS 's first artistic director and was let go by the OSF in 1992 . A two @-@ year transitional process began in 1993 , during which the OSF maintained a supervisory role over PCS . The Oregonian reported that the OSF 's artistic director Henry Woronicz " couldn 't figure out how to integrate the two closely enough for his liking , and he was unwilling to have Portland go its own way without supervision " . 
 The advisory board for Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland was reformulated as the board of directors of the PCS , and Elizabeth Huddle was hired in May 1994 as the producing artistic director . Huddle had previously served on the PCS 's search committee for a new artistic director , but decided to put her name in for consideration . In 1994 the PCS had a budget of US $ 2 @.@ 2 million , and over 11 @,@ 000 subscribers . 
 In May 1995 the company 's financial numbers for its transitional 1994 – 1995 period with its new artistic director were reported to be a deficit of $ 240 @,@ 000 . The company experienced what The Oregonian described as a " jarring divorce " from the OSF . Huddle had been on the 1991 search committee for the OSF 's artistic director Henry Woronicz , but he suddenly announced his resignation in June 1995 effective the following October citing " personal reasons " . Huddle and the rest of the theater community were surprised by Woronicz 's resignation . In 2000 PCS board president Julie <unk> commented to The Seattle Times that after separating from OSF " it was a real challenge to form our own identity " , but that Huddle " did a wonderful job helping us do that for the last six years " .

 Its fourth artistic director Chris Coleman took over in May 2000 , and recruited experienced actors to the company . Coleman had previously co @-@ founded Actor 's Express in Atlanta , Georgia , and was the artistic director there . Coleman initially signed on for a three @-@ year contract . Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS , the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland . However , the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties , with a deficit at the end of 1999 of $ 700 @,@ 000 . In 2000 PCS had a deficit of $ 880 @,@ 000 and a base of 10 @,@ 000 subscribers . The financial position of the company later stabilized , and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $ 3 @.@ 2 million to work with when he came on . A 2003 consultant 's report , however , found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than its peers around the company . 
 Coleman hired the Portland company Sandstrom Design to help with marketing . Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional materials of the organization , while Portland Center Stage modified the nature and style of its performances . Sandstrom Design produced a 56 @-@ page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003 – 2004 season which was mailed to subscribers , potential customers , handed out at performances and placed around town . The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film . PCS 's productions were presented in the <unk> and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005 – 2006 season . Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006 – 2007 season . 
 Portland Center Stage began a $ 32 @.@ 9 million capital campaign in 2004 , with the goal of building a new theater complex in the Portland Armory , a historic building in Portland . The company began usage of the Portland Armory space in September 2006 . PCS received $ 150 @,@ 000 from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in September 2006 for " renovations and upgrades to its facility " , and an additional $ 500 @,@ 000 as part of the " Portland Center Stage Armory Theater Energy Conservation Project " . 
 The theater facilities at the Portland Armory include " a 599 @-@ seat main stage theater , a smaller , 200 @-@ seat black box theater , administrative offices , a rehearsal hall and production facilities " . The main theater in the Portland Armory is called the Gerding Theater . Seven productions are performed annually , from September through May . The company 's productions include contemporary , classical pieces and modern premieres , in addition to a summer playwrights festival , <unk> ( previously known as Just Add Water / West ) . PCS has approximately 8 @,@ 000 subscribers and an annual audience of over 90 @,@ 000 .

 When Elizabeth Huddle became producing artistic director in 1994 , a production schedule had already been set by the OSF 's Pat Patton . Huddle made changes to her first season 's schedule and decided to direct the first play of the season Arms and the Man , instead of the previously scheduled play Jean Anouilh 's translation of Sophocles ' Antigone . Portland Center Stage was nominated for " Best Production " in the 1994 – 95 <unk> Awards which recognize excellence in Portland theater , for Arms and the Man . 
 Huddle was artistic director for the world premiere of the play Comfort and Joy : A Play in Two Acts , which premiered at PCS on December 2 , 1995 . Huddle had commissioned playwright Jack <unk> to write Comfort and Joy , which was the first time that Portland Center Stage had ever produced a new play . Huddle ended her time with the Portland Center Stage company in January 2000 . One of Huddle 's final productions with PCS was A Christmas Carol , and her final production with the company was Bus Stop . 
 Chris Coleman 's first production after signing on with PCS in 2000 was the play The Devils by Elizabeth <unk> , based on the novel of the same name by Fyodor Dostoevsky . Theater critic Misha Berson of The Seattle Times described Coleman 's choice as " an especially audacious departure for Portland Center Stage " , though reviews in Portland media were mixed , it received a positive review in The Oregonian and from audience feedback . Other productions in the 2000 – 2001 season included Martin McDonagh 's Irish comedy , The Cripple of <unk> , A Christmas Carol , Patrick Marber 's Closer , and adaptation of Antigone , and the Northwest premiere of A New Brain by William Finn . 
 Coleman opened the 2006 , 2007 and 2008 seasons at PCS with musicals . He opened the 2006 season with West Side Story , and the 2007 season with Cabaret . Other productions in the 2007 – 2008 season included Doubt , a Parable , Twelfth Night , and Sometimes a Great Notion . PCS received a total of 12 awards at the 29th annual <unk> Awards in June 2008 , including " Outstanding Production " for Twelfth Night . Coleman opened the 2008 – 2009 season with Guys and Dolls , which The Oregonian and Willamette Week described as a timely choice in light of the Economic crisis of 2008 .

 In her 2004 guide Best Places Northwest Giselle Smith wrote that PCS " offers excellent production values , whatever the play " . In his 2004 book Best Places Portland , author John <unk> wrote positively of Portland Center Stage , commenting : " Portland 's leading professional theater company is on a par with the country 's best regional theaters . " The 2007 guidebook Moon Handbooks Oregon notes that the company : " produces innovative and sometimes daring productions " . 
 = My Opposition = 
 My Opposition ( German : Mein <unk> ) is a diary secretly written by the German social democrat Friedrich Kellner ( 1885 – 1970 ) during World War II to describe life under Nazi Germany and to expose the propaganda and the crimes of the Nazi dictatorship . It is considered one of the most comprehensive diaries of the period . The first entry in the 861 @-@ page diary is dated September 13 , 1939 , and the last entry is May 17 , 1945 . In 1968 Kellner gave the diary to his American grandson , Robert Scott Kellner , to translate into English and to bring it to the attention of the public . 
 The diary has been on exhibit in museums in America and Germany . The first exhibit was at the George Bush Presidential Library in April and May 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day , which took place on May 8 , 1945 . The Holocaust Literature Research Unit at the University of Giessen in Germany has created the Kellner Project . The complete diary was published in 2011 by <unk> Verlag in Göttingen , Germany . It is in two volumes , approximately 1 @,@ 200 pages , with over 70 illustrations and photographs . The title is , " Friedrich Kellner , ' <unk> , <unk> sind alle <unk> , ' Tagebücher 1939 @-@ 1945 . " ( Literal translation : ' Clouded , darkened are all of the minds , ' Diaries 1939 @-@ 1945 . ) A Canadian documentary film , My Opposition : The Diaries of Friedrich Kellner , was produced in 2006 , for distribution in 2007 .

 Friedrich Kellner was a justice inspector in the courthouse in Mainz between 1903 and 1933 . From 1914 until 1918 , he served as a soldier in the German army . When the First World War ended and Germany became a republic , Kellner became a political activist for the Social Democratic Party of Germany . For ten years , Kellner openly campaigned against the Nazis until they came to power in 1933 . 
 Once in power , Adolf Hitler soon banned the Social Democratic Party and other political organizations . Concerned for his family 's safety , Kellner moved to the town of Laubach in Hesse , where he became the chief justice inspector : the judicial officer in charge of the administration of the courthouse . When Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , Kellner began his secret diary to record the crimes of the Third Reich . 
 After the war , Friedrich Kellner was made deputy mayor of Laubach . He dedicated himself to reestablishing the Social Democratic Party , and he became chairman of the Laubach branch . He retired from politics in 1960 , at the age of seventy @-@ five . In 1968 he gave the diary to his American grandson . 
 Using his grandfather 's writings to combat the resurgence of fascism and anti @-@ Semitism in the twenty @-@ first century , and to counter historical revisionists who would deny the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities , Robert Scott Kellner wrote to the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who according to some sources has referred to the Holocaust as " a myth " and has called for Israel to be " wiped off the map , " to offer him a copy of the diary . In his letter to Ahmadinejad , Kellner wrote : " We need to renounce ideologies that do not uphold , above all else , human life and personal liberty . " 
 = = The diary = = 
 The diary , which Kellner titled Mein <unk> , meaning My Opposition , is divided into ten volumes , with a total of 861 pages . There are 676 dated entries . The handwriting is in the <unk> script , a style of German lettering no longer in use . Included among the pages of the diary are more than 500 newspaper clippings ; a " collage effect " that enhances the diary 's historical significance . 
 The diary seldom deals with the <unk> ’ personal lives , their daily tribulations and how they managed to survive during the war , although there are occasional entries to that effect , such as this one written on 20 March 1942 : 
 We were informed of the prospect of a shortening in food rations . 300 grams of meat or sausage per week . Once the Führer asserted he had the right to require sacrifices because he himself was ready to accept any personal sacrifice . If now the idea came into his head to starve to death , then I would not want to take away his right to ask all his fellow fighters to do the same . 
 = = = Call to arms = = = 
 In his diary Kellner focused on the broader sociological and political issues of Germany . On 21 January 1942 he reflected on the foolish choices the Germans had made following World War I ; electing Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists to power , and allowing Germany to become a totalitarian state : 
 Whoever looks in the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be overpowered by great pain in the face of the mistakes that have been made . When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf , it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book . Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions , even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion . What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break @-@ in ? Anybody would make security arrangements . And what did the government and the representatives of the people do ? As much as nothing . A tired , weak and sick population , as well as a weak government , let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing . For every problem this quack had the only right medicine . He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels . 
 Kellner 's diary takes to task not only the German people who elected Hitler , but the citizens and leaders of other nations who remained indifferent to evidence that dictators in Germany , Italy and Japan were plotting to take possession of the entire world . In a number of entries , Kellner accused politicians in the democracies of failing to stand up against the dictators . He pointed out that the world ’ s intelligentsia , university professors and professionals in medicine and law , were willing to accept the National Socialist propaganda . “ The whole world let themselves be fooled by this man , ” he wrote on May 3 , 1942 . " 
 He especially could not understand how those who had defeated Germany in the First World War watched without protest as Germany rearmed itself . In an entry dated 12 November 1940 , he wrote : 
 Chamberlain and the entire subsequent government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany 's preparations for war . A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack . Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared . Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action . It 's possible that it was merely constraining itself , but that strategy is a mistake . It should have been put into action immediately . Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter @-@ attacked . 
 Also troubling to Kellner , aside from the Allies ' failure to prepare for the war , was their hesitation to enter the war with their full forces once it had begun . When Poland was attacked in 1939 , followed by attacks on Denmark , Norway , Belgium and France , Kellner looked to the United States to come to Europe 's aid . He could not understand why the United States acted so late to enter the war . On 25 June 1941 , a few days after Operation Barbarossa and six months before Japan ’ s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor , he wrote : 
 When will this insanity be brought to an end ? Now is a unique chance for England and America to take the initiative , but not only with empty promises and insufficient measures . If America had the will to throw its entire might into the fray , it could tip the balance for a return of peace . Only a tremendous force and the commitment of all war material can bring the German wild steer to reason . Up until now the statesmen , through unbelievable shortsightedness , have neglected or failed their duty . Mankind awake ! Attack together with all your might against the destroyers of peace ! No reflections , no resolutions , no speeches , no ‘ neutrality . ’ Advance against the enemy of mankind ! 
 In the same entry he angrily wrote : 
 Even today there are idiots in America who talk nonsense about some compromise with Germany under Adolf Hitler . Those are the most atrocious dummies .

 In a number of entries , Kellner records atrocities being committed by the German soldiers . On 29 July 1941 he recorded what he learned of the deliberate execution of captured Russian soldiers in the prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps : 
 The wounded soldiers in the field hospital in Giessen tell the story that Russian prisoners @-@ of @-@ war were also being murdered . Gruesome bandits . Are the German people a people of culture ? No ! A cultural people must be able to think as individuals and behave themselves properly . But the German people have repeatedly allowed themselves to be dictated to by their " infallible " Führer without participating in the slightest degree in their own destiny . The Führer is always right , the Führer never errs . The German people have been taken in by this devil . 
 And he denounced the German military for their policies against the resistance forces in the occupied lands . On 26 October 1941 he wrote : 
 In France two German officers have been shot by unknown murderers , in Nantes and Bordeaux . In retribution fifty citizens in each of these towns were apprehended and executed . To let people who are completely innocent suffer for the deed of another reminds us of the terrific deeds of wild beasts in times long gone . It was General von <unk> 's lot to revive one of the most gruesome deeds . The world will rightfully be upset over so much inhumanity , and a hate will burn that can never be extinguished . . . How long will this reign of terror continue ? 
 Perhaps the single most important entry in the diary is dated October 28 , 1941 . After the war many Germans would insist they knew nothing at all about the Holocaust . More recently , Holocaust deniers have questioned the extent , and even the existence of the Holocaust . Friedrich Kellner 's diary counters such suggestions : 
 A soldier on vacation here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity in the occupied parts of Poland . He watched as naked Jewish men and women were placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians in the back of their heads and they fell into the ditch . Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch . These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians , who were used as tools , suffered nervous breakdowns . All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub @-@ humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution . There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts . Of course , when the retribution comes , the innocent will have to suffer along with them . But because ninety @-@ nine percent of the German population is guilty , directly or indirectly , for the present situation , we can only say that those who travel together will hang together . 
 Kellner also recorded the miscarriages of justice within Germany itself , where the Nazi 's disregard for laws and human life took its toll upon the citizenry . On 5 July 1941 he wrote this : 
 In Giessen , Forester Ritter was arrested because he said the war would last another three years . Two years ago R. was assassinated because he maintained that the war would last two years . 
 The truth may not be said . 
 = = = Results of totalitarianism = = = 
 Kellner was particularly incensed by the internal censorship laws . Censorship in Nazi Germany was implemented by the Minister of Propaganda , Joseph Goebbels . All media — literature , music , newspapers , and radio broadcasts — were censored , in an effort to reinforce Nazi power and to suppress opposing viewpoints and information . On 14 April 1943 , upon reading that the People 's Court of Justice in Vienna had imposed the death sentence on a man accused of listening to a non @-@ censored overseas radio broadcast , Kellner cut the article from the newspaper and wrote next to it : 
 Ten years in the penitentiary for a ' radio crime . ' According to the newspaper that was too little for the chief justice . He sent back the verdict to the original court and demanded the death penalty . Just think : the death sentence for listening to a foreign broadcast on the radio . It cannot be imagined in the rest of the world that there would be given such a punishment for listening to a German broadcast on their radios . This horror regime has given itself a gruesome monument unto the distant time . Will there be retribution for this some day , Mr. Chief Justice ? 
 Two months before the war 's end , on 7 March 1945 , when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory , Friedrich Kellner tried to explain why the German people themselves had not rebelled against Nazi rule , why it was necessary for outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power . 
 The way that leads to the abyss for the German people has now come . The party patriots continue ever to believe and hope . Also , there are still those who do not want to see , and they expect a miracle from the Führer . Those are the kind of people who do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave . In all other respects , the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour . The coming generations , and the foreign countries , will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war . For this , something should be said to clear up the question . 
 To begin with , the number of the party members is extremely large . Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy ; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda . Individual thinking was switched off , and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for <unk> this spread throughout the entire population . In this way , more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force , and other means of terror , to eliminate any internal resistance . 
 There is no important place in the government or private sector not occupied by proven party comrades . Adolf Hitler clearly announced before the seizure of power that the party would be running things . Thus , anywhere there might be a reaction against the party , a Hitler guard stands ready to quell that reaction . 
 Although today our opponents are at the Rhine and at the Oder , I do not believe yet that there will be a coup brought about by the German people . Without assistance from outside , such a coup is not even to be considered . Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup . But the prominent officers know , as well as the party officials , that a lost war will sweep them out of power . Therefore , the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end . The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance . 
 That is how I imagine it will end . The Allies must continue to use force in order to terminate the war .

 = 2009 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl = 
 The 2009 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Tennessee Volunteers on December 31 , 2009 , in the Georgia Dome , Atlanta , Georgia . Virginia Tech defeated Tennessee 37 – 14 . The game was part of the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was the concluding game of the season for both teams . The game , the 42nd edition of the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl — called the Peach Bowl for much of its existence — was televised in the United States on ESPN and the broadcast was seen by an estimated 4 @.@ 87 million viewers . 
 Each participating team was selected by the bowl game 's selection committee , which had paid contracts with the participating football conferences . The Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl had the second pick of bowl @-@ eligible teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the fifth pick from eligible teams in the Southeastern Conference . In picking Virginia Tech and Tennessee , the selection committee bypassed teams with better or similar records in order to create a matchup appealing to television audiences . Pregame media coverage focused on the close geographic rivalry between the two teams and the success of Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin in reversing his team 's poor fortune from the previous season . 
 The game kicked off at 7 : 37 p.m. EST and Virginia Tech jumped to an early lead with a first @-@ quarter touchdown . Tennessee replied in the second quarter with two touchdowns of their own , but Virginia Tech kept the lead by scoring 10 points in the quarter . At halftime , Tech led 17 @-@ 14 . In the second half , Virginia Tech pulled away from Tennessee , scoring 20 unanswered points to win the game 37 @-@ 14 . 
 In recognition of his performance during the game , Virginia Tech running back Ryan Williams was named the game 's most valuable player . By the end of the game , he had set a school record for most rushing yards in a season and conference records for most rushing touchdowns and most total touchdowns . Following the game , Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin resigned to become head coach of the University of Southern California Trojans football team . Several players from each team participated in postseason all @-@ star games and a handful were selected to play in the National Football League through the 2010 NFL Draft . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 Beginning with the 2006 game , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl purchased the right to select the highest @-@ ranked Atlantic Coast Conference team after representatives from the Bowl Championship Series made their selection . The contract was renewed in 2009 , extending that right through 2013 . According to the official selection rules used in the 2009 @-@ 10 season , the team chosen to represent the ACC in the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl had to be within one conference victory of the remaining highest @-@ ranked conference team or ranked more than five spaces ahead of the ACC team with the best conference record available in the final BCS standings . Following the conclusion of the 2009 college football regular season , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl selection committee bypassed the ACC Championship Game loser , Clemson , in order to pick Virginia Tech , which had the same conference record . The committee believed a game featuring Virginia Tech would draw more television viewers and in @-@ person attendance than Clemson , even though the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl was the third time that season Virginia Tech played a game in Atlanta . 
 In choosing the SEC opponent , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl selection committee had the right to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series , Cotton Bowl Classic , Capital One Bowl , and Outback Bowl made their selections . Just as in the ACC , the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two fewer losses than the highest available team . After the 2009 regular season ended , SEC champion Alabama was selected for the national championship game , and SEC runner @-@ up Florida was picked by the Sugar Bowl to fill the SEC 's BCS tie @-@ in . The Cotton Bowl selected Ole Miss , the Capital One Bowl picked LSU , and the Outback Bowl took Auburn . For its pick , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl bypassed local team Georgia ( No. 2 in the SEC 's eastern division ) for Tennessee ( No. 3 in the division ) in order to set up a game against two geographic rivals and because Tennessee had defeated Georgia in a head @-@ to @-@ head matchup . 
 The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion @-@ dollar payout system , which guarantees a certain amount of money to the participating conferences . Before 2006 , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl ( then known as the Peach Bowl ) matched the No. 5 team in the SEC versus the No. 3 team in the ACC . After the bowl increased its payout to $ 2 @.@ 8 million per squad , it then was given the second pick from the ACC , with the Gator Bowl dropping to third . After 2006 , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl has steadily increased its payouts in order to keep pace with the trend across college football . In the 2009 game , the ACC and SEC split a payout of $ 6 @.@ 02 million , with the ACC receiving more because it offered an earlier selection . 
 = = = Virginia Tech = = = 
 The Hokies went 10 @-@ 4 in 2008 , concluding the season with a 20 @-@ 7 win in the 2009 Orange Bowl . Before the 2009 season started , Virginia Tech accepted an invitation to play Alabama in the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Kickoff Game , a game organized by the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl to pit two high @-@ profile teams against each other to create a bowl game @-@ like atmosphere in the Georgia Dome at the start of the season . Virginia Tech was ranked No. 7 in the preseason polls , while Alabama was No. 5 ; the game was forecast as a competition between two possible national championship contenders . Alabama defeated Virginia Tech 34 @-@ 24 and ultimately went on to win the national championship . 
 Tech recovered from the loss by winning its next five games , including a last @-@ second victory over 19th @-@ ranked Nebraska and a 31 @-@ 7 blowout victory over No. 9 Miami . The victories brought Tech to a 5 @-@ 1 record and a No. 4 national ranking . On October 17 , Virginia Tech traveled to Atlanta for the second time that season , this time to play 19th @-@ ranked Georgia Tech . For the first time since 1962 , Georgia Tech defeated a top @-@ five team , beating Virginia Tech 28 @-@ 23 . Georgia Tech 's win gave it a tiebreaker against Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference standings , but Virginia Tech made the tiebreaker moot by losing its next game , an ACC contest against North Carolina . Georgia Tech lost only one ACC game all season , a record that won it the ACC 's Coastal Division and the accompanying spot in the ACC Championship Game ahead of Virginia Tech , which was No. 2 in the division . 
 Virginia Tech broke its two @-@ game losing streak by defeating non @-@ conference foe East Carolina on November 5 . The victory was the start of a four @-@ game win streak that brought Virginia Tech to the end of the regular season and restored its national ranking to No. 12 after falling to No. 23 following the North Carolina loss . 
 = = = Tennessee = = = 
 The Tennessee Volunteers entered the 2009 season following a 2008 campaign that ended with a bowl @-@ ineligible 5 @-@ 7 record . After the 2008 season ended , Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin , who promised to turn the program around . Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of NCAA rules . In a season @-@ opening win over Western Kentucky , Kiffin appeared to have made a difference for Tennessee , as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years . 
 That victory was followed by consecutive losses , however , against UCLA and No. 1 @-@ ranked Florida . Tennessee ended its losing streak with a win against Ohio , then began alternating wins and losses . The victory against Ohio was followed by a loss to Auburn . A win against Georgia preceded a loss to No. 2 Alabama on a last @-@ second blocked field goal and a win against No. 22 South Carolina . After South Carolina , Tennessee beat Memphis to create its first winning streak of the season . That streak abruptly ended the following week , when Tennessee lost to Mississippi . 
 The Volunteers won their last two games of the regular season — against Vanderbilt and Kentucky — bringing them to a record of 7 @-@ 5 . At no time during the season was Tennessee ranked in the national top @-@ 25 polls , and Tennessee was never in consideration to play in the SEC Championship Game because of its early loss to Florida . 
 = = Pregame buildup = = 
 In the weeks before the game , media coverage focused on the geographic rivalry between the two teams , the controversies surrounding Lane Kiffin , and the performances of the players on each team . Virginia Tech played in the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl in 2006 , losing to Georgia 31 @-@ 24 , and the 2009 game was its fourth appearance in the game . It was Tennessee 's fifth appearance in the game , and the Volunteers had most recently lost to Clemson in the 2004 contest , 27 @-@ 14 . Entering the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , Virginia Tech was 0 @-@ 2 in games held in Atlanta during 2010 , it had lost four consecutive games to SEC foes , and it had never won back @-@ to @-@ back bowl games ( Tech won the 2009 Orange Bowl ) . Despite those factors , Virginia Tech was an early 4 @.@ 5 @-@ point favorite and was listed as a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ point favorite by spread bettors on the day before the game . 
 = = = Geographic rivalry = = = 
 The University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech are separated by only 233 miles ( 375 km ) by road , and no major university lies between the two , creating an intense geographical rivalry in that region of the Appalachian Mountains . As Virginia Tech linebacker Cody Grimm said before the game , " ( In ) Southwest Virginia , you are either a Tennessee fan or a Tech fan . Now we actually get a chance to play them . " 
 Despite the proximity of the two schools , the 2009 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl was only their eighth football meeting . Tennessee held a 5 @-@ 2 advantage in the series , but before 1994 , the last meeting between them was in 1937 . The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl , which the Volunteers won 45 @-@ 23 . Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17 @,@ 000 tickets , and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced . This gave the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout . 
 = = = Tennessee coaching turmoil = = = 
 In the weeks leading up to the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , the number of controversies surrounding Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin continued to grow . Throughout the regular season , he was linked to violations of NCAA rules and actions that appeared to fall outside the norm for SEC coaches . He was mentioned in a rap song by Lil Wayne , and his combative attitude toward opposing coaches caused friction within the SEC . In the second week of December , he was connected to an ongoing scandal in which Tennessee hostesses allegedly helped lure recruits to Tennessee , violating NCAA rules . Despite these problems , he was a successful recruiter , and gained commitments from sought @-@ after recruits in the leadup to the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl . 
 In addition to the off @-@ the @-@ field issues , Tennessee underwent a pair of coaching changes in the weeks before the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl . Wide receivers coach Frank Wilson and running backs coach Eddie Gran each decided in the first days of December to leave Tennessee for other SEC teams . In interviews , Kiffin said the coaching changes and stories surrounding him were not a distraction from his team 's bowl preparation . 
 = = = Virginia Tech offense = = = 
 During the 2009 season , Virginia Tech was 28th nationally in scoring offense ( number of points scored ) and 55th in total offense . Most of the Hokies ' success came on the ground : Tech was 16th nationally in rushing offense but 98th in passing offense . A large reason for Virginia Tech 's offensive success was running back Ryan Williams , who broke Virginia Tech 's single @-@ season rushing record that year . Entering the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , he had 1 @,@ 538 yards , only 110 short of the record . Tech running back Darren Evans , who tore his left anterior cruciate ligament before the season began , was held out of the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , even though his recovery had progressed to the point that he could have participated . 
 Virginia Tech also was rated higher than Tennessee in every major special teams category . The Hokies were in the top 25 in both kickoff return yardage defense and kickoff returns and were No. 16 nationally in turnover margin . 
 = = = Tennessee offense = = = 
 At the conclusion of the 2009 regular season , Tennessee 's offense was the 32nd most successful squad in the nation , scoring an average of 30 @.@ 58 points per game . In terms of yardage gained , Tennessee was 48th . There wasn 't much difference between the success of the rushing offense ( 43rd ) and the passing offense ( 47th ) . Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton , after struggling in 2008 , improved significantly in 2009 , when he passed for 2 @,@ 565 yards and 26 touchdowns . In 2008 , the Volunteers were 11th in the SEC in offense , averaging 145 @.@ 8 yards per game . In 2009 , they were third , averaging 225 @.@ 6 yards per game . In addition to Crompton , running back Montario Hardesty also improved his performance from 2008 to 2009 . In the season leading up to the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , he had 1 @,@ 306 rushing yards , just 158 short of the single @-@ season Tennessee record , and 12 touchdowns . Entering the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , Hardesty hoped to match the team 's rushing record , but doubted he would be able to because of past knee injuries that made it difficult to run on artificial turf . Volunteers tight end Luke Stocker , who caught 27 passes for 370 yards and six touchdowns in 2009 , was a player Virginia Tech 's defense focused on in pregame preparation . 
 Because Tennessee 's placekicking had been erratic during the regular season , Tennessee 's head coach held an open competition among his three kickers to compete for the starting placekicking job in the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl . 
 = = = Virginia Tech defense = = = 
 In 2009 , Virginia Tech was ranked 14th in total defense , sixth in passing defense , and 52nd in rushing defense . In scoring defense , the Hokies were 11th nationally , permitting an average of 15 @.@ 75 points per game . The top individual performer on the defense was linebacker Cody Grimm , who tied for the most forced fumbles in college football during the regular season , with seven . In recognition of the achievement , he earned the Dudley Award , given annually to the top Division I football player in Virginia , and was named a first @-@ team All @-@ ACC and third @-@ team All @-@ America player . Cornerback Stephen Virgil , a starter for the Hokies in 10 of their regular @-@ season games , was declared ineligible for the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl because of poor grades . Defensive coordinator Bud Foster was wooed by several other teams between the conclusion of the regular season and the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , but Foster remained at Tech after the school created an annuity for Foster , granted if he remained with the team for five more years . 
 = = = Tennessee defense = = = 
 Tennessee 's defense was prized for its success against opponents ' passing game . In 2009 , the Volunteers were 10th nationally against the pass , permitting an average of 165 @.@ 92 yards per game . Against the run , they were 58th . When both facets were combined , the defense was 16th , permitting an average of 308 @.@ 83 yards per game . Much of the reason for Tennessee 's success against the pass was star safety Eric Berry , only the second player in Tennessee history to be named a unanimous All @-@ American twice . He won the Jim Thorpe Award , given each year to the best defensive back in the nation . Joining Berry in the defensive secondary was Janzen Jackson , who returned to the field following three missed games caused by his alleged involvement in an armed robbery . Countering Jackson 's return , Tennessee lost defensive back Brent Vinson , who was dismissed from the team for reasons unrevealed at the time . Two months after the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , Vinson was charged with tampering with evidence related to a murder investigation . Tennessee defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin , interviewed 10 days before the game , said Virginia Tech 's offensive strength presented problems for Tennessee .

 The 2009 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl kicked off at 7 : 37 p.m. EST on December 31 , 2009 , in the Georgia Dome , Atlanta , Georgia . Bowl officials announced 73 @,@ 777 people attended the game , but that figure was based on the number of tickets sold rather than actual turnstile attendance . That attendance figure was the fourth @-@ largest in Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl history , including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl , and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game . The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN , and was watched by an estimated 4 @.@ 87 million people , earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4 @.@ 2 . That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season , and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year 's rating . The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough , Matt Millen , and Holly Rowe . Because the game was played indoors , weather was not a factor . 
 The ceremonial playing of the national anthem was performed by trumpeter Dan Oxley . The game 's referee was Ed Ardito , its umpire was Greg Adams , and its linesman was Jim Laborde , all of Conference USA . A military veteran from each school was invited to the ceremonial pregame coin toss to determine first possession . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 Tennessee won that ceremonial coin toss and chose to kick off to begin the game , ensuring the Volunteers received the ball to begin the second half . Tennessee placekicker Chad Cunningham delivered the ball from the tee , and Virginia Tech 's Dyrell Roberts returned it to the Tech 26 @-@ yard line , where Virginia Tech began the game 's first offensive drive . Two running plays by Tech 's Ryan Williams gained 4 yards , then Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a seven @-@ yard pass for the game 's initial first down . Tech advanced as far as its 43 @-@ yard line , but a five @-@ yard false @-@ start penalty prevented the Hokies from gaining another first down . They punted the ball to Tennessee , which began its first drive of the game from its 11 @-@ yard line . 
 Two running plays gained 11 yards and a first down , then Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton began throwing the ball . His first pass the game fell incomplete , and his second was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Rashad Carmichael , who ran it back to the Tennessee 44 @-@ yard line . Tech 's second drive of the game thus began in Tennessee 's defensive half . The first play of the drive was a 20 @-@ yard throw from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin . That completed pass was the longest play of the drive , which continued through short rushes and passes . On the seventh play after the interception , Williams ran the ball forward one yard , crossing the goal line for the game 's first touchdown . Tech placekicker Matt Waldron successfully converted the extra point , and with 6 : 56 remaining in the first quarter , Tech led 7 @-@ 0 . 
 Virginia Tech 's post @-@ score kickoff was returned to the Tennessee 25 @-@ yard line , but the Volunteers failed to gain a first down on their second drive of the game , going three @-@ and @-@ out . They punted , returning the ball to Virginia Tech at the Hokies ' 31 @-@ yard line . Taylor completed a 14 @-@ yard pass to Roberts and a 10 @-@ yard throw to Marcus Davis for two first downs , advancing the Hokies into Tennessee 's half of the field , but Virginia Tech 's drive petered out after Williams was tackled for a three @-@ yard loss and the Hokies were unable to regain the lost yardage . Tech punted to the Tennessee 10 @-@ yard line , where the Volunteers took over on offense with 1 : 16 remaining in the quarter . Crompton completed a passing play that lost three yards , then Tennessee regained two of those yards with a running play as time expired in the quarter with Tech leading , 7 @-@ 0 . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 The second quarter began with Tennessee facing third down and 11 from its 9 @-@ yard line . The first play of the quarter ended in a two @-@ yard loss for Tennessee , and the Volunteers punted after their second consecutive three @-@ and @-@ out . Starting at Tennessee 's 46 @-@ yard line after the punt , Tech quarterback Taylor completed a 42 @-@ yard pass to Danny Coale on the Hokies ' first play of the quarter , giving Virginia Tech a first down at the Tennessee 4 @-@ yard line . There , however , Tennessee 's defense stiffened . Tech was stopped for no gain on consecutive plays , but on third down the Volunteers committed a facemask penalty , giving Virginia Tech a first down at the 1 @-@ yard line . Even then , it took Ryan Williams two plays to gain the momentum needed to cross the goal line for Virginia Tech 's second touchdown . The score and subsequent extra point gave the Hokies a 14 @-@ 0 lead with 11 : 56 remaining before halftime . 
 Virginia Tech 's kickoff was downed for a touchback , and Tennessee started its drive from its 20 @-@ yard line . On the second play of the possession , Crompton completed a 40 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Denarius Moore . The play gave Tennessee its first plays inside Virginia Tech territory , and the Volunteers capitalized on the field position . After two rushing plays were stymied for no gain or losses , Crompton completed a 15 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones . Crompton was sacked on the next play , but two plays later completed a 20 @-@ yard throw to Jones , who ran out of bounds at the Tech 4 @-@ yard line , giving Tennessee another first down . Two plays later , running back Montario Hardesty ran forward four yards into the end zone , halving Virginia Tech 's lead . After the extra point , Virginia Tech still led , 14 @-@ 7 , with 6 : 43 remaining in the first half . 
 Following Tennessee 's score , the two teams traded possessions as each offense went three @-@ and @-@ out . Virginia Tech 's offense then began a drive from its 40 @-@ yard line with 3 : 21 remaining in the half . Williams gained a first down with a pair of five @-@ yard running plays , and Taylor gained 21 yards on another running play . Tech advanced to the Tennessee 31 @-@ yard line , where Taylor was sacked for a loss of nine yards . In an effort to recover the lost field position , Taylor threw a pass downfield , but the ball was intercepted by Tennessee 's Janzen Jackson , who returned it to the Tech 48 @-@ yard line . Tennessee 's offense entered the field of play with 1 : 11 remaining in the quarter , and it moved quickly . On the first play of the drive , a Crompton pass was caught by Hardesty for a 47 @-@ yard gain . Two plays later , Crompton completed a two @-@ yard toss to Moore for a touchdown . The extra point tied the game at 14 with 18 seconds remaining before halftime . 
 Tennessee 's post @-@ touchdown kickoff was returned to the Tech 33 @-@ yard line , but Virginia Tech decided to not run an inconsequential play to drain the final seconds from the clock and enter halftime . On the first play after the kickoff , Taylor threw a surprise pass downfield to Boykin , who was tackled at the Tennessee four @-@ yard line . Instant replay revealed there were two seconds remaining on the game clock after the play , and Virginia Tech placekicker Matt Waldron came onto the field to complete a 21 @-@ yard field goal as time expired . The Hokies thus regained a 17 @-@ 14 lead at halftime . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game , Tennessee received the ball to begin the second half . After a short return , Tennessee 's offense started the half from its 30 @-@ yard line . Crompton completed passes of 11 and 8 yards , then Virginia Tech 's defense halted the Tennessee advance and forced a punt . Virginia Tech 's offense began its first drive of the second half at its 26 @-@ yard line , with 13 : 02 remaining in the quarter . From the 26 , Tech began an eight @-@ play drive that saw Ryan Williams carry the ball on seven consecutive plays . Only the final play of the drive , a one @-@ yard touchdown run by Tyrod Taylor , didn 't feature the Tech running back . Williams opened the drive with a 21 @-@ yard sprint and had a 32 @-@ yard run during the possession that ended with Taylor 's touchdown at the 8 : 42 mark in the quarter . The touchdown and extra point extended Tech 's lead to 24 @-@ 14 . 
 Tennessee attempted to answer Tech 's score in its following possession . The Hokies ' kickoff resulted in a touchback , so the Volunteers began from their 20 @-@ yard line . Montario Hardesty gained a first down with a 10 @-@ yard run , then Crompton gained another first down with an 11 @-@ yard pass . Tennessee continued to advance on running plays and a 14 @-@ yard pass by Crompton , pushing the ball inside the Tech 30 @-@ yard line . Once there , however , the Hokies rallied by sacking Crompton for a seven @-@ yard loss . A two @-@ yard run and an incomplete pass kept Tennessee from gaining another first down , setting up a fourth down . Rather than try an offensive play and possibly gain a first down or turn the ball over on downs , Tennessee punted , forcing Virginia Tech 's offense to start from its 11 @-@ yard line . 
 Building on the rushing success of its previous drive , Virginia Tech used fullback Josh Oglesby in tandem with Williams , who also figured prominently in the team 's second possession of the half . The two men combined for 19 yards on the first three plays of the drive , then Williams exited the game because of an injury . After play resumed , Taylor gained 10 yards on a rushing play and completed a 23 @-@ yard pass before Oglesby carried the ball again . When the third quarter ended , Virginia Tech faced second down at the Tennessee 30 @-@ yard line , still leading 24 @-@ 14 . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Virginia Tech began the quarter in possession of the ball in Tennessee territory , attempting to capitalize upon a drive begun in the third quarter . Tennessee 's defense , however , allowed only one yard on the first two plays of the quarter , and Tech placekicker Waldron returned to the field to convert a 46 @-@ yard field goal , extending Virginia Tech 's lead to 27 @-@ 14 with 13 : 33 left in the game . 
 After Virginia Tech 's post @-@ score kickoff and a short return , Tennessee 's offense started from its 31 @-@ yard line . A five @-@ yard penalty against Virginia Tech was followed by a five @-@ yard first @-@ down run by Hardesty . Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech 's lead by scoring fast . Crompton completed an 18 @-@ yard pass , advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory , but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five @-@ yard false start penalty , forcing the Volunteers to punt . The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback , and Tech 's offense returned to the field at its 20 @-@ yard line . 
 As in the previous two drives , Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense : The first five plays of the drive were runs by David Wilson , who gained 26 yards . The Hokies then switched gears , surprising Tennessee , whose defense allowed a 30 @-@ yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin . Tech reverted to running plays , but Tennessee again allowed a long gain , as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run , then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone . The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34 @-@ 14 lead with 5 : 14 remaining in the game . 
 Tech 's kickoff was returned to the Tennessee 25 @-@ yard line , but on the first play of the Volunteers ' drive , Crompton was sacked by Jason Worilds and fumbled the ball . The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech 's John Graves at the Tennessee 13 @-@ yard line . The Hokies ' offense returned to the field and began running out the clock with running plays , which keep the game clock ticking as long as the ball carrier is tackled in the field of play . Three rushing plays failed to gain a first down , but they drained more than two minutes from the game clock , and Tech 's Waldron extended the Hokies ' lead to 37 @-@ 14 with a 22 @-@ yard field goal . 
 Tennessee had one final opportunity to score after receiving Virginia Tech 's kickoff with 2 : 38 remaining . Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield , completing throws of 9 , 9 , 8 , and 26 yards , advancing the Volunteers toward the end zone . Inside the Virginia Tech red zone , however , the Volunteers found less success . They committed a false start penalty , advanced the ball with a five @-@ yard run , then Crompton threw two incomplete passes . On fourth down , Crompton was sacked for a 14 @-@ yard loss , the Volunteers ' final play of the game . Virginia Tech knelt on the ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37 @-@ 14 victory .

 = = Statistical summary = = 
 In recognition of his performance , Virginia Tech running back Ryan Williams was named the game 's most valuable player . On 25 carries , Williams accumulated 117 rushing yards and two touchdowns . Williams also caught two passes : one that gained six yards and one that lost six yards . Williams ' performance , coupled with success early in the season , allowed him to set Tech 's single @-@ season rushing record with 1 @,@ 655 yards . The game was Williams ' 10th of at least 100 yards that season . Williams also set two ACC records : His touchdowns gave him 21 rushing touchdowns on the season and 22 total touchdowns . 
 Alone , Williams had more rushing yards than all of Tennessee 's players combined . Tennessee 's leading rusher was Montario Hardesty , who carried the ball 18 times for 39 yards and a touchdown . Hardesty had 1 @,@ 345 rushing yards on the season , the fourth @-@ highest season total for any player in Tennessee 's history . Tennessee 's No. 2 rusher was Tauren Poole , who gained 15 yards on 3 carries . Collectively , Tennessee had just five yards net rushing , the second @-@ least ever in a Tennessee bowl game and the least allowed by Virginia Tech in a bowl game . Most of Tennessee 's rushing gains were negated when quarterback Jonathan Crompton was sacked six times , losing 55 yards . 
 Though ineffective on the ground , Crompton outperformed Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor in the passing game . Crompton completed 15 of 26 pass attempts for 235 yards , one touchdown , and one interception . Crompton finished the season with 27 touchdown passes , third @-@ most in school history , and had the fourth @-@ most pass attempts , ninth @-@ most completions , and eighth @-@ most yards for a Tennessee season . Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed 10 of 17 passes for 209 yards and one interception . 
 Tennessee 's Herman <unk> led all defenders with 12 total tackles , including 2 tackles for loss , both career highs . The game 's No. 2 tackler was Tennessee 's Dan Williams , who tied a career high by recording nine tackles , including half a sack . Virginia Tech 's leading tackler was <unk> Gibson , who had eight tackles , including half a tackle for loss . Virginia Tech 's John Graves , participating in his first game of the season , had two tackles for loss , including a sack , and forced a fumble . Virginia Tech 's other forced turnover was an interception caught by cornerback Rashad Carmichael . Tennessee 's Janzen Jackson had the Volunteers ' only interception . 
 Virginia Tech kicker Matt Waldron set a school record for most field goals in a bowl game ( 3 ) and tied the school record for the longest bowl @-@ game field goal with his 46 @-@ yard kick .

 Virginia Tech 's victory gave the team its sixth consecutive 10 @-@ win season and brought the Hokies to a final 2009 record of 10 @-@ 3 . It was the first time in school history that Tech won bowl games in consecutive years . Tennessee 's loss dropped it to 7 @-@ 6 , and the Volunteers remained unranked in the final college football polls of the year . Virginia Tech was credited for its bowl @-@ game win and rose to 10th in both the Associated Press and coaches ' polls . Visiting fans generated an estimated $ 31 @.@ 2 million in business for the Atlanta area . 
 Several players from each team participated in all @-@ star games following the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl . Virginia Tech 's Kam Chancellor , Sergio Render and Stephan Virgil played in the 2010 East @-@ West Shrine Game . Tennessee 's Morgan Cox , Chris Scott and Dan Williams played in the Senior Bowl , while Jonathan Crompton and Vladimir Richard participated in the Texas vs The Nation game . These all @-@ star games were a chance for graduating players to highlight their skills before the 2010 NFL Draft , which took place in April . A handful of players from each team were selected through the draft to play for National Football League teams . 
 Tennessee had six players selected , including two in the first round : safety Eric Berry was the fifth selection overall , followed by Dan Williams ( 26 ) , Montario Hardesty ( 59 ) , Jacques McClendon ( 129 ) , Chris Scott ( 151 ) , and Jonathan Crompton ( 168 ) . Virginia Tech had five players selected : Jason Worilds was picked 52nd overall , followed by Kam Chancellor ( 133 ) , Ed Wang ( 140 ) , Brent Bowden ( 172 ) , and Cody Grimm ( 210 ) . 
 In addition to player changes , Tennessee saw coaching changes . Two weeks after the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl defeat , Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin announced he was leaving the team to become the new head coach of the University of Southern California football team . The decision shocked Tennessee administrators and fans , who believed Kiffin would stay longer than one season . To replace Kiffin , Tennessee hired Derek Dooley , who had been coaching football at Louisiana Tech . Defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator Ed <unk> also left with Kiffin . They were replaced by Justin Wilcox and Chuck Smith , respectively . 
 Dooley also changed position coaches , naming Terry Joseph defensive backs coach and Eric Russell special teams coach . To coach quarterbacks , he brought in Darin Hinshaw of Memphis . He hired Charlie Baggett to coach wide receivers and serve as assistant head coach , and added assistant coach Harry <unk> and strength and conditioning coach Bennie Wylie . He retained offensive coordinator Jim Chaney from Kiffin 's staff . 
 = History of the National Hockey League ( 1942 – 67 ) = 
 The Original Six era of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) began in 1942 with the demise of the Brooklyn Americans , reducing the league to six teams : Boston Bruins , Chicago Black Hawks , Detroit Red Wings , Montreal Canadiens , New York Rangers , and Toronto Maple Leafs . This structure remained stable for a quarter century ; the era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size adding six expansion teams . 
 The Stanley Cup , was the de facto championship since 1926 , becoming the de jure championship in 1947 , when the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain control of the Cup . Toronto and Montreal evidenced dynasties , as the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup nine times from 1942 onwards , while the Canadiens won ten times , including five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960 . The 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date . 
 Remarkably , Maurice Richard became the first player to score 50 goals in a season in 1944 – 45 . In 1955 , Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman , leading to the Richard Riot . Gordie Howe made his debut in 1946 , retiring 32 years later as the NHL 's all @-@ time leader in both goals and points . Willie O 'Ree broke the NHL 's colour barrier when he dressed for the Bruins in 1958 . 
 The NHL continued to develop throughout the era . In 1943 , in an attempt to ' open up ' the game , the league introduced the centre @-@ ice red line allowing players for the first time to pass out of their defensive zone . In 1959 , Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to regularly wear a face mask for protection . Off the ice , the business of hockey was changing as well . The first amateur draft was held in 1963 as part of efforts to balance talent distribution within the league . The National Hockey League Players Association was formed in 1967 , ten years after Ted Lindsay 's attempts at unionization failed . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1930s and early 1940s , both the Great Depression and World War II were detrimental to the NHL . Although the league peaked at ten teams between 1926 and 1931 , financial pressures led to the demise of several of these . In 1930 , the Pittsburgh Pirates relocated to become the Philadelphia Quakers before folding in 1931 . In 1934 , the Ottawa Senators became the St. Louis Eagles , and likewise ceased operations after one year in their new market . The Montreal Maroons suspended operations in 1937 as the Montreal market was unable to support two teams . The New York Americans , renamed the Brooklyn Americans , suspended operations in 1942 , citing financial difficulty , and a lack of players due to the war . By the 1942 – 43 season , the league was reduced to six teams . 
 There was also change at the top ; in February 1943 , league President Frank Calder collapsed during a meeting , dying shortly after . After receiving assurances from the league the Brooklyn franchise he operated would resume play after the war , Red Dutton agreed to take over as president . When the other team owners reneged on this promise in 1946 , Dutton resigned as league president . In 1946 , with Dutton 's recommendation , Clarence Campbell was named president of the NHL . Campbell remained until retirement in 1977 . Campbell 's tenure matched the league 's stability . For the first 21 years of his presidency , the same six teams competed for the Stanley Cup ; that period has been called the " golden age of hockey " . The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game . 
 = = Post @-@ war period = = 
 World War II extensively ravaged the rosters of many teams ; by the 1943 – 44 season teams battled each other for players . In need of a goaltender , the Bruins won a fight with the Canadiens over the services of Bert Gardiner . Meanwhile , the Rangers were forced to lend forward Phil Watson to the Canadiens in exchange for two players , as Watson was required in Montreal for a war job , and refused permission to play in New York . 
 With only five returning players from the previous season , Rangers general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspension of his team 's play for the duration of the war . Patrick was otherwise persuaded ; however , the Rangers managed only six wins in a 50 @-@ game schedule , giving up 310 goals that year . The Rangers were so desperate for players that 42 @-@ year @-@ old coach Frank Boucher made a brief comeback , recording four goals and ten assists in 15 games . That year the Canadiens dominated the league , finishing with a 38 – 5 – 7 record . Five losses remains a league record for the fewest in one season ; the Canadiens did not lose a game on home ice . Their 1944 Stanley Cup victory was the team 's first in 14 seasons . The Canadiens again dominated the 1944 – 45 , finishing with a 38 – 8 – 4 record . They were defeated in the playoffs by the underdog Maple Leafs , who eventually won the Cup . 
 NHL teams exclusively competed for the Stanley Cup following the 1926 demise of the Western Hockey League . Though rejected by Cup trustees for various reasons , in the intervening years other teams , and leagues , attempted to challenge for the Cup . In 1947 , the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant Cup control to the NHL , thereby allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues . The last such challenge came in 1953 , from the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League ; it was rejected , as the AHL was not considered of equivalent calibre to the NHL , which was a condition of the NHL 's ' deal ' with trustees . 
 The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership of James T. Sutherland , a former President of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association ( CAHA ) . The Hall of Fame was established as a joint venture between the NHL and the CAHA , in Kingston , Ontario , considered by Sutherland the birthplace of hockey . Originally called the " International Hockey Hall of Fame " , its mandate was to honor great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location . The first eleven honored members were inducted on April 30 , 1945 . Not until 1961 did the Hockey Hall of Fame establish a permanent home at Exhibition Place in Toronto . 
 On October 13 , 1947 , to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society , the first official All @-@ Star Game took place at Toronto 's Maple Leaf Gardens . The NHL All @-@ Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4 – 3 and raised C $ 25 @,@ 000 for the pension fund . The All @-@ Star Game remains an annual tradition . 
 = = = " Rocket " Richard = = = 
 The 1940s Canadiens were led by the " Punch line " of Elmer Lach , Toe Blake and Maurice " Rocket " Richard . In 1944 – 45 , Lach , Richard and Blake finished first , second and third in the NHL 's scoring race with 80 , 73 and 67 points , respectively . Richard became a media and fan focus with attempts to score 50 goals in a 50 @-@ game season , a feat no other player had accomplished in league history . During that season , in a 9 – 1 victory over Detroit on December 28 , 1944 , Richard set a single @-@ game scoring record , scoring five goals and three assists . Later scoring his 45th goal in his 42nd game , he broke Joe Malone 's goal scoring record . Opposing teams did all they could to prevent him from reaching the 50 @-@ goal mark : he was slashed , elbowed and held , as no team wanted to be known for giving up the 50th goal . Despite the opposition 's efforts , in Boston at 17 : 45 of the third period of Montreal 's final game of the season , Richard scored his 50th goal . Until Mike Bossy in 1980 – 81 , no other player scored 50 goals in 50 games . 
 In March 1955 , Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season , including the playoffs , after receiving a match penalty for slashing Boston 's Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene . The suspension created a wave of anger towards Campbell , who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats , mainly from French @-@ Canadians accusing him of anti @-@ French bias . Dismissing the warnings , Campbell attended the March 17 game , as planned . His presence was interpreted by many fans as provocation ; he was booed , and pelted with eggs and fruit ; an hour into the game , a fan lobbed a tear @-@ gas bomb in Campbell 's direction ; firefighters decided to clear the building . A riot ensued outside the Forum as disenchanted fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators ; the hostile crowd overwhelmed 250 police officers on the scene . Seventy people were arrested , another 37 people were injured ; fifty stores were looted , and $ 100 @,@ 000 in property damage was reported , in what became known as l 'affaire Richard , or the Richard Riot . 
 The following day , Richard went on Montreal radio to ask fans to cease rioting , and instead support the Canadiens in the playoffs ; he offered to take his punishment then come back the following year to win the Cup . While the Canadiens were eliminated in the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals , Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup . The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada ; the riot is often characterized as an early manifestation of Quebec 's Quiet Revolution . Campbell 's decision to suspend Richard was widely supported by fans outside of Quebec . Some , including Detroit 's Ted Lindsay , said the suspension did not go far enough and argued Richard , a man who had paid more fines than any other player in league history , should have been banned for life . 
 On October 19 , 1957 , Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals . He retired in 1960 , as an eight @-@ time Stanley Cup champion , as well as the NHL 's all @-@ time leading scorer , with 544 goals . In 1961 , the league waived the customary three @-@ year waiting period ; Richard was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame . 
 = = = Hockey Night in Canada = = = 
 In the fall of 1951 , in an attempt to determine whether it a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games , Conn Smythe watched special television feeds of Maple Leaf games . Television already had detractors within the NHL , especially Campbell who declared it " the greatest menace of the entertainment world " . In 1952 , even though only 10 % of Canadians owned a television set , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) began televising games . On November 1 , 1952 , Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television , with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens . The broadcasts quickly became the highest @-@ rated show on Canadian television . The broadcast came three weeks after Montreal radio host René Lecavalier presented a French @-@ language telecast of the Montreal Canadiens ' opener against Chicago , marking the beginning of La <unk> du hockey , which Radio @-@ Canada , the French arm of the CBC , broadcast until 2004 . On that same night , Danny Gallivan made his debut as the English language play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the Canadiens . 
 While Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person , Smythe felt the opposite . " There 'll be thousands of people seeing hockey as played by the pros for the first time . They 'll be sold on it because it 's a great game , and they won 't be satisfied to stay [ at home ] but will turn out to the rinks . " As an experiment in the 1956 – 57 season , CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States . Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts , it inaugurated a 21 @-@ game package of games the following year . The NHL itself adapted to become viewer @-@ friendly . In 1949 , to make the puck easier to see , the league mandated the ice surface painted white . In 1951 , so each team was distinguishable on black and white television , the League required home teams wear colored jerseys , and the road teams wear white . For the same reason , teams painted the centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from the solid blue lines .

 In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals , in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime , the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one . After dashing from his defensive position , despite an earlier warning from Smythe not to take unnecessary chances , Leafs ' defenceman Bill Barilko hammered the Cup @-@ winning goal past Montreal goaltender Gerry McNeil . The goal completed Toronto 's fourth Stanley Cup championship in five seasons , making Barilko a national hero . Four months later , Barilko and a friend disappeared in Northern Ontario , where they had flown on a fishing trip . Barilko 's disappearance became front page news across Canada ; a massive search failed to locate the missing plane . Barilko 's remains were not found until 1962 , the first year the Maple Leafs won the Cup since Barilko 's overtime winner eleven years previous . Barilko 's disappearance was immortalized 40 years later by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip in their 1992 song " Fifty Mission Cap " . 
 By 1962 , the disappearance of Bill Barilko and the Maple Leafs ' subsequent failure to win the Stanley Cup led Toronto fans to believe a curse was upon the team . The Leafs won the 1962 championship shortly before Barilko 's remains were discovered . In 1963 , they repeated as champions . In 1964 , the Leafs again played for the Stanley Cup against the Red Wings . In the third period of game six , trailing the series 3 – 2 , Maple Leafs ' defenceman Bobby Baun suffered a broken ankle from a Gordie Howe slap shot . Despite the injury , Baun returned with his ankle taped up to score the winning goal in overtime . Baun also played the seventh game as the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings to win their third consecutive title . 
 = = = Detroit Red Wings = = = 
 Beginning in 1948 – 49 , the Red Wings went on to win seven consecutive regular season titles - a feat no other team has accomplished . During that time , the Wings won four Stanley Cups . During the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals the Legend of the Octopus was created . For the fourth game of the finals , brothers Pete and Jerry <unk> brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia . At the time , they reasoned the eight tentacles of an octopus represented the eight wins required to win the Stanley Cup . The Wings had won seven consecutive playoff games , and the brothers hoped the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth victory . The tradition was born , as Detroit handily defeated Montreal 3 – 0 . 
 During this time , the Wings were led by Gordie Howe . In 1943 , at the age of 15 , Howe was invited to the Rangers player camp in Winnipeg ; but quickly became homesick and failed to favorably impress the Rangers coaches . The next season the Red Wings invited him to their camp , where coach Jack Adams called him " the best prospect I 've seen in 20 years . " Two years later , at the age of 18 , Howe debuted in the NHL for Detroit . On March 28 , 1950 , during a playoff game against the Leafs , Howe was nearly killed as he mistimed an attempted check on Toronto 's Ted Kennedy , causing him to slam head first into the boards . <unk> to hospital , doctors drilled a hole into Howe 's skull to relieve pressure on his brain . Despite fears he would never play again , " Mr. Hockey " recovered to start the following season , then won his first of four consecutive scoring titles in 1950 – 51 . Howe was 52 years old when he retired from professional hockey . 
 = = = Montreal Canadiens = = = 
 In three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956 , the Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals . Detroit won the first two match @-@ ups , however , Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup , ending one dynasty and starting another . Subsequently , the Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960 , a feat no other team has duplicated . 
 In 1953 , the Canadiens signed Jean Beliveau ; a well @-@ anticipated prospect in the NHL for years . Because his Quebec Senior Hockey League team , the Quebec Aces , matched any contract offer the Canadiens made , Beliveau repeatedly refused to turn professional with Montreal . Ultimately , Montreal bought the entire league outright , along with the rights to all players , and turned it professional . Beliveau finally signed with Montreal for $ 105 @,@ 000 over five years and a $ 20 @,@ 000 bonus , an unprecedented contract for a rookie . Playing for Montreal , Beliveau went on to win ten Stanley Cups . 
 Led by Richard and Beliveau , the 1950s Canadiens had overwhelming offensive ability ; to slow their offence the NHL amended its rules . To illustrate , the 1955 – 56 Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals during the same two @-@ minute powerplay . In one game against Boston , during a penalty , Beliveau scored three goals in 44 seconds . For the following season , the league instituted a rule permitting a player serving a minor penalty to return to the ice when a goal was scored against his team . 
 = = Breaking the colour barrier = = 
 On January 18 , 1958 , by joining the Bruins as an ' injury call @-@ up ' for a game in Montreal , Willie O 'Ree became the first black player in the NHL . Playing only two games with the Bruins in the 1957 – 58 season , O 'Ree returned in 1960 – 61 , playing another 43 games with Boston . Although he only played 45 NHL games , scoring four goals , he earned the label the " Jackie Robinson of hockey " . 
 Throughout the season , O 'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents , remarking " people just wanted a piece of me , maybe because they thought I was different , so I had to defend myself . I wasn 't going to be run out of any rink . " He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago , Detroit and New York , though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto . O 'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans . He stated " they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York , too . But never in Boston . I 'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk , Doug <unk> , Charlie Burns and Don McKenney . They accepted me totally . All of them had class . " In 1961 , O 'Ree was traded to Montreal but was unable to crack the Canadiens ' line @-@ up . Playing over 20 minor league seasons , O 'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League 's scoring title : in 1964 , with the Los Angeles Blades , and in 1969 , with the San Diego Gulls . 
 O 'Ree 's breakthrough came several years after another black player , Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity . In 1938 – 39 , playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association 's Toronto Rangers , during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told " See that man sitting in the blues ? That 's Conn Smythe , owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs . He says he 'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white . " Stung by the comments , Carnegie resolved to excel at the game . He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950 , then a spot on their lowest minor league team . " They told me that if I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven , I would make international headlines . I told them my family couldn 't eat headlines . That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me . " 
 = = " Norris House League " = = 
 During the 1960s , it was often joked " NHL " stood for " Norris House League " because the Norris family held interests in several league teams . James D. Norris was co @-@ owner of the Black Hawks along with Arthur Wirtz ; his brother Bruce inherited ownership of the Red Wings . James D. Norris was also the largest shareholder in Madison Square Garden , giving him control over the Rangers . 
 The Black Hawks qualified for the playoffs only once between 1949 and 1957 . The team 's fortunes turned in 1958 – 59 , following the acquisition of Ted Lindsay and Glenn Hall from Detroit . Making the playoffs , the Black Hawks lost to Montreal in the semi @-@ finals in 1959 and 1960 , before capturing their first championship in 23 years , in the 1961 Stanley Cup Finals . Chicago next won the Cup 49 years later in the 2009 @-@ 10 season . 
 The Hawks ' resurgence in the 1960s led Norris and Wirtz to take advantage of their customers . Dubbed the " Chicken Wings " by fans , the Hawks were famous for fleecing fans . Ticket sellers were arrested for scalping ; the team charged $ 9 for playoff tickets in 1965 , $ 3 more than Detroit , Toronto or Montreal . The Hawks also refused to broadcast road playoff games in Chicago , preferring to charge fans to watch the games via closed @-@ circuit television at Chicago Stadium . Fans responded by littering the ice and passing out leaflets urging a boycott of the team during Chicago 's last regular season game in 1964 – 65 . 
 = = Expansion = = 
 In 1963 , Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964 – 65 season . His argument was based around concerns the Western Hockey League intended to operate in the near future as a major league . Jennings also hoped inclusion of teams on the west coast would make the league truly national , and thereby , improve the chances of returning to television in the United States as the NHL had lost its deal with CBS . While the governors did not agree to the proposal , the topic of expansion surfaced every time the owners met subsequently . In 1965 , there was agreement to expand by six teams , doubling the size of the NHL . San Francisco – Oakland and Vancouver were declared " acceptable cities " with Los Angeles and St. Louis as potential sites . Fourteen applications were received from across Canada and the United States , including four from Los Angeles . 
 In February 1966 , the governors met and awarded franchises to Los Angeles , Minnesota , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , San Francisco and St. Louis . The league rejected bids from Baltimore , Buffalo and Vancouver . The six winning bids each paid $ 2 million for their franchises . St. Louis was awarded a franchise with no bid received . The league 's decision to grant a franchise was contingent on a potential owner stepping forward - a decision influenced by the Norris and Wirtz families , who owned the St. Louis Arena . 
 Canadians were outraged no expansion teams were awarded to Canada . Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson stated : " the NHL decision to expand only in the U.S. impinges on the sacred principles of all Canadians . " Maple Leafs coach Punch Imlach stated Vancouver was " sold out " and Toronto and Montreal did not want to share television revenue with another Canadian team . 
 Leafs co @-@ owner Stafford Smythe rejected accusations that he opposed expansion to Vancouver , pointing out that he had offered to build and operate an $ 8 million facility in the city 's downtown area , a proposal that he contended made little sense unless Vancouver had an NHL team . However , Smythe 's proposal was contingent on him acquiring the parcel of land required from the city , then valued at $ 2 @.@ 5 million , for $ 1 . The proposed transaction was defeated in a municipal referendum . Smythe therefore placed the blame for Vancouver 's failed bid on the city : " Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal " , Smythe said . " That proved to me that the people out there aren 't interested in going major league . " 
 The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between the two @-@ time defending champion Canadiens , and the Maple Leafs . The oldest team in the league , the third place Leafs were led in goal by 37 @-@ year @-@ old Terry Sawchuk and 42 @-@ year @-@ old Johnny Bower . Known as the " over the hill gang " , in six games , Toronto became the oldest team to win the Cup , defeating the favored Canadiens . The Maple Leafs have not appeared in the Stanley Cup finals since . 
 = = Rules and innovations = = 
 In 1942 , due to World War II related travel restrictions , league president Frank Calder abolished the 10 @-@ minute overtime for regular season games so teams could catch their trains without delay . With the war 's conclusion , regular season overtime did not return , although playoff games continued until a winner was decided . Overtime was re @-@ introduced in the regular 1983 – 84 season . 
 In 1943 , to make it more entertaining , the rules committee looked to increase the game 's speed . Rangers coach Frank Boucher proposed the neutral zone divided by a centre red line , so teams could pass the puck out of the defensive zone into their half of the neutral zone . Previously , the league required defensive players carry the puck from the defensive zone , not permitting a pass across the blue line . Introduced in 1943 – 44 , the new rule changed the game . Formerly , strong fore @-@ checking pinned opponents in their own zone for minutes at a time ; subsequently , teams rushed up the ice with defencemen passing to forwards beyond the blue line . Scoring increased 10 % league @-@ wide ; four of six teams topped 200 goals , the first time teams did so . In the early 1960s , Stan Mikita inadvertently introduced the curved blade to a hockey stick . Cracking his blade during a practice and not wanting to retrieve another , Mikita shot the puck in anger . He noticed the curve in the cracked blade caused the puck to behave differently . Both Mikita and Bobby Hull experimented with heating and bending their stick blade to create different curves . Using a curved blade , Mikita went on to win four Art Ross Trophies as the NHL 's leading scorer . He later said he regretted the idea : " It 's one of the worst inventions in hockey , because it eliminated the use of the backhand . " 
 The NHL Amateur Draft was first held on June 5 , 1963 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , Quebec . Created by Campbell , it was meant to more evenly distribute talent . To that point , teams directly sponsored junior clubs , buying a player 's rights . A 16 @-@ year @-@ old with the St. Michaels Juveniles , Garry Monahan , was the first player selected in the 1963 draft . Monahan remains the youngest player ever selected in an NHL draft . The Entry Draft system did not fully replace the sponsorship system until 1969 . 
 = = = Goaltending = = = 
 Goaltender Clint Benedict was the first to wear facial protection , donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose . Because its design interfered with his vision , Benedict quickly abandoned the mask . Twenty @-@ nine years later , Jacques Plante made the goalie mask a permanent fixture in hockey . In 1956 , Plante began wearing a mask in practice after shots from teammates twice broke cheekbones . Montreal coach Toe Blake refused to allow Plante to wear his mask in games . On November 1 , 1959 , in a game at Madison Square Garden , that changed , when Plante was struck in the face . Teams did not dress backup goaltenders ; the game was delayed 20 minutes , while doctors frantically stitched up Plante . When Blake asked Plante if he was ' ready to return ' , Plante refused unless allowed to wear his mask . Livid , Blake agreed only if Plante removed the mask when his face was healed . Wearing the mask , Plante led the Canadiens on an 18 @-@ game unbeaten streak , to finally remove the mask at Blake 's urging ; promptly the team lost their first game . Defeated , Blake relented . Plante 's mask became a permanent fixture as he led the Canadiens to their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup . Soon after , other goalies followed Plante 's lead . 
 Remarkably , Terry Sawchuk played goal for most of his career not wearing a mask ; he crouched very low such that his shoulders nearly touched his knees . This stance became known as the " gorilla crouch " . During his career , Sawchuk relied on his ability to see the puck under the players ' bodies , his outstanding mobility , and reflexes , to win four Vezina Trophies . By 1955 , he was regarded as the greatest goaltender to ever play the game . Sawchuk 's career was cut short when he died in 1970 from injuries suffered in a drunken incident with teammate Ron Stewart . The Hall of Fame waived its waiting period , immediately inducting Sawchuk as the NHL 's all @-@ time record holder in wins ( 447 ) and shutouts ( 103 ) . Sawchuk 's style of play was a precursor to the modern goaltending butterfly style . 
 The butterfly style - used by most all modern goaltenders - was invented by Glenn Hall . Considered both unique and foolish , Hall 's style of dropping to his knees and kicking his pads out in a V formation forced shooters to aim for the top half of the net . Hall adopted the technique as a youth when he lacked the arm strength to stop shots with his stick . An eight @-@ time All @-@ Star , Hall became an NHL regular at the start of the 1955 – 1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for Detroit and Chicago . This record is hailed as one of the NHL 's most unbreakable .

 The first players ' union was formed February 12 , 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat on the board of the NHL 's Pension Society since 1952 . Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league 's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund . The league claimed that it was barely breaking even financially , and so could not contribute more than it did . Players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise , leading Lindsay and Doug Harvey of the Canadiens to discussions on forming a union in 1956 . The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union 's founding was announced publicly , every NHL player had signed up with the exception of Ted Kennedy , who was retiring . 
 The owners immediately worked to crush the union . Toronto owner Conn Smythe compared the players association to communism : " I feel that anything spawned in secrecy as this association was certainly has to have some odour to it . " Red Wings president Bruce Norris responded by trading Lindsay to his brother 's team , the Black Hawks . The move was widely seen as punitive , as the Hawks had finished last in the NHL every season , save one , from 1949 until 1957 . Lindsay was not the only player sent to Chicago as punishment ; Glenn Hall was included as he refused to distance himself from Lindsay . In Toronto , Smythe repeatedly benched Jim Thomson , who was the union 's secretary , before also dealing him to the Black Hawks . The Players ' Association responded by filing a $ 3 million anti @-@ trust lawsuit against the NHL . Persuaded by teammates Gordie Howe and Red Kelly , the Red Wings players voted to withdraw from the association in November 1957 . Other teams quickly followed , and the union capitulated . Union leadership ultimately agreed to drop the lawsuit in exchange for small concessions , which included a minimum annual salary of $ 7 @,@ 000 , increases to the pension contributions and moving expenses for traded players . 
 Led by Alan Eagleson , the National Hockey League Players ' Association ( NHLPA ) was formed in 1967 . Eagleson became the sport 's first player agent in 1966 when he negotiated a deal on behalf of Bobby Orr with the Bruins that saw the 18 @-@ year @-@ old rookie become the highest paid player in the NHL . At its peak , Eagleson 's practice represented 150 professional athletes . Eagleson had also helped settle an American Hockey League players strike sparked by mistreatment of players . In June 1967 , the NHLPA was announced , and quickly received acceptance from the owners .

 = Lead ( II ) nitrate = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Pb ( NO3 ) 2 . It commonly occurs as a colourless crystal or white powder and , unlike most other lead ( II ) salts , is soluble in water . 
 Known since the Middle Ages by the name plumb dulcis , the production of lead ( II ) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small @-@ scale , for direct use in making other lead compounds . In the 19th century lead ( II ) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States . Historically , the main use was as a raw material in the production of pigments for lead paints , but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide . Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters , and in coatings of <unk> paper . Since around the year 2000 , lead ( II ) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation . 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is toxic , an oxidizing agent , and is categorised as probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer . Consequently , it must be handled and stored with the appropriate safety precautions to prevent inhalation , ingestion and skin contact . Due to its hazardous nature , the limited applications of lead ( II ) nitrate are under constant scrutiny . 
 = = History = = 
 Since the Middle Ages , lead ( II ) nitrate has been produced as a raw material for the production of coloured pigments in lead paints , such as chrome yellow ( lead ( II ) chromate ) , chrome orange ( lead ( II ) hydroxide chromate ) and similar lead compounds . These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles . 
 In 1597 , the German alchemist Andreas Libavius first described the compound , coining the medieval names of plumb dulcis and <unk> plumb dulcis , meaning " sweet lead " , because of its taste . Although originally not understood during the following centuries , the <unk> property of lead ( II ) nitrate led to its use in matches and special explosives such as lead azide . 
 The production process was and still is chemically straightforward , effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis ( nitric acid ) , and subsequently harvesting the precipitate . However , the production remained small @-@ scale for many centuries , and the commercial production of lead ( II ) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835 . In 1974 , the U.S. consumption of lead compounds , excluding pigments and gasoline additives , was 642 tons . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The crystal structure of solid lead ( II ) nitrate has been determined by neutron diffraction . The compound crystallizes in the cubic system with the lead atoms in a face @-@ centred cubic system . Its space group is <unk> = 4 ( Bravais lattice notation ) , with each side of the cube with length 784 picometres . 
 The black dots represent the lead atoms , the white dots the nitrate groups 27 picometres above the plane of the lead atoms , and the blue dots the nitrate groups the same distance below this plane . In this configuration , every lead atom is bonded to twelve oxygen atoms ( bond length : 281 pm ) . All N – O bond lengths are identical , at 127 picometres . 
 Research interest in the crystal structure of lead ( II ) nitrate was partly based on the possibility of free internal rotation of the nitrate groups within the crystal lattice at elevated temperatures , but this did not materialise . 
 = = Preparation and production = = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate can be obtained by dissolving metallic lead in aqueous nitric acid : 
 Pb + 4 HNO3 → Pb ( NO3 ) 2 + 2 NO2 + 2 H2O 
 More commonly , it is obtained by dissolving lead ( II ) oxide in nitric acid : 
 PbO + 2 HNO3 → Pb ( NO3 ) 2 + H2O 
 In either case , since the solvent is concentrated nitric acid ( in which lead ( II ) nitrate has very low solubility ) and the resulting solution contains nitrate ions , anhydrous crystals of lead ( II ) nitrate spontaneously form as a result of the common ion effect : 
 It is also possible to harvest nitrate from organic materials like fertilizer or urine . The nitrates harvested using this method are not nearly as strong as industrial grade nitrate , but would work in the production of Gunpowder . 
 Most commercially available lead ( II ) nitrate , as well as laboratory @-@ scale material , is produced accordingly . Supply is in 25 kilogram bags up to 1000 kilogram big bags , and in laboratory containers , both by general producers of laboratory chemicals and by producers of lead and lead compounds . No large @-@ scale production has been reported . 
 In nitric acid treatment of lead @-@ containing wastes , e.g. , in the processing of lead – bismuth wastes from lead refineries , impure solutions of lead ( II ) nitrate are formed as by @-@ product . These solutions are reported to be used in the gold cyanidation process . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 Apart from lead ( II ) acetate , lead ( II ) nitrate is the only common soluble lead compound . Lead ( II ) nitrate readily dissolves in water to give a clear , colourless solution . As an ionic substance , the dissolution of lead ( II ) nitrate involves dissociation into its constituent ions . 
 Pb ( NO3 ) 2 ( s ) → Pb2 + ( aq ) + 2 NO − 
 3 ( aq ) 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate forms a slightly acidic solution , with a pH of 3 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 0 for a 20 % aqueous solution . 
 When concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is added to lead ( II ) nitrate solution , basic nitrates are formed , even well past the equivalence point . Up through the half equivalence point , Pb ( NO3 ) 2 · Pb ( OH ) 2 predominates , then after this point Pb ( NO3 ) 2 · <unk> ( OH ) 2 is formed . No simple Pb ( OH ) 2 is formed up to at least pH 12 . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is associated with interesting supramolecular chemistry because of its coordination to nitrogen and oxygen electron @-@ donating compounds . The interest is largely academic , but with several potential applications . For example , combining lead nitrate and <unk> glycol ( EO5 ) in a solution of acetonitrile and methanol followed by slow evaporation produces a new crystalline material [ Pb ( NO3 ) 2 ( EO5 ) ] . In the crystal structure for this compound , the EO5 chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an equatorial plane similar to that of a crown ether . The two bidentate nitrate ligands are in trans configuration . The total coordination number is 10 , with the lead ion in a bicapped square <unk> molecular geometry . 
 The complex formed by lead ( II ) nitrate , lead ( II ) perchlorate and a <unk> bidentate N @-@ donor ligand is <unk> , with a nitrate group bridging the lead atoms with coordination number of 5 and 6 . One interesting aspect of this type of complexes is the presence of a physical gap in the coordination sphere ; i.e. , the ligands are not placed symmetrically around the metal ion . This is potentially due to a lead lone pair of electrons , also found in lead complexes with an imidazole ligand . 
 This type of chemistry is not unique to the nitrate salt ; other lead ( II ) compounds such as lead ( II ) bromide also form complexes , but the nitrate is frequently used because of its solubility properties and its bidentate nature . 
 = = = Oxidation and decomposition = = = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is an oxidizing agent . Depending on the reaction , this may be due to the Pb2 + ( aq ) ion , which has a standard reduction potential ( E0 ) of − 0 @.@ 125 V , or the nitrate ion , which under acidic conditions has an E0 of + 0 @.@ 956 V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition , while the lead ( II ) works best in a neutral aqueous solution . 
 When heated , lead ( II ) nitrate crystals decompose to lead ( II ) oxide , oxygen and nitrogen dioxide . 
 2 Pb ( NO3 ) 2 ( s ) → 2 PbO ( s ) + 4 NO2 ( g ) + O2 ( g ) 
 Because of this property , lead nitrate is sometimes used in pyrotechnics such as fireworks . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is soluble in water but is almost insoluble in nitric acid . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Due to the hazardous nature of lead ( II ) nitrate , there is a preference for using alternatives in industrial applications . In the formerly major application of lead paints , it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide . Other historical applications of lead ( II ) nitrate , such as in matches and fireworks , have declined or ceased as well . Current applications of lead ( II ) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters , as a coating for <unk> paper , and in rodenticides . 
 On a laboratory scale , lead ( II ) nitrate provides one of two convenient and reliable sources of <unk> tetroxide . By carefully drying lead ( II ) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel , nitrogen dioxide is produced , which <unk> into the desired compound . 
 2 NO2 ⇌ <unk> 
 To improve the leaching process in the gold cyanidation , lead ( II ) nitrate solution is added . Although a bulk process , only limited amounts ( 10 to 100 milligrams lead ( II ) nitrate per kilogram gold ) are required . Both the cyanidation itself , as well as the use of lead compounds in the process , are deemed controversial due to the compounds ' toxic nature . 
 In organic chemistry , lead ( II ) nitrate has been used as an oxidant , for example as an alternative to the <unk> reaction for oxidation of benzylic halides to aldehydes . It has also found use in the preparation of <unk> from <unk> . Because of its toxicity it has largely fallen out of favour , but it still finds occasional use , for example as a bromide scavenger during <unk> substitution . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Lead ( II ) nitrate is toxic , and ingestion may lead to acute lead poisoning , as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds . All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) as probably carcinogenic to humans ( Category 2A ) . They have been linked to renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer , brain cancer and lung cancer in humans , although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic . Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes , including δ @-@ aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( porphobilinogen synthase ) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine @-@ 5 ′ <unk> , important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage . 
 = Carol Browner = 
 Carol Martha Browner ( born December 16 , 1955 ) is an American lawyer , environmentalist , and businesswoman , who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011 . Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001 . 
 Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law . After working for the Florida House of Representatives , she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington , D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore . Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993 , where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government . 
 She was the longest @-@ serving administrator in the history of the EPA , staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency . During her tenure , she reorganized the agency 's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation . She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas . She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets , and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle . 
 Afterward , Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management during the 2000s ( decade ) . She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues . Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the " Energy Czar " or " Climate Czar " . Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail , but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government 's response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill during 2010 . She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter . Following that she rejoined the Albright Stonebridge Group , continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations , and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in Miami , Florida , Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty @-@ Hugues and Michael Browner , both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College , in social science and English respectively . She has two younger sisters . Browner grew up in South Miami , and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house – gave her a close connection to the natural world : " I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there . " 
 Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977 , majoring in English . She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 During 1980 and 1981 , Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations . There she helped revise Florida 's Conservation and Recreational Lands Program . In 1983 , she moved to Washington , D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group , a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues . 
 Browner met Michael <unk> , a specialist in health @-@ care issues at Citizen Action , in 1983 . They married in 1987 and lived in Takoma Park , Maryland . They have a son , Zachary , born in 1987 . 
 Between 1986 and 1988 , Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida . In that role , she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida 's Big Cypress National Preserve as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys . During 1989 , she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources . She was not averse to in @-@ field investigation , and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant . 
 From 1988 to 1991 , Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore , and became known as a Gore protégé . She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act and managed Gore 's legislative staff . 
 = = Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida = = 
 As Secretary of Environmental Regulation , Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993 , while living in Tallahassee . It was the nation 's third @-@ largest such state agency , with 1 @,@ 500 employees and a budget of some $ 650 million . There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other . She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government . She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands @-@ affected areas and for manufacturing plants ; in doing so , she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review . 
 Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators , on the grounds that health and environment consequences were insufficiently known . She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned , in exchange for $ 40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby . She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles , who had become governor , to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $ 1 billion cost . The head of Florida 's largest business trade association described dealing with Browner : " She kicks the door open , throws in a hand grenade , and then walks in to shoot who 's left . She really doesn 't like to compromise . [ But she ] has done a pretty good job down here . People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does . "

 After the 1992 presidential election , Browner served as transition director for Vice President @-@ elect Gore . President @-@ elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11 , 1992 . While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration 's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign , the selection of Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having " the mind and training of an attorney @-@ legislator but the soul of an activist " – was seen as an indication that Gore 's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton 's more pro @-@ business mindset . Clinton later wrote that he had not known her , but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named . The pick , along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made , helped solidify the vice president 's position within the administration . At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore . She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21 , 1993 . 
 She and <unk> returned to Takoma Park , Maryland , and he continued to work at Citizen Action . Her long @-@ term goal was " to leave the world a slightly better place , " and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home . She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton 's other early female nominees by having never used a nanny . She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling , skiing , and jogging .

 At the EPA , Browner supervised some 17 @,@ 000 employees and a $ 7 billion budget . Early in her administration , she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money . Soon after taking office , Browner and her top aides , including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman , reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance . The EPA 's regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures , however , which led to some bureaucratic conflicts . 
 Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists , who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods . Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists , however . A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet @-@ level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support . Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher @-@ priority 1993 Clinton health care plan . 
 When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections , Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans , especially in the House of Representatives , to amend the Clean Water Act and to roll back other environmental regulations . She was able to work in a bipartisan manner , though , with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act . During the budget @-@ cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995 , Browner successfully protected the EPA 's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $ 750 million in increased spending for the agency . Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent : " an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right . " 
 Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner 's tenure were part of its " reinventing government " program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA 's flexible public @-@ private partnerships , as an alternative to traditional regulation . Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense , cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities , while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors , rather than dealing with issues on a crisis @-@ by @-@ crisis , pollutant @-@ by @-@ pollutant basis . Project XL had mixed results , with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned . The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative , which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice , showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998 . 
 In March 1995 , Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti @-@ Lobbying Act ( 18 U.S. Code § 1913 ) by <unk> unsolicited material opposing the Republican @-@ sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public @-@ interest groups . Browner denied the accusation , saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections . 
 As EPA administrator , Browner started the agency 's successful <unk> Program in 1995 . The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities , especially in urban areas , by empowering states , communities , and assorted stakeholders in economic development . It leveraged more than $ 1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs , while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use .

 Perhaps Browner 's biggest triumph came in 1997 , when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act 's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground @-@ level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot . The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade . There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration , with opposition from the president 's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA 's scientific reviews on the matter . Over eighty environmental and health groups , who had grown quite frustrated with the administration 's preference for minimal @-@ cost incremental actions in the area , pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter , but he remained silent . Browner 's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single @-@ handedly , in private meetings , Congressional testimony , and public debate , and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration . Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination . Ultimately , Gore lent behind @-@ the @-@ scenes support in favor of the new regulations , which was a key factor in Clinton 's final decision in Browner 's favor . Overall , the New York Times termed Browner 's actions " a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura " and Time magazine labelled Browner the " Queen of Clean Air " . As the decision was announced , one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns , Browner said : " These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans , including 35 million children . " 
 The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review , but the support of Republicans from the northeast , especially New York Senator Al D 'Amato , helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them . The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution 's <unk> principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court , whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled Whitman v. American Trucking Associations , Inc. largely upheld Browner 's and the EPA 's actions . Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles , issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars , and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years . 
 During her tenure , Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming , giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change , although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority . Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well . 
 During Browner 's tenure , there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of " good old boys " who dominated the agency 's middle management . The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman @-@ Adebayo , who in 1997 filed suit against the agency ; in 2000 , the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman @-@ Adebayo , and awarded her $ 300 @,@ 000 . Coleman @-@ Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up . In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter , Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency 's senior rank during her time as administrator , but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman @-@ Adebayo 's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted . Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA 's treatment of Coleman @-@ Adebayo led to passage of the No @-@ <unk> Act in 2002 , which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation . 
 In the final days of the Clinton administration , D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last @-@ minute EPA regulation <unk> . In 2003 , Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner 's files , but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt . Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work @-@ related . 
 During her EPA tenure , Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups , especially utilities and heavy manufacturing , as well as with conservatives in Congress , who thought businesses were stifled by her policies . She also battled the Treasury Department at times , and sometimes opposed Clinton himself , who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations . Nonetheless , Browner was the longest @-@ serving administrator in the history of the agency , staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years . Robert W. Collin , author of a 2005 text on the agency , assessed her as " one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA , " and wrote that she was " completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues . " Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements .

 After the Clinton administration , Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group , a " global strategy group " headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright . As a principal , Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally , including complying with environmental regulations and climate change . Coca @-@ Cola and Merck & Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance . She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management , an investment advisory company . During 2002 , she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater , now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law . 
 Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey . The marriage , his second , her third , took place on June 21 , 2007 , in Riverhead , New York . Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry . In 2006 , she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World , but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy . 
 Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003 ; her term expired in 2008 . She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection , an organization founded by Gore in 2006 . In 2008 , she joined the board of APX , Inc . , which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard . She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters . She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration . Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International 's Commission for a Sustainable World Society , although the commission 's web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009 . 
 Her income in 2008 was between $ 1 million and $ 5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group , where her husband was a principal . She also reported $ 450 @,@ 000 in " member distribution " income , plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group . 
 Browner retained a political voice during her business career , describing the George W. Bush administration as " the worst environmental administration ever . " She also stated that global warming is " the greatest challenge ever faced " . In the 2008 presidential election , she was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's bid for the Democratic nomination . After Clinton lost her bid , Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events . 
 = = Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy = = 
 On November 5 , 2008 , Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama @-@ Biden Transition Project . 
 On December 15 , 2008 , President @-@ elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change . Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , she acted as a coordinator for environmental , energy , climate , transport and related matters for the federal government . Her position was sometimes informally described as the " Energy Czar " or the " Climate Czar " . It did not require Senate confirmation . Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress , but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it . In any case , her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion : " I don 't have any independent policymaking authority . It 's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation . " Browner 's deputy assistant was Heather <unk> , a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry . 
 The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members . She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009 , and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers . She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 . She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program , seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu , and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall . Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House . By September 2009 , Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies . She also became a brief target of fervent anti- " czar " radio and television commentator Glenn Beck , following the Van Jones resignation . 
 In October 2009 , Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap @-@ and @-@ trade legislation before the end of year was unlikely , and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December . By the next month , she moderated her concern , but expressed opposition to any congressional " slicing and dicing " that would separate energy and climate concerns . Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate ; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said , " Obviously , everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation . " 
 In 2010 , Browner became a key part of the administration team handling , and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about , the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as " probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country " and said that the administration was " prepared for the worst " . She added that " I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August , when the relief wells will be finished . " Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that " [ Browner 's ] calm , authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe . " 
 With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections , chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner 's and the administration 's goals were essentially nil , and Obama conceded as much . As the Obama administration neared its two @-@ year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway , there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities , such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff . But that did not come to pass . 
 Instead , in late January 2011 , White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future . Browner said of her unexpected decision , " [ there 's ] no back story – it was just time to go " and that she felt " honored to have a second ... chance to serve . " League of Conservation Voters president Gene <unk> characterized Browner as a " tenacious advocate on our issues " who would be " sorely missed " , while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell & Giuliani said Browner 's exit was a good development and that " Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States . " Browner left the White House during March 2011 . Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second @-@ in @-@ command , Heather <unk> , from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council . 
 In late February 2011 , while Browner was still in place , the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether . While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama 's " czars " , Browner was a particular focus of it . Representative Steve Scalise , who led the effort , said of Browner , " Let her leave , and take the funding , too . " In the mid @-@ April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown , funding for the position was indeed eliminated ( as were three other " czar " roles , most of which were similarly vacant ) . Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it , but the point was largely moot as the positions in question , including the Browner one , had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council . 
 = = Return to business and advocacy = = 
 Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization 's Executive Committee . She also rejoined the Albright firm , now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group , as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact . She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was " disappointed " by the Obama administration 's September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low @-@ altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards . In March 2014 , she was elected as Chair of the Board of Directors of the League of Conservation Voters . 
 In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters , an industry @-@ backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change . In that role , she has said that " We can 't take a carbon @-@ free source of energy off the table . " She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier , she would " probably not be pro @-@ nuclear " , but said that " I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced " and it would simply be " irresponsible " not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution .

 In April 1997 , Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother 's Day Committee " for her dedication to providing ' children with a safer , healthier world . ' " Browner also has received Glamour magazine 's Woman of the Year Award , the Ambulatory Pediatric Association 's Advocate for Children Award , the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society 's Guy M.

The route was 5 @.@ 24 miles ( 8 @.@ 43 km ) long and stretched from the town of Brant to the hamlet of Evans Center within the town of Evans . NY 323 began at an intersection with NY 249 and County Route 9 ( CR 9 ) in Brant and headed north to a junction with NY 5 in Evans Center . In between , it passed over the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 or I @-@ 90 ) and intersected U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) . 
 The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It went unchanged until 1980 when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government .

It proceeded to the Brant – Evans town line , where it met Cain Road ( CR 491 ) a short distance south of the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) . The highway progressed onward , passing over the Thruway on its way to a junction with Dunfee Road , a connector leading to US 20 . NY 323 met US 20 itself a short distance to the northwest . 
 The route headed northwest from US 20 , intersecting with Pontiac Road ( CR 490 ) as it curved back to the north and entered the village of Angola . Within Angola , NY 323 followed Main Street northward past several blocks of homes and business . At Orchard Avenue , the street turned to the northwest , roughly paralleling Big Sister Creek as both exited the village limits . Past this point , the amount of development along the route dropped slightly as it continued northward toward the hamlet of Evans Center . NY 323 crossed over Big Sister Creek south of the community before ending at a junction with NY 5 in the center of the hamlet .

 Weh Island or Pulau Weh or Pulo Weh ( by the local population commonly referred to only as " Sabang " , the name of the largest city ) is a small active volcanic island to the northwest of Sumatra , 45 minutes by fast regular ship or 2 hours by ferry from mainland , Banda Aceh . It was originally connected to the Sumatran mainland and became separated by sea after the volcano 's last eruption in the Pleistocene era . The island is situated in the Andaman Sea . The largest city on the island , Sabang , is the northernmost outpost of Indonesia . 
 The island is known for its ecosystem ; the Indonesian government has declared 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) of inland and sea around the island as a wildlife protection area . A rare megamouth shark species was found on shore and the island is the only habitat for the threatened toad , <unk> valhallae ( formerly Bufo valhallae ) . Coral reef areas around the island are known for their large variety of fish species . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Weh Island is located in the Andaman Sea , where two groups of islands , the Nicobar Islands and Andaman Islands , are scattered in one line from Sumatra to the north up to the Burma plate . The Andaman Sea lies on an active moving small tectonic plate ( microplate ) . A complex geological fault system and volcanic arc islands have been created along the length of the sea by the movement of the microplate . 
 The island lies about 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) off the northernmost tip of Sumatra . The island is small at only 156 @.@ 3 km2 ( 60 @.@ 3 sq mi ) , but mountainous . The highest peak is a fumarolic volcano , 617 metres ( 2 @,@ 024 ft ) high . The last known eruption is estimated to have occurred in the Pleistocene age , as a result which the mountain partially collapsed and was filled by the sea , forming a separate island . 
 At a depth of 9 metres ( 30 ft ) , close to Sabang city , underwater fumaroles emerge from the seabed . At Gapang Beach ( Gapang is name of a kind of a tree ) , one hour from Balohan Port to the west there is also underwater fumaroles which is suitable for diving and is called as Hydrothermal Point . A volcanic cone is found in the jungle . There are three <unk> ( <unk> ) fields on the island : one is 750 metres ( 0 @.@ 5 mi ) southeast of the summit and the others are 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) and 11 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 7 mi ) northwest of the summit , on the western shore of <unk> <unk> bay . 
 There are four islets surrounding Weh Island : Klah , Rubiah , <unk> , and Rondo . Among those , Rubiah is well known for diving tourism , because of its coral reefs . When traveling to Saudi Arabia was only possible by sea , Rubiah was used as a place of quarantine for Indonesian Muslims during the Hajj pilgrimage season . 
 = = Inhabitants = = 
 Weh Island is a part of Aceh province . A 1993 census reported 24 @,@ 700 inhabitants . The large majority of the population are Acehnese and the remaining are Minangkabau , Javanese , Batak and Chinese . It is unknown when the island was first inhabited . Islam is the main religion , as Aceh is a special province where Sharia law has been applied exclusively for the province . However , there are some Christians and Buddhists on the island . They are mostly Javanese , Batak and Chinese . 
 On 26 December 2004 , a massive ( 9 @.@ 0 on Richter scale ) undersea earthquake struck in the Andaman Sea . The earthquake triggered a series of tsunamis that killed at least 130 @,@ 000 people in Indonesia alone . The effect on the island was relatively small , but it is unknown how many of its inhabitants were killed by the event . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy on Weh Island is dominated by agriculture . The main products are cloves and coconuts . Small @-@ scale fisheries operate in the area , and fishermen have used explosives and cyanide fishing extensively . Therefore , since 1982 , a wildlife protection area ( <unk> alam ) has been declared by the Indonesian government that includes 34 square kilometres ( 13 sq mi ) inland and 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) of surrounding sea . 
 The two main cities are Sabang and Balohan . Balohan is a ferry port that serves as a hub between the island and Banda Aceh on the mainland Sumatra . Sabang has been an important quay since the late nineteenth century , because the city overlooks the entry to a busy shipping route , Malacca Strait . 
 Before the Suez Canal was opened in 1869 , the Indonesian archipelago was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa . From the Suez Canal , the route to Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait . Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water , the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay . In 1883 , Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the <unk> Associate . At first , the harbour was intended as a coal station for the Dutch navy , but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra . 
 Each year , 50 @,@ 000 vessels pass through Malacca Strait . In 2000 , the Indonesian government declared Sabang a Free Trade Zone and Free Port , to gain economic benefit by establishing the port as a logistic hub for international vessels passing through the strait . <unk> for a deep water harbour , port , warehousing and refuelling facilities , were developed . 
 Weh Island is served by the Maimun Saleh Airport located in Sabang . Currently there is no airlines serving that airport . Thus , the nearest airport to get into Sabang is the Sultan <unk> Airport which is located at Banda Aceh . From the airport of Banda Aceh , it 's about a half @-@ hour drive to <unk> <unk> , close to the center of Banda Aceh , from where the ferries to Balohan ( Pulau Weh 's ferry harbour ) are leaving . 
 Weh Island is also known for ecotourism . Underwater diving , hiking through the volcanic mountain and beach resorts are the main attractions . A small village , Iboih , is known as a location for scuba diving . A few meters from Iboih is the Rubiah islet that is known for its coral reefs . There are also several dive operators in Gapang . 
 = = Ecosystem = = 
 During 1997 – 1999 , Conservation International conducted a survey of the coral reef in the area . According to the survey , the coral diversity is relatively low , but fish species variation is rich . Some species found during the survey include <unk> ocellata , Chaetodon gardneri , Chaetodon xanthocephalus , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Scarus <unk> , Scarus scaber and <unk> <unk> . 
 On 13 March 2004 , a specimen of the rare and unusual species of shark , megamouth shark , was washed ashore on Gapang beach . <unk> shark has a distinctive large mouth , very short snout and is broadly rounded in dorsal view . The specimen is said to be the 21st ( some say it is the 23rd ) sighting of the species since its discovery in 1976 . The male shark , measuring 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) in length and weighing 13 @.@ 82 kg ( 30 @.@ 5 pounds ) , was frozen and sent to the Indonesian Institute of Sciences ( <unk> ) for further scientific study . As of 2006 , there have only been 36 findings of megamouth sharks in the Pacific , Indian and Atlantic oceans . 
 The 2004 earthquake and tsunami has affected the island 's ecosystem . At Iboih village , a large swath of mangrove was destroyed . Debris from the land was deposited on the nearby reefs as a result of the tsunami . In 2005 , about 14 @,@ 400 mangrove seedlings were replanted to save the mangrove forest . 
 Apart from underwater ecosystem , Weh island is the only habitat of one threatened species of toad , <unk> valhallae ( formerly Bufo valhallae ) . The species is only known from the holotype from the island . Due to heavy forestation on the island , the survival of the species is uncertain .

 = Battle of Mauropotamos = 
 The Battle of Mauropotamos ( Greek : Μάχη τοῦ <unk> ) was fought in 844 , between the armies of the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate , at Mauropotamos ( either in northern Bithynia or in Cappadocia ) . After a failed Byzantine attempt to recover the Emirate of Crete in the previous year , the Abbasids launched a raid into Asia Minor . The Byzantine regent , Theoktistos , headed the army that went to meet the invasion but was heavily defeated , and many of his officers defected to the Arabs . Internal unrest prevented the Abbasids from exploiting their victory , however . A truce and a prisoner exchange were consequently agreed in 845 , followed by a six @-@ year cessation of hostilities , as both powers focused their attention elsewhere . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the restoration of the veneration of icons in March 843 , the Byzantine Empire 's government , headed by the Empress @-@ regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos , embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines ' main political and ideological foe , the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies . This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability that the end of the Iconoclasm controversy brought , and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims . 
 The first such campaign , an attempted reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person , made initial gains , but ultimately ended in disaster . After scoring a victory over the Arabs in Crete , Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor , possibly her brother Bardas . Theoktistos hurried back to Constantinople , where he discovered that the rumour was false , but in his absence , the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs . 
 = = Battle = = 
 In 844 , according to Byzantine sources , Theoktistos learned of an Arab invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor , led by a certain ' Amr , probably the semi @-@ autonomous emir of Malatya , Umar al @-@ Aqta . The Arab sources do not make explicit mention of this campaign . The Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev , however , identified it with an expedition recorded in the poems of Abu Tammam and <unk> , which was led by general Abu Sa 'id and took place during the regency of Theodora . Umar al @-@ Aqta 's participation is likely , as he often aided the Abbasids in their raids against the Byzantines . According to Arab accounts , the troops led by Abu Sa 'id comprised men from the border emirates of Qaliqala ( Erzurum ) and Tarsus . The Arab forces united at <unk> ( possibly the border fort of <unk> ) before raiding through the Byzantine themes of Cappadocia , <unk> , <unk> , and Opsikion . Sa 'id 's troops sacked Dorylaion and even reached the shore of the Bosporus . 
 Theoktistos led the Byzantine army in against the invaders , but was heavily defeated at Mauropotamos ( " Black River " ) . The location of the latter , if indeed it is a river and not a simple toponym , is disputed ; it was most likely a tributary of the Sangarius in Bithynia or of the Halys in Cappadocia . Not only did the Byzantines suffer heavy casualties , but many senior Byzantine officials defected to the Arabs . Theoktistos returned to Constantinople , where he blamed Bardas for the recent defeats and had him exiled from the capital . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Abbasids were unable to exploit their success due to the internal instability of the Caliphate . Likewise , the Byzantines preferred to focus their strength against the ongoing conquest of Sicily by the Aghlabids . Thus , a Byzantine embassy was sent to Baghdad in 845 , which was warmly received . The Abbasids reciprocated with an embassy to Constantinople , where the two states agreed on a truce and a prisoner exchange , which was held at the river Lamos on 16 September 845 . A winter raid by the Arab governor of Tarsus shortly after failed disastrously , after which the Arab @-@ Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years . 
 = Biscayne National Park = 
 Biscayne National Park is a U.S. National Park located in southern Florida , south of Miami . The park preserves Biscayne Bay and its offshore barrier reefs . Ninety @-@ five percent of the park is water , and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest . The park covers 172 @,@ 971 acres ( 69 @,@ 999 ha ) and includes Elliott Key , the park 's largest island and first of the true Florida Keys , formed from fossilized coral reef . The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand . The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the Florida Reef , one of the largest coral reefs in the world . 
 Biscayne National Park protects four distinct ecosystems : the shoreline mangrove swamp , the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay , the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef . The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish , molluscs and crustaceans . The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish , seagrass beds , sponges , soft corals , and manatees . The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms , and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles . Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish , pelagic birds , whales and hard corals . Sixteen endangered species including Schaus ' swallowtail butterflies , smalltooth sawfish , manatees , and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park . Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators . 
 The people of the Glades culture inhabited the Biscayne Bay region as early as 10 @,@ 000 years ago before rising sea levels filled the bay . The Tequesta people occupied the islands and shoreline from about 4 @,@ 000 years before the present to the 16th century , when the Spanish took possession of Florida . Reefs claimed ships from Spanish times through the 20th century , with more than 40 documented wrecks within the park 's boundaries . While the park 's islands were farmed during the 19th and early 20th centuries , their rocky soil and periodic hurricanes made agriculture difficult to sustain . In the early 20th century the islands became secluded destinations for wealthy <unk> who built getaway homes and social clubs . Mark C. Honeywell 's guesthouse on Boca Chita Key was the area 's most elaborate private retreat , featuring a mock lighthouse . The Cocolobo Cay Club was at various times owned by Miami developer Carl G. Fisher , yachtsman Garfield Wood , and President Richard Nixon 's friend Bebe Rebozo , and was visited by four United States presidents . The amphibious community of Stiltsville was established in the 1930s in the shoals of northern Biscayne Bay , taking advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during Prohibition . Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959 , Elliott Key was used as a training ground for infiltrators into Fidel Castro 's Cuba by the Central Intelligence Agency and by Cuban exile groups . 
 Originally proposed for inclusion in Everglades National Park , Biscayne Bay was cut from the proposed park to ensure Everglades ' establishment . It remained undeveloped until the 1960s , when a series of proposals were made to develop the keys in the manner of Miami Beach , and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo , along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay . Through the 1960s and 1970s , two fossil @-@ fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores . A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument . The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re @-@ designation as Biscayne National Park . The park is heavily used by boaters , and apart from the park 's visitor center on the mainland , its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Biscayne National Park comprises 172 @,@ 971 acres ( 69 @,@ 999 ha ) in Miami @-@ Dade County in southeast Florida . Extending from just south of Key Biscayne southward to just north of Key Largo , the park includes Soldier Key , the Ragged Keys , Sands Key , Elliott Key , Totten Key and Old Rhodes Key , as well as smaller islands that form the northernmost extension of the Florida Keys . A wide shallow opening in the island chain , located between the Ragged Keys and Key Biscayne just north of the park 's boundary , is called the Safety Valve , as it allows storm surge water to flow out of the bay after the passage of tropical storms . The park 's eastern boundary is the ten @-@ fathom line ( 60 @-@ foot ; 18 m ) of water depth in the Atlantic Ocean on the Florida Reef . The park 's western boundary is a fringe of property on the mainland , extending a few hundred meters inland between Cutler Ridge and Mangrove Point . The only direct mainland access to the park is at the Convoy Point Visitor Center , adjacent to the park headquarters . The southwestern boundary adjoins the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station and its system of cooling canals . 
 The southern portion of Biscayne Bay extends between Elliott Key and the mainland , transited by the Intracoastal Waterway . The park abuts the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary on the east and south sides of the park and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park to the south . Only 9 @,@ 075 acres ( 3 @,@ 673 ha ) of the park 's area are on land , with the offshore keys comprising 4 @,@ 250 acres ( 1 @,@ 720 ha ) and mainland mangrove swamps account for the remaining 4 @,@ 825 acres ( 1 @,@ 953 ha ) . As an extension of the Everglades ecosystem , much of the park was originally proposed to be included in Everglades National Park , but was excluded in order to obtain a consensus for the establishment of the Everglades park in 1947 . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Biscayne Bay marks the southernmost extent of the Atlantic barrier islands , represented by Key Biscayne , and the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key . The keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands ' surface under a thin veneer of topsoil , while the barrier islands are dominated by wave @-@ deposited sands that cover most of the limestones . Biscayne Bay lies between low ridges of oolitic Miami Limestone on the west , forming Cutler Ridge , and the coral @-@ based Key Largo Limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys to the south . The Miami Limestone was deposited in turbulent lagoon waters . The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef and was formed during the Sangamonian interglacial period of about 75 @,@ 000 to 125 @,@ 000 years ago . The Miami Formation achieved its present form somewhat later , during a glacial period in which the lagoon deposits were consolidated and cemented by fresh water . The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone formed from stony corals , between 69 and 200 ft ( 21 and 61 m ) in thickness . As a consequence of their origins as reefs , the beaches of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rocky . Significant sandy beaches are found only at Sands Key . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 Biscayne Bay is a shallow semi @-@ enclosed lagoon which averages 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in depth . Both its mainland margins and the keys are covered by mangrove forest . The park includes the southern portion of Biscayne Bay , with areas of thin sediment called " <unk> " , and vegetated seagrass meadows supporting <unk> and shoal grass . 
 As a result of efforts to control water resources in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid @-@ 20th century , water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals . These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay . Prior to canal construction , most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater , but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay , conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer . The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ( CERP ) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades . Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park , the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of water out of the southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay . The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project ( <unk> ) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short , heavy discharges through drainage canals . 
 = = Human history = = 
 = = = Native people = = = 
 Native Americans were present in lower Florida 10 @,@ 000 years ago , when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was comparatively empty of water . Water levels rose from about 4000 years ago and inundated the bay . Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged ; none now exist on dry lands in the park . The Cutler Fossil Site , just to the west of the park , has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000 years before the present . The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500 years before the present , with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture . The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people , who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay . The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life , with no significant agricultural activity . A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds , worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000 AD to about 1650 , after contact was made with Europeans . A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park . 
 = = = Exploration = = = 
 Juan Ponce de León explored the area in 1513 , discovering the Florida Keys and encountering the Tequesta on the mainland . Other Spanish explorers arrived later in the 16th century and Florida came under Spanish rule . The Tequesta were resettled by the then @-@ Spanish government in the Florida Keys , and the South Florida mainland was depopulated . Ponce de León referred to the bay as " Chequescha " after its inhabitants , becoming " Tequesta " by the time of Spanish governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés later in the century . The present name has been attributed to a shipwrecked Basque sailor known as the " <unk> " or " <unk> " who lived in the area for a time , or to a more general allusion to the Bay of Biscay . 
 Spanish treasure fleets regularly sailed past the Florida Keys and were often caught in hurricanes . There are 44 documented shipwrecks in the park from the 16th through the 20th centuries . At least two 18th @-@ century Spanish ships were wrecked in the park area . The Spanish galleon Nuestra <unk> del Popolo is believed to have been wrecked in park waters in 1733 , though the site has not been found . HMS Fowey was wrecked in 1748 in what is now <unk> Anchorage , at some distance from the Fowey Rocks . The discovery of the ship in 1975 resulted in a landmark court case that established the wreck as an archaeological site rather than a salvage site . 43 wrecks are included on the National Register of Historic Places in the Offshore Reefs Archeological District , which extends for 30 mi ( 48 km ) along the seaward side of the Biscayne National Park keys . During the 18th century , Elliott Key was the reputed base of two different pirates , both of whom were called Black Caesar , commemorated by Caesar 's Creek between Elliott and Old Rhodes Key . 
 = = = Settlement and pre @-@ park use = = = 
 The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century . The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like key limes and pineapples . John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832 . Colonel Robert E. Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849 . At the end of the American Civil War in 1865 , a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba . Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C. Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba . The former United States vice president , Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey . Few people lived in the park area until 1897 , when Israel Lafayette Jones , an African @-@ American property manager , bought Porgy Key for $ 300 US . The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there , clearing land to grow limes and pineapples . In 1911 Jones bought 212 @-@ acre ( 86 ha ) Totten Key , which had been used as a pineapple plantation , for a dollar an acre , selling in 1925 for $ 250 @,@ 000 . Before Israel Jones ' death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast . 
 Carl G. Fisher , who was responsible for much of the development of Miami Beach , bought Adams Key , once known as Cocolobo Key , in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922 . The two @-@ story club building had ten guest rooms , a dining room , and a separate recreation lodge . Patrons included Warren G. Harding , Albert Fall , T. Coleman du Pont , Harvey Firestone , Jack Dempsey , Charles F. Kettering , Will Rogers and Frank <unk> . Israel Jones ' sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime @-@ growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable , and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full @-@ time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club . The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune , but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934 . Among the Joneses ' clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family . The Joneses also provided the club with fish , lobster and crabs . Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s . Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954 , who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club . Clients guided by the Joneses included then @-@ senators John F. Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , Richard Nixon , Herman Talmadge and George Smathers through the 1940s and 1950s . 
 During the Cold War the future park area was used as a training ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro 's Cuba . Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion . The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge , the only hotel ever built on the key . As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing . Farther north , exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963 . 
 = = = Proposed development = = = 
 As modern communities continued growing in and around Miami , developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects . The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory . Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland . One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north . At the same time , pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida . This led to competing priorities between those who wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development . On December 6 , 1960 , 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key . The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular , which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach . The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers . 
 In 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of Biscayne Bay , to be known as SeaDade . SeaDade , supported by billionaire shipping magnate Daniel K. Ludwig , would have included an oil refinery . In addition to the physical structures , it would have been necessary to dredge a 40 @-@ foot @-@ deep ( 12 m ) channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery . The channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water . In 1963 Florida Power and Light ( FP & L ) announced plans for two new 400 @-@ megawatt oil @-@ fired power plants on undeveloped land at Turkey Point . 
 Many local residents and politicians supported SeaDade because it would have created additional jobs , but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high . They fought against development of the bay and formed the Safe Progress Association . Led by Lloyd Miller , the president of the local chapter of the Izaak Walton League , Miami Herald reporter Juanita Greene , and Art Marshall , the opponents of industrialization proposed the creation of a national park unit that would protect the reefs , islands and bay . After initial skepticism , the park proposal obtained the support of Miami Herald editors , as well as Florida Congressman Dante Fascell and Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk , Jr . , and were supported by lobbying efforts by sympathetic businessmen including Herbert Hoover , Jr . 
 One vision of Islandia , supported by land owners , would have connected the northern Florida Keys – from Key Biscayne to Key Largo – with bridges and created new islands using the fill from the SeaDade channel . Although Ludwig 's SeaDade plans were not supported by Miami @-@ area politicians or the state of Florida , Islandia 's supporters continued to lobby for development support . In 1968 , when it appeared the area was about to become a national monument , Islandia supporters bulldozed a highway six lanes wide right down the center of the island , destroying the forest for 7 miles ( 11 km ) . Islandia landowners called it Elliott Key Boulevard , but called it " Spite Highway " privately . It was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage , no one would want it for a national monument . Over time in the near @-@ tropical climate , the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on Elliott Key now follows the path of Elliott Key Boulevard . 
 The oil @-@ fired Turkey Point power stations were completed in 1967 – 68 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay , where the heat killed marine grasses . In 1964 FP & L announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site , which were expected to compound the cooling water problem . Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay , the power stations were projected to consume a significant proportion of the bay 's waters each day for cooling . After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig , who owned lands needed for cooling water canals , a closed @-@ loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s . 
 Portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park 's establishment . Homestead Bayfront Park , still operated by Miami @-@ Dade County just south of Convoy Point , established a " blacks @-@ only " segregated beach for African @-@ Americans at the present site of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center . The segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished .

 The earliest proposals for the protection of Biscayne Bay were included in proposals by Everglades National Park advocate Ernest F. Coe , whose proposed Everglades park boundaries included Biscayne Bay , its keys , interior country including what are now Homestead and Florida City , and Key Largo . Biscayne Bay , Key Largo and the adjoining inland extensions were cut from Everglades National Park before its establishment in 1947 . When proposals to develop Elliott Key surfaced in 1960 , Lloyd Miller asked Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall to send a Park Service reconnaissance team to review the Biscayne Bay area for inclusion in the national park system . A favorable report ensued , and with financial help from Herbert Hoover , Jr . , political support was solicited , most notably from Congressman Fascell . A 90 @-@ acre ( 36 ha ) area of Elliott Key was by this time a part of the Dade County park system . The 1966 report noted that the proposed park contained the best remaining areas of tropical forest in Florida and a rare combination of " terrestrial , marine and amphibious life , " as well as significant recreational value . The report found that the most significant virtues of the potential park were " the clear , sparkling waters , marine life , and the submerged lands of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean . Here in shallow water is a veritable wonderland . " 
 President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 90 @-@ 606 to create Biscayne National Monument on October 18 , 1968 . The monument was expanded in 1974 under Public Law 93 @-@ 477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of Congress through Public Law 96 @-@ 287 , effective June 28 , 1980 . The 1980 expansion extended the park almost to Key Biscayne and included Boca Chita Key , the Ragged Keys and the Safety Valve shoal region , together with the corresponding offshore reefs and a substantial portion of central Biscayne Bay 
 The first Islandia property owner to sell land to the National Park Service was Lancelot Jones , together with Katherine Jones , Arthur 's widow . They sold their lands for $ 1 @,@ 272 @,@ 500 , about a third of the potential development value . Jones was given a life estate on 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) at the age of 70 . He visited with park rangers stationed at the former Cocolobo Club , which eventually burned down in 1975 . The other life estate in the park was held by Virginia Tannehill , the widow of Eastern Airlines executive Paul Tannehill . Jones ' house built by Lancelot , his father and his brother , burned down in 1982 . He lived in a two @-@ room shack for the next ten years , riding out hurricanes on Porgy Key , but left his home permanently just before Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . The house was destroyed and Jones remained in Miami until his death in 1997 at 99 years . 
 Deprived of a rationale for existence by the national monument 's establishment , Islandia languished . The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney 's office , headed by Janet Reno . In 1990 Reno 's office determined after investigation that all of the town 's elections were invalid , since the elections were restricted only to landowners , not residents . The town was finally abolished by the Miami @-@ Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012 . 
 The impact of Hurricane Andrew on neighboring Homestead Air Force Base caused the Air Force to consider closing the base and conveying it to Miami @-@ Dade County , which was interested in using the base for commercial air traffic as an alternative to Miami International Airport . An environmental impact study concluded that the resulting flight paths over the bay , only 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the east , would result in degradation of the park . In 1999 The Air Force prohibited major commercial development at Homestead as a result . 
 The park 's popularity as a destination for boaters has led to a high rate of accidents , some of them fatal . The Columbus Day weekend has been cited as the " most dangerous weekend of the year . " An annual boating regatta in its 57th year in 2012 resulted in six deaths between 2002 and 2011 , with damage to seabeds from vessel groundings and littering . Although official regatta activities take place outside the park , the area of Elliott Key has become a popular destination for some participants . 
 A fifth generating unit fueled by natural gas and oil was added to the Turkey Point generating station in 2007 . In 2009 , Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117 MW <unk> nuclear reactors , to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7 . If built , the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States . Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami @-@ Dade County , a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point , and its neighbor , the South Miami @-@ Dade Landfill .

Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys . Matheson Hammock Park is near the north end of the park , and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne . 
 Although it is a federally designated park , fishing within Biscayne is governed by the state of Florida . Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license . Fishing is limited to designated sport fish , spiny lobster , stone crab , blue crab and shrimp . Tropical reef fish may not be collected , nor may sharks , conch , sea urchins and other marine life . Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors . Additionally , <unk> is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay @-@ Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary , administered by the state of Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas , which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay . 
 A private <unk> provides tours from the Park headquarters into the bay and to the keys . Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April . Personal watercraft are prohibited in Biscayne and most other national parks , but other private powerboats and sailboats are permitted .

 <unk> and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities . The reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks .

 Stiltsville was established by Eddie " Crawfish " Walker in the 1930s as a small community of shacks built on pilings in a shallow section of Biscayne Bay , not far from Key Biscayne .

The site was incorporated into Biscayne National Park in 1985 , when the Park Service agreed to honor existing leases until July 1 , 1999 . Hurricane Andrew destroyed most of Stiltsville in 1992 . The Park Service has undertaken to preserve the community , which is now unoccupied . The community is to be administered by a trust and used as accommodation for overnight camping , educational facilities and researchers . 
 = = = Other structures = = = 
 Biscayne National Park includes a number of navigational aids , as well as an ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse . The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton @-@ frame cast iron structure built in 1878 . Already included within the boundaries of the park , the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2 , 2012 . The unmanned Pacific Reef Light is about three miles offshore from Elliott Key . The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada . 
 Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club member who bought Boca Chita Key in 1937 , expanding the facilities to include a small lighthouse . Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse , built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern , and the end of a jetty on the north side of the key . The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945 . Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel , a guesthouse , seawalls and utility buildings on the island . 
 The Boca Chita Key structures are administered as a cultural landscape , interpreting the area 's use as a retreat for the rich . More modest homesteads include the now @-@ abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons , and the Sweeting Homestead on Elliott Key . The frame structures associated with these plantations , together with those of the Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key , have been destroyed by fire and hurricanes . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 South Florida is a transitional zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones , resulting in a wide variety of plant and animal life . The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species , particularly birds , that are not seen elsewhere in North America . The park includes four distinct ecosystems , each supporting its own flora and fauna . Mangrove swamp , lagoon , island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species . In this semi @-@ tropical environment , the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall . Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms . Though only marginally cooler , the winters tend to be relatively drier . Bay salinity varies accordingly , with lower salinity levels in the wet summer , trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in . 
 Hundreds of species of fish are present in park waters , including more than fifty crustacean species ranging from isopods to giant blue land crabs , about two hundred species of birds and about 27 mammal species , both terrestrial and marine . Molluscs include a variety of bivalves , terrestrial and marine snails , sea hares , sea slugs and two cephalopods , the Caribbean reef octopus and the Caribbean reef squid . 
 The sheltered open waters of the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American , the Caribbean islands , and South America . Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park , just north of the park on Key Biscayne , before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay . Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key . Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers , with ovenbirds , palm warblers , American redstarts , common <unk> , prairie warblers , worm @-@ eating warblers and black @-@ throated blue warblers accounting for the majority . Migrant raptors include short @-@ tailed hawks , sharp @-@ shinned hawks , merlins , peregrine falcons and swallow @-@ tailed kites , while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park . Both white @-@ tailed and red @-@ tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park , as are American flamingos , with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds . 
 = = = Shoreline and mangrove swamp = = = 
 The mainland shorelines are dominated by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by red mangrove and black mangrove growing from the shallow water , with white mangrove growing farther back from the water 's edge . The trees ' aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs , fish and wading birds . The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish , mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters . Mangroves shed leaves at about 2 to 4 short tons per acre ( 4 @.@ 5 to 9 @.@ 0 t / ha ) per year , providing food for fish , worms and crustaceans . Because the carbon in the leaves is sequestered by incorporation into animals , the mangrove swamp is estimated to have two to three times the ability to sequester carbon of terrestrial forests . The mangrove forest on Biscayne Bay is the longest on Florida 's east coast . Shoreline and island mangrove swamps , together with the bay , represent a significant nursery for the marine life of southeast Florida . 
 The salt @-@ tolerant mangrove margin has expanded inland as freshwater flow into the bay has been channelized , replacing freshwater sawgrass marshes . The L @-@ 31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park 's western boundary has played a significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources . At the same time , tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin , limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems . 
 Bird life on the shoreline includes yellow @-@ crowned night herons , loggerhead shrikes , prairie warblers and shorebirds . Mangrove cuckoos , a notoriously difficult @-@ to @-@ observe species , may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point . Biscayne has one of the largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida . 
 The park 's margins are habitat for the threatened American crocodile . The construction of miles of cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant , and the canals ' warm waters , have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting , making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park . Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida , alligators are uncommon in Biscayne , since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland , while crocodiles can live in Biscayne 's somewhat saltier estuarine waters . 
 = = = Bay waters = = = 
 The open waters are inhabited by fishes , molluscs and crustaceans living on sea grasses or who prey on each other . The shallowness of the lagoon makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as anhinga , cormorants and diving ducks . The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts . Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay . The bay has a year @-@ round population of double @-@ crested cormorants . Winter residents include northern gannets , American white pelicans and common loons . The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins . 
 Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth . Instead of a vertical gradient , the bay shows a horizontal density gradient , with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals . Bay salinity reaches a peak in June . Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum . Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper . The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow . Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park : <unk> , shoal grass and manatee grass . The endangered Johnson 's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay , which is at the southern end of the grass 's range . Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses . Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem . About 200 such incidents are documented each year , with full re @-@ growth requiring up to 15 years . The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling , which is permitted in park waters . The passage of roller @-@ frame trawl nets does not harm grasses , but damages soft corals and sponges . 
 = = = Keys = = = 
 Elliott Key is the largest island in the park , measuring 1 @,@ 650 acres ( 670 ha ) and about 8 @.@ 1 mi ( 13 km ) long by 0 @.@ 62 mi ( 1 km ) wide . Next largest is Old Rhodes Key at 660 acres ( 270 ha ) , then Sands Key 420 acres ( 170 ha ) , Totten Key 380 acres ( 150 ha ) and Little Totten Key at 200 acres ( 81 ha ) , with 37 smaller islands arranged in a north @-@ south line 5 to 8 @.@ 7 mi ( 8 to 14 km ) east of the mainland shoreline . The keys shift from barrier islands with rocky cores in the north to coral rock platforms in the south . All are fringed with mangroves , with subtropical vegetation and hardwood forests in the interiors , including gumbo limbo , mahogany , ironwood , <unk> and <unk> . Insects include Schaus ' swallowtail , an endangered species , as well as dense clouds of mosquitoes in the wet season , preyed upon by dragonflies . Marsh rabbits and raccoons , together with mice and rats comprise the primary mammalian species . Reptiles include rattlesnakes and a variety of lizards , as well as an occasional crocodile . 
 The keys are a transitional area capable of hosting unexpected birds , often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland . The interior of the keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them . Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers . Gulls and terns include royal terns , laughing gulls and ring @-@ billed gulls , with brown pelicans just offshore . Wilson 's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key , where nesting zones are closed during breeding season . 
 Sea turtles nest on island beaches in the park . Park staff actively assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose an obstacle to adults and hatchlings . Loggerhead turtles are the most common sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park . Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population . Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100 % of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007 , with a more usual average of more than 50 % nest disturbance in most years . In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected , five partially disturbed nests were protected , and one nest was destroyed by predators . The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island . 
 Rare and endangered plant species on the islands include Sargent 's cherry palm and the semaphore prickly @-@ pear cactus ( <unk> <unk> ) . The cactus , which has been described as " near extinction " , has been reduced to about 20 individuals . A colonial population of 570 cacti were found on one island in Biscayne Bay in 2001 , making it the largest known population of semaphore prickly @-@ pear cactus in the world . The only natural population of Sargent 's palm grows on Elliott Key . Fewer than 50 grew on the key in 1991 . Despite efforts to propagate the plant , there are now 16 Sargent 's palms on Elliott Key , with about 123 propagated on Long Key . 
 Two critically endangered butterflies , Schaus ' swallowtail ( Papilio <unk> ) and the Miami blue , are found in the park , mostly on Elliott Key . In 2012 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) authorized a capture and captive breeding program for Schaus ' swallowtail after only five of the butterflies were found by surveyors in the park , down from 35 in 2011 , of a total surveyed Florida population of 41 . The Miami blue was feared to be extinct after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , but a population was found in 1999 at Bahia Honda Key . Captive breeding produced 25 @,@ 000 Miami blues , some of which have been released on Elliott Key with mixed results . 
 = = = Coral reef and offshore waters = = = 
 Beyond the keys in the Atlantic Ocean the seafloor slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef . The reef , composed of living corals , is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish , as well as molluscs , crustaceans and worms . Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations . Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park , with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank @-@ barrier reef . Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals , sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters . The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef on the edge of the Florida carbonate platform , the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys , and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys . The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to 10 @-@ meter ( 33 ft ) water depth , and staghorn coral below 10 meters . The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral . The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals . 
 Reef environments in Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species richness and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006 – 2007 . A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites . A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract and the decline in fish species . Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure . Algal cover has increased as coral has declined , so that coral @-@ dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased . Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role , while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples . 
 The park 's eastern boundary lies just beyond the rise of the offshore reef at ten @-@ fathom ( 60 @-@ foot ; 18 m ) sea depth . Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary , which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding to a depth of 300 fathoms ( 1 @,@ 800 ft ; 550 m ) . The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans , magnificent frigatebirds , brown boobies , particularly around the offshore lights , and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels . Whales in offshore waters are rare , but can include right whales , humpback whales , sperm whales , fin whales and sei whales , all of them endangered . The smalltooth sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered . Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals , as well as pillar coral , listed as endangered in Florida . 
 = = = Exotic species = = = 
 More than 50 species of exotic plant have been documented in the park , with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance . Green iguanas , cane toads , black rats , lionfish , fire ants , <unk> and brown basilisk lizards are common in the park . The lionfish ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> miles ) is a tropical fish from the Indian @-@ Pacific Ocean area . It is known for its voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters , rapidly replacing other species . Researchers theorized that the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums that were destroyed during the hurricane , though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion . More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park . Also likely originating from human captivity , Burmese pythons have been observed near the park 's boundary along the mainland . Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian @-@ pepper , torpedo grass , tuberous sword fern , guava and <unk> . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Biscayne 's tropical climate reflects its location in extreme South Florida . Southern Miami @-@ Dade County is classified as tropical savanna in the Köppen @-@ Geiger system . Seasons may be divided into the November – April dry season and the May – October wet season . Dry season temperatures average between 66 and 76 ° F ( 19 and 24 ° C ) with an average monthly rainfall of 2 @.@ 1 inches ( 53 mm ) . Wet season temperatures average between 76 and 85 ° F ( 24 and 29 ° C ) with an average monthly rainfall of 5 @.@ 39 inches ( 137 mm ) . The wet season roughly coincides with hurricane season , with frequent thunderstorms . 
 Like many locations in southern Florida , Biscayne National Park is affected by hurricanes every few years . Most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities . A direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences , primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park , which is well @-@ adapted to these events . Significant hurricanes to strike Biscayne include storms in 1835 and 1904 , the 1906 Florida Keys hurricane , the 1926 Miami hurricane , the 1929 Bahamas hurricane , the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , the 1935 Yankee hurricane , the 1941 Florida hurricane , the 1945 Southeast Florida hurricane , the 1948 Miami hurricane , Hurricane King in 1950 , Hurricane Donna in 1960 , . Hurricane Cleo in 1964 , and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . The park can be affected by wave action from more distant tropical storms such as 2012 's Hurricane Sandy , which damaged facilities on Elliott Key . 
 On August 24 , 1992 , Hurricane Andrew came ashore just south of Miami , passing directly across Biscayne National Park with maximum sustained winds of 141 miles per hour ( 227 km / h ) , with gusts to 169 mph ( 272 km / h ) . The storm surge was up to 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) above mean sea level . It was a compact Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Biscayne Bay was affected by bottom scouring and turbidity and with damage to its fringes of mangrove forest . Leakage from damaged boats and marinas polluted the bay with fuel , with discharges continuing for nearly a month after the hurricane 's passage . A commemorative plaque was placed at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center in 2002 to commemorate the human and environmental cost of Andrew , and to celebrate the area 's recovery from the storm 's effects . The inscription reads in part : 
 On Monday , August 24 , 1992 , at 4 : 30 a.m. , the eye wall of Hurricane Andrew passed over this point before striking Homestead and southern Miami @-@ Dade County . 
 The Fowey Rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two @-@ minute wind speed of 127 knots ( 235 km / h ) and a gust to 147 knots ( 272 km / h ) before the station ceased transmitting , presumably due to damage from stronger gusts . The strongest part of the eyewall had not reached Fowey Rocks when it stopped transmitting . 
 Since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level , they are vulnerable to rising sea levels . Park Service studies project that much of the park 's land area will be lost in the next two hundred years . Sea level in Biscayne Bay is projected to rise between 3 and 7 inches ( 8 and 18 cm ) by 2030 , and 9 to 24 inches ( 23 to 61 cm ) by 2060 . A sea level rise of 3 to 6 inches ( 8 to 15 cm ) is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne Aquifer . Higher rises will make the southern Everglades a saltwater marsh , altering the ecology of the region .

 cê is an album by Brazilian singer , songwriter , and guitarist Caetano Veloso . Released on 1 September 2006 on Mercury Records , the album took its title from the colloquial Portuguese word meaning you . It was written with Veloso 's band in mind , which was chosen in part by guitarist Pedro <unk> cê received mixed to positive critical commentary ; several critics specifically noted the album 's lyrical focus on human sexuality . 
 = = Title and cover = = 
 The word cê is a shortened version of the Portuguese personal pronoun você , meaning you . Veloso says that cê is a more " colloquial " version of você , used often in everyday speech . When he writes lyrics , Veloso typically writes the word você , but sings cê when performing . The inspiration for the album 's title came when he wrote cê instead of você and thought of it as an appropriate title . 
 Veloso designed the album 's cover himself , as he had done before for three other albums . He went through a long design process in which the cover 's colors , fonts , and text positioning were changed frequently . Veloso chose the color purple for the cover 's background because it is mentioned multiple times in the album itself . 
 = = Band and recording = = 
 Veloso wrote most of the album 's material with its band in mind and played the music as a complete unit with the band . Guitarist and percussionist Pedro Sá had already been confirmed as a participant on the album , and he was invited to pick other musicians for it. cê 's primary recording was completed in two weeks as a result of the extensive rehearsals conducted in the few months prior , and the extended recording process , including the production of rhythm tracks , extended for another six weeks . 
 When asked about the " tightness " of the album 's sound by The Boston Globe 's Siddhartha Mitter , Veloso responded that he had intended for the songs to be realized in this manner and that the young musicians he had hired to work on the album allowed him to do this . 
 = = Lyrics and themes = = 
 cê 's lyrical subject matter received attention from nearly every critic reviewing it , described as " carnal " by New York Times reviewer Nate Chinen . Brazilian music expert <unk> <unk> Jr. wrote , " Veloso 's disc as a whole displays a plethora of poetic representations and pervasive preoccupation with sex and gloom . " In particular , <unk> noted the album 's theme of unconventional sexual roles and Veloso 's uncertainty of his sexual orientation . 
 Concerning the album , Caetano says that cê : 
 resulted from a mutation , from a desire to make a rock album without my name , and then make a samba album ( Zii e <unk> , released in 2009 ) . I ended up not doing either one . 
 = = Reception = = 
 cê received a rating of 75 percent on the online review aggregator Metacritic , which corresponds with " generally favorable reviews . " Writing for The New Yorker , music journalist Sasha Frere @-@ Jones described the album as closest to indie rock , compared to Veloso 's previous records — " ' cê ' resists the anodyne charms of Brazilian pop , favoring loud , blocky rhythms more common to American garage bands . " Frere @-@ Jones went on to describe the fluidity of the album , falling very loosely into the rock music genre classification . Ben Ratliff , of The New York Times , noted that cê fell on the " petty end of the emotional spectrum " and that its compositions were raw and unpolished . 
 Allmusic 's Philip <unk> rated the album with three out of five stars . He wrote that cê , while not poor , lacked the creative spark that is Veloso 's trademark . Conversely , Mallory O 'Donnell of Stylus Magazine , who gave the album an A- rating , saw it as one of Veloso 's better recent works , compared to 2004 's A Foreign Sound , in particular . Village Voice critic Mike Powell also compared cê to A Foreign Sound and noted that cê 's relative simplicity was its " triumph " . cê was awarded the Latin Grammy for Best Singer @-@ Songwriter Album .
