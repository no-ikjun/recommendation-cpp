 As a teenager , Sevigny would occasionally ditch school in Darien and catch the train into Manhattan . In 1992 , at age 17 , she was spotted on an East Village street by Andrea <unk> , a fashion editor of Sassy magazine , who was so impressed by her style that she asked her to model for the magazine ; she was later made an intern . When recounting the event , Sevigny was ambivalent about it , stating that " the woman at Sassy just liked the hat I was wearing " . She later modeled in the magazine as well as for X @-@ girl , the subsidiary fashion label of the Beastie Boys ' " X @-@ Large " , designed by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth , which then led to an appearance in the music video for Sonic Youth 's " Sugar Kane " . 
 In 1993 , at age 19 , Sevigny relocated from her Connecticut hometown to an apartment in Brooklyn , and worked as a seamstress . During that time , author Jay McInerney spotted her around New York City and wrote a seven @-@ page article about her for The New Yorker in which he dubbed her the new " it girl " and referred to her as one of the " coolest girls in the world " . She subsequently appeared on the album cover of Gigolo <unk> ' 1994 recording <unk> ' Out and the EP Full @-@ On Bloom , as well as a Lemonheads music video which further increased her reputation in New York 's early 1990s underground scene .

 Sevigny encountered young screenwriter and aspiring director Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park in New York City during her senior year of high school in 1993 . The two became close friends , which resulted in her being cast in the low @-@ budget independent film Kids ( 1995 ) . Directed by Larry Clark and written by Korine , Sevigny plays a New York teenager who discovers she is HIV positive . According to Sevigny , she was originally cast in a much smaller role in the film , but ended up replacing Canadian actress Mia Kirshner . Just two days before production began , the leading role went to the then @-@ 19 @-@ year @-@ old Sevigny , who had no professional acting experience ; she said of her casting in the role , " Harmony [ Korine ] just thought I was this sweet , cute girl and he liked my blonde hair . " Nonetheless , Kids was highly controversial ; the film was given an NC @-@ 17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for its graphic depiction of sexuality and recreational substance and drug use involving teenagers . Despite its controversy , Kids was taken note of critically and commercially : respected film critic Janet Maslin considered the film a " wake @-@ up call to the modern world " about the nature of the American youth in contemporary urban settings . Sevigny 's performance was praised , with critics noting that she brought a tenderness to the chaotic , immoral nature of the film : " Sevigny provided the warm , reflective center in this feral film " . She ended up receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female . 
 Sevigny followed Kids with actor / director Steve Buscemi 's independent film Trees Lounge ( 1996 ) , starring in a relatively small role as Buscemi 's object of affection . During this time , director Mary Harron ( after having seen Kids ) offered Sevigny a minor part in her film , I Shot Andy Warhol ( 1996 ) . Harron tracked Sevigny down to the SoHo clothing store Liquid Sky , where she was working at the time . Sevigny then gave her first audition ever , but ultimately decided to turn down the part ; she would later work with Harron on American Psycho ( 2000 ) . Instead of taking the part in I Shot Andy Warhol , Sevigny starred in and worked as a fashion designer on Gummo ( 1997 ) , directed and written by Harmony Korine , who was romantically involved with Sevigny during filming . Gummo was as controversial as Sevigny 's debut ; set in Xenia , Ohio , the film depicts an array of nihilistic characters in a poverty @-@ stricken small @-@ town America , and presents issues such as drug and sexual abuse as well as anti @-@ social alienated youth in Midwestern America . In retrospection to the confronting nature of the film , Sevigny cited it as one of her favorite projects : " Young people love that movie . It 's been stolen from every Blockbuster in America . It 's become a cult film " . The film was dedicated to Sevigny 's father , who died prior to the film 's release . 
 After Gummo , Sevigny starred in the neo @-@ noir thriller Palmetto ( 1998 ) , playing a young Florida <unk> alongside Woody Harrelson . She then had a leading role as a Hampshire College graduate in the sardonic period piece The Last Days of Disco ( 1998 ) , alongside Kate Beckinsale . The film was written and directed by cult director Whit Stillman and details the rise and fall of the Manhattan club scene in the " very early 1980s " . Stillman said of Sevigny : " Chloë is a natural phenomenon . You 're not directing , she 's not performing — it 's just real . " Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Sevigny " is seductively demure " in her performance as Alice . The film was generally well received , but was not a box @-@ office success in the United States , only grossing $ 3 million — it has since become somewhat of a success as a cult film . 
 Aside from film work , Sevigny starred in a 1998 Off @-@ Broadway production of Hazelwood Jr . High , which tells the true story of the 1992 murder of <unk> Sharer ; Sevigny played 17 @-@ year @-@ old Laurie <unk> , one of four girls responsible for torturing and murdering 12 @-@ year @-@ old Sharer . Sevigny was reportedly so emotionally disturbed after playing the role that she began attending Catholic Mass again . 
 = = = 1999 – 2003 : Boys Don 't Cry , breakthrough = = = 
 Sevigny was cast in the independent drama Boys Don 't Cry ( 1999 ) after director Kimberly Peirce saw her performance in The Last Days of Disco . Sevigny 's role in Boys Don 't Cry — a biographical film of trans man Brandon Teena , who was raped and murdered in Humboldt , Nebraska in 1993 — was responsible for her rise to prominence and her mainstream success . Sevigny played Lana Tisdel , a young woman who fell in love with Teena , initially unaware of the fact that he was designated female at birth and continued the relationship despite learning about his birth gender . Boys Don 't Cry received high praise from critics , and was a moderate box @-@ office success . Sevigny 's performance was singled out as one of the film 's strong points and was widely embraced as one of the best acted films of that year : The Los Angeles Times noted that Sevigny " plays the role with haunting immediacy , " Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times stated that " it is Sevigny who provides our entrance into the story " and Rolling Stone wrote that Sevigny gives a " performance that burns into the memory " . Director Kimberly Peirce echoed the same feelings of the critics : " Chloë just surrendered to the part . She watched videos of Lana . She just became her very naturally . She 's not one of those Hollywood actresses who diets and gets plastic surgery . You never catch her acting . " The role earned Sevigny Best Supporting Actress nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award . Sevigny won an Independent Spirit Award , a Satellite Award , and a Sierra Award for her performance . 
 Following Boys Don 't Cry , Sevigny had a supporting role in American Psycho , based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis . Sevigny plays the office assistant of Patrick Bateman , played by Christian Bale , a 1980s Manhattan yuppie @-@ turned @-@ serial killer . The film , as was its source novel , was controversial because of its depiction of graphic violence and sexuality in an upper @-@ class Manhattan society . In addition , she reunited with Kids writer and Gummo director Harmony Korine for the experimental Julien Donkey @-@ Boy ( 1999 ) , playing the pregnant sister of a schizophrenic man . Though it never saw a major theatrical release , it garnered some critical praise ; Roger Ebert gave the film his signature thumbs up , referring to it as " Freaks shot by the Blair Witch crew " , and continuing to say , " The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it . For others , it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn " . Sevigny followed Julien with a small part in the drama film A Map of the World ( 1999 ) , opposite Sigourney Weaver . 
 Between 1998 and 2000 , Sevigny moved back to Connecticut to live with her mother , and appeared as a lesbian in the Emmy Award @-@ winning television movie If These Walls Could Talk 2 ( 2000 ) , the sequel to the HBO television drama @-@ film If These Walls Could Talk ( 1996 ) . Sevigny reportedly took the role in the film in order to help pay her mother 's mortgage payment , and has credited it as the only film she ever made for financial benefit . Following this appearance , Sevigny was approached for a supporting role in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde alongside Reese Witherspoon and offered $ 500 @,@ 000 ; she declined and the role was given to Selma Blair . Instead , she starred in Olivier <unk> ' French techno thriller <unk> ( 2002 ) alongside Connie Nielsen , for which she was required to learn her lines in French . Sevigny described shooting the film as " strange " , in the sense that director <unk> hardly spoke to her during the filming , which she said was difficult because of the lack of " input " . After spending nearly three months in France to complete <unk> , Sevigny returned to New York to film the club kid biopic , Party Monster ( 2003 ) ; coincidentally , Sevigny in fact knew several of the people depicted in the film ( Michael <unk> and James St. James included ) , whom she met during her frequent trips to New York City 's club scene as a teenager . 
 Sevigny then obtained a role in Lars von Trier 's parable film Dogville ( 2003 ) , playing one of the various residents of a small mountain town , alongside Nicole Kidman , Lauren Bacall , and Paul Bettany ; the film received mixed reactions , and was criticized by critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper as being " anti @-@ American " . Sevigny re @-@ united with former Boys Don 't Cry star Peter Sarsgaard for the biographical film Shattered Glass ( 2003 ) , also alongside Hayden Christensen , about the career of Stephen Glass , a journalist whose reputation is destroyed when his widespread journalistic fraud was exposed . Sevigny played a co @-@ editor of Glass 's .

 In 2003 , Sevigny took on the lead female role in the art house film The Brown Bunny ( 2003 ) , which details a lonely traveling motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover . The film achieved notoriety for its final scene , which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo . The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival , and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics . She went on to defend the movie , " It 's a shame people write so many things when they haven 't seen it . When you see the film , it makes more sense . It 's an art film . It should be playing in museums . It 's like an Andy Warhol movie . " After the film 's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival , the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client . The agency believed the scene was " one step above pornography " , and claimed that Sevigny 's career " may never recover " . In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003 , when asked if she regretted the film , she responded : " No , I was always committed to the project on the strength of Vincent alone . I have faith in his aesthetic [ ... ] I try to forgive and forget , otherwise I 'd just become a bitter old lady . " 
 Despite the backlash toward the film , some critics praised Sevigny 's performance ; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said , " Actresses have been asked and even bullied into performing similar acts for filmmakers since the movies began , usually behind closed doors . Ms. Sevigny isn 't hiding behind anyone 's desk . She says her lines with feeling and puts her iconoclasm right out there where everyone can see it ; she may be nuts , but she 's also unforgettable . " Roger Ebert , although critical of The Brown Bunny , nevertheless noted that Sevigny brought " a truth and vulnerability " to the film . 
 Despite her agency 's disapproval of the film ( and fear that the actress might have forever tarnished her career ) , she continued on with various projects . Sevigny had a major supporting role as a Manhattanite in Woody Allen 's two @-@ sided tragicomedy , Melinda and Melinda ( 2004 ) , which Sevigny referred to as being a " pleasing " experience . She subsequently guest @-@ starred on the popular television show Will & Grace , and a string of film roles followed , including a small role in Lars von Trier 's sequel to Dogville , titled Manderlay ( 2005 ) , as well as a bit part alongside Bill Murray in Broken Flowers ( 2005 ) . Sevigny also played one of several lovers of New York doctor Herman <unk> in the HBO television film Mrs. Harris ( 2005 ) alongside Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley . Sevigny then had a major role as a Catholic nun visiting Africa in one of three stories in 3 Needles ( 2005 ) , an anthology dealing with the prevalence of AIDS in various parts of the world . Sevigny 's performance in the film was praised ; Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance in the film " convincing " , while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times also referred to Sevigny as " ever @-@ daring and shrewd " . Shortly after 3 Needles , Sevigny played the lead character in the experimental indie @-@ film Lying ( 2006 ) with Jena Malone and <unk> Sobieski , playing a pathological liar who gathers three female acquaintances for a weekend at her upstate New York country house ; the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006 . She also had a leading part in Douglas Buck 's 2006 remake of the Brian De Palma horror film Sisters ( 1973 ) .

 In 2006 , Sevigny began her five @-@ season run in the HBO television series Big Love , about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists . She played Nicolette Grant , the conniving , <unk> daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband , played by Bill Paxton . Sevigny found even more mainstream success with a role in her first big @-@ budget production as Robert Graysmith 's wife Melanie in David Fincher 's Zodiac ( 2007 ) , telling the true story of San Francisco 's infamous Zodiac killer .

Throughout 2009 , Sevigny continued working on Big Love 's fourth season ; when filming the series , she spent six months of the year living outside of Los Angeles near Santa Clarita , away from her home in New York City . 
 In January 2010 , Sevigny won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress – Series , Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in the third season of Big Love . The series itself also received nominations in two other categories . During a press conference following the award win , Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds : " These women are kept extremely repressed . They should be helped . They don 't even know who the president of the United States is . " In addition , she had various screening credits that year : Sevigny landed major roles in two independent comedy films : Barry Munday and Mr. Nice in Munday , Sevigny plays the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer ( opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer ) ; in Mr. Nice , she had a leading role as British marijuana @-@ trafficker Howard Marks ' wife , alongside Rhys Ifans ; the film was based on Marks ' autobiography of the same name . In a later interview with The A.V. Club , Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show 's message was that polygamy was " wrong " . In response , Sevigny stated : " No , absolutely not . I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love — more so than " Polygamy is wrong . " I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects . " During the same interview , Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series ' fourth season , calling it " awful " and " very telenovela " — though she stated that she loves her character and the writing , she felt the show " got away from itself . " Sevigny later regretted making the statements , saying she was very " exhausted " and " wasn 't thinking about what [ she ] was saying " ; she also apologized to the show 's producers . " [ I didn 't want them to think ] that I was biting the hand that feeds me , because I obviously love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it . And I didn 't want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn 't , you know , appreciative . " 
 In March 2010 , Sevigny attended the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin for the premiere of both Barry Munday and Mr. Nice ; Barry Munday was picked up for distribution by Magnolia Pictures several months later . In June 2010 , it was announced that Sevigny would be starring in a leading role in M.

 = = Fashion career = = 
 Sevigny has long been considered a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists . Throughout her career , she has modelled for several high profile designers , including Miu Miu , H & M , Louis Vuitton and Chloé . Prior to her career as an actress , she had achieved fame for her unique style . While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends , it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny 's look . Her interest in fashion and clothing , as well as her career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties , have led to a career as a prominent and well @-@ respected fashion designer . She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career , even dating back to her childhood : " Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show . I would only wear calico print dresses , and I actually slept in one of those little <unk> ! " , she told People in 2007 . Her unorthodox style ( which garnered her initial notoriety in the early ' 90s ) has often been referred to as very eclectic . Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself , both solo and in collaboration , and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon . 
 In 2002 , she collaborated with Tara <unk> for the 2003 Imitation of Christ collection in New York City , serving as creative director for the series , which was referred to as being " more about performance art and cultural theory than clothes " . Actress Scarlett Johansson also collaborated for the collection .

Sevigny has also done various modeling jobs and magazine spreads ; in October 2007 , the French fashion house Chloé announced that she would be one of the spokesmodels for their new fragrance . In addition , she appeared in the January 2007 issue of House and Garden titled " Subversive Spirit " , which featured a spread on Sevigny 's Manhattan apartment . Sevigny 's most recent collection was released in fall 2009 for the Manhattan boutique , Opening Ceremony ; the collection included both men 's , women 's , and unisex pieces . The pieces were sold exclusively at Opening Ceremony boutiques ( Manhattan and Los Angeles ) , Barneys ( United States ) , Colette ( Paris ) , and London 's Dover Street Market . The series received decidedly mixed reactions . Sevigny 's designs for the collection have been seen on Rihanna and Victoria Beckham . 
 Critical reception of her fashion and style has been extensively written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable . American designer Marc Jacobs wrote of Sevigny in 2001 : " The fashion world is fascinated by her . Because not only is she talented , young and attractive , she stands out in a sea of often clichéd looking actresses . " In terms of her own personal style , Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock ( 1975 ) , which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing , as a major inspiration ; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films . She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces : " I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer " , she told The Times . " I 'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like , ' Oh , I 'm going to buy everything , ' but a lot of it is extremely expensive , so I 'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it 's not too hard on the pocketbook . Then there 's this place called Studio Wardrobe Department where everything is like three dollars " . 
 During the 29th International Festival of Fashion and Photography , which runs from April 25 to 28 , 2014 , Sevigny is a judge of the fashion jury , along with Humberto Leon and Carol Lim . In April 2015 , Rizzoli released a picture book celebrating the actress 's style legacy , featuring photos of Sevigny through the years , with shots of her as a high school student , on @-@ set photos , scripts and other personal ephemera . 
 Sevigny 's distinct fashion is also part of the inspiration for a fictionalized version of herself satirically impersonated by Drew <unk> on his YouTube channel .

 Sevigny owned an apartment in Manhattan 's East Village , which she purchased for $ 1 @.@ 2 million in 2006 and sold in March 2013 for $ 1 @.@ 85 million .

She suffers from scoliosis , diagnosed when she was a child , though she never received any surgical treatment . She has stated that she practices yoga for relief from the pain caused by the spinal deformity .

Nonetheless , she has been popular with the gay community throughout her career . Following her relationship with Harmony Korine , which ended in the late 1990s , Sevigny dated British musician Jarvis Cocker , and later Matt McAuley , a member of the noise @-@ rock band <unk> Weapons . Sevigny and McAuley ended their relationship in early 2008 , after being together for nearly eight years . 
 In a 2009 interview , Sevigny reflected on her career , and said she was content with the level of stardom she had maintained : " When I was in my early 20s , I went out with a British pop star , Jarvis Cocker ; of course , pop stars have much more celebrity , I think , than actors even . They 're really hunted by their fans much more . I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street . I was like , ' This is horrible ! ' And I saw the effect it had on him , and that 's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level , and I think that 's why I 've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me .

 = Breakdown ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Breakdown " is a song by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album , Butterfly ( 1997 ) . It was released as the fourth single from the album on March 22 , 1998 by Columbia Records . Similar to the treatments of " Butterfly and The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , " Breakdown " received a limited worldwide release due to Carey 's conflict at the time with Sony . The song was written and produced by Carey , Stevie J and Puff Daddy , and features rap verses by Bone Thugs @-@ n @-@ Harmony . The song 's lyrics describe the emotions someone feels when their lover suddenly stops loving and leaves them , and the pain , or breakdown , it causes the person . The song was well received by contemporary music critics . 
 In the music video , Carey goes through a variety of different colorful outfits , with matching make @-@ up . Of the many changes , two scenes predominantly occupy the video . The first in Carey dressed in flamenco style clothing , while dancing on a chair with two other female dancers . The other features Carey and Bone Thugs @-@ N @-@ Harmony gambling in a casino . Carey performed the song live during select dates of her Butterfly World Tour in 1998 and Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006 . Due to the song 's limited release , " Breakdown " did not chart in most major music markets , with the exception of Australia and New Zealand , where it peaked at numbers 38 and four , respectively . In the US , due to Billboard rules at the time , the song was unable to chart on the Hot 100 , but charted at number 53 on the Hot 100 Airplay Chart . 
 = = Background = = 
 Carey recorded the song at the Hit Factory in New York City , throughout 1997 . " Breakdown " was one of the first of Carey 's album tracks to veer in a hip hop direction , and many were surprised when she contacted Bone Thugs @-@ n @-@ Harmony to record the song because she was considered more of a R & B / adult contemporary artist . According to author Chris Nickson , " Breakdown " was an important component of Butterfly : " ' Breakdown ' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory that was new for her and making it her own ; it had a melody that simmered under her vocal , and a groove that was irresistible . " When Carey began recording the album , she had slow and sultry ballads such as " Whenever You Call " and " Butterfly , " but also had big R & B and hip @-@ hop like " Honey " . For this reason , Carey recorded " Breakdown " in order to fill in the midsection of the album , and serve as the album 's " backbone . " 
 = = Controversy = = 
 " Breakdown " was the source of controversy when it came to its release . Carey was having a conflict with Columbia over the singles choices , as they were already not happy with the album 's hip @-@ hop transition . Later , in 1998 when Carey was composing the songs for her first compilation album , # 1 's , the song was again one of the reasons for continued conflict within the label . They disagreed on what content should compose the album . Sony wanted to release an album that featured her US number one singles , void of any new material . Carey on the other hand , felt that a greatest hits album should reflect on her most personal and favorite songs , not her most commercial . To accompany her thirteen number ones , Carey recorded four new songs . She felt that not including any new material would result in cheating her fans , therefore including some new material as well . While compromised , Carey often expressed distaste towards the album 's song selection , expressing her disappointment in the omission of her " favorite songs . " 
 For this reason , Sony titled the album # 1 's , as Carey felt the need to express the album 's true content , a collection of her number one hits . Carey has frequently cited " Underneath the Stars " ( 1996 ) and " Breakdown " ( 1998 ) as examples of songs she was unsuccessful in releasing . 
 = = Composition and remixes = = 
 " Breakdown " is a slow and sultry song , which blends hip @-@ hop and contemporary R & B genres . It incorporates drum notes , including heavy beats and grooves . The song features rap verses from two of the five members of Bone Thugs @-@ N @-@ Harmony , Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone . As part of " layering the song , " background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge . It is set in the signature common time , and is written in the key of E major . It features a basic chord progression of A ♭ -F ♭ -1 . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the note of B2 to the high note of F ♯ 5 ; the piano and guitar pieces range from F ♭ 3 to G ♭ 5 as well . The song contains choral lyrics written by Carey , who produced the song 's melody and chorus as well . Aside from assisting with its writing and chord progression , Combs and Stevie co @-@ arranged and produced the track as well .

 It was released as the album 's third single in 1998 in the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Australia only ( in Europe , " The Roof " was chosen as the third single instead ) . Because of conflict between Carey and her record label at the time , Sony Music Entertainment , it was only given a commercial release in Australia , where it performed modestly and remained in the top 40 for three weeks . A remix of the song was promoted to U.S. radio stations and debuted on Billboard magazine 's Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Airplay chart in September @-@ October 1997 . However , it wasn 't released commercially in the U.S. until April 1998 , as a double A @-@ side with " My All .

 = Gliese 581 = 
 Gliese 581 ( / ˈɡliːzə / ) is a star of spectral type M3V ( a red dwarf ) about 20 light years away from Earth in the constellation Libra . Its estimated mass is about a third of that of the Sun , and it is the 89th closest known star to the Sun . Observations suggest that the star has a planetary system consisting of three known planets , designated Gliese 581 b , c , and e and a possibly confirmed planet , d , in order of discovery . Additional outer planets , which received the designations Gliese 581 f , and g have been proposed , but the evidence that led to the discovery claims has been shown to be the result of stellar activity mimicking the radial velocity variations due to orbiting planets . 
 Gliese 581 has been the subject of a " huge amount of attention " in the quest to discover the first habitable extrasolar planet ; first for c , and then d and g . Gliese 581 c , the first low @-@ mass extrasolar planet found near a habitable zone , was discovered in April 2007 . It has since been shown that under known terrestrial planet climate models , Gliese 581 c is likely to have a runaway greenhouse effect , and hence is probably too hot to be habitable , analogous to Venus . The proposed planets Gliese 581 d and Gliese 581 g also received attention as being located within the habitable zone , but their existence has subsequently been put into doubt by some authors . 
 On 27 November 2012 , the European Space Agency announced a debris disk , with at least ten times as many comets as the Solar System . This put constraints on possible planets beyond 0 @.@ 75 AU . 
 = = History of observations = = 
 Gliese 581 is known at least from 1886 , when it was included in Eduard Schönfeld 's Southern Durchmusterung ( SD ) — the fourth part of the Bonner Durchmusterung . The corresponding designation is BD -7 4003 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The name Gliese 581 refers to the catalog number from the 1957 survey Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of the Earth . Other names of this star include BD @-@ 07 ° 4003 ( BD catalogue , first known publication ) and HO Librae ( variable star designation ) . It does not have an individual name such as Sirius or Procyon . The star is a red dwarf with spectral type M3V , located 20 @.@ 4 light @-@ years away from Earth . It is located about two degrees north of Beta Librae , the brightest star in the constellation Libra . Its mass is estimated to be approximately a third that of the Sun , and it is the 89th closest known star system to the Sun . 
 An M @-@ class dwarf star such as Gliese 581 has a much lower mass than the Sun , causing the core region of the star to fuse hydrogen at a significantly lower rate . From the apparent magnitude and distance , we can estimate an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0 @.@ 2 % of that of the Sun . However , a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared , with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm ( estimated using Wien 's displacement law , which assumes the star radiates as a black body ) , so such an estimate will underestimate the star 's total luminosity . ( For comparison , the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530 nm , in the middle of the visible part of the spectrum ) . When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account ( not just the part that humans are able to see ) , something known as the bolometric correction , this star has a bolometric luminosity 1 @.@ 3 % of the Sun 's total luminosity . A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth . The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the " Goldilocks Zone " , or , more prosaically , the habitable zone . The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system . 
 Gliese 581 is classified as a variable star of the BY Draconis type , and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae . This is a star that exhibits variability because of the presence of star spots combined with the rotation of the star . However , the measured variability is close to the margin of error , and , if real , is most likely a long term variability . Its brightness is stable to 1 % . Gliese 581 emits X @-@ rays . 
 = = Planetary system = = 
 Three confirmed planets and two possible planets are possibly known to orbit Gliese 581 , together with a debris disc . Most of the planets are located close to the star and have near @-@ circular orbits . In order of distance from the star , the planets are designated Gliese 581 e , Gliese 581 b and Gliese 581 c and possibly Gliese 581 g and Gliese 581 d . The letters represent the discovery order , with b being the first planet to be discovered around the star ( the letter d was used for a planet that was once no longer thought to be real and was an artifact caused by stellar activity , but reanalysis led to the conclusion that d might exist ) . The planets were all discovered with the radial velocity method which gives only lower limits on the planetary masses and no information about their radii . The minimum mass of the middle planet b is comparable to the solar system ice giants Uranus and Neptune , while the inner and outer planets have minimum masses a few times that of the Earth . The first three planets orbit closer to the star than the inner edge of the habitable zone , with the possibly reconfirmed planets Gliese 581 g and Gliese 581 d orbiting within the habitable zone . 
 The debris disc has an inclination between 30 ° and 70 ° . If the planetary orbits lie in the same plane , their masses would be between 1 @.@ 1 and 2 times the minimum mass values . 
 = = = Gliese 581 e = = = 
 Gliese 581 e is the innermost planet and with a minimum mass of 1 @.@ 7 Earth masses is the least massive of the three . Discovered in 2009 , it is also the most recent confirmed planet to have been discovered in this system . It takes 3 @.@ 15 days to complete an orbit . Initial analyses suggested that the planet 's orbit is quite elliptical but after correcting the radial velocity measurements for stellar activity , the data now indicate a circular orbit .

 Gliese 581 b is the most massive planet known to be orbiting Gliese 581 and was the first to be discovered . 
 = = = Gliese 581 c = = = 
 Gliese 581 c is the third planet orbiting Gliese 581 . It was discovered in April 2007 . In their 2007 paper , Udry et al. asserted that if Gliese 581 c has an Earth @-@ type composition , it would have a radius of <unk> ⊕ , which would have made it at the time " the most Earth @-@ like of all known exoplanets " . A direct measurement of the radius cannot be taken because , viewed from Earth , the planet does not transit its star . The minimum mass of the planet is 5 @.@ 5 times that of Earth . The planet initially attracted attention as being potentially habitable , though this has since been discounted . The mean blackbody surface temperature has been estimated to lie between − 3 ° C ( for a Venus @-@ like albedo ) and 40 ° C ( for an Earth @-@ like albedo ) , however , the temperatures could be much higher ( about 500 degrees Celsius ) due to a runaway greenhouse effect akin to that of Venus . Some astronomers believe the system may have undergone planetary migration and Gliese 581 c may have formed beyond the frost line , with a composition similar to icy bodies like Ganymede . Gliese 581 c completes a full orbit in just under 13 days . 
 = = = Gliese 581 g = = = 
 Gliese 581 g is an exoplanet that was once considered disputed due to its existence depending on the eccentricity assumed for Gliese 581 d . But reanalysis suggests that Gliese 581 d could exist meaning that Gliese 581 g could exist too . Gliese 581 g is thought to be in the middle of the habitable zone . Its mass is thought to be 2 @.@ 2 Earth and has an orbital period of 32 days , with a semi @-@ major axis of 0 @.@ 13 with an eccentricity of 0 . 
 = = = Gliese 581 d = = = 
 Gliese 581 d is an exoplanet that was once considered disputed due to inaccurate analysis caused by noise and stellar activity , but reanalysis suggests that it does in fact exist , despite stellar variability . Its mass is thought to be 6 @.@ 98 Earths and its radius is thought to be <unk> ⊕ . It is considered to be a super @-@ Earth , but remarkable in that its orbit is inside the habitable zone and has a solid surface allowing for any water present on its surface to form liquid oceans and even landmasses characteristic of Earth ’ s surface , although with a much higher surface gravity . Its orbital period is thought to be 66 @.@ 87 days long , with a semi @-@ major axis of 0 @.@ <unk> with an unconfirmed eccentricity , Analysis suggests that it orbits within the star 's habitable zone , where the temperatures are just right to support life .

 On 27 November 2012 , the European Space Agency announced that the Herschel space observatory had discovered a comet belt " at 25 ± 12 AU to more than 60 AU " . It must have " at least 10 times " as many comets as does the Solar system . This likely rules out Saturn @-@ mass planets beyond 0 @.@ 75 AU . However another ( undiscovered ) planet further out , say a Neptune @-@ mass planet at 5 AU , might be required to keep the comet belt replenished . 
 = = = History of detections = = = 
 The first announcement of a planet around the star was Gliese 581 b discovered by astronomers at the Observatory of Geneva in Switzerland and Grenoble University in France . Detected in August 2005 and using extensive data from the ESO HARPS spectrometer it was the fifth planet to be discovered around a red dwarf . Further observations by the same group resulted in the detection of two more planets , Gliese 581 c and Gliese 581 d . The orbital period of Gliese 581 d was originally thought to be 83 days but was later revised to a lower value of 67 days . The revised orbital distance would place it at the outer limits of the habitable zone , the distance at which it is believed possible for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planetary body , given favourable atmospheric conditions . Gliese 581 d was estimated to receive about 30 % of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun . By comparison , sunlight on Mars has about 40 % of the intensity of that on Earth , though if high levels of carbon dioxide are present in the planetary atmosphere , the greenhouse effect could keep temperatures above freezing . 
 The next discovery was the inner planet Gliese 581 e also by the Observatory of Geneva and using data from the HARPS instrument was announced on 21 April 2009 . This planet , at a minimum mass of 1 @.@ 9 Earths , was at the time the least massive confirmed exoplanet identified around a main @-@ sequence star . 
 On 29 September 2010 , astronomers using the Keck Observatory proposed two additional planets , Gliese 581 f and Gliese 581 g , both in nearly circular orbits based on analysis of a combination of data sets from the HARPS and HIRES instruments . The proposed planet Gliese 581 f was thought to be a 7 Earth @-@ mass planet in a 433 @-@ day orbit and too cold to support liquid water . The candidate planet Gliese 581 g attracted more attention : nicknamed Zarmina by one of its discoverers , the predicted mass of Gliese 581 g was between 3 and 4 Earth @-@ masses , with an orbital period of 37 days . The orbital distance was calculated to be well within the star 's habitable zone , though the planet was expected to be tidally locked with one side of the planet always facing the star . In an interview with Lisa @-@ Joy <unk> of the National Science Foundation , Steven Vogt was asked what he thought about the chances of life existing on Gliese 581 g . Vogt was optimistic : " I 'm not a biologist , nor do I want to play one on TV . Personally , given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can , I would say that ... the chances of life on this planet are 100 % . I have almost no doubt about it . " 
 Two weeks after the announcement of the discovery of Gliese 581 f and Gliese 581 g , astronomer Francesco Pepe of the Geneva Observatory reported that in a new analysis of 179 measurements taken by the HARPS spectrograph over 6 @.@ 5 years , neither planet g nor planet f was detectable , and the relevant measurements were included in a paper uploaded to the arXiv preprint server , though still unpublished in a refereed journal . The non @-@ existence of Gliese 581 f was accepted relatively quickly : it was shown that the radial velocity variations that led to the claimed discovery of Gliese 581 f were instead associated with the stellar activity cycle rather than an orbiting planet . Nevertheless , the existence of planet g remained controversial : Vogt responded in the media that he stood by the discovery and questions arose as to whether the effect was due to the assumption of circular rather than eccentric orbits or the statistical methods used . 
 Bayesian analysis found no clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the combined HIRES / HARPS data set , though other studies led to the conclusion that the data did support the existence of planet g , albeit with strong <unk> in the parameters as a result of the first eccentric harmonic with the outer planet Gliese 581 d . 
 Using the assumption that the noise present in the data was correlated ( red noise rather than white noise ) , Roman <unk> called into question not only the existence of planet g , but Gliese 581 d as well , suggesting there were only three planets ( Gliese 581 b , c and e ) present . A different objection against the existence of Gliese 581 d was offered in a 2014 study whose authors argued that Gliese 581 d is " an artifact of stellar activity which , when incompletely corrected , causes the false detection of the planet g . " This remains controversial .

 She Wolf ( Spanish : Loba ) is the eighth studio album by Colombian singer @-@ songwriter Shakira . It was released on 9 October 2009 , by Epic Records and Sony Music Latin . As executive producers , Shakira and Amanda Ghost enlisted collaborators including The Neptunes , John Hill , Wyclef Jean , Lukas Burton , Future Cut , Jerry Duplessis and Timbaland . Musically , the record shifts from her traditional Latin pop and pop rock musical styles , instead exploring electropop , with influences of folk and world music . The lyrical themes of the album mostly focus on love and relationships and were based on the conversations Shakira had with her friends . 
 She Wolf reached number one on the charts of Argentina , Ireland , Italy , Mexico and Switzerland . It also charted inside the top five in Spain , Germany and the United Kingdom . It debuted at number fifteen on the Billboard 200 . She Wolf was certified double @-@ platinum in Colombia and Mexico , platinum in Italy and Spain , and gold in numerous countries including France and the United Kingdom . 
 The album was supported by four singles . Its lead single , " She Wolf " , along with its Spanish @-@ language version " Loba " , which reached the top ten in several countries . " Did It Again " ( along with its Spanish @-@ language version " Lo Hecho Está Hecho " ) was released worldwide as the second single , except in the United States , where its release was substituted by " Give It Up to Me " . The fourth single was " Gypsy " , along with its Spanish @-@ language version " Gitana " . Shakira embarked on The Sun Comes Out World Tour in late @-@ 2010 to promote She Wolf . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 In 2005 , Shakira attained international success with the release of her fourth and fifth studio albums Fijación Oral Vol . 1 and Oral Fixation Vol . 2 , which spawned the highly successful singles " La Tortura " and " Hips Don 't Lie " , respectively . To promote both the albums , she embarked on the Oral Fixation Tour , which reportedly grossed more than US $ 100 million worldwide . In 2008 , Shakira signed a 10 @-@ year deal with international touring company Live Nation , which prompted Forbes to deem her the fourth highest earning female musician in history . 
 Soon , Shakira began work on her next studio album , titled She Wolf , which was , among other places , recorded at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley , The Cure , and AC / DC , of whom she is a fan . Unlike most of her previous projects , which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles , She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences . When asked why the album had electronic influences , Shakira responded , " I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro @-@ pop world and everything it has to offer . I wanted to make sure that this album was very <unk> and that the kicks hit really hard , and I wanted to concentrate on the beat . But my music , to a certain extent , is very complex – because I always try to experiment with sounds from other parts of the world . " Explaining the meaning behind the title , Shakira said that " ' She Wolf ' is the woman of our time . The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions . She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal " . 
 Shakira and Amanda Ghost , the executive producers of the album , enlisted a diverse group of producers to collaborate on the tracks , such as Pharrell Williams , one half of the record production duo The Neptunes , who co @-@ wrote four of the tracks on the album with Shakira . Other collaborators included John Hill , Sam Endicott , and Timbaland . Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot , noting " When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method " . The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days , and commented that " What was interesting is that he 's very fast and immediate in the studio and I 'm a little slower " . Endicott , musician and lead singer of American post @-@ punk band The Bravery , was personally called by Shakira to co @-@ compose the title track of the album along with Hill . He explained how they both began working with the single , saying she " contacted him [ Hill ] , asking if he had any stuff . We never had her in mind . We just made the thing independently of her , and then she liked it a lot , and she sang over it . She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf . And that 's how it happened " . Haitian @-@ American rapper Wyclef Jean , who previously appeared as a featured artist on " Hips Don 't Lie " with Shakira , talked about his chemistry with her , saying " I have a natural chemistry with Shakira . I love the Latin vibe . The Lebanese vibe . I love the multicultural aspect of the CD . These days it 's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end . Shakira represents that 360 degrees of : You put it in , and the whole CD rocks " . In She Wolf , Jean appears as a featured artist on the track " Spy " . 
 = = Musical styles and lyrics = = 
 She Wolf is primarily an electropop album that combines influences from the musical styles of various countries and regions , like Africa , Colombia , India , and the Middle East . Shakira termed the album a " sonic experimental trip " , and said that she researched folk music from different countries in order to " combine electronics with world sounds , tambourines , clarinets , oriental and Hindu music , dancehall , etc . " The title track is an example of the electronic music styled production of the album , and is composed of 70s disco guitars and " heaps of robot effects " . " Did It Again " is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba . World music influences surface on songs like " Why Wait " and " Gypsy " , the former is a heavy synth based electro @-@ funk song with Led Zeppelin @-@ inspired Middle Eastern strings , while the latter is included as the " closest thing to an acoustic song on the album " and features instrumentation from mandolin , banjo , sitar and tabla . Tracks like " Long Time " and " Good Stuff " display dancehall , electronica and Latin elements . Critics found the 1980s @-@ stylised electropop track " Men in This Town " similar to the work of American band No Doubt . The Wyclef Jean collaboration " Spy " is a bouncy disco and R & B song that is described as sultry and playful . Elements of rock music are also present on the album , mostly evident on the " noisy " stadium rock song " Mon Amour " . The US bonus track " Give It Up to Me " mixes pop and hip hop music with a playful rap by Lil Wayne . As Shakira wanted to make sure the " kicks hit really hard " , the tracks on She Wolf were made " very bass @-@ driven " . She revealed that she had no idea how the album would sound like at the end , describing it to be like " standing in front of a white canvas " , but admitted that she knew she wanted to make an electronica influenced album from the beginning . 
 The lyrics of the tracks on She Wolf , according to Shakira , have been written from a " very feminine perspective " . She attributed this to her growing maturity , noting " I think maybe because I feel more like a woman today " . Many of the songs focus on " emotions that a woman experiments when you 're in love or out of love — jealousy , fantasies , daydreams " , which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are " struggling with their own romantic lives " . This issue is prominently covered in the track " Men in This Town " , in which Shakira sings about the lack of eligible bachelors in Los Angeles . The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon , the latter of whom Shakira knows personally , and popular destinations like the <unk> . Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that " Shakira wasn 't afraid to get a little wacky when it came to the lyrics on She Wolf " . In an interview with Jim Cantiello , the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like " I 'm so happy I should get sued " ( in the track " Long Time " ) , to which Shakira replied " Maybe it rhymed . It 's hard to explain your own lyrics , you know " . In " Mon Amour " , she wishes that her ex @-@ boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by " French fleas " . Other themes the album touches upon include night @-@ life , sex , and seduction , in songs like " Did It Again " and " Spy " . Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter " a meditation on masturbation " .

 She Wolf was released on 9 October 2009 , in Germany , Austria , Belgium , Italy , Ireland , the Netherlands and Switzerland . In the rest of Europe and Latin America , the album was released on 12 October , with subsequent releases in Spain , Japan , and Australia . It was scheduled to be released on 13 October in the United States , but was delayed and instead was released on 23 November . The reason for this delay was because Ghost decided to include the last @-@ minute Timbaland production " Give It Up to Me " on the tracklist of the US version of the album . In 2010 , She Wolf was reissued as Loba in Hispanic countries , which features additional remixes of the Spanish @-@ language songs on the original album .

 Shakira embarked on The Sun Comes Out World Tour in late @-@ 2010 , to promote She Wolf along with her ninth studio album Sale el Sol . Shakira 's official website first announced the three initial venues of the North American leg of the tour , on 3 May 2010 , and subsequently 22 more venues were listed . After a special tour preview show held in Montreal , Canada , on 15 September 2010 , the North American leg of the tour commenced at Uncasville , Connecticut , on 17 September , and closed at Rosemont , Illinois , on 29 October 2010 . The initial dates for the European leg of the tour were announced on 28 June 2010 , and subsequently 22 more shows were listed . The European leg of the tour was planned to commence at Lyon , France , on 16 November , and end in London , England , on 20 December 2010 . The tickets for the initial dates of the European leg were soon sold out , and Shakira extended the tour into 2011 , beginning by announcing a show at Paris , France ; venues at countries such as Croatia , Russia , Spain and Switzerland were soon added . The Latin American leg of the tour was a part of the Pop Festival , which was heralded as an initiative to bring international music stars to Latin America . Initial tour dates for the leg were announced on 3 December 2010 , and soon venues at countries like Argentina , Brazil , Colombia and Mexico were added to the tour dates . 
 The title track , " Why Wait " , and " Gypsy " were the only songs from She Wolf to be included on the setlist for the tour . The stage was shaped like the letter " T " to enable maximum amount of viewers to see Shakira easily .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , She Wolf received an average score of 72 based on 15 reviews , indicating " generally favourable reviews " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album a very positive review and concluded that She Wolf is a " celebration of all the strange sensuality that comes out at night " . Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson from Entertainment Weekly praised the production and music of the album , calling the album " some of the most unusually effective dance @-@ floor dynamite you 're likely to encounter all year " . David Balls from Digital Spy complimented Shakira 's ability to " mix this album 's eclectic range of influences into a listenable , cohesive collection of songs " , but also noted that some fans may be disappointed over the fact that " She Wolf downplays Shakira 's Latin @-@ pop routes in favour of a sound that will appeal to radio <unk> the world over " . Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph praised Shakira 's inventiveness on the album and summed up the review by saying " incongruous elements only add to the perfection of Shakira 's She Wolf " . Michael Cragg from MusicOMH singled out the tracks produced by The Neptunes as the best on the album , and also noted that they are " very much Shakira songs , not merely songs produced by The Neptunes " . Johnny Davis from The Observer labelled the album " preposterously brilliant " , while Mike Diver from BBC Music thought it was " perhaps the most enjoyably varied pop album of 2009 " . Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone was also positive towards the album and called Shakira a " charmer — a globe @-@ straddling star you can cuddle up to " . Joey Guerra from Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer gave the album a very positive review , praising Shakira 's exploration of world music and her experimentation , saying " every song goes to completely unexpected places , veering from a perfectly commercial shine to avant @-@ garde pop . " Guerra also commended the Neptunes ' production , calling She Wolf " Shakira 's most compelling , consistently entertaining disc since 1998 's Dónde Están los Ladrones ? , " and concluded that " Shakira has created some of the most weirdly wonderful pop of the past year . " Moreover , the critic felt that Shakira had not completely abandoned her musical roots and commented : " the rumors of Shakira 's vanishing Latina identity have been grossly exaggerated . " 
 Ayala Ben @-@ Yehuda from Billboard positively noted that the album was " certainly more adventurous than anything from her peers " , but felt that its execution seemed a " little forced " . She singled out the tracks " Gypsy " and " Why Wait " as album highlights . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought that " she ( Shakira ) takes quite well to the ( electro @-@ pop ) sound " , but felt that the album had a " bit of an identity problem " . Ben Ratliff from The New York Times gave the album a negative review and criticized The Neptunes ' productions . He concluded the review by saying that " there should be no American edition of Shakira : you just take her , in all her <unk> , or leave her " .

 = Caesium = 
 Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55 . It is a soft , silvery @-@ gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28 @.@ 5 ° C ( 83 @.@ 3 ° F ) , which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature . Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium . The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric , reacting with water even at − 116 ° C ( − 177 ° F ) . It is the least electronegative element . It has only one stable isotope , caesium @-@ 133 . Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite , while the radioisotopes , especially caesium @-@ 137 , a fission product , are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors . 
 The German chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy . The first small @-@ scale applications for caesium were as a " getter " in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells . In 1967 , based on Einstein defining the speed of light as the most constant dimension in the universe , the International System of Units isolated two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium @-@ 133 to co @-@ define the second and the meter . Since then , caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks . 
 Since the 1990s , the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids . It has a range of applications in the production of electricity , in electronics , and in chemistry . The radioactive isotope caesium @-@ 137 has a half @-@ life of about 30 years and is used in medical applications , industrial gauges , and hydrology . Although the element is only mildly toxic , it is a hazardous material as a metal and its radioisotopes present a high health risk if released into the environment .

 Caesium is a very soft ( it has the lowest hardness of all elements , 0 @.@ 2 Mohs ) , very ductile , pale metal , which darkens in the presence of trace amounts of oxygen . It has a melting point of 28 @.@ 4 ° C ( 83 @.@ 1 ° F ) , making it one of the few elemental metals that are liquid near room temperature . Mercury is the only elemental metal with a known melting point lower than caesium . In addition , the metal has a rather low boiling point , 641 ° C ( 1 @,@ 186 ° F ) , the lowest of all metals other than mercury . Its compounds burn with a blue or violet colour . 
 Caesium forms alloys with the other alkali metals , as well as with gold , and amalgams with mercury . At temperatures below 650 ° C ( 1 @,@ 202 ° F ) , it does not alloy with cobalt , iron , molybdenum , nickel , platinum , tantalum or tungsten . It forms well @-@ defined intermetallic compounds with antimony , gallium , indium and thorium , which are photosensitive . It mixes with all the other alkali metals ( except lithium ) ; the alloy with a molar distribution of 41 % caesium , 47 % potassium , and 12 % sodium has the lowest melting point of any known metal alloy , at − 78 ° C ( − 108 ° F ) . A few amalgams have been studied : <unk> 
 2 is black with a purple metallic lustre , while <unk> is golden @-@ coloured , also with a metallic lustre .

 Caesium metal is highly reactive and very pyrophoric . In addition to igniting spontaneously in air , it reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures , more so than other members of the first group of the periodic table . The reaction with solid water occurs at temperatures as low as − 116 ° C ( − 177 ° F ) . Because of its high reactivity , the metal is classified as a hazardous material . It is stored and shipped in dry saturated hydrocarbons , such as mineral oil . Similarly , it must be handled under inert gas , such as argon . However , a caesium @-@ water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium @-@ water explosion with a similar amount of sodium . This is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water , leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate . Caesium can be stored in vacuum @-@ sealed borosilicate glass ampoules . In quantities of more than about 100 grams ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) , caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed , stainless steel containers . 
 The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals , but is more closely similar to that of rubidium , the element above caesium in the periodic table . As expected for an alkali metal , its only common oxidation state is + 1 . Some small differences arise from the fact that it has a higher atomic mass and is more electropositive than other ( nonradioactive ) alkali metals . Caesium is the most electropositive chemical element . The caesium ion is also larger and less " hard " than those of the lighter alkali metals . 
 = = = Compounds = = = 
 The vast majority of caesium compounds contain the element as the cation Cs + , which binds ionically to a wide variety of anions . One noteworthy exception is provided by the <unk> anion ( Cs − ) . Other exceptions include the several suboxides ( see section on oxides below ) . 
 Returning to more normal compounds , salts of Cs + are almost invariably colourless unless the anion itself is coloured . Many of the simple salts are hygroscopic , but less so than the corresponding salts of the lighter alkali metals . The phosphate , acetate , carbonate , halides , oxide , nitrate , and sulfate salts are water @-@ soluble . Double salts are often less soluble , and the low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in the purification of Cs from its ores . The double salt with antimony ( such as <unk> 
 4 ) , bismuth , cadmium , copper , iron , and lead are also poorly soluble . 
 Caesium hydroxide ( CsOH ) is hygroscopic and a very strong base . It rapidly etches the surface of semiconductors such as silicon . CsOH has been previously regarded by chemists as the " strongest base " , reflecting the relatively weak attraction between the large Cs + ion and OH − ; it is indeed the strongest Arrhenius base , but a number of compounds that cannot exist in aqueous solution , such as n @-@ butyllithium and sodium amide , are more basic . 
 A stoichiometric mixture of caesium and gold will react to form yellow caesium auride ( Cs + Au − ) upon heating . The auride anion here behaves as a pseudohalogen . The compound reacts violently with water , yielding caesium hydroxide , metallic gold , and hydrogen gas ; in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium @-@ specific ion exchange resin to produce <unk> auride . The analogous platinum compound , the red caesium platinide ( <unk> ) , contains the platinide ion that behaves as a <unk> . 
 = = = = Complexes = = = = 
 Like all metal cations , Cs + forms complexes with Lewis bases in solution . Because of its large size , Cs + usually adopts coordination numbers greater than six @-@ coordination , which is typical for the lighter alkali metal cations . This trend is already apparent by the 8 @-@ coordination in CsCl , vs. the halite motif adopted by the other alkali metal chlorides . Its high coordination number and softness ( tendency to form covalent bonds ) are the basis of the separation of Cs + from other cations , as is practiced in the remediation of nuclear wastes , where 137Cs + is separated from large amounts of nonradioactive K + . 
 = = = = Halides = = = = 
 Caesium fluoride ( CsF ) is a hygroscopic white solid that is widely used in organofluorine chemistry as a source of the fluoride anion . Caesium fluoride has the halite structure , which means that the Cs + and F − pack in a cubic closest packed array as do Na + and Cl − in sodium chloride . It is noteworthy as caesium and fluorine have the lowest and highest electronegativities respectively among all the known elements . 
 Caesium chloride ( CsCl ) crystallizes in the simple cubic crystal system . Also called the " caesium chloride structure " , this structural motif is composed of a primitive cubic lattice with a two @-@ atom basis , each with an eightfold coordination ; the chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube , while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the center of the cubes . This structure is shared with <unk> and CsI , and many other compounds that do not contain Cs . In contrast , most other alkaline halides adopt the sodium chloride ( NaCl ) structure . The CsCl structure is preferred because Cs + has an ionic radius of 174 pm and Cl − 181 pm . 
 = = = = Oxides = = = = 
 More so than the other alkali metals , caesium forms numerous binary compounds with oxygen . When caesium burns in air , the superoxide CsO 
 2 is the main product . The " normal " caesium oxide ( Cs 
 2O ) forms yellow @-@ orange hexagonal crystals , and is the only oxide of the anti @-@ <unk> 
 2 type . It vaporizes at 250 ° C ( 482 ° F ) , and decomposes to caesium metal and the peroxide Cs 
 2O 
 2 at temperatures above 400 ° C ( 752 ° F ) . Aside from the superoxide and the <unk> CsO 
 3 , several brightly coloured suboxides have also been studied . These include Cs 
 7O , Cs 
 4O , Cs 
 <unk> 
 3 , Cs 
 3O ( dark @-@ green ) , CsO , Cs

 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Caesium has a total of 39 known isotopes that range in their mass number ( i.e. number of nucleons in its nucleus ) from 112 to 151 . Several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by the slow neutron capture process ( S @-@ process ) inside old stars , as well as inside supernova explosions ( R @-@ process ) . However , the only stable caesium isotope is 133Cs , which has 78 neutrons . Although it has a large nuclear spin ( 7 / 2 + ) , nuclear magnetic resonance studies can be done with this isotope at a resonating frequency of 11 @.@ 7 MHz . 
 The radioactive 135Cs has a very long half @-@ life of about 2 @.@ 3 million years , longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium . 137Cs and 134Cs have half @-@ lives of 30 and two years , respectively . 137Cs decomposes to a short @-@ lived <unk> by beta decay , and then to nonradioactive barium , while 134Cs transforms into <unk> directly . The isotopes with mass numbers of 129 , 131 , 132 and 136 , have half @-@ lives between a day and two weeks , while most of the other isotopes have half @-@ lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second . There are at least 21 metastable nuclear isomers . Other than <unk> ( with a half @-@ life of just under 3 hours ) , all are very unstable and decay with half @-@ lives of a few minutes or less . 
 The isotope 135Cs is one of the long @-@ lived fission products of uranium which form in nuclear reactors . However , its fission product yield is reduced in most reactors because its predecessor , 135Xe , is an extremely potent neutron poison and transmutes frequently to stable 136Xe before it can decay to 135Cs . 
 Because of its beta decay ( to <unk> ) , 137Cs is a strong emitter of gamma radiation . Its half @-@ life makes it the principal medium @-@ lived fission product along with 90Sr — both are responsible for radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use . For example , 137Cs together with 90Sr currently generate the largest source of radioactivity generated in the area around the Chernobyl disaster . It is not feasible to dispose of 137Cs through neutron capture ( due to the low capture rate ) and as a result it must be allowed to decay . 
 Almost all caesium produced from nuclear fission comes from beta decay of originally more neutron @-@ rich fission products , passing through various isotopes of iodine and of xenon . Because iodine and xenon are volatile and can diffuse through nuclear fuel or air , radioactive caesium is often created far from the original site of fission . With the commencement of nuclear weapons testing around 1945 , 137Cs was released into the atmosphere and then returned to the surface of the earth as a component of radioactive fallout . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Caesium is a relatively rare element as it is estimated to average approximately 3 parts per million in the Earth 's crust . This makes it the 45th most abundant of all elements and the 36th of all the metals . Nevertheless , it is more abundant than such elements as antimony , cadmium , tin and tungsten , and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury or silver , but 3 @.@ 3 % as abundant as rubidium — with which it is so closely associated , chemically . 
 Due to its large ionic radius , caesium is one of the " incompatible elements " . During magma crystallization , caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last . Therefore , the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process . Because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as does rubidium , the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite ( KCl ) and carnallite ( <unk> 
 3 · 6H 
 2O ) may contain only 0 @.@ 002 % caesium . Consequently , Cs is found in few minerals . Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl ( Be 
 <unk> 
 2 ( SiO 
 3 ) 
 6 ) and <unk> ( ( K , Cs ) BF 
 4 ) , up to 15 wt % <unk> in the closely related mineral <unk> ( Cs ( <unk> ) <unk> ) , up to 8 @.@ 4 wt % <unk> in the rare mineral <unk> ( ( Cs , K ) Al 
 4Be 
 4 ( B , Be ) 
 12O 
 28 ) , and less in the more widespread <unk> . The only economically important source mineral for caesium is pollucite Cs ( <unk> 
 2O 
 6 ) , which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites , and is associated with the more commercially important lithium minerals lepidolite and petalite . Within the pegmatites , the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals create high @-@ grade ore for mining . 
 One of the world 's most significant and richest sources of the metal is the Tanco Mine at Bernic Lake in Manitoba , Canada . The deposits there are estimated to contain 350 @,@ 000 metric tons of pollucite ore , which represent more than two @-@ thirds of the world 's reserve base . Although the stoichiometric content of caesium in pollucite is 42 @.@ 6 % , pure pollucite samples from this deposit contain only about 34 % caesium , while the average content is 24 wt % . Commercial pollucite contains over 19 % caesium . The <unk> pegmatite deposit in Zimbabwe is mined for its petalite , but it also contains a significant amount of pollucite . Notable amounts of pollucite are also mined in the <unk> Desert , Namibia . At the present rate of world mine production of 5 to 10 metric tons per year , reserves will last for thousands of years . 
 = = Production = = 
 The mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations . The ore is crushed , hand @-@ sorted , but not usually concentrated , and then ground . Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods : acid digestion , alkaline decomposition , and direct reduction . 
 In the acid digestion , the silicate pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids , such as hydrochloric ( HCl ) , sulfuric ( H 
 2SO 
 4 ) , hydrobromic ( HBr ) , or hydrofluoric ( HF ) acids . With hydrochloric acid , a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced , and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride ( Cs 
 <unk> 
 7 ) , caesium iodine chloride ( Cs 
 <unk> ) , or caesium <unk> ( Cs 
 2 ( <unk> 
 6 ) ) . After separation , the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed , and pure CsCl is obtained after evaporating the water . The method using sulfuric acid yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium alum ( <unk> ( SO 
 4 ) 
 2 · 12H 
 2O ) . The aluminium sulfate in it is converted to the insoluble aluminium oxide by roasting the alum with carbon , and the resulting product is leached with water to yield a Cs 
 2SO 
 4 solution . 
 The roasting of pollucite with calcium carbonate and calcium chloride yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride . Leaching with water or dilute ammonia ( NH 
 <unk> ) yields then a dilute chloride ( CsCl ) solution . This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate . Albeit not commercially feasible , direct reduction of the ore with potassium , sodium or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly . 
 Most of the mined caesium ( as salts ) is directly converted into caesium formate ( HCOO − Cs + ) for applications such as oil drilling . To supply the developing market , Cabot Corporation built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba , with a capacity of 12 @,@ 000 barrels ( 1 @,@ 900 m3 ) per year of caesium formate solution . The primary smaller @-@ scale commercial compounds of caesium are caesium chloride and its nitrate . 
 Alternatively , caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore . Caesium chloride , and the other caesium halides , as well , can be reduced at 700 to 800 ° C ( 1 @,@ 292 to 1 @,@ 472 ° F ) with calcium or barium , followed by distillation of the caesium metal . In the same way , the aluminate , carbonate , or hydroxide may be reduced by magnesium . The metal can also be isolated by electrolysis of fused caesium cyanide ( <unk> ) . Exceptionally pure and gas @-@ free caesium can be made by the thermal decomposition at 390 ° C ( 734 ° F ) of caesium azide <unk> 
 3 , which is produced from aqueous caesium sulfate and barium azide . In vacuum applications , caesium dichromate can be reacted with zirconium forming pure caesium metal without other gaseous products .

 = = History = = 
 In 1860 , Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from Dürkheim , Germany . Due to the bright blue lines in its emission spectrum , they chose a name derived from the Latin word <unk> , meaning sky @-@ blue . Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically , only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff . 
 To obtain a pure sample of caesium , 44 @,@ 000 litres ( 9 @,@ 700 imp gal ; 12 @,@ 000 US gal ) of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield 240 kilograms ( 530 lb ) of concentrated salt solution . The alkaline earth metals were precipitated either as sulfates or oxalates , leaving the alkali metal in the solution . After conversion to the nitrates and extraction with ethanol , a sodium @-@ free mixture was obtained . From this mixture , the lithium was precipitated by ammonium carbonate . Potassium , rubidium and caesium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid , but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water . Therefore , the less @-@ soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ( ( Cs , Rb ) <unk> ) could be obtained by fractional crystallization . After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen , caesium and rubidium could be separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol . The process yielded 9 @.@ 2 grams ( 0 @.@ 32 oz ) of rubidium chloride and 7 @.@ 3 grams ( 0 @.@ 26 oz ) of caesium chloride from the initial 44 @,@ 000 liters of mineral water . 
 The two scientists used the caesium chloride thus obtained to estimate the atomic weight of the new element at 123 @.@ 35 ( compared to the currently accepted one of 132 @.@ 9 ) . They tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride , but instead of a metal , they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which " neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope " showed the slightest trace of metallic substance " ; as a result , they assigned it as a <unk> ( Cs 
 2Cl ) . In reality , the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and caesium chloride . The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury anode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under the aqueous conditions . The pure metal was eventually isolated by the German chemist Carl <unk> while working on his doctorate with Kekulé and Bunsen . In 1882 , he produced caesium metal by <unk> caesium cyanide , and thus avoiding the problems with the chloride . 
 Historically , the most important use for caesium has been in research and development , primarily in chemical and electrical fields . Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s , when it came to be used in radio vacuum tubes . It had two functions ; as a getter , it removed excess oxygen after manufacture , and as a coating on the heated cathode , it increased its electrical conductivity . Caesium did not become recognized as a high @-@ performance industrial metal until the 1950s . Applications of nonradioactive caesium included photoelectric cells , photomultiplier tubes , optical components of infrared spectrophotometers , catalysts for several organic reactions , crystals for scintillation counters , and in magnetohydrodynamic power generators . Caesium also was , and still is , used as a source of positive ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) . 
 Since 1967 , the International System of Measurements has based its unit of time , the second , on the properties of caesium . The International System of Units ( SI ) defines the second as the duration of 9 @,@ 192 @,@ 631 @,@ 770 cycles at the microwave frequency of the spectral line corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine energy levels of the ground state of caesium @-@ 133 . The 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures of 1967 defined a second as : " the duration of 9 @,@ 192 @,@ 631 @,@ 770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium @-@ 133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields " .

 The largest current end @-@ use of nonradioactive caesium is in caesium formate @-@ based drilling fluids for the extractive oil industry . Aqueous solutions of caesium formate ( HCOO − Cs + ) — made by reacting caesium hydroxide with formic acid — were developed in the mid @-@ 1990s for use as oil well drilling and completion fluids . The function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits , to bring rock cuttings to the surface , and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well . Completion fluids assist the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining the pressure . 
 The high density of the caesium formate brine ( up to 2 @.@ 3 g · cm − 3 , or 19 @.@ 2 pounds per gallon ) , coupled with the relatively benign nature of most caesium compounds , reduces the requirement for toxic high @-@ density suspended solids in the drilling fluid — a significant technological , engineering and environmental advantage . Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids , caesium formate is relatively environment @-@ friendly . The caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium <unk> to decrease the density of the fluids down to that of water ( 1 @.@ 0 g · cm − 3 , or 8 @.@ 3 pounds per gallon ) . Furthermore , it is biodegradable and reclaimable , and may be recycled , which is important in view of its high cost ( about $ 4 @,@ 000 per barrel in 2001 ) . Alkali <unk> are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative , high @-@ density brines ( such as zinc bromide ZnBr 
 2 solutions ) sometimes do ; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs .

The first accurate caesium clock was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK . They have been improved repeatedly over the past half @-@ century , and form the basis for standards @-@ compliant time and frequency measurements , and have been regarded as " the most accurate realization of a unit that mankind has yet achieved . " These clocks measure frequency with an error of 2 to 3 parts in 1014 , which would correspond to a time measurement accuracy of 2 nanoseconds per day , or one second in 1 @.@ 4 million years . The latest versions are accurate to better than 1 part in 1015 , which means they would be off by about 1 second in 20 million years , . Caesium clocks are also used in networks that oversee the timing of cell phone transmissions and the information flow on the Internet . 
 = = = Electric power and electronics = = = 
 Caesium vapour thermionic generators are low @-@ power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy . In the two @-@ electrode vacuum tube converter , it neutralizes the space charge that builds up near the cathode , and in doing so , it enhances the current flow . 
 Caesium is also important for its <unk> properties by which light energy is converted to electron flow . It is used in photoelectric cells because caesium @-@ based cathodes , such as the intermetallic compound K 
 <unk> , have low threshold voltage for emission of electrons . The range of <unk> devices using caesium include optical character recognition devices , photomultiplier tubes , and video camera tubes . Nevertheless , germanium , rubidium , selenium , silicon , tellurium , and several other elements can substitute caesium in photosensitive materials . 
 Caesium iodide ( CsI ) , bromide ( <unk> ) and caesium fluoride ( CsF ) crystals are employed for scintillators in scintillation counters widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research , as they are well @-@ suited for the detection of gamma and X @-@ ray radiation . Caesium , being a heavy element , provides good stopping power , contributing to better <unk> . Caesium compounds may also provide a faster response ( CsF ) and be less hygroscopic ( CsI ) . 
 Caesium vapor is used in many common magnetometers . The element is also used as an internal standard in spectrophotometry . Like other alkali metals , caesium has a great affinity for oxygen and is used as a " getter " in vacuum tubes . Other uses of the metal include high @-@ energy lasers , vapour glow lamps , and vapor rectifiers . 
 = = = <unk> fluids = = = 
 Because of their high density , solutions of caesium chloride , caesium sulfate , and caesium <unk> ( Cs ( O 
 <unk> 
 3 ) ) are commonly used in molecular biology for density gradient ultracentrifugation . This technology is primarily applied to the isolation of viral particles , subcellular organelles and fractions , and nucleic acids from biological samples . 
 = = = Chemical and medical use = = = 
 There are relatively few chemical applications for caesium . Doping with caesium compounds is used to enhance the effectiveness of several metal @-@ ion catalysts used in the production of chemicals , such as acrylic acid , anthraquinone , ethylene oxide , methanol , <unk> anhydride , styrene , methyl <unk> monomers , and various olefins . It is also used in the catalytic conversion of sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide in the production of sulfuric acid . 
 Caesium fluoride enjoys niche use in organic chemistry as a base , or as an anhydrous source of fluoride ion . Caesium salts sometimes replace potassium or sodium salts in organic synthesis , such as <unk> , esterification , and polymerization . It has also been used in thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry ( TLD ) : When exposed to radiation , it acquires crystal defects that , when heated , revert with emission of light proportionate to the received dose . Thus , measuring the light pulse with a photomultiplier tube can allow the accumulated radiation dose to be quantified . 
 = = = Nuclear and isotope applications = = = 
 Caesium @-@ 137 is a very common radioisotope used as a gamma @-@ emitter in industrial applications . Its advantages include a half @-@ life of roughly 30 years , its availability from the nuclear fuel cycle , and having <unk> as a stable end product . The high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool <unk> for food and medical supplies . It has been used in agriculture , cancer treatment , and the sterilization of food , sewage sludge , and surgical equipment . Radioactive isotopes of caesium in radiation devices were used in the medical field to treat certain types of cancer , but emergence of better alternatives and the use of water @-@ soluble caesium chloride in the sources , which could create wide @-@ ranging contamination , gradually put some of these caesium sources out of use . Caesium @-@ 137 has been employed in a variety of industrial measurement gauges , including moisture , density , leveling , and thickness gauges . It has also been used in well logging devices for measuring the electron density of the rock formations , which is analogous to the bulk density of the formations . 
 Isotope 137 has also been used in hydrologic studies analogous to those using tritium . It is a daughter product of nuclear fission reactions . With the commencement of nuclear testing around 1945 , and continuing through the mid @-@ 1980s , caesium @-@ 137 was released into the atmosphere , where it is absorbed readily into solution . Known year @-@ to @-@ year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers . Caesium @-@ 134 , and to a lesser extent caesium @-@ 135 , have also been used in hydrology as a measure of caesium output by the nuclear power industry . While they are less prevalent than either caesium @-@ 133 or caesium @-@ 137 , these isotopes have the advantage of being produced solely from anthropogenic sources . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early ion engines designed for spacecraft propulsion on very long interplanetary or <unk> missions . The ionization method was to strip the outer electron from the propellant upon contact with a tungsten electrode that had voltage applied . Concerns about the corrosive action of caesium on spacecraft components have pushed development in the direction of the use of inert gas propellants , such as xenon ; this is easier to handle in ground @-@ based tests and has less potential to interfere with the spacecraft . Eventually , xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft Deep Space 1 launched in 1998 . Nevertheless , Field Emission Electric Propulsion thrusters which use a simple system of accelerating liquid metal ions such as of caesium to create thrust have been built . 
 Caesium nitrate is used as an oxidizer and pyrotechnic colorant to burn silicon in infrared flares , such as the <unk> @-@ 19 flare , because it emits much of its light in the near infrared spectrum . Caesium has been used to reduce the radar signature of exhaust plumes in the SR @-@ 71 Blackbird military aircraft . Caesium , along with rubidium , has been added as a carbonate to glass because it reduces electrical conductivity and improves stability and durability of fibre optics and night vision devices . Caesium fluoride or caesium aluminium fluoride are used in fluxes formulated for the brazing of aluminium alloys that contain magnesium . 
 <unk> ( MHD ) power @-@ generating systems were researched , but failed to gain widespread acceptance . Caesium metal has also been considered as the working fluid in high @-@ temperature Rankine cycle <unk> generators . Caesium salts have been evaluated as <unk> reagents to be used following the administration of <unk> drugs . Because of their effect on heart rhythms , however , they are less likely to be used than potassium or rubidium salts . They have also been used to treat epilepsy . 
 = = Health and safety hazards = = 
 <unk> caesium compounds are only mildly toxic . Exposure to large amounts can cause <unk> and spasms , due to the chemical similarity of caesium to potassium , but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard . The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2 @.@ 3 g per kilogram , which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride . However , in large quantities caesium competes with potassium in various biological processes . Accordingly , excess <unk> intake can lead to hypokalemia , <unk> , and acute cardiac arrest . The principal use of nonradioactive caesium , as caesium formate in petroleum drilling fluids , takes advantage of its low toxicity compared to less costly alternatives . 
 Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly explosive when it comes in contact with water . The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time , causing ignition and a violent explosion . This can occur with other alkali metals , but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can even be triggered by cold water . The autoignition temperature of caesium is also − 116 ° C , so it is highly pyrophoric , and ignites explosively in air to form caesium hydroxide and various oxides . Caesium hydroxide is a very strong base , and will rapidly corrode glass . 
 The isotopes 134 and 137 are present in the biosphere in small amounts from human activities and which differs between locations . <unk> does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products ( such as radioiodine and <unk> ) . About 10 % of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine . The remaining 90 % has a biological half @-@ life between 50 and 150 days . <unk> follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues , including fruits and vegetables . Plants absorb caesium differently , some do not absorb it much , and some take it large amounts , sometimes displaying great resistance to it . It is also well @-@ documented that mushrooms from contaminated forests accumulate radiocaesium ( caesium @-@ 137 ) in their fungal sporocarps . Accumulation of caesium @-@ 137 in lakes has been a high concern after the Chernobyl disaster . Experiments with dogs showed that a single dose of 3 @.@ 8 millicuries ( 140 MBq , 4 @.@ 1 μg of caesium @-@ 137 ) per kilogram is lethal within three weeks ; smaller amounts may cause infertility and cancer . The International Atomic Energy Agency and other sources have warned that radioactive materials , such as caesium @-@ 137 , could be used in radiological dispersion devices , or " dirty bombs " .

 = Manchester computers = 
 The Manchester computers were an innovative series of stored @-@ program electronic computers developed during the 30 @-@ year period between 1947 and 1977 by a small team at the University of Manchester , under the leadership of Tom Kilburn . They included the world 's first stored @-@ program computer , the world 's first transistorised computer , and what was the world 's fastest computer at the time of its inauguration in 1962 . 
 The project began with two aims : to prove the practicality of the Williams tube , an early form of computer memory based on standard cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) ; and to construct a machine that could be used to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems . The first of the series , the Small @-@ Scale Experimental Machine ( SSEM ) , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 . As the world 's first stored @-@ program computer , the SSEM , and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it , quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government , who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version . The resulting machine , the Ferranti Mark 1 , was the world 's first commercially available general @-@ purpose computer . 
 The collaboration with Ferranti eventually led to an industrial partnership with the computer company ICL , who made use of many of the ideas developed at the university , particularly in the design of their 2900 series of computers during the 1970s . 
 = = Small @-@ Scale Experimental Machine ( SSEM ) = = 
 The Manchester Small @-@ Scale Experimental Machine ( SSEM ) , also known as the Baby , was designed as a test @-@ bed for the Williams tube , an early form of computer memory , rather than as a practical computer . Work on the machine began in 1947 , and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program , consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 ( 262 @,@ 144 ) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards . The program ran for 52 minutes before producing the correct answer of 131 @,@ 072 . 
 The SSEM was 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) in length , 7 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 24 m ) tall , and weighed almost 1 long ton . It contained 550 thermionic valves – 300 diodes and 250 <unk> – and had a power consumption of 3 @.@ 5 kilowatts . Its successful operation was reported in a letter to the journal Nature published in September 1948 , establishing it as the world 's first stored @-@ program computer . It quickly evolved into a more practical machine , the Manchester Mark 1 . 
 = = Manchester Mark 1 = = 
 Development of the Manchester Mark 1 began in August 1948 , with the initial aim of providing the university with a more realistic computing facility . In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of the prototype , and was so impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine , the Ferranti Mark 1 . 
 Two versions of the Manchester Mark 1 were produced , the first of which , the Intermediary Version , was operational by April 1949 . The Final Specification machine , which was fully working by October 1949 , contained 4 @,@ 050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts . Perhaps the Manchester Mark 1 's most significant innovation was its incorporation of index registers , commonplace on modern computers . 
 = = Meg and Mercury = = 
 As a result of experience gained from the Mark 1 , the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths . They therefore embarked on the design of a new machine which would include a floating point unit ; work began in 1951 . The resulting machine , which ran its first program in May 1954 , was known as Meg , or the <unk> machine . It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1 , as well as quicker at solving maths problems . Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury , in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory . 
 = = Transistor Computer = = 
 Work on building a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952 , in parallel with Meg 's ongoing development . Two of Kilburn 's team , R. L. <unk> and D. C. Webb , were assigned to the task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves . Initially the only devices available were germanium point @-@ contact transistors , less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power . 
 Two versions of the machine were produced . The first was the world 's first transistorised computer , and became operational in November 1953 . The second version was completed in April 1955 . The 1955 version used 200 transistors , 1 @,@ 300 solid @-@ state diodes , and had a power consumption of 150 watts . The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory , so it was not the first completely transistorised computer , a distinction that went to the Harwell <unk> of 1955 . 
 Problems with the reliability of early batches of transistors meant that the machine 's mean time between failures was about 90 minutes , which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available . The Transistor Computer 's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan @-@ Vickers in their Metrovick 950 , in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors . Six Metrovick 950s were built , the first completed in 1956 . They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years . 
 = = Muse and Atlas = = 
 Development of MUSE – a name derived from " microsecond engine " – began at the university in 1956 . The aim was to build a computer that could operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction , one million instructions per second . Mu ( or µ ) is a prefix in the SI and other systems of units denoting a factor of 10 − 6 ( one millionth ) . 
 At the end of 1958 Ferranti agreed to collaborate with Manchester University on the project , and the computer was shortly afterwards renamed Atlas , with the joint venture under the control of Tom Kilburn . The first Atlas was officially commissioned on 7 December 1962 , and was considered at that time to be the most powerful computer in the world , equivalent to four IBM <unk> . It was said that whenever Atlas went offline half of the UK 's computer capacity was lost . Its fastest instructions took 1 @.@ 59 microseconds to execute , and the machine 's use of virtual storage and paging allowed each concurrent user to have up to one million words of storage space available . Atlas pioneered many hardware and software concepts still in common use today including the Atlas Supervisor , " considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system " . 
 Two other machines were built : one for a joint British Petroleum / University of London consortium , and the other for the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton near Oxford . A derivative system was built by Ferranti for Cambridge University , called the Titan or Atlas 2 , which had a different memory organisation , and ran a time @-@ sharing operating system developed by Cambridge Computer Laboratory . 
 The University of Manchester 's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971 , but the last was in service until 1974 . Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh . 
 = = MU5 = = 
 MU5 was designed to be about 20 times faster than Atlas , and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand @-@ written machine code , something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently . A major factor in the MU5 's much @-@ improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory , which greatly speeded up access to its main store . . 
 Work on MU5 started in 1966 . The Science Research Council ( SRC ) awarded Manchester University a five @-@ year grant of £ 630 @,@ 466 in 1968 ( equivalent to about £ 9 @.@ 9 million as of 2016 ) to develop the MU5 , and ICL made its production facilities available to the university . Development began in 1969 , and by 1971 the design team had grown from its initial nucleus of six members of the university 's computer science department to 16 , supported by 25 research students and 19 ICL engineers . 
 MU5 was fully operational by October 1974 , coinciding with ICL 's announcement that it was working on the development of a new range of computers , the 2900 series . ICL 's <unk> in particular , first delivered in June 1975 , owed a great deal to the design of MU5 , which was in operation at the university until 1982 . 
 = = MU6 = = 
 MU5 was the last large @-@ scale machine to be designed and built at Manchester University . The development of its successor , MU6 , was funded by a grant of £ 219 @,@ 300 awarded by the SRC in 1979 ( equivalent to about £ 1 @,@ 001 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . MU6 was intended to be a range of processors with MU6 @-@ V at the top end and a personal processor , MU6 @-@ P , at the bottom . Only MU6 @-@ P and a mid @-@ range processor , MU6 @-@ G , were ever produced , and ran between 1982 and 1987 . The university did not have the resources to build the remaining machines in @-@ house , and the system was never commercially developed .

 Roseanne Cherrie Barr ( born November 3 , 1952 ) is an American actress , comedian , writer , television producer , director , and 2012 presidential nominee of the California @-@ based Peace and Freedom Party . Barr began her career in stand @-@ up comedy at clubs before gaining fame for her role in the classic sitcom Roseanne . The show was a hit and lasted nine seasons , from 1988 to 1997 . She won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show . Barr had crafted a " fierce working @-@ class domestic goddess " persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism . 
 The granddaughter of immigrants from Europe and Russia , Barr was the oldest of four children in a working @-@ class Jewish Salt Lake City family ; she was also active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS Church ) . In 1974 , she married Bill Pentland , with whom she had three children , before divorcing in 1990 and marrying comedian Tom Arnold for four years . Controversy arose when she sang " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " off @-@ key at a 1990 nationally aired baseball game , followed by grabbing her crotch and spitting . 
 After her sitcom ended , she launched her own talk show , The Roseanne Show , which aired from 1998 to 2000 . In 2005 , she returned to stand @-@ up comedy with a world tour . In 2011 , she starred in an unscripted TV show , Roseanne 's Nuts , that lasted from July to September of that year , about her life on a Hawaiian farm . 
 In early 2012 , Barr announced her candidacy for the presidential nomination of the Green Party . Barr lost the nomination to Jill Stein . She then sought the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party , which she won on August 4 , 2012 . Barr received 61 @,@ 971 votes in the general election , placing sixth overall .

 Barr was born in Salt Lake City , to a working @-@ class Jewish family . She is the oldest of four children born to Helen ( née Davis ) , a bookkeeper and cashier , and Jerome Hershel " Jerry " Barr , who worked as a salesman . Her father 's family were Jewish immigrants from Russia , and her maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Austria @-@ Hungary and Lithuania , respectively . Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from " <unk> " to " Barr " upon entering the United States . 
 Her Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother . Barr 's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints . Barr has stated , " Friday , Saturday , and Sunday morning I was a Jew ; Sunday afternoon , Tuesday afternoon , and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons " . When Barr was three years old , she got Bell 's palsy on the left side of her face . Barr said , " [ so ] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me , but nothing happened . Then my mother got a Mormon preacher , he prayed , and I was miraculously cured " . Years later Barr learned that Bell 's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came " exactly at the right time " . At six years old , Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group . 
 At 16 , Barr was hit by a car that left her with a traumatic brain injury . Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital . In 1970 , when Barr was 18 years old , she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks , but never returned .

In 1986 , she performed on Late Night with David Letterman and the following year had her own HBO special called The Roseanne Barr Show , which earned her an American Comedy Award for the funniest female performer in a television special . Barr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in Married ... with Children but turned it down . In her routine she popularized the phrase , " domestic goddess , " to refer to a homemaker or housewife . The success of her act led to her own series on ABC , called Roseanne .

 In 1987 , The Cosby Show executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a " no @-@ perks family comedy " to television . They hired Cosby writer Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner . The show premiered on October 18 , 1988 and was watched by 21 @.@ 4 million households , making it the highest @-@ rated debut of that season . 
 Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of Roseanne and noticed that in the credits , Williams was listed as creator . She told Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly , " We built the show around my actual life and my kids . The ' domestic goddess ' , the whole thing " . In the same interview , Werner said , " I don 't think Roseanne , to this day , understands that this is something legislated by the Writers Guild , and it 's part of what every show has to deal with . They 're the final arbiters . " During the first season , Barr sought more creative control over the show , opposing Williams ' authority . Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set . She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave . ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode . 
 Roseanne ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997 . Barr won an Emmy , a Golden Globe , a Kids Choice Award , and three American Comedy Awards for her part in the show . For the final two seasons , Barr earned $ 40 million , making her the second @-@ highest @-@ paid woman in show business at the time , after Oprah Winfrey . 
 Barbara Ehrenreich called Barr a working @-@ class spokesperson representing " the hopeless underclass of the female sex : polyester @-@ clad , overweight occupants of the slow track ; fast @-@ food waitresses , factory workers , housewives , members of the invisible pink @-@ collar army ; the despised , the jilted , the underpaid , " but a master of " the kind of class @-@ militant populism that the Democrats , most of them anyway , never seem to get right . " Barr refuses to use the term " blue collar " because it masks the issue of class . 
 During Roseanne 's final season , Barr was in negotiations between Carsey @-@ Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin @-@ off . However , after failed discussions with ABC , and later CBS and Fox , Carsey @-@ Werner and Barr agreed not to go on with the negotiations . 
 Barr gave Amy Sherman @-@ Palladino and Joss Whedon their first writing jobs on Roseanne . She released her autobiography in 1989 , titled Roseanne — My Life As a Woman . That same year , she made her film debut in She @-@ Devil , playing Ruth . Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying , " Barr could have made an easy , predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years . Instead , she took her chances with an ambitious project – a real movie . It pays off , in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona , a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride , and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting " . 
 In 1991 , she voiced the baby , Julie , in Look Who 's Talking Too . She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress . She appeared three times on Saturday Night Live from 1991 to 1994 , co @-@ hosting with then @-@ husband Tom Arnold in 1992 . In 1994 , she released a second book , My Lives . That same year , Barr became the first female comedian to host the MTV Video Music Awards on her own . She remained the only to have done so until comedian Chelsea Handler hosted in 2010 . In 1997 , she made guest appearances on 3rd Rock from the Sun and The Nanny . 
 In 1998 , she portrayed the Wicked Witch of the West in a production of The Wizard of Oz at Madison Square Garden . That same year , Barr hosted her own talk show , The Roseanne Show , which ran for two years before it was canceled in 2000 . In the summer of 2003 , she took on the dual role of hosting a cooking show called Domestic Goddess and starring in a reality show called The Real Roseanne Show about hosting a cooking show . Although 13 episodes were in production , a hysterectomy brought a premature end to both projects . In 2004 , she voiced Maggie , one of the main characters in the animated film Home on the Range .

 Barr released her third book , <unk> : Dispatches from the Nut Farm , in January 2011 . She appeared in 2011 on a Super Bowl XLV commercial for Snickers along with comedian Richard Lewis . It was the most popular ad based on the number of TiVo users rewinding and watching it over . Roseanne 's Nuts , a reality show featuring Barr , boyfriend Johnny Argent , and son Jake as they run a macadamia nut and livestock farm in Big Island , Hawaii was broadcast by Lifetime Television in July 2011 , and cancelled in September of that year . 
 In August 2011 , it was reported that Barr was working on a new sitcom with 20th Century Fox Television tentatively titled <unk> Mobile . Steven Greener , who also executive produced her reality show Roseanne 's Nuts , will also executive produce the sitcom . Eric Gilliland is attached as co @-@ creator , writer and executive producer ; Gilliland was also a writer on Barr 's previous sitcom Roseanne . The show will be set in a mobile home community and use a multiple @-@ camera setup . In October 2011 , NBC picked up the show . A pilot was filmed but initially ended up being shelved by the network . Barr blames her " Progressive politics " as being the sole reason behind the pilot 's rejection . Barr states that she was notified that the show would not be picked up due to its being labeled " too polarizing " by network executives . In an interview with <unk> , Barr revealed that the show had been axed only to announce three hours later that she had just received a phone call saying that NBC had not given up on the project completely . The show could end up as an NBC midseason replacement . Barr hopes she 's given the opportunity to retool the show . 
 Barr was " roasted " by Comedy Central in August 2012 . Barr 's former spouse , Tom Arnold , had claimed that he would not be appearing , but he ended up doing so . 
 In the summer of 2014 Barr joined <unk> Ivory Wayans and Russell Peters as a judge on Last Comic Standing on NBC . 
 On November 28 , 2014 , Barr 's series , <unk> : When Moms Go Bad debuted on the Investigation Discovery cable network , a network that she says she 's a ' little obsessed with . ' Barr hosts the show as herself .

Following her rendition , she mimicked the often @-@ seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup . Barr claimed she had been encouraged by baseball officials to " bring humor to the song " . The song and the closing routine received heavy media attention and offended many , including President George H. W. Bush , who called her rendition " disgraceful . " Barr would revisit this incident during her Comedy Central Roast in 2012 , wherein she once again belted out the last few bars of the national anthem , without screeching .

 In 2014 , the parents of George Zimmerman , a neighborhood watch coordinator who is known for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin but was later acquitted of second degree murder and manslaughter , filed a lawsuit against Barr for tweeting their home address and phone number on March 29 , 2012 . Barr allegedly tweeted " At first I thought it was good to let <unk> know that no one can hide anymore ... If Zimmerman isn 't arrested I 'll rt his address <unk> maybe go 2 his house myself . " Zimmerman 's parents allege that Barr sought to " cause a lynch mob to descend " on their home . The Seminole County Circuit Court complaint sought more than $ 15 @,@ 000 for emotional distress and invasion of privacy . In August 2015 , summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr . 
 = = 2012 Presidential campaign = = 
 On August 5 , 2011 , Barr appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and announced her candidacy for president in the 2012 presidential election , running on the " Green Tea Party " ticket . Her candidacy mixed attention to economics , personal health and meditation . She also said that she is running for Prime Minister of Israel . In an interview with The Jewish Daily Forward she invoked tikkun olam in her support of bringing women into politics and religion . On September 19 , 2011 , she appeared at the Occupy Wall Street protests and spoke in support of the protestors . She further stated that any " guilty " Wall Street bankers should be forced to give up any income over $ 100 million , be sent to re @-@ education camps , or be executed by beheading if they resisted . Barr filed with the Federal Election Commission as a Green Party presidential candidate in January 2012 . She formally announced her candidacy for the party 's 2012 presidential nomination on February 2 , 2012 . 
 On July 14 , 2012 , Barr came in second , losing the nomination to Jill Stein . Stein chose Cheri <unk> as her running @-@ mate despite suggestions that she could choose Barr . Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore , Maryland , but decided to instead send a surrogate ( <unk> Hakeem ) to speak on her behalf . Barr 's surrogate reportedly chided the Party for not respecting Barr 's candidacy . A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued . Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination , and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter . 
 Shortly after losing the Green Party nomination , Barr announced she would run on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket with activist Cindy Sheehan as a running mate . On August 4 , 2012 , Barr won the 2012 presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party . Barr 's running mate , Cindy Sheehan , immediately had disagreements with Barr , from Barr 's views on policy , to Barr 's desire to only campaign online , and Barr 's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein , leading Sheehan to request her name taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket . Sheehan was told it was too late to have her name removed , so she instead announced that she was simply leaving the campaign . 
 Barr finished her campaign with nearly 50 @,@ 000 votes nationwide , placing sixth overall with considerably less than 0 @.@ 1 % of the popular vote ; Stein placed far ahead of her in fourth place with roughly 0 @.@ 3 % of the popular vote and 469 @,@ 501 votes . Barr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign , with documentarian Eric Weinrib directing , leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign . Over 300 hours were filmed and were released as a film called Roseanne for President ! . Despite questions of her sincerity regarding her campaign , Barr and her family have insisted her desire to run for President was " very real . "

 In 1970 , when she was 17 , Barr had a child whom she placed for adoption ; they were later reunited . On February 4 , 1974 , Barr married Bill Pentland , a motel clerk she met while in Colorado . They had three children : Jessica , Jennifer , and Jake . Pentland and Barr divorced on January 16 , 1990 . Four days later , on January 20 , 1990 , Barr married fellow comedian Tom Arnold and became known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage . Barr had met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis , where he opened for her stand @-@ up comedy act . In 1988 , Barr brought Arnold onto her sitcom , Roseanne , as a writer . 
 Barr has a lesbian sister , Geraldine Barr , and a gay brother , Ben Barr , both of whom inspired her to introduce gay characters into her sitcom . Barr has stated that she supports gay marriage . Geraldine was also Barr 's manager while performing in comedy clubs and at the start of her sitcom . Geraldine claimed that Arnold tried to dominate Barr " for his own reasons " . After being fired by Roseanne , Geraldine filed a $ 70 @.@ 3 million breach of contract lawsuit in Superior Court of Los Angeles County on December 18 , 1991 . She said Barr promised her half the earnings from the Roseanne show for helping invent the " domestic goddess " character in 1981 , serving as " writer , organizer , accountant , bookkeeper and confidante " . Since it was six months past the statute of limitations , the suit was thrown out . 
 In a 1991 interview with People , Barr described herself as an " incest survivor " , accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse , claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied . Melvin Belli , her parents ' lawyer , said that they had passed a lie detector test " with flying colors " . Barr was even part of an incest recovery group , something she said her parents knew about but for which they were " in denial " . On February 14 , 2011 , Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word " incest " could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the " darkest time " in her life . She told Oprah , " I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs ... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness ... I totally lost touch with reality ... ( and ) I didn ’ t know what the truth was ... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family " . She added that not everything was " made up " , saying , " Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification " . Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years , but had recently reconciled . 
 Barr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April 18 , 1994 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County , citing irreconcilable differences . Their efforts to have children were unsuccessful . On February 14 , 1995 , Barr married Ben Thomas , her one @-@ time personal security guard , at Caesars Tahoe with a reception at Planet Hollywood . In November 1994 , she became pregnant through in @-@ vitro fertilization and they had a son named Buck . The couple stayed together until 2002 . 
 In the mid @-@ 1990s , Barr had multiple cosmetic surgeries performed , such as a breast reduction , tummy tuck , and a nose job . During the late 1990s she had gastric bypass surgery . 
 In 2002 , Barr met Johnny Argent online after running a writing competition on her blog and began dating him in 2003 , after a year of phone conversations . They live on a 46 @-@ acre macadamia nut farm located on the Big Island of Hawaii . Barr purchased the property in 2007 for $ 1 @.@ 78 million . Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline . 
 In 2015 , Barr revealed she has been diagnosed with both macular degeneration and glaucoma , and thus is gradually losing her eyesight and expects to eventually go blind ; she is consuming medical marijuana to fight the raised intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases .

 = River Arun = 
 The Arun ( / <unk> / ) is a river in the English county of West Sussex . Its source is a series of small streams in the St Leonard 's Forest area , to the east of Horsham . After flowing through Horsham to the west , it is joined by the North River at <unk> . Turning to the south , it is joined by its main tributary , the western River Rother , and continues through Arundel and past Arundel Castle , to join the English Channel at Littlehampton . The Arun local government district in West Sussex is named after it . It is one of the faster flowing rivers in England , and is tidal as far inland as Pallingham Quay , 25 @.@ 5 miles ( 41 @.@ 0 km ) upstream from the sea at Littlehampton . 
 The first major improvements to the river were made between the 1540s and the 1570s , when Arundel became a port , and navigation up to Pallingham was improved , but barges had difficulty negotiating the flash locks that were installed . The work was carried out by Henry FitzAlan , 19th Earl of Arundel , who made the upper section toll @-@ free . Harbour commissioners managed the lower river from Arundel to the sea from 1732 , and major improvements to keep the estuary free from silt were sanctioned by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793 . With the coming of the railways and changes in coastal shipping , Littlehampton superseded Arundel as the port of the Arun , and the Littlehampton harbour commissioners are still responsible for the river up to Arundel , collecting tolls for its use . 
 The river above Arundel was improved after 1785 . As the main channel was toll @-@ free , the proprietors of the scheme built two major cuts . One , which included three locks and passed through Hardham Tunnel , was built to avoid a large bend near Pulborough . The other was near the upper terminus , where a cut with three locks crossed the original channel by an aqueduct to reach wharves at Newbridge . Further improvements were made when the Wey and Arun Canal opened in 1816 , joining the Arun at Newbridge , and after the completion of the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal , which opened soon afterwards . These two canals were an attempt to provide an inland route between London and Portsmouth , but were not as successful as the proprietors hoped . Traffic declined rapidly when the railways offered competition , and the navigation ceased to be maintained from 1888 , though some traffic continued on the lower sections . The Wey and Arun Canal is currently being restored , and restoration will eventually include the cut and locks below Newbridge . 
 = = History = = 
 When Ptolemy wrote his Geography around 150 AD , the Arun was called the Trisantonis , with later accounts using the same name . Trisantonis is thought to be a Brythonic word for ' the trespasser ' , indicating the river 's tendency to flood land near to the river . <unk> translates directly as ' one who goes across ' . There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea , but known as the <unk> ( from the Brythonic ' Arno ' meaning run , go , or flow ) in its upper reaches . It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno @-@ dell , or dell of the flowing river . By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel , the Arundel river , or the high stream of Arundel . An alternative name , the Tarrant ( derived from <unk> ) , is , however , attested in 725 and 1270 , and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street , one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river . The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577 , but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years . 
 The mouth of the river has not always been at Littlehampton . Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten miles to the east before entering the sea . This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides , pushing the Adur towards Shoreham @-@ by @-@ Sea , while the Arun broke out at Worthing , Goring and <unk> at various times , until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530 . 
 = = = Improvements = = = 
 The lower portion of the river , from the sea to Ford , was navigable in the eleventh century at the time of the Norman conquest . In the sixteenth century , Henry FitzAlan , 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford , and improved the river channel below there , so that the town became a port . Over the 30 years from 1544 , he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay . Although the work involved a number of flash locks , which were not very successful , no tolls were charged for its use , and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber . Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful . 
 An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1732 , the main emphasis of which was the improvement of " the harbour of Littlehampton , called Arundel Port " , but improvements to the first 5 @.@ 75 miles ( 9 @.@ 25 km ) of the river , from the sea to Arundel , were also authorised . Commissioners were appointed , with powers to erect piers and to cut a new channel to the sea through a sand bar . The Act allowed them to charge tolls for use of the facilities , and once the initial costs had been repaid , one half of the tolls were to be used to maintain the harbour and the river channel up to Arundel . Although most ships were of 30 or 40 tons , ships of up to 100 tons could reach Arundel as a result of the work , and trade improved . 
 The next Act to affect the river was obtained by a group of local men in 1785 . Under the Act , the proprietors were empowered to make the river navigable for 30 @-@ ton barges up to Newbridge . They had no jurisdiction over the river from Arundel to Houghton bridge , and could not charge tolls for use of the river up to Pallingham . There were 31 members of the proprietors , who could raise £ 10 @,@ 000 by issuing 100 shares worth £ 100 each . Day @-@ to @-@ day oversight of the affairs of the navigation were managed by three proprietors , with a half @-@ yearly meeting of the larger group . The purpose of the navigation was to carry coal , chalk and lime upstream , and agricultural produce in the other direction . Rather than improve the river channel , the navigation upstream of Pallingham consisted of a separate channel , containing three locks , and an aqueduct which carried the navigation over the river at <unk> . The journey below Pallingham was made 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) shorter by cutting a new channel between <unk> and Hardham . This involved the construction of three more locks and a 375 @-@ yard ( 343 m ) tunnel . The Pallingham to Newbridge section opened on 1 August 1787 , while the Hardham cut was completed in mid @-@ 1790 . The cost of the work was around £ 16 @,@ 000 . 
 There were two proposals to extend the navigation at this time . The first was for a canal to North Chapel , to the north of Petworth , in 1791 , and the second was for a canal to Horsham in the following year . The route was surveyed by John Rennie , who estimated that it would cost £ 18 @,@ 133 to build , but negotiations with the existing proprietors failed , and the scheme was dropped in 1794 . Meanwhile , a second Act of Parliament was obtained by the harbour commissioners in 1793 , as there was serious silting of the estuary . <unk> were constructed and the existing piers were made longer . In addition , a towpath was built from the mouth of the river up to Arundel . The Act stated that the capital borrowed to finance the harbour under the previous act had been repaid , and that tolls would all be used for maintenance of the harbour and river up to Arundel , once further borrowings had been repaid . Because the inhabitants of Arundel had spent £ 28 @,@ 300 on the harbour , boats which belonged to the port of Arundel did not have to pay any tolls . As a result of the works , the port of Arundel enjoyed its most prosperous period for the next thirty years , with ships of 200 and 300 tons able to reach the town on spring tides . Facilities improved , and there were four docks by 1840 . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 Payment of dividends to shareholders began in 1792 , and over the next five years , tolls raised an average of £ 893 per year and the dividend was 3 @.@ 1 per cent . At this time , George Wyndham , 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them , he became chairman of the company . He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly . Apart from an interim payment in 1821 , dividends were not reinstated until 1830 . In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham , and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal , which was seen as part of a larger scheme to link London to Portsmouth , an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641 . He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811 , at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal , and put up £ 20 @,@ 000 of the initial £ 90 @,@ 500 estimated cost . The canal opened in September 1816 , but the estimated 100 @,@ 000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth , and the 30 @,@ 000 tons of local traffic , were far too optimistic , with actual traffic averaging around 15 @,@ 000 tons per year throughout its life . 
 The London to Portsmouth route was to be completed by the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal , in which Wyndham and the <unk> , who also held many shares in the Arun Navigation , were both significant subscribers . This was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1817 , and an agreement was reached that the Arun would be improved to aid through traffic . Nevertheless , no work commenced on the Arun until the proprietors were sure that the Ford section of the new canal would actually be built . Once they were convinced , they obtained an Act of Parliament in May 1821 , and the engineer James Hollingworth oversaw the improvements , which were completed in mid @-@ 1823 . The work involved improving the depth and width of the channel , and some alterations to bridges and locks to make their size more uniform . The company borrowed £ 3000 to finance the work , which cost around £ 5000 in total . The loans had been repaid by 1831 , and the work allowed barge sizes to be increased from 30 tons to 40 tons , with the result that business improved . 
 Traffic increased , as shown by the number of boats belonging to residents of Arundel . There were 13 in 1801 , which had increased to 15 by 1803 , with a total tonnage of 266 . A timber merchant called John Boxold owned barges in 1815 and 1832 , while in 1820 , a company began running regular freight services to London , using three barges based near the town quay . By 1823 they had ten barges , which had reduced to seven by 1830 , and barges ran twice @-@ weekly to Chichester , London , Midhurst , and Petworth . The company was variously called Seward and Co . , The Arundel Barge Co . , and several other names . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 From the 1840s , use of the river declined , as a result of competition from the railways , and changes in coastal shipping . Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel , the customs house was moved there in 1864 . The Mid @-@ Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859 , which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863 . Receipts from tolls had peaked at £ 2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840 , when a dividend of 11 @.@ 8 percent was paid , but dropped quickly , raising just £ 389 for years between 1870 and 1875 , when the dividend was 1 percent . 
 By 1852 , the barge service to London only ran once a week , and it had ceased altogether three years later . Most vessels reaching Arundel were coasters rather than barges by 1886 , and just 20 ships used the facilities that year . The Wey and Arun Canal closed in 1871 . The proprietors of the upper river ceased to maintain the navigation from 1 January 1888 , and the last barge passed through Hardham Tunnel on 29 January 1889 . The river was abandoned as a navigation by a warrant issued as part of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888 . The River Lark in Suffolk was the only other river navigation abandoned at that time . The Board of Trade issued a closing order in 1896 , and after that , there was no navigation authority responsible for the upper river . However , traffic did not cease entirely . 
 Fifteen or twenty barges were still using the river in the 1880s , although the upper reaches were no longer accessible . Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896 . In 1898 , the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway , who by this time were the owners of the railway from Horsham to Littlehampton , drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course , and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it . A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century . Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs , and imports of salt , timber and coal for the gasworks continued . Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914 , and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later . Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908 , and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938 . As freight traffic disappeared from the river , Edward Slaughter , who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter , was hiring pleasure craft by 1903 , and the company was still doing so in the 1990s . 
 = = = Present = = = 
 Authority for the river remains much as it was after 1896 , with the Littlehampton Harbour Board responsible for the section from the mouth up to Arundel Bridge , and no navigation authority for the river above that , although the Environment Agency have responsibility for its drainage functions . There are nine bridges with a minimum navigable headroom of between 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at high water . The river is tidal to Pallingham Quay , 25 @.@ 5 miles ( 41 @.@ 0 km ) upstream from the sea at Littlehampton , and flows at 4 to 6 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 to 11 @.@ 1 km / h ) , making it one of the fastest flowing rivers in the country . The tidal range at Littlehampton is 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) at spring tides and 8 @.@ 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) at neap tides . High tide occurs 15 minutes later than high water at Dover , and high water at Pulborough is four hours later than at Littlehampton .

 The Arun & Rother Rivers Trust ( <unk> ) is a charity set up in 2011 with objectives around education , fisheries , biodiversity , access and pollution amongst other issues . 
 The Wey and Arun Canal is being restored by the Wey and Arun Canal Trust , which was set up in the 1970s . The Wey and Arun Canal technically ended at Newbridge , but the restoration will include the Arun Navigation section down to Pallingham to reach the River Arun . For many years , the Solent and Arun Branch of the Inland Waterways Association organised an annual cruise on the river to ensure that the navigation rights were maintained . Responsibility for its organisation has now been passed to the Wey and Arun Canal Trust .

 At 37 miles ( 60 km ) from its source to the sea , the Arun is the longest of the rivers in Sussex . It rises as a series of streams , known locally as <unk> or gills , to the east of Horsham , in St Leonard 's Forest . It flows westwards , along the southern boundary of Horsham and turns briefly to the north to skirt <unk> Heath . Continuing westwards , it is joined by the North River , which is also known as the River Oke , whose headstreams are the heights of Leith Hill and <unk> Hill in Surrey . After the junction , it passes under the A29 road , which follows the route of the Roman Stane Street at this point , and timber piles of a Roman bridge have been found in the riverbed . The earthworks from a Roman station are close by . To the south of <unk> it is crossed by a disused railway line , and at this point it crosses the 66 @-@ foot ( 20 m ) contour . Its course is marked by winding meanders as it turns towards the south , and the county boundary briefly follows its course , before it is joined by the partially restored Wey and Arun Canal . Its former course to the west of the canal can be clearly seen , and is followed by the boundary , but the main flow of the river follows a new straight cut just to the east of the canal . Once the boundary crosses back over the canal , the river resumes its meandering course on the eastern side of the canal . 
 A little further to the south is another straight cut , with the old course still visible on the other side of the canal . Soon it reaches Newbridge on the A272 road near <unk> Green . The location of the wharf which was the northern terminus of the Arun Navigation was just to the south of the bridge . Wharf Farm was nearby , and the modern 1 : 2500 Ordnance Survey map shows buildings named " The Old Wharf " . <unk> Brook joins from the east before the river turns briefly westwards . Soon it is crossed by <unk> Aqueduct , which carried the Arun Navigation over the river channel . The River <unk> joins it , flowing from the north , and it turns southwards again . At Pallingham the remains of Pallingham Manor are on the north bank , next to Pallingham Manor Farm , a 17th @-@ century timber @-@ framed farmhouse , which is Grade II listed . Pallingham Quay Farmhouse , another Grade II listed building dating from the 18th century , is on the west bank of the river just before its junction with the Arun Navigation cut . Below the junction , the river is tidal . 
 Continuing southwards , the river passes the gallops which are part of <unk> Racing Stables , situated on the eastern bank , and Park Mount , a motte and bailey dating from the time of the Norman conquest . It is one of the best @-@ preserved monuments of this type in south east England . The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge , a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422 @-@ 23 . The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822 . It is a Grade I listed structure , and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument . It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War , but has been repaired , and the heavy traffic on the <unk> road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s . 
 Below the bridge is a small island , after which an artificial cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards . The river now discharges over a weir at the site of the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream , and the junction is followed by another small island . Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill , and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother . Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953 , when both ends were accessible , and again in 2012 , when only the southern end was explored . A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end , and the tunnel mouth is within the site . The river continues in a large loop to the east . The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station . There is another island , with the A29 road crossing both channels . Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop , and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge . The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches , two taller arches , a cast iron span over the navigable channel , and a solid ramp to the east . Although its construction suggests that it is medieval , most of the arches were erected in 1827 . 
 On the west bank of the river below the bridge is Waltham Brooks nature reserve . <unk> lock , on the branch through the Hardham Tunnel , is still marked on modern maps , and the section from the lock to the river still holds water . Just to the north of Amberley , the river is crossed by the Arun Valley line again at <unk> Bridge . At the village of Bury , the West Sussex Literary Trail joins the western bank and another footpath joins the eastern bank . The next bridge is Houghton Bridge , close to Amberley railway station . The river splits into two channels here , and the bridge spans both . Similar to Greatham Bridge , it looks medieval , but was built in 1875 . There is a solid section on the island between the channels , with a single arch over the eastern channel and four arches over the main river . The chalk pits which provided trade to the navigation are now the location of Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre , a 36 @-@ acre ( 15 ha ) site with many items of industrial heritage on display . 
 The river follows an " S " -shaped course , the northern loop encircling the village of North Stoke and the south one encircling South Stoke .

On the west bank is the hamlet of <unk> and Arundel Wetland Centre , a 65 @-@ acre ( 26 ha ) haven for birds which is run by the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust . The market town of Arundel is to the west of the river . It has a castle build on a motte , the construction of which was started in 1068 . It is owned by the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk . The present building consists of many different components , dating from the late eleventh century through to the nineteenth , and is Grade I listed . Two bridges span the river here , the first on the original road through the town , while the second carries the <unk> Arundel Bypass . The final section is crossed by a railway bridge , built in 1908 , and the A259 road bridge , which carries the road into Littlehampton on the east bank . It discharges into the English Channel between the East and West Piers . 
 Littlehampton and its harbour were guarded from naval attack by Littlehampton Redoubt on the western bank at the mouth of the river , completed in 1854 , which is now screened from the open sea by <unk> sand dunes . This fort replaced a seven @-@ gun battery on the east bank , which was built in 1764 .

 = Paul Cornell ( lawyer ) = 
 Paul Cornell ( August 5 , 1822 – March 3 , 1904 ) was an American lawyer and Chicago real estate speculator who founded the Hyde Park Township that included most of what are now known as the south and far southeast sides of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . He turned the south side Lake Michigan lakefront area , especially the Hyde Park community area and neighboring Kenwood and Woodlawn neighborhoods , into a resort community that had its heyday from the 1850s through the early 20th century . He was also an urban planner who paved the way for and preserved many of the parks that are now in the Chicago Park District . Additionally , he was a successful entrepreneur with interests in manufacturing , cemeteries , and hotels . 
 His modern legacy includes several large parks now in the Chicago Park District : Jackson Park , Washington Park , Midway Plaisance and Harold Washington Park . Most of the South and Southeast Sides of Chicago were developed and eventually annexed into the City of Chicago as a result of his foresight . 
 = = Background = = 
 Born in Upstate New York , Cornell was from a distinguished New England family , was descendant from Thomas Cornell , the progenitor of the Cornell family in North America , and a cousin to Ezra Cornell , founder of Cornell University . When his father died ( he was 9 at that time ) the family moved to the Adams County , IL / Schuyler County , IL area , where he worked as a farmhand to pay for schooling . He passed the Illinois bar examination and moved to Chicago in 1847 . Unfortunately , his entire savings was stolen from his hotel room on his first night in town . A sympathetic lawyer provided him with both a loan and a job at the law office of Skinner and <unk> , where he met Senator Stephen Douglas . 
 He was married to the sister @-@ in @-@ law of John Evans , after whom Evanston , IL was named . He had many strong local connections , being related to founders of Northwestern University ( Evans and <unk> Lunt ) and to George Kimbark of Riverside Improvement Company . His brother @-@ in @-@ law Kimbark purchased the area between 51st and 55th and Dorchester and Woodlawn to the west of Cornell 's purchase . Cornell later purchased this as well as other lands purchased by his Uncle , Hassan A. Hopkins , to add to Hyde Park . 
 = = Hyde Park = = 
 Douglas advised him to consider investing in land south of the city limits . After some horseback travels through the area , he began to envision a viable community there . In 1853 , following the advice of Douglas , he bought 300 acres ( 1 @.@ 21 km2 ) of property between 51st Street and 55th Street as a speculative investment . This area was 7 miles ( 11 @.@ 27 km ) south of the mouth of the Chicago River and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 66 km ) south of downtown Chicago . In the 1850s , Chicago was still a walkable urban area well contained within a 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 22 km ) radius of the center . It was common for development companies to locate hotels near rail depots to introduce visitors to new suburbs . In 1856 , Paul Cornell invented the Chicago railroad suburb . In an effort to improve his land value , he deeded 60 acres ( 0 @.@ 24 km2 ) to the Illinois Central Railroad in exchange for a 53rd Street train station and a commitment of 6 daily connections to Chicago ’ s Central Depot in each direction . He then marketed the neighborhood to wealthy Chicagoans as a resort area . He selected the name Hyde Park to associate the area with the elite high class neighborhoods of New York and London . 
 At about the same time , he built the Hyde Park House a 4 story hotel at 53rd Street and Lake Michigan . The hotel became the focal point of the community and drew affluent guests with leisure time and discretionary income . This site is now occupied by the Hampton House . The hotel also helped others to envision a thriving affluent community in the area . By 1861 , the residents petitioned the Illinois General Assembly to create the Hyde Park Township . 
 Paul Cornell specifically forbade heavy industry development in Hyde Park . This philosophy later became a part of the Burnham Plan . He maintained the character of Hyde Park , which was intended to be an elite suburb bordering Chicago , by selling only large lots that the affluent could afford . The neighborhood flourished for the next two generations . 
 In 1889 , the entire Hyde Park township ( the area south of 39th Street , north of 138th Street , and east of State Street ) , which had quintupled in population from an 1880 population of 15 @,@ 716 to an 1889 population of 85 @,@ 000 , voted for annexation to the City of Chicago . Paul Cornell planned and advocated a town with a lakefront park , a <unk> , an adjoining park and boulevards shaped the town . His plan for a cornerstone institution to rival Evanston 's Northwestern University was at first thwarted by the decision to establish a theological seminary on the north side , but would come to fruition with the foundation of the University of Chicago through the philanthropy of John D. Rockefeller and Marshall Field in 1890 . 
 Hyde Park maintained racially restrictive covenants excluding African Americans from purchasing , leasing , or occupying homes in Hyde Park for nearly one hundred years until this <unk> tool was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in a 1940 case , Lee v. Hansberry , concerning the nearby Washington Park Subdivision . At his death , Cornell bequeathed East End Park ( Now renamed Harold Washington Park ) to the city . The stone pictured above commemorates this gift . 
 = = Civic Leadership = = 
 Cornell is considered the " father of the South Parks System " for his extensive efforts after the American Civil War to create a parks system south of Chicago . Cornell , as a real estate developer , presented a convincing case to city developers that a parks system would increase the value of land surrounding it . Cornell based his arguments on New York City 's Central Park , which had substantially raised surrounding real estate values . Repeated attempts eventually got a plan through the Illinois General Assembly . As a civic leader he along with his peer William Le Baron Jenney , the West Parks commissioner , commissioned urban landscape designers such as Frederick Law Olmsted , Calvert Vaux , Ossian Simonds , H. W. S. Cleveland , and Jens Jensen to create landscaped cemeteries , to implement a coordinated parks and boulevard system and to design the railroad @-@ served suburbs to complement urban civilization . 
 In 1869 , the state passed the " Parks Law " , which created the north , south and west parks district . The parks districts were established as municipal corporations with funding based on the taxable real estate within its service area . The legislation provided for orderly growth and evolution of the city by outlining not only the powers and duties of the parks districts , but also the geography of the parks and connecting boulevards . Cornell was able to both benefit financially from the $ 46 million spent on the parks during the remainder of the century and to assume a position of influence over the parks . Cornell served for over 13 years on the South Parks Commission , which regulated parks south of the city . This position enabled him to pursue his vision which was to have a park system that would give " lungs to the great city and its future generations . " He also served as the Hyde Park Township 's first Town Supervisor . Today , Jackson Park , Washington Park and Harold Washington Park stand as a testament to his efforts . These parks became major selling points that contributed to the growth of Hyde Park . 
 = = Other ventures = = 
 In 1887 , Cornell built the Hyde Park Hotel ( left , 1887 – 1963 ) on the former site of his home at Lake Park and East Hyde Park Boulevard . The hotel was expanded in 1891 . In 1914 , the hotel expanded ( for a second time ) , which doubled its capacity to 300 rooms ( see right ) . 
 Paul Cornell also purchased the swampland and prairie 8 miles ( 12 @.@ 9 km ) south of the Loop at the intersection of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Illinois Central Railroad at a location that now is 75th Street and South Chicago Avenue in 1855 . He subdivided parcels for sale through the 1870s . The area , which was first named Cornell , became Grand Crossing . He had accumulated a total of 960 acres ( 1 @.@ 5 sq mi ; 3 @.@ 9 km2 ) land at one point . The reason that the name was changed was the pre @-@ existence of Cornell , Illinois . 
 Paul Cornell established the Cornell Watch Factory at 76th Street and the Illinois Central tracks in 1876 in Grand Crossing . Among his other ventures , Cornell founded Republic Life Insurance Company and the American Bronze Company . He served as secretary for a group of Chicagoans who purchased 167 acres ( 0 @.@ 68 km2 ) in 1853 to create Oak Woods Cemetery . He has a 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) tall zinc monument at the cemetery .

 = Poland in the Early Middle Ages = 
 The main event that took place within the lands of Poland in the Early Middle Ages , as well as other parts of central @-@ eastern Europe , was the arrival , and subsequent permanent settlement , of the Slavic peoples . The Slavic migrations in the area of contemporary Poland started in the second half of the 5th century CE , some half century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes , their previous inhabitants . The first waves of the incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern Poland and southern Masovia . Coming from the east , from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River , the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni , and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs . Their early archeological traces belong to the Prague @-@ Korchak culture , which is similar to the earlier Kiev culture . 
 From there the new population dispersed north and west over the course of the 6th century . The Slavs lived from cultivation of crops and were generally farmers , but also engaged in hunting and gathering . The migrations took place when the destabilizing invasions of eastern and central Europe by waves of people and armies from the east , such as the Huns , Avars and Magyars , were occurring . This westward movement of Slavic people was facilitated in part by the previous emigration of Germanic peoples toward the safer and more developed areas of western and southern Europe . The immigrating Slavs formed various small tribal organizations beginning in the 8th century , some of which coalesced later into larger , state @-@ like ones . Beginning in the 7th century , these tribal units built many fortified structures with earth and wood walls and embankments , called gords . Some of them were developed and inhabited , others had a very large empty area inside the walls . 
 By the 9th century , the Slavs had settled the Baltic coast in Pomerania , which subsequently developed into a commercial and military power . Along the coastline , remnants of Scandinavian settlements and <unk> were to be found . The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso , located in Prussia . Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians . During the same time , the tribe of the Vistulans ( <unk> ) , based in Kraków and the surrounding region , controlled a large area in the south , which they developed and fortified with many strongholds . 
 During the 10th century , the Polans ( Polanie , lit . " people of the fields " ) turned out to be of decisive historic importance . Initially based in the central Polish lowlands around Giecz , Poznań and Gniezno , the Polans went through a period of accelerated building of fortified settlements and territorial expansion beginning in the first half of the 10th century . Under Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty , the expanded Polan territory was converted to Christianity in 966 , which is generally regarded the birth of the Polish state . The contemporary names of the realm , " Mieszko 's " or " Gniezno state " , were dropped soon afterwards in favour of " Poland " , a rendering of the Polans ' tribal name . The Piast dynasty would continue to rule Poland until the late 14th century . 
 = = Origin of the Slavic peoples = = 
 = = = Slavic beginnings in Poland = = = 
 The origins of the Slavic peoples , who arrived on Polish lands at the outset of the Middle Ages , archeologically as the Prague culture , go back to the Kiev culture , which formed beginning early in 3rd century CE , and which is genetically derived from the Post @-@ Zarubintsy cultural horizon ( <unk> – <unk> – <unk> material culture sphere ) , and itself was one of the later post @-@ Zarubintsy culture groups . Such <unk> relationship is apparent between the large Kiev culture population and the early ( 6th – 7th centuries ) Slavic settlements in the Oder and Vistula basins , but lacking between these Slavic settlements and the older local cultures within the same region , that ceased to exist beginning in the 400 – 450 CE period . 
 = = = Zarubintsy culture = = = 
 The Zarubintsy culture circle , in existence roughly from 200 BCE to 150 CE , extended along the middle and upper Dnieper and its tributary the Pripyat River , but also left traces of settlements in parts of Polesie and the upper Bug River basin . The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group , the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group . The Zarubintsy culture developed from the <unk> culture in the northern part of its range and from the local Scythian populations in the more southern part . The Polesie group 's origin was also influenced by the Pomeranian and Jastorf cultures . The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by La Tène culture and the Black Sea area ( trade with the Greek cities provided imported items ) centers of civilization in the earlier stages , but not much by Roman influence later on , and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures . Cremation of bodies was practiced , with the human remains and burial gifts including metal decorations , small in number and limited in variety , placed in pits . 
 = = = Kiev culture = = = 
 Originating from the Post @-@ Zarubintsy cultures and often considered the oldest Slavic culture , the Kiev culture functioned during the later Roman periods ( end of 2nd through mid @-@ 5th century ) north of the vast Chernyakhov culture territories , within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper , Desna and <unk> rivers . The archeological cultural features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible ( representing the same cultural model ) with that of the 6th @-@ century Slavic societies , including the settlements on the lands of today 's Poland . The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites ; the burial sites , involving pit graves , are few and poorly equipped . Not many metal objects have been found , despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals , including enamel coating technology . Clay vessels were made without the potter 's wheel . The Kiev culture represented an intermediate level of development , between that of the cultures of the Central European Barbaricum , and the forest zone societies of the eastern part of the continent . The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations : The Middle Dnieper group , the Desna group , the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper @-@ Don group . The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups , but evolved probably over a larger territory , stretching west to the base of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains , and from a broader Post @-@ Zarubintsy foundation . The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 CE , when the Ostrogothic state , and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture , were destroyed by the Huns . This process was facilitated further and gained pace , involving at that time the Kiev 's descendant cultures , when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid @-@ 5th century . 
 = = = Written sources = = = 
 The eastern cradle of the Slavs is also directly confirmed by a written source . The anonymous author known as the <unk> of Ravenna ( c . 700 ) names Scythia , a geographic region encompassing vast areas of eastern Europe , as the place " where the generations of the Sclaveni had their beginnings " . Scythia , " stretching far and spreading wide " in the eastern and southern directions , had at the west end , as seen at the time of Jordanes ' writing ( first half to mid @-@ 6th century ) or earlier , " the Germans and the river Vistula " . Jordanes places the Slavs in Scythia as well . 
 = = = Alternative point of view = = = 
 According to an alternative theory , popular in the earlier 20th century and still represented today , the medieval cultures in the area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration , but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations , who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs . This view has mostly been discarded , primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity , during which settlements were absent or rare , and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites . 
 A 2011 article on the early Western Slavs states that the transitional period ( of relative depopulation ) is difficult to evaluate archeologically . Some believe that the Late Antique " Germanic " populations ( in Poland late Przeworsk culture and others ) abandoned East Central Europe and were replaced by the Slavs coming from the east , others see the " Germanic " groups as staying and becoming , or already being , Slavs . Current archeology , says the author , " is unable to give a satisfying answer and probably both aspects played a role " . In terms of their origin , territorial and linguistic , " Germanic " groups should not be played off against " Slavs " , as our current understanding of the terms may have limited relevance to the complex realities of the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages . Local languages in the region cannot be identified by archeological studies , and genetic evaluation of cremation burial remains has not been possible . 
 = = Slavic differentiation and expansion ; Prague culture = = 
 = = = Kolochin culture , Penkovka culture and Prague – Korchak culture = = = 
 The final process of the differentiation of the cultures recognized as early Slavic , the Kolochin culture ( over the Kiev culture 's territory ) , the Penkovka culture and the Prague @-@ Korchak culture took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE . Beyond the Post @-@ Zarubintsy horizon the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the Chernyakhov culture and the Dacian Carpathian <unk> culture . As not all of the previous inhabitants ( from those cultures ) had left the area and some groups were assimilated , they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures . 
 The Prague culture developed over the western part of the Slavic expansion , within the basins of the middle Dnieper , Pripyat , upper Dniester , up to the Carpathian Mountains and in southeastern Poland , that is the upper and middle Vistula basin . This culture was responsible for most of the growth in 6th and 7th centuries , by which time it also encompassed the middle Danube and middle Elbe basins . The Prague culture very likely corresponds to Jordanes ' Sclaveni , whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources . The Penkovka culture people inhabited the southeastern part , from Seversky Donets to the lower Danube ( including the region where the Antes would be ) , and the Kolochin culture was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka culture ( the upper Dnieper and Desna basins ) . The Korchak type designates the eastern part of the Prague @-@ Korchak culture , which because of its western expansion is somewhat less directly dependent on the mother Kiev culture than its two sister cultures . The early 6th @-@ century Slavic settlements covered an area three times the size of the Kiev culture region some hundred years earlier . 
 = = = Early settlements , economy and burials in Poland = = = 
 In Poland the earliest archeological sites considered Slavic include a limited number of 6th @-@ century settlements and a few isolated burial sites . The material obtained there consists mostly of simple , manually formed ceramics , typical of the entire early Slavic area . It is because of the different varieties of these basic clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished . The largest of the earliest Slavic ( Prague culture ) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in <unk> , Rzeszów County and dated the second half of 5th through 7th centuries . It consisted of 12 nearly square , partially dug out houses , each covering the area of 6 @.@ 2 to 19 @.@ 8 ( 14 @.@ 0 on the average ) square meters . A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner , which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period , but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found . 45 younger , different type dwellings ( 7th / 8th to 9th / 10th centuries ) have also been discovered in the vicinity . 
 Characteristic of all early Slavic cultures are poorly developed handicraft and limited resources of their communities . There were no major iron production centers , but metal founding techniques were known ; among metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks , as well as bronze decorative items ( 7th @-@ century finds in <unk> , Bielsk Podlaski County , a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements ) . The inventories of the typical , rather small , open settlements include normally also various clay ( including weights used for weaving ) , stone and horn utensils . The developments arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys , but above their flood levels , were usually irregular , and typically faced south . The wooden frame or pillar supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each side 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 meters long . Fertile lowlands were sought , but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance . The settlements were self @-@ sufficient — the early Slavs functioned without significant long @-@ distance trade . The potter 's wheel was being used from the turn of 7th century on . Some villages larger than a few homes have been investigated in the Kraków @-@ Nowa Huta region ( 6th to 9th century , for example cottages from about 625 CE ) , where , on the left bank of the Vistula , in the direction of <unk> a complex of 11 settlements has been located . The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine , because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood , leather or fabrics . Free standing clay dome stoves for bread baking were found on some locations . Another large 6th – to 9th @-@ century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia . 
 Like others for many centuries in this part of the world , the Slavic people cremated their dead . The burials were usually single , the graves grouped in small cemeteries , with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations . The number of burial sites found is small in relation to the known settlement density . The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation , cattle breeding ( swine , sheep and goats to a lesser extent ) , hunting , fishing and gathering . 
 = = = Geographic expansion in Poland and central Europe = = = 
 As the Slavs were arriving from the east beginning in the second half of 5th century , the earliest settlers reached southeastern Poland , that is the San River basin , then the upper Vistula regions including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley . Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz , Lublin , in Masovia and Upper Silesia . Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia . In the 6th century the above areas were settled . At the end of this century , or in early 7th century the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania . According to Theophylact Simocatta , the Slavs captured in 592 at Constantinople named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place they came from . 
 As of that time and in the following decades this region , plus some of the Greater Poland , Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River make up the <unk> @-@ <unk> group . Its origin is the subject of debate among archeologists . First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture . They reveal certain similarities to the findings of <unk> group of the Przeworsk culture . According to some scholars like Siedow , <unk> and <unk> , it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition . According to <unk> , it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage . <unk> @-@ <unk> group shows significant idiosyncrasies , as no graves or ( typical for the rest of the Slavic world ) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span . 
 This particular pattern of expansion into the lands of Poland and then Germany ( another , more southern 6th @-@ century route took the Prague culture Slavs through Slovakia , Moravia and Bohemia ) was a part of the great Slavic migration , which took many of them during this 5th – to 7th @-@ century period from the lands of their origin to the various countries of central and southeastern Europe . In particular the Slavs reached the eastern Alps , populated the Elbe basin , and the Danube basin , from where they moved south to occupy the Balkans as far as Peloponnese . 
 = = = Slavic related Ancient and early Medieval written accounts = = = 
 Besides the Baltic Veneti ( see Poland in Antiquity article ) , ancient and medieval authors speak of the East European , or Slavic Venethi . It can be inferred from Tacitus ' description in Germania that his " Venethi " lived possibly around the middle Dnieper basin , which in his times would correspond to the Proto @-@ Slavic Zarubintsy cultural sphere . Jordanes , to whom the Venethi meant his contemporary Slavs , wrote of past fighting between the Ostrogoths and the Venethi , which took place during the third quarter of 4th century in today 's Ukraine . At that time the Venethi would therefore mean the Kiev culture people . The Venethi says Jordanes , who " now rage in war far and wide , in punishment for our sins " , were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king <unk> 's command . Jordanes ' 6th @-@ century description of the " populous race of the Venethi " range includes the regions near the left ( northern ) ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there " almost endlessly " east , while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula . More specifically he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower Danube as the country of the Sclaveni . " They have swamps and forests for their cities " ( hi <unk> <unk> pro <unk> <unk> ) , he adds sarcastically . The " bravest of these peoples " , the Antes , settled the lands between the Dniester and the Dnieper rivers . The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location ( the more distant from Jordanes ' vantage and more ancestral in relation to the other two , the Kolochin culture is the likely possibility ) , as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples , who " though off @-@ shoots from one stock , have now three names " . Procopius in De Bello <unk> located the " countless Antes tribes " even further east , beyond the Dnieper . Together with the Sclaveni they spoke the same language , of an " unheard of barbarity " . According to him the Heruli nation traveled in 512 across all of the Sclaveni peoples territories , and then west of there through a large expanse of unpopulated lands , as the Slavs were about to settle the western and northern parts of Poland in the decades to follow . All of the above is in good accordance with the findings of today 's archeology . 
 Byzantine writers held the Slavs in low regard for the simple life they lived and also for their supposedly limited combat abilities , but in fact they were already in the early 6th century a threat to the Danubian boundaries of the Empire , where they waged plundering expeditions . Procopius , the anonymous author of <unk> known as Pseudo @-@ Maurice and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length on how to deal with the Slavs militarily , which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary . John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying ( the last quarter of 6th century ) , that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army . The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders , during the first half of 7th century , under Emperor Heraclius . 
 The above @-@ mentioned authors provide various details on the character , lifestyle and living conditions , social structure and economic activities of the early Slavic people , some of which are confirmed by the archeological discoveries as far as in Poland , as the Slavic communities were quite similar all over their range . Their uniform Old Slavic language remained in use until , depending on the region , the 9th to 12th centuries . For example , the Greek missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius from Thessaloniki , where " everybody fluently spoke Slavic " , when sent in 863 by the Byzantine ruler to distant Moravia , were expected to be able to communicate there without any difficulty .

 In the 6th century , the Turkic speaking nomadic Avars moved into the middle Danube area .

The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control , including Pomerania , to secure their participation in Avar raids , but other than that the exact nature of their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known . The Avars had some presence or contacts there also in the 7th and 8th centuries , when they left artifacts in the Kraków @-@ Nowa Huta region and elsewhere , including a bronze belt decoration found in the Krakus Mound .

Normal settlements , with the exception of a few fortified and cult places , were limited to lowland areas , below 350 meters above the sea level . Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water . The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as natural defense . 
 The living and economic activity structures were either distributed randomly , or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot . The larger settlements could have had over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents , but more typically there were just several homes with no more than 30 inhabitants . From the 7th century on the previously common semi @-@ subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings located over most of their areas or wholly above the surface ( pits were dug for storage and other uses ) , but still consisted of just one room . As the Germanic people before , the Slavs were leaving no man 's land regions between developed areas , and especially along the limits of their tribal territories , for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts . 
 = = = Gord construction = = = 
 The Polish tribes did however leave remnants of more imposing structures — fortified settlements and other reinforced enclosures of the gord ( Polish " <unk> " ) type . Those were being established on naturally suitable , defense enhancing sites beginning in late 6th or 7th century ( <unk> near Płock and <unk> are the early examples ) , with a large scale building effort taking place in the 8th century . The gords were differently designed and of various sizes , from small to impressively massive . Ditches , walls , palisades and embankments were used to strengthen the perimeter , which involved an often complicated earthwork , wood and stone construction . Gords of the tribal period were irregularly distributed across the country ( fewer larger ones in Lesser Poland , more smaller ones in central and northern Poland ) , could cover an area from 0 @.@ 1 to 25 hectares , have a simple or multi @-@ segment architecture , and be protected by fortifications of different types . Some were permanently occupied by a substantial number of people or by a chief and his cohort of armed men , while others were utilized as refuges to protect the local population in case of external danger . The gords eventually ( beginning in the 9th century ) became the nuclei of future urban developments , attracting , especially in strategic locations , tradesmen of all kinds . Gords erected in the 8th century have been investigated for instance in <unk> ( Cieszyn County , <unk> tribe ) and <unk> ( Nowy Sącz County ) . The last one was destroyed and rebuilt four times , with the final reconstruction after 989 . 
 A monumental ( over 3 hectares ) and technically complex border protection area gord was built around 770 – 780 in <unk> near Jasło , on the site of an old Bronze Age era stronghold , probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison . Thousands of relics were found there including a 600 pieces silver treasure . The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed during the first half of the 11th century . 
 This larger scale gord building activity , from the mid @-@ 8th century on , was a manifestation of the emergence of tribal organisms , a new civilizational quality , representing rather efficient proto @-@ political organizations and social structures on a new level . They were based on these fortifications , defensive objects , of which the mid @-@ 8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example . The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the organizing and the construction projects . 
 = = = Society organized into larger tribal units = = = 
 The Slavs in Poland , from the 8th century on , increasingly organized in larger structures , known as great tribes , either through voluntary or forced association , were primarily agricultural people . Fields were cultivated , as well as , within settlements , nearby gardens . <unk> was done using oxen and wooden , iron reinforced plows . Forest burning was used to increase the arable area , but also provided fertilizer , as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons . Rotation of crops was practiced as well as the winter / spring crop system . After several seasons of exploitation the land was being left idle to regain fertility . Wheat , millet and rye were most important ; other cultivated plant species included oat , barley , pea , broad bean , lentil , flax , hemp , as well as apple , pear , plum , peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards . Beginning in the 8th century , swine gradually became economically more important than cattle ; sheep , goats , horses , dogs , cats , chickens , geese and ducks were also kept . The Slavic agricultural practices are known from archeological research , which shows progressive over time increases in arable area and resulting deforestation , and from written reports provided by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , a 10th @-@ century Jewish traveler . Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life , for example the use of steam baths . The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology . An anonymous Arab writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute , tambourines and wind instruments . 
 Gathering , hunting and fishing were still essential as sources of food and materials , such as hide or fur . The forest was also exploited as a source of building materials such as wood , wild forest bees were kept there , and as a place of refuge . The population was , until the 9th century , separated from the main centers of civilization , self @-@ sufficient with primitive , local community and household based manufacturing . Specialized craftsmen ( of rather mediocre qualifications ) existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing , and pottery ; the few luxury type items used were imports . From the 7th century on , modestly decorated ceramics was made with the potter 's wheel . 7th – to 9th @-@ century collections of objects have been found in <unk> and <unk> , Kościan County ( iron spurs , knives , clay containers with some ornamentation ) and in Kraków @-@ Nowa Huta region ( weapons and utensils in <unk> and <unk> , where the most substantial of iron treasures was located ) , among other places . Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears , bows and wooden shields ; occasionally seen later axes and still later swords are of the types popular throughout 7th – to 9th @-@ century Europe . Independent of distant powers the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life , but at the cost of some civilizational backwardness . 
 A qualitative change took place in the 9th century , when the Polish lands were crossed again by long @-@ distance trade routes , with Pomerania becoming a part of the Baltic trade zone , while Lesser Poland participated in exchange centered in the Danubian countries . Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins , often cut into pieces , " grzywna " iron coin equivalents ( of the type used in Great Moravia ) in the Upper Vistula basin and even linen cloths served as currency . 
 The basic social unit was the nuclear family , consisting of parents and their children , which had to fit in a dwelling area of several to 25 square meters . The big family , a patriarchal , multi @-@ generational group of related families , a kin or clan , was of declining importance during the discussed period . A larger group was needed in the past ( 5th – 7th centuries ) for forest clearing and burning undertakings , when farming communities had to shift from location to location ; in the 8th @-@ century mature — settled phase of agriculture , a family was sufficient to take care of their arable land . A concept of agricultural land ownership was gradually developing , being at this point a matter of family , not individual prerogative . Several or more clan territories were grouped into a neighborhood association , or " <unk> " , which established a rudimentary self @-@ government . Such community was the owner of forested land , pastures , bodies of water and within it the first organizing around common projects and related development of political power took place . A big and resourceful <unk> could become , by extending its possessions , a proto @-@ state entity vaguely referred to as the tribe . The tribe was the top level of this structure , containing several <unk> and controlling a region of several hundred up to about 1500 square kilometers , where internal relationships were arbitrated and external defense organized . 
 A general assembly of all tribesmen present took care of the most pressing of issues ( Thietmar of Merseburg wrote in the early 11th century of the Veleti , Polabian Slavs , that their assembly kept deliberating till everybody agreed ) , but this " war democracy " was gradually being replaced by a government system in which the tribal elders and rulers had the upper hand . This development facilitated the coalescing of tribes into great tribes , some of which under favorable conditions would later become tribal states . The communal and tribal democracy , with self @-@ imposed contributions by the community members , survived in small entities and local territorial subunits the longest ; on a larger scale it was being replaced by the rule of able leaders and then dominant families , ultimately leading inevitably to hereditary transition of supreme power , mandatory taxation , service etc . When social and economic evolution reached this level , the concentration of power was facilitated and made possible to sustain by parallel development of a professional military force ( called at this stage " <unk> " ) at the ruler 's or chief 's disposal . 
 = = = Burials and religion = = = 
 The burial customs , at least in southern Poland , included raising kurgans . The urn with the ashes was placed on the mound or on a post thrust into the ground . In that position few such urns survived , which may be why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare . All dead , regardless of social status , were cremated and afforded a burial , according to Arab testimonies ( one from the end of 9th century and another one from about 930 ) . A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta . 
 According to Procopius the Slavs believed in one god , creator of lightning and master of the entire universe , to whom all sacrificial animals ( sometimes people ) were offered . The highest god was called <unk> throughout the Slavic area , as other gods were worshiped too in different regions at different times , often with local names . Natural objects such as rivers , groves or mountains were also celebrated , as well as nymphs , demons , ancestral and other spirits , who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals , which also involved augury . Such beliefs and practices were later continued , developed further and individualized by the many Slavic tribes . 
 The Slavs erected sanctuaries , created statues and other sculptures including the four @-@ faced <unk> , whose carvings symbolize various aspects of the Slavic cosmology model . One 9th @-@ century specimen from the <unk> River in today 's Ukraine , found in 1848 , is on display at the Archeological Museum in Kraków . Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland , in northeastern Germany or Ukraine . In Poland religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania , including Szczecin , where a three @-@ headed deity once stood and the Wolin island , where 9th – to 11th @-@ century cult figurines were found . <unk> confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations .

 The first Slavic state @-@ like entity , the Samo 's Realm of King Samo , originally a Frankish trader , was close to Poland ( in Bohemia and Moravia , parts of Pannonia and more southern regions between the Oder and Elbe rivers ) and existed during the 623 – 658 period . Samo became a Slavic leader by successfully helping the Slavs defend themselves against the Avar assailants . What Samo led was probably a loose alliance of tribes and it fell apart after his death . Slavic <unk> , centered on <unk> Grad ( now <unk> in Austria ) , was more of a real state , developed possibly from one part of the disintegrating Samo 's kingdom , but lasted under a native dynasty throughout the 8th century and became Christianized . 
 = = = Great Moravia = = = 
 Larger scale state @-@ generating processes and in more remote ( in relation to Byzantium ) Slavic areas took place in the 9th century . Great Moravia became established in the early 9th century south of today 's Poland , but eventually encroached on and also included the Silesia and very likely southern Lesser Poland regions . The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries , of which lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular . Such finds however do not extend to the peripheral areas of Great Moravia , the lands that now constitute southern Poland . The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia took place during the reign of Svatopluk I , at the end of 9th century . Beyond the original Moravia and western Slovakia the Great Moravian state incorporated then also , to various degrees , Bohemia , Pannonia and the above @-@ mentioned regions of Poland . In 906 Great Moravia , weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions , ceased to exist . 
 In 831 Mojmir I was baptized and his Moravian state became a part of the Bavarian Passau diocese . Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as political independence from East Frankish influence , his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries . As a result , Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there . To further their goals the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language — the Old Church Slavonic , using the Glagolitic alphabet created by them . Into this language they translated the Bible and other church texts , thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches . 
 = = = Czech state = = = 
 The fall of Great Moravia made room for the expansion of the Czech or Bohemian state , which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands . The founder of the Přemyslid dynasty , Prince Bořivoj was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague . His son and successor <unk> was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite , which marks the early stage of East Frankish / German influence , destined to be decisive in Bohemian affairs . Borivoj 's grandson Prince Wenceslaus , the future Czech martyr and patron saint , was killed , probably in 935 , by his brother Boleslaus . Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the Lesser Poland 's Vistulans and Lendians tribes and at least parts of Silesia . 
 = = = 9th @-@ century Polish lands = = = 
 In the 9th century the Polish lands were still on the peripheries in relation to the major powers and events of medieval Europe , but a measure of civilizational progress did take place , as evidenced by the number of gords built , kurgans raised and movable equipment used . The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire ; objects crafted there have occasionally been found . Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes . The names of some of them , mostly from western part of the country , are known from written sources , especially the Latin @-@ language document written in the mid @-@ 9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer . During this period typically smaller tribal structures were disintegrating , larger ones were being established in their place . 
 Characteristic of the turn of the 10th century in most Polish tribal settlement areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity . The gords were the centers of social and political life . Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them . Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity , while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans . 
 = = = Vistulan state = = = 
 A major development of this period concerns the somewhat enigmatic <unk> , or Vistulans ( Bavarian Geographer 's <unk> ) tribe . The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland , mentioned in several contemporary written sources , already a large tribal union in the first half of the 9th century , were evolving in the second half of that century toward a super @-@ tribal state , until their efforts were terminated by the more powerful neighbors from the south . Kraków , the main town of the Vistulans , with its Wawel gord , was located along a major " international " trade route . The main Vistulan @-@ related archeological find ( in addition to the 8th @-@ century Krakus , Wanda and other large burial mounds and the remnants of several gords ) is the late 9th @-@ century treasure of iron @-@ ax shaped <unk> , well known as currency units in Great Moravia . They were discovered in 1979 in a wooden chest , below the basement of a medieval house on <unk> Street , near the Vistula and the Wawel Hill . The total weight of the iron material is 3630 kilograms and the individual bars of various sizes ( <unk> of them ) were bound in bundles , which suggests that the package was being readied for transportation . 
 According to Constantine VII , in the 7th century Croats were dwelling beyond Bavaria , where White Croats lived in the 10th century . That was probably around the Upper Vistula region and in northern Bohemia . In the 7th century a Croat family of five brothers and two sisters left the area with their folk , and came to Dalmatia , with permission of Emperor Heraclius , to help defend the imperial borders . 
 Vistulan gords , built from the mid @-@ 8th century on , had typically very large area , often over 10 hectares . About 30 big ones are known . The 9th @-@ century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia had likely been built as a defense against Great Moravian military expansion . The largest one , in <unk> , Kazimierza <unk> County , had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments up 18 meters high , but parts of this giant structure were probably built later . The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains , on hills or hillsides . The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent , so for the most part the gords ' role was other than that of settlements or administrative centers . 
 A large ( 2 @.@ 5 hectares ) gord was built at the turn of the 9th century in Zawada Lanckorońska , Tarnów County , and rebuilt after 868 . A treasure found there contains various Great Moravian type decorations dated from the late 9th century through mid @-@ 10th century . The treasure was hidden and the gord destroyed by fire during the second half of that century . 
 The large mounds , up to 50 meters in diameter , are found not only in Kraków , but also in Przemyśl and Sandomierz among other places ( about 20 total ) . They were probably funeral locations of rulers or chiefs , with the actual burial site , on the top of the mound , long lost . Besides the mounds @-@ kurgans , the degree of the Wawel gord development ( built in the 8th century ) and the grzywna treasure point to Kraków as the main center of Vistulan power ( in the past Wiślica was also suspected of that role ) . 
 The most important Vistulans related written reference comes from The Life of Saint Methodius , also known as The Pannonian Legend , written by Methodius ' disciples most likely right after his death ( 885 ) . The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince , residing in the Vistulan country , who reviled the Christians and caused them great harm . He was warned by St. Methodius ' emissaries speaking on the missionary 's behalf ( St. Methodius himself may have been acting as Svatopluk 's agent here ) , advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland . Otherwise , it was predicted , he would be forced to do so in a foreign land , and , according to the Pannonian Legend story , that is what eventually happened . This passage is widely interpreted as the indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of Great Moravia and their pagan prince captured . It would have to happen during Methodius ' second stay in Moravia , between 873 and 885 , and during Svatopluk 's reign . 
 A further elaboration on this story is possibly found in the chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek , written some three centuries later . The chronicler , inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras , talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great . The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland , and the King himself , having previously subjugated the Pannonians , entered through Moravia like through the back door . He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia , leveling in process Kraków 's ancient city walls . It appears that at some point during the intervening period , or by the chronicler himself , the glitter of the Svatopluk 's army became confused with that of the emperor @-@ warrior of another place and time . A dozen or more southern Lesser Poland gords attacked and destroyed at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this version of events . 
 East of the Vistulans , eastern Lesser Poland was the territory of the Lendians ( <unk> , Bavarian Geographer 's <unk> ) tribe . In the mid @-@ 10th century Constantine VII wrote their name as <unk> . The Lendians had to be a very substantial tribe , since the names for Poland in the Lithuanian and Hungarian languages and for the Poles in medieval Ruthenian all begin with the letter " L " , being derived from their tribe 's name . The Poles historically have also referred to themselves as " <unk> " . After the fall of Great Moravia the Magyars controlled at least partially the territory of the Lendians . The Lendians were conquered by Kievan Rus ' during 930 – 940 ; at the end of the 10th century the <unk> lands became divided , with the western part taken by Poland , the eastern portion retained by Kievan Rus ' . 
 The Vistulans were probably also subjected to Magyar raids , as an additional layer of embankments was often added to the gord fortifications in the early part of the 10th century . In the early or mid @-@ 10th century the Vistulan entity , like Silesia , was incorporated by Boleslaus I of Bohemia into the Czech state . This association turned out to be beneficial in terms of economic development , because Kraków was an important station on the Prague — Kiev trade route . The first known Christian church structures were erected on the Wawel Hill . Later in the 10th century , under uncertain circumstances but in a peaceful way ( the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion ) , the Vistulans became a part of the Piast Polish state . 
 = = = Baltic coast = = = 
 In terms of economic and general civilizational achievement the most advanced region in the 9th century was Pomerania , characterized also by most extensive contacts with the external world , and accordingly , cultural richness and diversity . Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands , some of whom were establishing local manufacturing and trade centers ; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite . Some of such industrial area / gord complexes gave rise to early towns — urban centers , such as Wolin , <unk> or Szczecin . The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes , the <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) in the area , each with 70 towns . Despite the high civilizational advancement , no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies , except for the Wolin city @-@ state . 
 The Wolin settlement was established on the island of the same name in the late 8th century . Located at the mouth of the Oder River , Wolin from the beginning was involved with long distance Baltic Sea trade . The settlement , thought to be identical with both Vineta and <unk> , was pagan , multiethnic , and readily kept accepting newcomers , especially craftsmen and other professionals , from all over the world . Being located on a major intercontinental sea route , it soon became a big European industrial and trade power . Writing in the 11th century Adam of Bremen saw Wolin as one of the largest European cities , inhabited by honest , good @-@ natured and hospitable Slavic people , together with other nationalities , from the Greeks to barbarians , including the Saxons , as long as they did not demonstrate their Christianity too openly . 
 Wolin was the major stronghold of the <unk> tribal territory , comprising the island and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland , with its frontier guarded by a string of gords . The city 's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900 , when a new seaport was built ( the municipal complex had now four of them ) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments . The archeological findings there include a great variety of imported ( even from the Far East ) and locally manufactured products and raw materials ; amber and precious metals figure prominently , as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the <unk> elite . 
 Truso in Prussia was another Baltic seaport and trade emporium known from the reworking of the Orosius ' universal history by Alfred the Great . King Alfred included a description of the voyage undertaken around 890 by Wulfstan from the Danish port of Hedeby to Truso located near the mouth of the Vistula . Wulfstan gave a rather detailed description of the location of Truso , within the land of the Aesti , yet right close to the Slavic areas across ( west of ) the Vistula . Truso 's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Janów <unk> , near Elbląg . 
 Established as a seaport by the Vikings and Danish traders at the end of the 8th century in the Prussian border area previously already explored by the Scandinavians , Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century , when it was destroyed and by which time it was replaced in that capacity by Gdańsk . The settlement covered an area of 20 hectares and consisted of a two dock seaport , the craft @-@ trade portion , and the peripheral residential development , all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland . The port @-@ trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it . There were several rows of houses including long Viking hall structures , waterside warehouses , market areas and wooden beam covered streets . Numerous relics were found , including weights used also as currency units , coins from English to Arab and workshops processing metal , jewelry or large quantities of amber . Remnants of long Viking boats were also found , the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce , the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region . The multi @-@ ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia , but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it , from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts . Ironically , Truso 's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid . 
 This connection to the Baltic trade zone led to an establishment of inner @-@ Slavic long @-@ distance trade routes . Lesser Poland participated in exchange centered in the Danubian countries . Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins , often cut into pieces , " grzywna " iron coin equivalents ( of the type used in Great Moravia ) in the Upper Vistula basin and even linen cloths served as currency . 
 = = = Magyar intrusion = = = 
 The Magyars were at first still another wave of nomadic invaders . Of the Uralic languages family , coming from northwestern Siberia , they migrated south and west , occupying from the end of 9th century the Pannonian Basin . From there , until the second half of the 10th century , when they were forced to settle , they raided and pillaged vast areas of Europe , including Poland . A saber and ornamental elements were found in a Hungarian warrior 's grave ( from the first half of the 10th century ) in the Przemyśl area . 
 Geographically the Magyar invasions interfered with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and Byzantine Christianity centers . It may have been the decisive factor that steered Poland toward the Western ( Latin ) branch of Christianity by the time of its adoption in 966 . 
 = = 10th @-@ century developments in Greater Poland ; Mieszko 's state = = 
 = = = Tribal Greater Poland = = = 
 This period brought a notable development in settlement stability on Polish lands . Short @-@ lived prehistoric settlements gradually gave way to villages on fixed sites . The number of villages grew with time , but their sites rarely shifted . The population distribution patterns established from that century on are evident on today 's landscape . 
 Sources from the 9th and 10th centuries make no mention of the Polans ( Polanie ) tribe . The closest thing would be the huge ( 400 gords ) <unk> tribe of the Bavarian Geographer , whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake <unk> , but archeological investigations cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake <unk> area . What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th @-@ century Greater Poland , one around the upper and middle Obra River basin , one in the lower Obra basin , and another one west of the Warta River . There was the Gniezno area tribe , whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center — the Lech Hill of today 's Gniezno . Throughout the 9th century the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural , or settlement pattern sense . The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences , such as from the highly developed Moravian @-@ Czech or Baltic Sea centers . Such separation ( also from the more expansive powers ) was probably a positive factor , facilitating at this stage the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there , known as the Piast House , which resulted in the early part of the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic state . 
 = = = Mieszko 's state and its origins = = = 
 What was later to be called Gniezno state , also known as Mieszko 's state , was expanded at the expense of the subdued tribes in Mieszko 's grandfather and father times , and in particular by Mieszko himself . Writing around 965 or 966 Ibrahim ibn Yaqub described the country of Mieszko , " the king of the North " , as the most wide @-@ ranging of the Slavic lands . Mieszko , the ruler of the Slavs , was also mentioned as such at that time by Widukind of Corvey in his Res <unk> <unk> . In its mature form this state included the West Slavic lands between the Oder and Bug rivers and between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains , including the economically crucial mouth areas of the Vistula and Oder rivers , as well as Lesser Poland and Silesia . 
 The name of Poles ( <unk> , <unk> , Polans ) appears in writing for the first time around year 1000 , like the country 's name Poland ( Latinized as Polonia ) . " Polanie " was possibly the name given by later historians to the inhabitants of Greater Poland ( a presumed tribe not mentioned in earlier sources ) . 10th @-@ century inhabitants of Greater Poland would originate from unknown ( by name ) tribes , which were instrumental in bringing about the establishment of the Polish state ; one such tribe had to constitute the immediate power base of Mieszko 's predecessors , if not Mieszko himself . 
 = = = Gallus Anonymus ' account vs. archeology = = = 
 In the early 12th century chronicler Gallus Anonymus wrote down or invented a dynastic legend of the House of Piasts . The story gives , amid miraculous details , the names of the supposed ancestors of the royal family , beginning with a man named <unk> , the father of the central figure Piast , who was a humble farmer living in Gniezno , married to <unk> . The male heads of the Piast clan following after him were , according to Gallus , Siemowit , Lestek , Siemomysł and Mieszko I , the first " Piast " known with historic certainty . Gallus expressed his own misgivings concerning the trustworthiness of the royal story he passed on ( he qualified it with words like " oblivion " , " error " and " idolatry " ) , but the sequence of the last three names of Mieszko 's predecessors he considered reliable . 
 The results of archeological studies of the Greater Poland 's 9th- and 10th @-@ century gords are at odds with the timing of this story . There was no Gniezno settlement in the 9th century ; there was a pagan cult site there beginning with the turn of the 10th century . The Gniezno gord was built around year 940 , possibly because the location , being of great spiritual importance to the tribal community , would rally the local population around the building and defense effort . 
 = = = Early Piast state and its expansion = = = 
 Under the old tribal system , the tribal assembly elected a chief in case of an external threat , to lead the defense effort , and it was a temporarily granted authority . The Piast clan was able to replace it in Gniezno area with its own hereditary rule over the tribe that inhabited it , which was in line with the trends of the times , and allowed them to create the state that they controlled . Greater Poland during the first half of the 10th century was not particularly densely populated or economically developed , lagging behind such regions as Pomerania , Silesia and Lesser Poland . It was favored by the above @-@ mentioned geographic isolation , central location among the culturally similar tribes and extensive network of suitable for transportation rivers . What made the ultimate difference however could be that some Piast family members were exceptional individuals , able to take advantage of the arising opportunities . 
 The development of the Piast state can be traced to some degree by following the disappearance of the old tribal gords ( many of them were built in Greater Poland during the later part of the 9th century and soon thereafter ) , destroyed by the advancing Gniezno tribe people . For example , the gords in <unk> , Września County and in <unk> , <unk> County , both built soon after 899 , were attacked and taken over by the Piast state forces , the first one burned during the initial period of the armed expansion . The old gords were often rebuilt and enlarged or replaced , beginning in the first decades of the 10th century , by new , large and massively reinforced Piast gords . Gords of this type were erected or reconstructed from earlier ones initially in the tribe 's native Gniezno Land and then elsewhere in central Greater Poland , in <unk> near Września ( 920 – 930 ) , Ostrów Lednicki , Giecz , Gniezno , <unk> in Poznań County , <unk> in <unk> County and in Poznań ( Ostrów <unk> ) . Connected by water communication lines , in the mid @-@ 10th century the powerful gords served as the main concentrations of forces of the emerging state . 
 In parallel with the gord building activity ( 920 – 950 ) the Piasts undertook military expansion , crossing the Warta and moving towards the end of this period south and west within the Oder River basin . The entire network of tribal gords between the Obra and <unk> rivers , among other places , was eliminated . The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland , which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well @-@ developed regions . At the end of this stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords were built in the ( north ) Noteć River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands , for example in <unk> and <unk> around 970 . During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished — besides Greater Poland with Kujawy it included also much of central Poland . Masovia and parts of Pomerania found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence , while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled , because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state . 
 The expanding Piast state developed a professional military force . According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , Mieszko collected taxes in the form of weights used for trading and spent those taxes as monthly pay for his warriors . He had three thousands of heavily armored mounted soldiers alone , whose quality according to Ibrahim was very impressive . Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs , even military pay for their children regardless of their gender , from the moment they were born . This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters . Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords , many of them of foreign , e.g. Frankish or Scandinavian origin . Mercenaries from these regions , as well as German and Norman knights , constituted a significant element of Mieszko 's elite fighting guard . 
 = = = Revenue generating measures and conquests = = = 
 To sustain this military machine and to meet other state expenses large amounts of revenue were necessary . Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade such as fur , hide , honey and wax , but those surely did not provide enough income . According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , Prague in Bohemia , a city built of stone , was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities in this part of Europe . The Slavic traders brought here from Kraków tin , salt , amber and other products they had and most importantly slaves ; Muslim , Jewish , Hungarian and other traders were the buyers . The Life of St. Adalbert , written at the end of the 10th century by John <unk> , lists the fate of many Christian slaves , sold in Prague " for the wretched gold " , as the main curse of the time . Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th @-@ century Gniezno Doors . It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself , and partially the expanding state , by being the source of loot , of which the captured local people were the most valuable part . The scale of the human trade practice is however arguable , because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near @-@ gord settlements , where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state . Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe . The slave trade not being enough , the Piast state had to look for other options for generating revenue . 
 Thus , Mieszko <unk> to subdue Pomerania at the Baltic coast . The area was the site of wealthy trade <unk> , frequently visited by traders , especially from the east , west and north . Mieszko had every reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes , such as Wolin , Szczecin and Kołobrzeg . 
 The Piast state reached the mouth of the Vistula first . Based on the investigations of the gords erected along the middle and lower Vistula , it appears that the lower Vistula waterway was under Piast control from about the mid @-@ 10th century . A powerful gord built in Gdańsk , under Mieszko at the latest , solidified the Piast rule over Pomerelia . However , the mouth of the Oder River was firmly controlled by the Jomsvikings and the <unk> , who were allied with the Veleti . " The Veleti are fighting Mieszko " , reported Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , " and their military might is great " . Widukind wrote about the events of 963 , involving the person of the Saxon count Wichmann the Younger , an adventurer exiled from his country . According to Widukind , " Wichmann went to the barbarians ( probably the Veleti or the <unk> ) and leading them ( ... ) defeated Mieszko twice , killed his brother , and acquired a great deal of spoils " . Thietmar of Merseburg also reports that Mieszko with his people became in 963 , together with other Slavic entities such as the <unk> , subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor , forced into that role by the powerful Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March . 
 = = = Mieszko 's relationship with Emperor Otto I = = = 
 Such series of military reverses and detrimental relationships , which also involved the Czech <unk> allied with the Veleti , compelled Mieszko to seek the support of the German Emperor Otto I. After the contacts were made , Widukind described Mieszko as " a friend of the Emperor " . A pact was negotiated and finalized no later than in 965 . The price Mieszko had to pay for the imperial protection was becoming the Emperor 's vassal , paying him tribute from the lands up to the Warta River , and , very likely , making a promise of accepting Christianity . 
 = = = Mieszko 's acceptance of Christianity = = = 
 In response to the immediate practical concerns , the Christian Church was installed in Poland in its Western Latin Rite . The act brought Mieszko 's country into the realm of the ancient Mediterranean culture . Of the issues requiring urgent attention the preeminent was the increasing pressure of the eastbound expansion ( between the Elbe and the Oder rivers ) of the German state , and its plans to control the parallel expansion of the Church through the archdiocese in Magdeburg , the establishment of which was finalized in 968 . 
 The baptism and the attendant processes did not take place through Mieszko 's German connections . At that time Mieszko was in process of fixing the uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of Boleslaus I. The difficulties were caused mainly by the Czech cooperation with the Veleti . Already in 964 the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues . In 965 Mieszko married Boleslaus ' daughter Doubravka . Mieszko 's chosen Christian princess , a woman possibly in her twenties , was a devout Christian and Mieszko 's own conversion had to be a part of the deal . This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland , a region up to that point , unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia , not exposed to Christian influence . In 968 an independent missionary bishopric , reporting directly to the Pope , was established , with Jordan installed as the first bishop . 
 The scope of the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land . Stone churches and baptisteries were discovered within the Ostrów Lednicki and Poznań gords , a chapel in Gniezno . Poznań was also the site of the first cathedral , the bishopric seat of Jordan and Bishop Unger , who followed him . 
 = = = Piast early expansion , Great Moravian and Norman contributions = = = 
 Newer research points out some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early origins of the Polish state in Greater Poland . There are indications that the processes that led to the establishment of the Piast state began during the 890 – 910 period . During these years a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland , as the unearthed products of all kinds are better made and more elaborate . The timing coincides with the breakdown of the Great Moravian state caused by the Magyar invasions . Before and after its 905 – 907 fall , fearing for their lives many Great Moravian people had to escape . According to the notes made by Constantine VII , they found refuge in the neighboring countries . Decorations found in <unk> graves in Poznań have their counterparts in burial sites around Nitra in Slovakia . In Nitra area also there was in medieval times a well @-@ known clan named Poznan . The above indicates that the Poznań town was established by <unk> refugees , and more generally , the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands . 
 Early expansion of the Gniezno Land tribe began very likely under Mieszko 's grandfather Lestek , the probable real founder of the Piast state . Widukind 's chronicle speaks of Mieszko ruling the Slavic nation called " <unk> " , which was what Widukind made out of " <unk> " , the people of <unk> , or Lestek . Lestek was also reflected in the sagas of the Normans , who may have played a role in Poland 's origins ( an accumulation of 930 – 1000 period treasures is attributed to them ) . Siemomysł and then Mieszko continued after Lestek , whose tradition was alive within the Piast court when Bolesław III <unk> gave this name to one of his sons and Gallus Anonymous wrote his chronicle . The " <unk> " term popular later , synonymous with " Poles " , like the legend of Lech , written in a chronicle at the turn of the 14th century , may also have been inspired by Mieszko 's grandfather . 
 = = = Early capitals , large scale gord construction = = = 
 There is some disagreement as to the early seat of the ruling clan . Modern archeology has shown that the gord in Gniezno had not even existed before about 940 . This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno 's early central role , which is what had long been believed , based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus . The relics ( including a great concentration of silver treasures ) found in Giecz , where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier , later turned into a powerful Piast stronghold , point to that location . Other likely early capitals include the old gords of <unk> , Kalisz ( located away from Gniezno Land ) or Poznań . Poznań , which is older than Gniezno , was probably the original Mieszko 's court site in the earlier years of his reign . The first cathedral church , a monumental structure , was erected there . The events of 974 – 978 , when Mieszko , like his brother @-@ in @-@ law Boleslaus II of Bohemia , supported Henry II in his rebellion against Otto II , created a threat of the Emperor 's retribution . The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to the safer , because of its more eastern location , Gniezno . The Emperor 's response turned out to be ineffective , but this geographical advantage continued in the years to come . The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of the new southern part to the original two segments of the gord . In the existing summary of the Dagome iudex document written 991 / 992 before Mieszko 's death , Mieszko 's state is called Civitas <unk> , or Gniezno State . 
 The enormous effort of the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousands of residents of the Gniezno region , who were involved in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords ( all of the local supply of oak timber was exhausted ) , was made in response to a perceived deadly threat , not just to help them pursue regional conquests . After 935 , when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko 's father Siemomysł , the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany . The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community . Also a Polabian Slavs uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I , and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time ( unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto , helping restrain the <unk> ) . When the situation stabilized , the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast 's own expansion , led at this stage by Siemomysł . 
 = = = Alliance with Germany and conquest of Pomerania = = = 
 Fighting the Veleti from the beginning of Mieszko 's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany . The alliance was natural at this point , because , as the Polish state was expanding westbound , the German state was expanding eastbound , with the Veleti in between being the common target . A victory was achieved in September of 967 , when Wichmann , leading this time ( according to Widukind ) forces of the <unk> , was killed , and Mieszko , helped by additional mounted units provided by his father @-@ in @-@ law Boleslaus , had his revenge . Mieszko 's victory was recognized by the Emperor as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs , which distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies . This new status allowed Mieszko to successfully pursue the efforts leading to obtaining by his country an independent bishopric . The Poles thus had their bishopric even before the Czechs , whose tradition of Christianity was much older . The 967 victory , as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of <unk> of 972 , allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania . Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan . Kołobrzeg , where a strong gord was built around 985 , was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania . Before , a Scandinavian colony in <unk> @-@ <unk> near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area . The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania ( the region referred to by Polish historians as Western Pomerania , roughly within the current Polish borders , as opposed to Gdańsk Pomerania or Pomerelia ) , became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005 ; that was after Mieszko 's death , when Poland was ruled by his son Bolesław . 
 = = = Completion of Poland 's territorial expansion under Mieszko = = = 
 Around 980 in the west Lubusz Land was also under Mieszko 's control and another important gord was built in Włocławek much further east . Masovia was still more loosely associated with the Piast state , while the Sandomierz region was for a while their southern outpost . 
 The construction of powerful Piast gords in western Silesia region along the Oder River ( Głogów , Wrocław and Opole ) took place in 985 at the latest . The alliance with the Czechs was by that time over ( Doubravka died in 977 , leaving two children Bolesław and <unk> ) , Mieszko allied with Germany fought the <unk> and took over that part of Silesia and then also eastern Lesser Poland , the <unk> lands . In 989 Kraków with the rest of Lesser Poland was taken over . The region , autonomous under the Czech rule , also enjoyed a special status within the Piast state . In 990 eastern Silesia was added , which completed the Piast takeover of southern Poland . By the end of Mieszko 's life , his state included the West Slavic lands in geographic proximity and connected by natural features , such as an absence of mountain ranges , to the Piast territorial nucleus of Greater Poland . Those lands have sometimes been regarded by historians as " <unk> " , or ethnically Polish , even though linguistically in the 10th century all the western Slavic tribes , including the Czechs , were quite similar . 
 Silver treasures , common in the Scandinavian countries , are found also in Slavic areas including Poland , especially northern Poland . Silver objects , coins and decorations , often cut into pieces , are believed to have served as currency units , brought in by Jewish and Arab traders , but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige . The process of hiding or depositing them , besides protecting them from danger , is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual . 
 A treasure located in Góra <unk> , Białystok County , hidden after 901 , includes <unk> coins minted between 764 and 901 and Slavic decorations made in southern Ruthenia , showing Byzantine influence . This find is a manifestation of a 10th @-@ century trade route running all the way from Central Asia , through Byzantium , Kiev , the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers basins and Masovia , to the Baltic Sea shores . Such treasures most likely belonged to members of the emerging elites . 
 = The Good Huswifes Jewell = 
 The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English cookery book by the cookery and housekeeping writer Thomas Dawson , first published in 1585 . It includes recipes for medicines as well as food . To the spices found in Medieval English cooking , the book adds herbs , especially parsley and thyme . Sugar is used in many of the dishes , along with now @-@ unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater . 
 The book includes recipes still current , such as pancakes , haggis , and salad of leaves and flowers with vinaigrette sauce , as well as some not often made , such as mortis , a sweet chicken pâté . Some dishes have familiar names , such as trifle , but different ingredients from those used today . 
 The Jewell is the first English cookery book to give a recipe for sweet potatoes . 
 = = Context = = 
 The Elizabethan age represented the period of transition from Medieval to modern . Cookery was changing as trade brought new ingredients , and fashion favoured new styles of cooking , with , for example , locally @-@ grown herbs as well as imported spices . Cooking came to be seen as a subject in its own right , rather than being part of medicine or books of " secrets " . Little is known of the book 's author , Thomas Dawson , beyond the bare fact that he published several books on cooking including also his 1620 Booke of <unk> . Such books were becoming available to a wider audience than the aristocratic households of the Middle Ages , hence the " <unk> " of Dawson 's title . 
 = = Book = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The Good Huswifes Jewell gives recipes for making fruit tarts using fruits as varied as apple , peach , cherry , damson , pear , and mulberry . For stuffing for meat and poultry , or as Dawson says " to <unk> all things " , he recommends using the herbs thyme , hyssop , and parsley , mixed with egg yolk , white bread , raisins or barberries , and spices including cloves , mace , cinnamon and ginger , all in the same dish . A sauce for pork was made with white wine , broth , nutmeg , and the herbs rosemary , bay , thyme , and marjoram . 
 Familiar recipes include pancakes , which were made with cream , egg yolks , flour , and a little ale ; the cook was directed " let the fire be verie soft , and when the one side is baked , then turn the other , and bake them as dry as ye can without burning . " Blancmange appears as " <unk> " , made of cream , eggs , sugar and rosewater . 
 = = = Approach = = = 
 The recipes are written as goals , like " To make a <unk> of <unk> " , with instructions to achieve the goal . Quantities are given , if at all , only in passing , either with vague phrases like " a good handful of <unk> and a few sweet <unk> " , or as " the yolks of 4 hard <unk> " . Cooking times are given only occasionally , as " let them <unk> a <unk> of an <unk> " . Directions as to the fire are given where necessary , as " <unk> it in a chafing dish of <unk> " or " with a fyre of Wood <unk> it the space of two <unk> " . 
 The recipe for a salad with a vinaigrette dressing runs as follows ( from the 1596 edition ) : 
 To Make a <unk> of All Kinde of <unk> 
 Take your <unk> and <unk> them very fine into faire water , and <unk> your flowers by <unk> , and <unk> them al <unk> , and swing them in a strainer , and when you put them into a dish , mingle them with <unk> or Lemmons <unk> and sliced , and scrape Suger , and put in <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> the flowers on the toppe of the sallet , and of every sorte of the <unk> things and garnish the dish about with the <unk> things , and <unk> <unk> <unk> and laide about the dish and upon the sallet .

 The celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright comments on Dawson 's trifle that it differs from the modern recipe , as it consists only of " a <unk> of <unk> <unk> " , seasoned with sugar , ginger and rosewater , and warmed gently for serving . She notes , also from the Good Huswife 's Jewell , that the Elizabethans had a strong liking for sweet things , " richly demonstrated " in Dawson 's " names of all things necessary for a banquet " : 
 Sugar , cinnamon , liquorice , pepper , nutmegs , all kinds of saffron , sanders , comfits , <unk> , coriander , oranges , pomegranate seeds , Damask water , <unk> , lemons , prunes , rose water , dates , currants , raisins , cherries conserved , barberries conserved , rye flower , ginger , sweet oranges , pepper white and brown , mace , wafers . 
 The culinary historian Alison Sim notes that " the closest the Tudors came to sponge were sponge @-@ like biscuits " , which could be raised with eggs or with yeast ; the " <unk> " in the Jewell were boiled before baking , being put into boiling water where they would sink and then rise to the top . Sim notes that Dawson 's " fine <unk> bread " had to be beaten for two hours . 
 The culinary historian Ken Albala describes the Jewell as an " important cookbook " , and observes that it is the first English cookery book to give a recipe for sweet potatoes , while also listing " old medieval standbys " . He comments that there are several pudding recipes , both savoury and sweet , including haggis . He notes , too , that it gives instructions for the marzipan figures " so beloved on the Elizabethan <unk> table . " 
 The culinary historian Stephen Mennell calls the Jewell " more distinctively English " than the Boke of <unk> and the Boke of <unk> from earlier in the century . It , like Gervase Markham 's The English Hus @-@ Wife of 1615 , was aimed at a more general audience , not only aristocrats but " housewives " , which Mennell glosses as " gentlewomen concerned with the practical tasks of running households " . Hence the book could treat not only food but medicines , dairy @-@ work , brewing , and preserving . 
 The historian Joanna <unk> notes that the Elizabethans used what " may seem odd ingredients today " , such as rosewater and violets , and that Dawson provides a recipe for salmon with violets , the recipe calling for slices of onion with violets , oil , and vinegar . She also notes that sugar was included " in almost every kind of dish " , as well as spices that we would use in " sweet rather than savory dishes . " 
 = Terra ( Kingdom Hearts ) = 
 Terra ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Tera ) is a fictional character from Square Enix 's video game franchise Kingdom Hearts . He was introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as one of the three protagonists . He had a cameo appearance in a secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II and its re @-@ release Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix ; the later game included an optional boss fight against the Lingering Will ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , a hollow armor containing Terra 's mind . In Birth by Sleep , Terra appears as one of the apprentices from Master Eraqus who trains him alongside his friends Aqua and Ventus to become masters of the Keyblade weapon . When Master Xehanort disappears , Terra is sent to find him and also tame the growing darkness within himself . 
 Terra 's character was designed by the director series Tetsuya Nomura when preparing the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix . He was developed to be reminiscent to the Xehanort featured in previous titles as well as having a connection with Riku , one of the series ' main characters . Ryōtarō Okiayu has done the voice of Terra in Japanese and Jason Dohring in the English version . Video game publications gave mixed responses to Terra 's character , with many noting his similarity to the Final Fantasy VII character Zack Fair and later commenting on his naive portrayal in Birth by Sleep . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Terra first made cameos in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix which depicted events from Birth by Sleep . Additionally , the Lingering Will , an armor containing Terra 's will , appears in Kingdom Hearts II : Final Mix as an optional boss in the world Keyblade Graveyard . The Lingering Will fights the game 's protagonist Sora upon sensing Sora 's Keyblade and mistaking Sora for Xehanort and acknowledges Sora as a Keyblade Master afterward . 
 In the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep , Terra is a trainee from Master Eraqus alongside Aqua and Ventus , developing a strong sibling @-@ like bond with both of them . One day , Terra participates with Aqua in an exam to become Keyblade Masters . Terra fails to pass the test as Eraqus detects darkness in his heart , which he disapproves . Eraqus later informs Terra and Aqua about the appearance of creatures known as the Unversed and the disappearance of Master Xehanort . He orders both of them to eliminate the Unversed and find Xehanort . During his search for the missing Xehanort , he interacts with several Disney characters for information on his whereabouts as he faces his inner darkness . When finding Xehanort , Terra is requested by him to kill Vanitas , a figure made from Ventus 's darkness and source of all the Unversed . Xehanort later makes Terra return to the Land of Departure to stop Eraqus from killing Ventus . Unwilling to let Ventus die , Terra rescues him and confronts Eraqus . As the battle finishes , both Terra and Eraqus apologize to each other for their actions , but Eraqus is then killed by Xehanort . Realizing Xehanort 's true nature , Terra goes to the Keyblade Graveyard where he reunites with Ventus and Aqua , and prepares to face Xehanort . There , Ventus tells Aqua and him that Xehanort plans to use him and Vanitas to create the legendary χ @-@ blade to help him in his plans which caused Eraqus to try to kill him . The three are then confronted by Xehanort and Vanitas and proceed to fight . When Ventus and Aqua are wounded in battle , Terra attacks Xehanort alone and unleashes the darkness in his heart , allowing Xehanort to take over his body . However , Terra 's mind persists in his discarded armor , becoming the Lingering Will , and continues to fight Xehanort , knocking him out . The Lingering Will remains in the Keyblade Graveyard , while Terra 's heart has an internal struggle with Xehanort 's in his original body when Xehanort battles Aqua . This results in Xehanort stabbing himself to stop Terra , but Terra 's presence remains within Xehanort , swearing to stop him . 
 While Terra does not appear in Kingdom Hearts Re : coded , aside from the Lingering Will making a cameo in the opening , he is mentioned by King Mickey , who is searching for the Birth by Sleep protagonists . Terra briefly appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop Distance during Sora 's dream , where Sora 's friends , Riku and Kairi , are transformed into Terra and Aqua . Terra also appears when Sora declares his pride in being connected to many Keyblade wielders . 
 A vision of Terra makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts 0 @.@ 2 Birth by Sleep : A fragmentary passage , a part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 8 Final Chapter Prologue . He appears to Aqua as she laments not being able to reverse time to spend one more night with her friends . While she is shocked at his appearance , thinking that he did not make it out of the Realm of Darkness , she resolves to continue her journey . 
 Terra 's role from Birth by Sleep is reprised in Tomoko <unk> 's light novels of the game . Additionally , the final chapter shows the Lingering Will fighting Sora from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix .

 Although Terra , Ventus and Aqua first appeared in the ending of Kingdom Hearts II wearing armor , director Tetsuya Nomura still had not designed their real look , having only thought about their story . Despite not revealing their identities , Nomura still said that they are characters from the past from the Kingdom Hearts series . Following the release of the Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , Nomura revealed a connection between them and the game 's villain Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people 's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity . Terra 's face was first shown in the 2006 Tokyo Game Show in which he was described as an avenger of Xehanort . Nomura also confirmed that Lingering Will was connected with Terra . He also stated that his name means " earth " from Latin , following the " land " theme Riku represents as well as connecting him with the other main characters ' names from the series . In October 2007 , Nomura was asked if the Lingering Will was actually Terra due to their similarities , but he responded it was still uncertain . When asked about what was the Will 's true nature after being revealed to contain Terra 's memories , Nomura stated it was not a Heartless . Nomura expressed that the fans liked the inclusion of the Will 's battle due to his challenging difficulty , which led the staff to design another hard boss character for Birth by Sleep . 
 From the three protagonists from Birth by Sleep , Terra 's design was the only which was decided how should it be from the start , with Nomura stating he would be designed younger than shown in previous games . Japanese @-@ inspired designs were incorporated into Terra 's outfit based on the " master and apprentice " relationship featured in the game . Nomura had troubles designing Terra 's , Ventus 's and Aqua 's armors due how they would be able to summon them . Therefore , an " X " was added to their clothes as a mean to activate the armors as well as due to the fact it was one of the game 's keywords . Ever since development of Birth by Sleep started , the staff already decided that the three stories would be told in separate scenarios with Terra 's story being the first one written . Terra 's conversation with Riku was written by Nomura early on development wishing to explain the reason for Riku 's ability to use the Keyblade , and he requested the staff in charge to make it into the game . The staff also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series , leading to the interaction between the three scenarios . Nomura recommended players to first play as Terra in Birth by Sleep in order to understand the story better . His gameplay was also described by Nomura as " heavy " in comparison to Ventus 's and Aqua 's . 
 To expand the connection between Terra and Riku , scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra 's perspective were added to the game , though Nomura has stated that these foreshadows are not of a precognitive nature . Nomura expects that in future games , the connection between both of them would be expanded . Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra 's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka , Xehanort 's voice actor , and Akio Ōtsuka , Xehanort 's voice actor while using Terra 's body . The staff found Chikao 's was a dry sort of voice , Akio 's a deep resonating sort of voice , and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors .

 When Terra 's character was first revealed , 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish found him to be very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII to the point where he wondered whether he would actually be Zack . However , when considering Terra 's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games , he thought he may not be Zack . Amanda L. <unk> from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack , but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series . Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN 's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish , finding only minor differences between their outfits . 
 Terra 's role in Birth by Sleep has received mixed critics with Adam <unk> from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing . VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may know little about them due to their role in Kingdom Hearts II , but with Birth by Sleep , players will able to know about them . Writing for GamesRadar , <unk> Antista commented that he did not understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II , although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep . PlayStation LifeStyle 's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise , finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds . X @-@ Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil 's allure .

It has also been referred to as the Underground Great Wall since it was built for the purpose of military defense . The complex was constructed from 1969 to 1979 in anticipation of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union , as Sino @-@ Soviet relations worsened and was officially reopened in 2000 . Visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex , which has been described as " dark , damp , and genuinely eerie " . <unk> Cheng has been closed for renovation since at least February 2008 .

 At the height of Soviet @-@ Chinese tensions in 1969 , Chinese chairman Mao Zedong ordered the construction of the Underground City during the border conflict over <unk> Island in the Heilongjiang River . The Underground City was designed to withstand nuclear , biochemical and conventional attacks . The complex would protect Beijing 's population , and allow government officials to evacuate in the event of an attack on the city . The government claimed that the tunnels could accommodate all of Beijing 's six million inhabitants upon its completion . 
 The complex was equipped with facilities such as restaurants , clinics , schools , theaters , factories , a roller skating rink , grain and oil warehouses , and a mushroom cultivation farm . There were also almost 70 potential sites where water wells could easily be dug if needed . Elaborate ventilation systems were installed , with 2300 shafts that can be sealed off to protect the tunnels ' inhabitants from poison gases , <unk> and water @-@ proof hatches , as well as thick concrete main gates , were constructed to protect the tunnels from biochemical attacks and nuclear fallouts . 
 There is no official disclosure about the actual extent of the complex , but it is speculated that the tunnels may link together Beijing 's various landmarks , as well as important governmental buildings such as the Zhongnanhai , the Great Hall of the People , and even military bases in the outskirts of the city . The China Internet Information Center asserts that " they supposedly link all areas of central Beijing , from <unk> and <unk> to Qianmen and [ the ] Chongwen district " , in addition to the Western Hills . It is also rumoured that every residence once had a secret trapdoor nearby leading to the tunnels . In the event of a nuclear attack , the plan was to move half of Beijing 's population underground and the other half to the Western Hills . 
 The tunnels were built by more than 300 @,@ 000 local citizens , including school students , on volunteer duties . Some portions were even dug without the help of any heavy machinery . Centuries @-@ old city walls , towers and gates , including the old city gates of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were destroyed to supply construction materials for the complex . 
 Since the complex 's completion , it has been utilized by locals for in various ways as the tunnels remain cool in summer and warm in winter . On busy streets , some portions of the complex were refurbished as cheap hotels , while others were transformed into shopping and business centers , or even theaters . 
 While the complex has never been used for its intended purpose , it has never been fully abandoned either . Local authorities still perform water leakage checks and pest control in the tunnels on a regular basis .
