 = = = Ethnic groups = = = 
 Four ethnic groups were recognized in Imperial Brazil : white , black , Indian and brown . Brown ( Portuguese : pardo ) was a designation for multiracial Brazilians which is still officially used , though some scholars prefer the term " mixed one " ( Portuguese : <unk> ) . The term denotes a broad category which includes caboclos ( descendants of whites and Indians ) , mulattoes ( descendants of whites and blacks ) and <unk> ( descendants of blacks and Indians ) . 
 The caboclos formed the majority of the population in the Northern , Northeastern and Central @-@ Western regions . A large mulatto population inhabited the eastern coast of the northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba and were also present in northern Maranhão , southern Minas Gerais , eastern Rio de Janeiro and in Espírito Santo . The <unk> were the smallest and most difficult to distinguish from the two other mixed @-@ race subgroups since the descendants of caboclos and mulattoes also fell into this category and were found in the northeast sertão ( English : hinterland ) . These groups may still be found in the same areas today . 
 White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers . From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants : mainly Italians , Spaniards and Germans . Although whites could be found throughout the country , they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province . Whites also comprised a significant proportion ( 40 % ) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará , Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte . Black Brazilians of Sub @-@ Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes . The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro , Minas Gerais , Espírito Santo , Bahia , Sergipe , Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces ( the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country — less than 30 % in each ) were black or brown . The Indians , the indigenous peoples of Brazil , were found mainly in Piauí , Maranhão , Pará and Amazonas . 
 Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities , 19th century Brazil developed as a multi @-@ ethnic nation . However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872 . The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9 @,@ 930 @,@ 479 inhabitants there were 38 @.@ 1 % whites , 38 @.@ 3 % browns , 19 @.@ 7 % blacks and 3 @.@ 9 % Indians .

 = = = European immigration = = = 
 Prior to 1808 , the Portuguese were the only European people to settle Brazil in significant numbers . Although British , Germans , Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil , they had only done so as a small number of individuals or in very small groups . These earliest non @-@ Portuguese settlers did not have a significant impact on the culture of Portugal 's Brazilian colony . The situation changed after 1808 when King João VI began to encourage immigration from European countries outside Portugal . 
 The first to arrive in numbers were the Swiss , of whom some 2 @,@ 000 settled in Rio de Janeiro province during 1818 . They were followed by Germans and Irish , who immigrated to Brazil in the 1820s . German settlers gravitated mostly to the southern provinces , where the environment was more like their homeland . In the 1830s , due to the instability of the Regency , European immigration ground to a halt , only recovering after Pedro II took the reins of government and the country entered a period of peace and prosperity . Farmers in the southeast , enriched by lucrative coffee exports , created the " partnership system " ( a form of indentured servitude ) to attract immigrants . The scheme endured until the end of the 1850s , when the system collapsed and was abandoned . The failure was rooted in the large debts European settlers incurred in order to subsidize their travel and settlement expenses , leaving them as virtual slaves to their employers . Immigration suffered another decline during the Paraguayan War , which lasted from 1864 to 1870 . 
 Immigrant numbers soared during the 1870s in what came to be called the " great immigration " . Up to that point , around 10 @,@ 000 Europeans arrived in Brazil annually , but after 1872 , their numbers increased dramatically . It is estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics that 500 @,@ 000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1883 . The figure for European settlers arriving between 1884 and 1893 climbed to 883 @,@ 668 . The number of Europeans immigrating continued to rise in the following decades , with 862 @,@ 100 between 1894 and 1903 ; and 1 @,@ 006 @,@ 617 between 1904 and 1913 . 
 From 1872 until 1879 , the nationalities forming the bulk of the new settlers were composed of Portuguese ( 31 @.@ 2 % ) , Italians ( 25 @.@ 8 % ) , Germans ( 8 @.@ 1 % ) and Spanish ( 1 @.@ 9 % ) . In the 1880s , Italians would surpass the Portuguese ( 61 @.@ 8 % to 23 @.@ 3 % respectively ) , and the Spanish would displace the Germans ( 6 @.@ 7 % to 4 @.@ 2 % respectively ) . Other , smaller groups also arrived , including Russians , Poles and Hungarians . Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire , ethnic distribution , already unequal before the mass immigration , became even more divergent between regions . For a nation that had a small , widely scattered population ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 1823 and 14 @,@ 333 @,@ 915 in 1890 ) , the immigration of more than 1 @,@ 380 @,@ 000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country 's ethnic composition . In 1872 , the year of the first reliable national census , white Brazilians represented just over a third ( 38 @.@ 1 % ) of the total population ; in 1890 , they had increased to a little under half ( 44 @.@ 0 % ) of all Brazilians . 
 = = = Slavery = = = 
 In 1823 , a year after independence , slaves made up 29 % of the population of Brazil , a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire : from 24 % in 1854 , to 15 @.@ 2 % in 1872 , and finally to less than 5 % in 1887 — the year before slavery was completely abolished . Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa . Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically , religiously and linguistically , each identifying primarily with his or her own nation of origin , rather than by a shared African ethnicity . Some of the slaves brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting intertribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers . 
 Slaves and their descendants were usually found in regions devoted to producing exports for foreign markets . Sugarcane plantations on the eastern coast of the northeast region during the 16th and 17th centuries are typical of economic activities dependent on slave labor . In northern Maranhão province , slave labor was used in cotton and rice production in the 18th century . In this period , slaves were also exploited in Minas Gerais province where gold was extracted . Slavery was also common in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo during the 19th century for the cultivation of coffee which became vital to the national economy . The prevalence of slavery was not geographically uniform across Brazil . Around 1870 only five provinces ( Rio de Janeiro with 30 % , Bahia with 15 % , Minas Gerais with 14 % , São Paulo with 7 % and Rio Grande do Sul also with 7 % ) held 73 % of the nation 's total slave population . These were followed by Pernambuco ( with 6 % ) and Alagoas ( with 4 % ) . Among the remaining 13 provinces none individually had even 3 % . 
 Most slaves worked as plantation laborers . Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most small and medium @-@ sized farms employed free workers . Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities : some were used as house servants , farmers , miners , prostitutes , gardeners and in many other roles . Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves . While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves who appeared to be of European descent — the product of generations of inter @-@ ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves . Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long @-@ established practice of selling slaves along with their families , taking care not to separate individuals . Slaves were regarded by law as properties . The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed — the only exception being that , until 1881 , freed slaves were barred from voting in elections , although their children and descendants could vote . 
 = = = Nobility = = = 
 The nobility of Brazil differed markedly from its counterparts in Europe : noble titles were not hereditary , with the sole exception of members of the Imperial Family , and those who had received a noble title were not considered to belong to a separate social class , and received no appanages , stipends or emoluments . However , many ranks , traditions , and regulations in Brazil 's system of nobility were co @-@ opted directly from the Portuguese aristocracy . During Pedro I 's reign there were no clear requisites for someone to be ennobled . During Pedro II 's reign ( apart from the Regency period during which the regent could not grant titles or honors ) the nobility evolved into a meritocracy with titles granted in recognition of an individual 's outstanding service to the Empire or for the public good . Noble rank did not represent " recognition of illustrious ancestry . " 
 It was the Emperor 's right as head of the Executive branch to grant titles and honors . The titles of nobility were , in ascending order , baron , viscount , count , marquis and duke . Apart from position in the hierarchy there were other distinctions between the ranks : counts , marquises and dukes were considered " Grandees of the Empire " while the titles of barons and viscounts could be bestowed " with Greatness " or " without Greatness " . All ranks of the Brazilian nobility were to be addressed as " Your Excellency " . 
 Between 1822 and 1889 , 986 people were ennobled . Only three became Dukes : Auguste de Beauharnais , 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg ( as Duke of Santa Cruz , brother @-@ in @-@ law to Pedro I ) , Dona Isabel Maria de Alcântara Brasileira ( as Duchess of Goiás , illegitimate daughter of Pedro I ) and lastly Luís Alves de Lima e Silva ( as Duke of Caxias , commander @-@ in @-@ chief during the Paraguayan War ) . The other titles granted were as follows : 47 marquises , 51 counts , 146 viscounts " with Greatness " , 89 viscounts " without Greatness " , 135 barons " with Greatness " and 740 barons " without Greatness " resulting in a total of 1 @,@ 211 noble titles . There were fewer nobles than noble titles because many were elevated more than once during their lifetime , such as the Duke of Caxias who was first made a baron , then a count , then a marquis and finally was elevated to a duke . Grants of nobility were not limited to male Brazilians : Thomas Cochrane , 10th Earl of Dundonald , a Scot , was made Marquis of Maranhão for his role in the Brazilian War of Independence , and 29 women received grants of nobility in their own right . As well as being unrestricted by gender , no racial distinctions were made in conferring noble status . <unk> , mulattoes , blacks and even Indians were ennobled . 
 The lesser nobility , who were untitled , were made up of members of the Imperial Orders . There were six of these : the Order of Christ , the Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz , the Order of Saint James of the Sword , the Order of the Southern Cross , the Order of Pedro I and the Order of the Rose . The first three had grades of honor beyond the Grand Master ( reserved for the Emperor only ) : knight , commander and grand cross . The latter three , however , had different ranks : the Order of the Southern Cross with four , the Order of the Rose with six , and the Order of Pedro I with three . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Article five of the Constitution declared Catholicism to be the state religion . However , the clergy had long been understaffed , undisciplined and poorly educated , all of which led to a general loss of respect for the Catholic Church . During Pedro II 's reign , the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies . As Catholicism was the official religion , the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid clerical salaries , appointed parish priests , nominated bishops , ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries . In pursuing reform , the government selected bishops whose moral fitness , stance on education and support for reform met with their approval . However , as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks , resentment of government control over the Church increased . Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines . This resulted in the Religious Question , a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government , since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs . 
 The Constitution did allow followers of other , non @-@ Catholic , faiths to practice their religious beliefs , albeit only in private . The construction of non @-@ Catholic religious buildings was forbidden . From the outset these restrictions were ignored by both the citizenry and authorities . In Belém , Pará 's capital , the first synagogue was built in 1824 . Jews migrated to Brazil soon after its independence and settled mainly in the northeastern provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco and in the northern provinces of Amazonas and Pará . Other Jewish groups came from the Alsace @-@ Lorraine region of Germany and from Russia . By the 1880s , there were several Jewish communities and synagogues scattered throughout Brazil . 
 The Protestants were another group that began settling in Brazil at the beginning of the 19th century . The first Protestants were English , and an Anglican church was opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1820 . Others were established afterwards in São Paulo , Pernambuco and Bahia provinces . They were followed by German and Swiss Lutherans who settled in the South and Southwest regions and built their own houses of worship . Following the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s , immigrants from the southern United States seeking to escape Reconstruction settled in São Paulo . Several American churches sponsored missionary activities , including Baptists , Lutherans , Congregationalists and Methodists . 
 Among African slaves , Catholicism was the religion of the majority . Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast . For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities . Some Africans and their descendants , however , held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism . This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé . Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves , although it was harshly repressed and by the end of the 19th century had been completely extinguished . By the beginning of the 19th century , the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated . Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west , where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs , or were restricted to <unk> ( reservations ) , where they eventually converted to Catholicism . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Visual arts = = = 
 According to historian Ronald <unk> , " visual arts underwent huge innovations in the Empire in comparison to the colonial period . " With independence in 1822 , painting , sculpture and architecture were influenced by national symbols and the monarchy , as both surpassed religious themes in their importance . The previously dominant old Baroque style was superseded by Neoclassicism . New developments appeared , such as the use of iron in architecture and the appearance of lithography and photography , which revitalized the visual arts . 
 The government 's creation of the Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts in the 1820s played a pivotal role in influencing and expanding the visual arts in Brazil , mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a stylistic guideline . The Academy 's origins lay in the foundation of the Escola Real das <unk> , Artes e <unk> ( Royal School of the Sciences , Arts and Crafts ) in 1816 by the Portuguese King João VI . Its members — of whom the most famous was Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> — were French <unk> who worked as painters , sculptors , musicians and engineers . The school 's main goal was to encourage French aesthetics and the Neoclassical style to replace the prevalent baroque style . Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception , the school was later renamed as the Academy of Fine Arts in 1820 , and in 1824 received its final name under the Empire : Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts . 
 It was only following Pedro II 's majority in 1840 , however , that the Academy became a powerhouse , part of the Emperor 's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of nationhood . Pedro II would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several public institutions funded by the government ( not restricted to the Academy of Fine Arts ) , such as Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera . That sponsorship would pave the way not only for the careers of artists , but also for those engaged in other fields , including historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen and musicians such as the operatic composer Antônio Carlos Gomes . 
 By the 1840s , Romanticism had largely supplanted Neoclassicism , not only in painting , but also in sculpture and architecture . The Academy did not resume its role of simply providing education : prizes , medals , scholarships in foreign countries and funding were used as incentives . Among its staff and students were some of the most renowned Brazilian artists , including <unk> Rodrigues de Sá , Félix Taunay , Manuel de Araújo Porto @-@ <unk> , Pedro Américo , Victor Meirelles , Rodolfo <unk> , Almeida Júnior , Rodolfo <unk> and João Zeferino da Costa . In the 1880s , after having been long regarded as the official style of the Academy , Romanticism declined , and other styles were explored by a new generation of artists . Among the new genres was Landscape art , the most famous exponents of which were Georg Grimm , Giovanni Battista <unk> , França Júnior and Antônio <unk> . Another style which gained popularity in the fields of painting and architecture was <unk> . 
 = = = Literature and theater = = = 
 In the first years after independence , Brazilian literature was still heavily influenced by Portuguese literature and its predominant Neoclassical style . In 1837 , Gonçalves de Magalhães published the first work of Romanticism in Brazil , beginning a new era in the nation . The next year , 1838 , saw the first play performed by Brazilians with a national theme , which marked the birth of Brazilian theater . Until then themes were often based on European works even if not performed by foreign actors . Romanticism at that time was regarded as the literary style that best fitted Brazilian literature , which could reveal its uniqueness when compared to foreign literature . During the 1830s and 1840s , " a network of newspapers , journals , book publishers and printing houses emerged which together with the opening of theaters in the major towns brought into being what could be termed , but for the narrowness of its scope , a national culture " . 
 Romanticism reached its apogee between the late 1850s and the early 1870s as it divided into several branches , including <unk> and sentimentalism . The most influential literary style in 19th @-@ century Brazil , many of the most renowned Brazilian writers were exponents of Romanticism : Manuel de Araújo Porto Alegre , Gonçalves Dias , Gonçalves de Magalhães , José de Alencar , Bernardo Guimarães , Álvares de Azevedo , Casimiro de Abreu , Castro Alves , Joaquim Manuel de Macedo , Manuel Antônio de Almeida and Alfredo d 'Escragnolle Taunay . In theater , the most famous Romanticist playwrights were Martins Pena and Joaquim Manuel de Macedo . Brazilian Romanticism did not have the same success in theater as it had in literature , as most of the plays were either Neoclassic tragedies or Romantic works from Portugal or translations from Italian , French or Spanish . After the opening of the Brazilian Dramatic Conservatory in 1845 , the government gave financial aid to national theater companies in exchange for staging plays in Portuguese . 
 By the 1880s Romanticism was superseded by new literary styles . The first to appear was Realism , which had among its most notable writers Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and Raul Pompeia . Newer styles that coexisted with Realism , Naturalism and <unk> , were both connected to the former 's evolution . Among the best @-@ known Naturalists were <unk> Azevedo and Adolfo <unk> . Notable <unk> were Gonçalves Crespo , Alberto de Oliveira , Raimundo Correia and Olavo Bilac . Brazilian theater became influenced by Realism in 1855 , decades earlier than the style 's impact upon literature and poetry . Famous Realist playwrights included José de Alencar , Quintino <unk> , Joaquim Manuel de Macedo , <unk> Lopes de Almeida and Maria Angélica Ribeiro . Brazilian plays staged by national companies competed for audiences alongside foreign plays and companies . Performing arts in Imperial Brazil also encompassed the staging of musical duets , dancing , gymnastics , comedy and farces . Less prestigious , but more popular with the working classes were puppeteers and magicians , as well as the circus , with its travelling companies of performers , including acrobats , trained animals , illusionists and other stunt @-@ oriented artists .

 = Three @-@ cent silver = 
 The three @-@ cent silver , also known as the three @-@ cent piece in silver or <unk> , was struck by the Mint of the United States for circulation from 1851 to 1872 , and as a proof coin in 1873 . Designed by the Mint 's chief engraver , James B. Longacre , it circulated well while other silver coinage was being hoarded and melted , but once that problem was addressed , became less used . It was abolished by Congress with the Coinage Act of 1873 . 
 After a massive importation of gold bullion during the California Gold Rush , silver could be traded for increasing amounts of gold , so U.S. silver coins were exported and melted for their metal . This , and the reduction of postage rates to three cents , prompted Congress in 1851 to authorize a coin of that denomination made of .750 fine silver , rather than the conventional .900 . The three @-@ cent silver was the first American coin to contain metal valued significantly less than its face value , and the first silver coin not to be legal tender for an unlimited amount . The coin saw heavy use until Congress acted again in 1853 , making other silver coins lighter , which kept them in circulation . Congress also lightened the three @-@ cent silver , and increased its fineness to 900 silver . 
 With the return of other denominations to circulation , the three @-@ cent silver saw less use , and its place in commerce was lost with the economic chaos of the American Civil War , which led to hoarding of all gold and silver coins . A three @-@ cent piece in copper @-@ nickel was struck beginning in 1865 , and the three @-@ cent silver saw low mintages for its final decade before its abolition . The series is not widely collected , and the pieces remain inexpensive relative to other U.S. coins of similar scarcity . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although the Mint of the United States had been striking silver coins since the 1790s , they did not always circulate due to fluctuations in the price of the metal . In 1834 , for example , half dollars sold on the market at a premium of one percent . The U.S. was then on a bimetallic standard , and though Congress had slightly overvalued silver with respect to gold , enough Mexican silver flowed into the country to produce a rough equilibrium . 
 By early 1849 , most of the silver coins in circulation were small coins of the Spanish colonial real , including the " levy " ( one real ) and " fip " ( half real ) . The levy and fip often passed for twelve and six cents respectively in the Eastern U.S. The mint accepted them as payment at a slightly lower figure , but even so , lost money on the transactions as many of the pieces were lightweight through wear . The odd denominations of the levy and fip were a convenience , allowing payment or change to be made without the use of cents , which were at that time large , made of copper , and not accepted by the government as legal tender due to their lack of precious metal . In the Western U.S. , the levy and fip were accepted as the equivalent of the silver dime and half dime , although the Spanish pieces contained more silver . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Bullion from the California Gold Rush and other discoveries came to the Eastern U.S. in considerable quantities beginning in 1848 . By the following year , the price of gold relative to silver had dropped , making it profitable to export American silver coins , sell them as bullion , and use the payment in gold to buy more U.S. coins . Silver coins consequently vanished from circulation , meaning the highest @-@ value American coin actually circulating that was worth less than the quarter eagle ( $ 2 @.@ 50 piece ) was the half @-@ dollar @-@ sized copper cent , which saw no use in much of the country because of its lack of legal tender status . Early in 1849 , Congress authorized a gold dollar to help bridge the gap . Spanish silver coins were the bulk of what was left in commerce for small change , although there was disagreement as to the value to be assigned to them . Additionally , they were often heavily worn , reducing their intrinsic worth at a time when Americans expected coins to contain metal worth the value assigned to them . 
 In 1850 , New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson introduced legislation for a three @-@ cent piece in .750 fine silver , that is , three parts silver to one part copper ( American silver coins were then .900 fine ) . He proposed to offer it in exchange for the Spanish silver , which would be valued at eight reals to the dollar for the purpose , higher than the going rate . The new coin would weigh three @-@ tenths as much as the dime , but the debasement of the silver would compensate the government for the losses it would take in redeeming the underweight , worn Spanish coins . The three @-@ cent denomination was chosen as it coordinated well with the six and twelve cent values often assigned the fip and levy . The House of Representatives instead considered legislation to reduce the valuation of the Spanish coins to ten cents per real , and to strike a twenty @-@ cent piece , of .900 silver , to facilitate the exchange . Neil Carothers , in his book on small @-@ denomination American money , suggests that the House 's plan would have resulted in the Spanish coins staying in circulation , and any twenty @-@ cent pieces issued being hoarded or melted . No legislation passed in 1850 , which saw continued export of America 's silver coinage . 
 Impetus for the passage of a three @-@ cent coin came when Congress , in January 1851 , considered reducing postage rates from five cents to three . In 1849 , House Committee on Ways and Means chairman , Samuel Vinton , had written to Mint director Robert M. Patterson that his committee was considering both reducing the postage rate and instituting a three @-@ cent coin . Although no legislative action was then taken , Patterson had the mint prepare experimental pattern coins . The House committee proposing the 1851 bill included Dickinson 's three @-@ cent piece , and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents . When the bill was debated in the House on January 13 , 1851 , New York Congressman William Duer indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 21 ⁄ 2 cents , and his fellow New Yorker , <unk> Matteson , offered an amendment to that effect . The amendment failed , as did every other attempt to change the legislation , including Dickinson 's plea , in the Senate , to restore the requirement that the new coin be used to retire some of the Spanish silver . The bill passed both houses , and became the Act of March 3 , 1851 when President Millard Fillmore signed it . 
 Carothers pointed out the precedent @-@ setting nature of the legislation , the first to authorize an American silver coin containing an amount of metal worth considerably less than its face value : 
 This almost forgotten statute is one of the most significant measures in American currency history . After resisting for sixty years every attempt to introduce any form of fiduciary silver coinage , Congress adopted a subsidiary silver coin as an adjunct to the postal service , without realizing that the first step had been taken in the relegation of silver to the status of a subordinate monetary material . The new piece was the first silver coin in the history of the United States that was not legal tender for an unlimited amount . Subsidiary coinage had been established , but in a trivial way , by an unworkable law , and at a time when the entire silver currency was flowing out of the country .

 In addition to striking the pattern coins in 1849 , officials at the Philadelphia Mint continued to experiment with three @-@ cent silvers . The matter was caught up in ongoing conflict between Mint chief coiner Franklin Peale , and the chief engraver , James B. Longacre , who each prepared designs . Peale produced a coin depicting a Liberty cap , based on a design prepared by Longacre 's late predecessor , Christian Gobrecht , in 1836 . Longacre prepared a design similar to the coin that was eventually released . 
 On March 2 , 1851 , the day before the legislation was passed , Longacre , with the reluctant permission of Patterson ( a Peale ally ) sent Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin samples of his proposed three @-@ cent piece , along with a letter explaining the symbology . Patterson preferred Peale 's design , but recommended Longacre 's for approval on the ground that it was in lower relief . Patterson , writing to Corwin on March 7 , indicated that if the three @-@ cent were struck in .900 silver , it would be hoarded , but as the silver in the .750 pieces was worth only two and a half cents , the Mint would profit via seignorage from coining the new pieces . Patterson also suggested that the New Orleans Mint could be used to strike the new coin . 
 Despite the provision of the Mint Act of 1837 entrusting Longacre , by virtue of his office , with responsibility for preparing dies , Peale prepared his own and ran off some sample three @-@ cent pieces . Both types of pattern coin were sent by Patterson to Corwin on March 25 , 1851 , with the Mint director 's recommendation that the chief engraver 's design be selected . The next day , acting Treasury Secretary William L. Hodge approved Longacre 's design . Knowing there was a large demand for the new coins , Patterson thought it best to build up a stock of 500 @,@ 000 before beginning distribution . 
 = = Design = = 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule , in his book on American coins and medals , considered the silver three @-@ cent piece one of the ugliest U.S. coins , though it " has the redeeming feature of delicate workmanship " . Dennis Tucker , head of Whitman Publishing , in 2016 described the coin as " something of a ' Sarah plain and small ' . " Congress had required , in the authorizing act for the three @-@ cent silver , that the piece bear a design distinct from both the gold dollar and the other silver coins . As Longacre wrote in his letter to Corwin of March 2 , 1851 @,@ 
 On so small a coin it is impossible that the device can be at once conspicuous and striking unless it is simple — complexity would defeat the object . For the obverse I have therefore chosen a star ( one of the heraldic elements of the National crest ) bearing on its centre the shield of the Union , surrounded by the legal inscription and date . For the reverse I have devised an ornamental letter C embracing in its centre the Roman numeral III , the whole encircled by the thirteen stars . 
 Longacre 's original design for the reverse ( type 1 ) was altered when the fineness of the coin was increased in 1854 , to aid the public in distinguishing between them . For the type 2 and type 3 , ( the reverses of which are identical , the only differences between the two types are on the obverse ) an olive sprig , a symbol of peace , was added over the III , and a bundle of three arrows , a symbol of war , below it . The arrows are bound by a ribbon .

 According to numismatic historian Walter Breen , " the new 3 ¢ coins were minted in large quantities , went immediately into circulation , and stayed there " .

 The small size of the coins , which were dubbed " fish scales " , was disliked as they were easily lost . The mint used them to redeem some of the Spanish silver , but the bulk of those foreign coins remained in circulation . A shopper paying for a small purchase with a gold dollar might receive fifteen or so three @-@ cent pieces and the remainder in badly worn <unk> and other small silver coins . One Philadelphia newspaper reported , derisively , that merchants were reduced to giving ladles full of three @-@ cent pieces in change for a five @-@ dollar banknote . 
 Silver coins continued to flow out of the U.S. in 1852 , and the three @-@ cent silver saw its highest mintage , 18 @,@ 663 @,@ 500 , all from Philadelphia . The value of these pieces was larger than that of all other silver coins struck by the mints in 1852 . The chaotic state of commerce , with no circulating federal coin valued between the three @-@ cent piece and gold dollar , was a source of concern , and mint officials and congressmen corresponded in 1852 concerning a reduction in weight of silver coins such as the half dime and half dollar . Congress at last responded by laws passed on February 21 , 1853 and March 3 , 1853 . These reduced the weight of all silver coins except for the silver dollar . The three @-@ cent piece had its weight reduced from .8 grams to .75 , but its fineness increased to .900 . Although the other reduced @-@ weight silver coins were given legal tender limits of five dollars , that of the three @-@ cent piece remained at thirty cents . Carothers theorized , " Congress , probably realizing that the 3 cent piece was a misfit at best , preferred to leave it with a discordant legal tender value " . Pursuant to these congressional acts , mintage of the type 1 three @-@ cent silver stopped on March 31 , 1853 . These changes to the silver coinage alleviated the problem of small change , as the new lightweight coins remained in circulation and were not then hoarded . 
 = = = Type 2 ( 1854 – 1858 ) = = = 
 The shift to .900 silver for the three @-@ cent silver was intended to help drive the Spanish coins out of circulation . Longacre made changes to both sides of the three @-@ cent silver , engraving a triple line around the star on the obverse and adding an olive branch and bunch of arrows to the reverse . These parallel changes were made to the other silver coins of less than a dollar to distinguish the new , lighter coins from the old . Since it was more urgent to complete work on the modifications to silver coins such as the half dollar and quarter , Longacre left the three @-@ cent piece for last , and did not complete work on the coin until late 1853 . The new treasury secretary , James Guthrie , approved the changes on November 10 . 
 Starting with 1854 , small quantities of proof coins were struck and apparently distributed in sets with the other silver coins . Beginning in 1858 , Mint director James Ross Snowden made the proof sets available to the general public . 
 The 1853 acts had prohibited the mint from buying silver from the public . Since the silver dollar was heavy relative to its value , little silver was presented for striking into that piece . As the statutes did not permit the public to deposit silver and receive it back in the form of subsidiary silver coins ( the three @-@ cent piece through half dollar ) , this effectively placed the U.S. on the gold standard . Despite the statutes , in 1853 and 1854 , Snowden had the mint purchase large quantities of silver bullion at a fixed price , generally above the market rate , and struck it into coin . Since the subsidiary coins were only legal tender to five dollars , and could not be redeemed for gold , this led to a glut of silver coins in commerce . This oversupply , which persisted through 1862 , led to lower mintages of silver coins in the mid @-@ 1850s , including the three @-@ cent piece . The largest mintage for the type 2 three @-@ cent silver was in 1858 , when 1 @,@ 603 @,@ 700 were struck for circulation . 
 = = = Type 3 ( 1859 – 1873 ) = = = 
 Although there is no archival evidence , Breen theorized that in 1858 Snowden ordered Longacre to make changes to improve striking quality , as most type 2 pieces were weakly struck . The changes include removal of one of the outlines around the star , with smaller and more evenly spaced lettering . Breen suggested that the lettering displays the influence of Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet , who likely assisted Longacre . These changes only affected the obverse ; the reverse was not altered . 
 The economic chaos of the civil war brought the introduction of legal tender notes , backed only by the credit of the government , and by mid @-@ 1862 , gold and silver coins had vanished from circulation in much of the nation , their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps . The three @-@ cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins , apparently because the public thought it was still made of debased silver , but by the autumn of 1862 , it too was hoarded . With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate , mintage of the three @-@ cent silver dropped from 343 @,@ 000 in 1862 to 21 @,@ 000 in 1863 , a figure that would be exceeded only once ( 22 @,@ 000 in 1866 ) during the rest of the series . In March 1863 , Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase wrote in a letter that the three @-@ cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation , and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding . 
 Congress began the task of restoring federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two @-@ cent piece in bronze , and by authorizing a three @-@ cent piece in copper @-@ nickel the following year . In 1866 , it authorized a five @-@ cent piece in the latter alloy , the nickel , as it has come to be known . With the three @-@ cent silver effectively replaced by base @-@ metal pieces , it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868 . The three @-@ cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s . 
 In 1870 , Treasury Secretary George Boutwell sent Congress a draft bill to replace the outdated 1837 Mint Act and the bits of legislation passed over the years regarding the mint and coinage . Even in the draft bill , no provision was made for the three @-@ cent silver , though some in Congress wished to retain the coin in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments . After much debate in Congress , President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Coinage Act of 1873 on February 12 of that year . The law abolished the two @-@ cent piece , three @-@ cent silver , half dime , and standard silver dollar ( later restored in 1878 ) . Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five @-@ cent pieces " a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage " . Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three @-@ cent piece and the half dime , which might have directly competed with the two copper @-@ nickel coins , a favor to industrialist Joseph Wharton , whose mines produced much of the nickel ore used in coinage . According to numismatist R. W. Julian , the three @-@ cent silver " had played its part well in the U.S. monetary system , but there was no longer any need for it " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Large quantities of the three @-@ cent silver , including much of the production from 1863 and later , were held by the treasury and were melted after the coin was <unk> . The three @-@ cent nickel went the way of its silver counterpart . After years of low mintages and decreasing popularity , it was abolished by the Act of September 26 , 1890 along with the gold dollar and three @-@ dollar piece . 
 The three @-@ cent silver was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965 , which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt . By then , that coin had long since disappeared from circulation . 
 = = Collecting = = 
 According to Kevin Flynn and Winston Zack in their book on the three @-@ cent silver , " Lower interest [ in that piece ] means that it is the type of coin [ on ] which you can find great deals on pricing , even on dates in which rarity is high . " According to R. S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins , published in 2015 , the ones that catalog the highest are the proof issues from before 1858 , with the 1854 issue leading the way , listed at $ 35 @,@ 000 . Not listed is the 1851 proof three @-@ cent silver , of which only one is known , which was last sold in 2012 for $ 172 @,@ 500 , and once formed part of the Louis Eliasberg collection . Flynn and Zack theorize that this was the specimen viewed by Hodge in approving Longacre 's design , as there is no record of its return to the Philadelphia Mint . 
 The 1873 coin , the final issue , was struck in proof only , and is listed at between $ 825 and $ 2 @,@ 000 , depending on condition . Most U.S. coins of that year were struck with a " close 3 " in the date , and , following a complaint that the 3 too closely resembled an eight , an " open 3 " variety . The three @-@ cent silver exists only as a close 3 . Of coins struck for circulation , Yeoman 's highest listings are for the 1868 , at $ 11 @,@ 000 in near pristine MS @-@ 66 condition . 
 Yeoman lists all three @-@ cent pieces before 1863 at $ 27 in worn G @-@ 4 condition , except the 1851 @-@ O ( $ 40 ) and the 1855 ( $ 38 ) . All three @-@ cent pieces from and after 1863 are less valuable in proof than in uncirculated MS @-@ 63 condition . Much of the mintage of later dates were melted by the Mint after the end of the series .

 = Eric Bana = 
 Eric <unk> ( born 9 August 1968 ) , known professionally as Eric Bana , is an Australian actor and comedian . He began his career in the sketch comedy series Full Frontal before gaining critical recognition in the biographical crime film Chopper ( 2000 ) . After a decade of roles in Australian TV shows and films , Bana gained Hollywood 's attention for his performance in the war film Black Hawk Down ( 2001 ) and by playing the title character in the Ang Lee 's Marvel Comics film Hulk ( 2003 ) . He has since played Hector in the movie Troy ( 2004 ) , the lead in Steven Spielberg 's historical drama and political thriller Munich ( 2005 ) , Henry VIII in The Other Boleyn Girl ( 2008 ) , and the villain Nero in the science @-@ fiction film Star Trek , ( 2009 ) . In 2013 , he played Lt. Cmdr. Erik S. Kristensen in the war film Lone Survivor and in the following year he played police sergeant Ralph <unk> in the horror film Deliver Us from Evil . 
 An accomplished dramatic actor and comedian , he received Australia 's highest film and television awards for his performances in Chopper , Full Frontal and Romulus , My Father . Bana has performed across a wide spectrum of leading roles in a variety of low @-@ budget and major studio films , ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction and action thrillers . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bana was born in Melbourne , Victoria . His father , Ivan , was Croatian and worked as a logistics manager for Caterpillar , Inc . , and his mother , Eleanor , was a hairdresser , originally from near Mannheim in Germany . He has one older brother , Anthony . Bana grew up in Melbourne 's Tullamarine , a suburban area on the northern edge of the city , near Melbourne 's international airport , and attended <unk> and Essendon Grammar School . In a cover story for the Mail on Sunday , he told author Antonella Gambotto @-@ Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts , and that it had distressed him . " Wog is such a terrible word , " he said . He has stated : " I have always been proud of my origin , which had a big influence on my upbringing . I have always been in the company of people of European origin " . 
 Showing acting skill early in life , Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven , first mimicking his grandfather 's walk , voice and mannerisms . In school , he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble . As a teen , he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max ( 1979 ) , and decided he wanted to become an actor . However , he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne 's Castle Hotel . His stand @-@ up gigs in inner @-@ city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself , however , so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables .

 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 In 1993 , Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard 's late night talk show , Tonight Live . His performance gained the attention of producers from the sketch comedy series , Full Frontal , who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer . During his four years on the show , Bana wrote much of his own material , and based some of his characters on members of his family . His impressions of Columbo , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sylvester Stallone , and Tom Cruise made Bana popular with the show 's audience . This success led him to record the comedy album Out of Bounds in 1994 and to host his own television special , titled Eric , in 1996 . The show , a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters , prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series The Eric Bana Show . The series , written and performed by Bana , featured skits , stand @-@ up and celebrity guests , but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings . Even so , in 1997 , he received a Logie Award for " Most Popular Comedy Personality " for his work on the show . 
 That same year , Bana made his film debut in the Australian film The Castle , which tells the story of a Melbourne @-@ based family 's struggles to keep their home by Melbourne 's airport as the airport authority force them to move . He was featured in a supporting role as Con <unk> , a kickboxing accountant who is the householder 's son @-@ in @-@ law . The Castle was a surprise critical and financial success , earning A $ 10 @,@ 326 @,@ 428 at the box office in Australia .

 In 1997 , in spite of his lack of experience in dramatic roles , Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik to appear in the film Chopper ( 2000 ) , a biographical film based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read . Dominik had been working on the project for five years , but was unable to find an actor to portray Read . Only after Read himself suggested Bana , having seen him perform a skit on television , did Dominik consider him for the part . 
 For the role , Bana shaved his head , gained thirty pounds , and spent two days with Read to perfect his mimicry . During filming he arrived on set at four in the morning and spent five hours being covered in Read 's trademark tattoos . In spite of the film 's limited release outside of Australia , Bana 's performance received positive reviews . American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana , stating that " in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found , I think , a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match . You cannot look away from him " . Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia , and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001 . Bana 's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor . 
 In 2001 , director Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American soldier in the film Black Hawk Down ( 2001 ) . Scott , with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana 's performance in Chopper , did not require him to audition . In the film , he played Sergeant First Class Norm ' Hoot ' Hooten , an elite Delta Force soldier , who fights his way out of a battle in Mogadishu , Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry . Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began . He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg , learning to fire weapons and clear rooms . 
 Bana 's next project was the low @-@ budget Australian film The Nugget ( 2002 ) . A comedy , the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working class men and was released with moderate success in Australia . Bana read the script after filming Chopper in 2000 and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood and because he found its characters amusing and likeable . While filming The Nugget , Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular Marvel Comic book series The Incredible Hulk . Only after learning of director Ang Lee 's involvement in the project did he consider the role . Bana admired Lee for his work on the film The Ice Storm and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete . He said he was drawn to the film because " the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential " and was " a fairly non @-@ traditional superhero " . Hulk ( 2003 ) received mixed reviews and a moderate success at the box office , but Bana 's performance was praised : Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner " with great conviction " . Bana earned an Academy of Science Fiction , Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for " Cinescape Genre Face of the Future " for the film . 
 In 2004 , Bana co @-@ starred with Brad Pitt in the big @-@ budget film Troy . In the film , he played Prince Hector , leader of the Trojan forces battling against the Greek warrior Achilles . Director Wolfgang Petersen offered him a role in the film after meeting with Brad Pitt , a fan of Chopper . The film was an international success , grossing US $ 364 million , with US $ 133 million in the US . 
 = = = 2005 – present = = = 
 After the critical disappointment of Hulk and Troy , critics questioned Bana 's bankability in big @-@ budget films . He responded in Empire Magazine : " It 's not like it [ Hulk ] was a flop . When you 're on a long shoot it is a long personal investment . If I wasn 't happy with the end result I 'd be bloody upset , but in every case so far I 've been happy . Troy could take $ 50 and I wouldn 't regret it . " 
 The following year , Bana co @-@ starred with Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush in Steven Spielberg 's controversial film Munich . Bana played Avner , a Mossad agent , who is ordered to track down and kill the Black September terrorists thought to be responsible for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics . The film was a critical success , and was nominated for five Academy Awards in 2006 . The Los Angeles Times wrote that Bana as Avner " projects a combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness and ... knows how to present a face for which worry is a new experience . " 
 In 2006 , Bana was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . Lucky You , a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming Munich , was released in early 2007 . In the film , he played Huck Cheever , a professional poker player who must overcome his personal problems to win a high @-@ stakes tournament in Las Vegas . His next film was the Australian drama Romulus , My Father ( 2007 ) . The film , based on Raimond <unk> 's memoir of the same name , portrays a couple and their struggle in the face of adversity to raise their son . The film was a critical success , and Bana 's performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor . In 2007 , he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy Kath & Kim as himself . 
 Bana 's next project was the historical drama The Other Boleyn Girl ( 2008 ) . In the film he played Henry VIII of England opposite Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman . Bana was surprised to be offered the role and admitted that he " probably would have just passed it on without even opening it " if it had been presented to him under a different title . The following year , he co @-@ starred with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in the science fiction film Star Trek . In the film , Bana played Nero , a Romulan mining ship captain who attempts to exact revenge on Spock , whom he blames for the destruction of his homeworld and its inhabitants . The film was a critical success and grossed over US $ 380 million worldwide . 
 In August 2009 , he appeared as Henry <unk> in the film adaptation of The Time Traveler 's Wife . Bana also co @-@ starred with Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen in Judd Apatow 's third directorial feature , about stand @-@ up comics , titled Funny People , marking Bana 's first appearance in an American mainstream comedy . 
 In 2009 , Bana released a self @-@ produced and directed documentary @-@ style film called Love the Beast . It details his personal relationship with his first car and follows his progression as a car lover . Along the way he seeks guidance and wisdom from the inner sanctum of his three lifelong friends , as well as celebrities Jay Leno , Jeremy Clarkson , and Dr. Phil . In 2011 , Bana appeared as Erik Heller in the action thriller film Hanna , starring alongside Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett . The film became another success for Bana as it opened at No. 2 at the United States box office . Having read Marcus Luttrell 's autobiographical account as a United States Navy SEAL , Lone Survivor , he was willing to appear in the 2013 film adaptation regardless of which role he was offered . In the film , he portrayed Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen . The following year he starred as Ralph <unk> , a police sergeant who investigated paranormal cases , in the supernatural horror film Deliver Us from Evil .

 = German attacks on Nauru = 
 The German attacks on Nauru refers to the two attacks on Nauru in December 1940 . These attacks were conducted by auxiliary cruisers between 6 and 8 December and on the 27th of the month . The raiders sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on Nauru 's economically important phosphate @-@ loading facilities . Despite the significance of the island to the Australian and New Zealand economies , Nauru was not defended and the German force did not suffer any losses . 
 The two attacks on Nauru were the most effective operations conducted by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II . They disrupted supplies of phosphate to Australia , New Zealand and Japan , which reduced agricultural production in these countries . In response , Allied naval vessels were deployed to protect Nauru and nearby Ocean Island and escort shipping in the South Pacific . Small garrisons were also established to protect the two islands . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nauru and nearby Ocean Island were important sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and played an important role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II . The Melbourne @-@ based British Phosphate Commission ( BPC ) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands and dominated all aspects of Nauruan life . During the year ending 30 June 1940 , the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels ( Triadic , Triaster , Triona and Trienza ) and chartered merchant ships . 
 As the islands have no harbours or anchorages , the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties . During south @-@ westerly wind periods — which are common from November to March — the ships had to stop loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved . It was common for these ships to be allowed to drift to save fuel , and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru . 
 Despite their importance to the Australian and New Zealand economies , Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940 . Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia , however , to lessen the impact of an attack on the islands . 
 In late October 1940 , the German raider Orion , which was commanded by Captain Kurt Weyher met Komet , which came under the command of Captain Robert Eyssen , and the supply ship Kulmerland at <unk> in the Caroline Islands . Eyssen was the more senior of the two captains , and assumed overall command of the force . The three ships operated off New Zealand 's east coast for 18 days during November and sank the small coaster Holmwood and large ocean liner <unk> with gunfire without being detected by the weak New Zealand defences on 25 and 27 November respectively . Following these attacks , the raiders proceeded to the Kermadec Islands where they transferred their women and children prisoners to Kulmerland on 29 November . The three ships then proceeded to Nauru to attack the island 's phosphate industry and the concentration of shipping which the German captains knew was usually present . 
 = = Attacks on Nauru = = 
 The German force encountered its first BPC ship while en route to Nauru . On 6 December , Triona ( 4 @,@ 413 long tons ( 4 @,@ 484 t ) ) was attacked north @-@ east of the Solomon Islands and was sunk with torpedoes after a chase in which three of her crew were killed by the raiders ' guns . All 68 survivors were captured . 
 The raider captains intended to land a shore party and bombard Nauru 's shore installations at dawn on 8 December , but bad weather forced them to concentrate on the ships which were off the island . On the evening of 7 December , Komet — which had gone ahead to reconnoitre and was disguised as the Japanese merchant ship <unk> Maru — sank the Norwegian merchant ship Vinni ( 5 @,@ 181 long tons ( 5 @,@ 264 t ) ) approximately 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Nauru . While the raider was spotted from the shore , her disguise was successful and she was assumed to be a merchant ship bound for Japan . 
 Orion joined Komet off Nauru in the early hours of 8 December , and attacked and damaged Triadic ( 6 @,@ 378 long tons ( 6 @,@ 480 t ) ) and sank Triaster ( 6 @,@ 032 long tons ( 6 @,@ 129 t ) ) . Komet then tried to sink Triadic with scuttling charges , but this was unsuccessful and Orion sank the merchant ship with gunfire . Komet later sank the British steamer <unk> ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ( 4 @,@ 000 t ) ) . Following these attacks , the two raiders and Kulmerland withdrew and assembled 20 mi ( 17 nmi ; 32 km ) east of Nauru . As the weather precluded a landing on the island , it was decided that Komet and Kulmerland would go to Ailinglaplap in the Marshall Islands where Komet would refuel while Orion operated north @-@ west of Nauru . Following this the ships would meet off the island and make another attempt to land a raiding party . 
 When the German force reassembled off Nauru on 15 December , the weather continued to be too bad to permit a landing and the attack on Nauru was broken off . Further attacks on shipping were judged impractical as the raiders had intercepted radio messages ordering vessels bound for Nauru and Ocean Island to disperse . Instead , the three German ships proceeded to the Australian @-@ administered island of Emirau to disembark the 675 prisoners they were carrying . While Weyher refused to release any of the European ethnic prisoners on board Orion as he believed that " trained officers and crews are as much a problem for Britain as shipping itself " , the ships landed 343 Europeans and 171 Chinese and South Pacific @-@ ethnic people . 
 Fortunately for the Germans , Emirau was one of the few islands in the region to not have a Royal Australian Navy @-@ supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities . The two European families on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies , and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government . A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau , and arrived there on 24 December . The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat . The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29 December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland , where they arrived on 1 January 1941 . They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders ' operations , and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19 February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners . 
 The three German ships parted company after leaving Emirau on 21 December . Orion proceeded to <unk> and then <unk> in the Mariana Islands to overhaul her engines , Kulmerland went to Japan and only Komet continued operations in the South Pacific . She attempted to lay mines off Rabaul on 24 December using her motor boat , but this project was abandoned when the boat 's engines failed . 
 Komet returned to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul , and arrived off the island at 05 : 45 on the morning of 27 December . After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant , she opened fire at 06 : 40 . The bombardment lasted for about an hour , during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant , oil tanks , boats , buildings and mooring buoys . Following this attack she sailed to the south east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia . This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war , and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The German raids on Nauru had an impact on the Australian and New Zealand economies and were the greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II . It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru , and the loss of ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output . The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction of fertilizer rationing in New Zealand from July 1941 . Komet 's bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate consignments to Japan , which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it was providing to Germany . The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands . Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded . 
 Following the raids , the Commonwealth military forces in the Pacific took steps to prevent further attacks by raiders . The Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force flew an increased number of patrols in search of raiders operating near major ports . In addition , the Australian Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty authorise the redeployment of Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders . This was agreed to , and the light cruiser HMAS Sydney and armed merchant cruiser HMAS Kanimbla returned to Australia from other stations . This allowed naval protection to be provided to Nauru and Ocean islands , and the armed merchant cruiser HMAS Manoora arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941 escorting Trienza . Several Australian and New Zealand warships maintained a continual presence off the islands during subsequent months , and two field guns were deployed to each island . The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand . The naval authorities were able to use the intelligence they gained from the prisoners landed at Emirau to re @-@ route merchant ships away from the areas in which the German raiders were operating ; this greatly reduced the effectiveness of the raiders , and Komet and Orion only sank three ships in the period between the attack on Nauru and their return to Europe in late 1941 .

 Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Limited ( Chinese : <unk> ) , operating as Dragonair and to be rebranded as Cathay Dragon ( Chinese : <unk> ) , is a Hong Kong @-@ based international regional airline , with its corporate headquarters , Dragonair House , and main hub at Hong Kong International Airport . As of 30 October 2013 , the airline operates a scheduled passenger network to 44 destinations in 13 countries and territories across Asia . Additionally , the airline has 3 codeshares on routes which are served by partner airlines . It has an all Airbus fleet of 41 aircraft , consisting of A320s , A321s and A330s . Dragonair is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong 's flag carrier , Cathay Pacific , and is an affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance . The airline was founded on 24 May 1985 by Chao Kuang Piu , the airline 's present honorary chairman . Its maiden flight departed Hong Kong for Kota Kinabalu , Malaysia after being granted an air operator 's certificate ( AOC ) by the Hong Kong Government in July 1985 . In 2010 , Dragonair , together with its parent , Cathay Pacific , operated over 138 @,@ 000 flights , carried nearly 27 million passengers and over 1 @.@ 80 billion kg of cargo and mail .

 = = = Early beginning = = = 
 The airline was established in Hong Kong on 24 May on the initiative of Kuang @-@ Piu Chao , the airline 's present honorary chairman , as a subsidiary of Hong Kong Macau International Investment Co . It started <unk> in July 1985 with a Boeing 737 @-@ 200 service from Kai Tak International Airport to Kota Kinabalu International Airport in Malaysia , after receiving an Air Operator 's Certificate ( AOC ) from the Hong Kong Government . The airline commenced services to Phuket , Thailand , as well as six secondary cities in mainland China on regular charter basis in 1986 . In 1987 , the airline became the first Hong Kong @-@ based airline to join as an active member of the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) . 
 Dragonair was the first local competitor for Hong Kong 's largest airline , Cathay Pacific , in forty years ; and since the airline 's inception , Cathay Pacific fought vigorously to block the airline 's flight @-@ slot applications . In January 1987 , the airline announced its expansion by the order of two long @-@ range McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 11 aircraft . However , after a heated hearing before Hong Kong 's Air Transport Licensing Authority , the Hong Kong Government adopted a one route @-@ one airline policy , which lasted until 2001 . The airline was not able to gain the scheduled routes it needed to compete effectively . The airline was disadvantaged in that Hong Kong 's financial secretary back then , Sir John <unk> , was a former Cathay Pacific chairman . 
 Mr Stephen Miller , Dragonair 's first CEO , said : 
 Our arrival on the scene was not hailed very enthusiastically by the then Hong Kong government ... we got a lot of opposition from Cathay ( Pacific ) . 
 It was later discovered that Cathay Pacific was concentrating on a boom in travel elsewhere in the 1980s , and left the undeveloped mainland China market to Dragonair . Forced into accepting less @-@ desirable routes , the young airline focused on the mainland . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 In January 1990 , Cathay Pacific , Swire Group and CITIC Pacific acquired an 89 percent stake in the airline , with CITIC Pacific holding 38 percent ; while the family of the airline 's chairman Kuang @-@ Piu Chao reduced their holding from 22 percent to 6 percent , with the remainder held by minor shareholders . The change of ownership saw Cathay Pacific transferring its Beijing and Shanghai routes to Dragonair , along with a Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStar on a lease basis . The first Airbus A320 joined the airline 's fleet in March 1993 and by December , there was a total of six A320 aircraft . This was followed by the introduction of the Airbus A330 wide @-@ body aircraft into the Dragonair 's fleet in July 1995 . 
 A further redistribution of shares took place in April 1996 , when China National Aviation Corporation ( CNAC ) purchased 35 @.@ 86 percent of Dragonair and became the largest shareholder , with Cathay Pacific and Swire retaining 25 @.@ 50 percent , CITIC Pacific retaining 28 @.@ 50 percent and the Chao family retaining 5 @.@ 02 percent . CNAC 's holding was further increased to 43 percent when it was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 17 December 1997 . On 5 July 1998 , Dragonair Flight 841 from Chongqing was the last scheduled arrival at Kai Tak Airport , landed runway 13 at 15 : 38 GMT ( 23 : 38 Hong Kong time ) . 
 = = = Operational expansion = = = 
 In 2000 , the airline commenced an all @-@ cargo service to Shanghai , Europe and the Middle East using a leased Boeing 747 @-@ 200 freighter and a service to Osaka was added in May 2001 . The airline purchased two Boeing 747 @-@ 300 freighters in 2001 and extended freight operations to Xiamen and Taipei in 2002 . The airline 's net profits rose 60 percent to HK $ 540 million in 2002 , with cargo operations accounting for 30 percent of revenues ; and freight volume increasing nearly 50 percent to 20 @,@ 095 tonnes . 
 All regular flights were converted to scheduled services in March 2000 , with passenger service to Taipei , Bangkok and Tokyo commenced in July 2002 , November 2003 and April 2004 , respectively . Dragonair Cargo continued to see steady growth and the airline began a Hong Kong – Shanghai freight route on behalf of DHL in June 2003 and leased an Airbus A300 freighter to start a cargo service to Nanjing in June 2004 . A second daily European loop to Frankfurt and London , in addition to Manchester and Amsterdam , followed and by mid @-@ 2004 the airline had five Boeing 747 freighters and 26 Airbus passenger aircraft . In bitter Air Transport Licensing Authority ( ATLA ) hearings in 2004 , Cathay Pacific applied to fly to three mainland cities to which Dragonair filed an objection , saying the move would have an effect on its very survival . 
 A new passenger service to Sydney was scheduled to open in the second half of 2005 , along with Manila and Seoul as the other anticipated destinations . The airline also planned services to the United States in 2005 , at first with cargo flights . It was the airline 's intention to more than double its freighter fleet to nine Boeing 747s by 2008 . 
 = = = Cathay Pacific takeover = = = 
 By 2005 , Cathay Pacific owned 18 percent of the airline , with its parent , Swire Pacific owned 7 @.@ 71 percent ; CNAC owned 43 percent and CITIC Pacific owned 28 @.@ 5 percent . A Hong Kong newspaper reported that Swire Pacific was in advanced negotiations that would see Cathay Pacific taking over Dragonair . This was dismissed outright by Tony Tyler , then chief operating officer of Cathay Pacific who said " We have no plans to change that structure right now ... we are happy with the structure of the shareholding in Dragonair at the moment . " Peter Hilton , transport analyst at <unk> , said Tyler 's remarks were a " cut and dried " dismissal of the takeover talk . 
 On 28 September 2006 , Dragonair became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific after completion of a major shareholding realignment involving Cathay Pacific , Air China , CNAC , CITIC Pacific and Swire Pacific . Cathay Pacific claimed that Dragonair will continue to operate as a separate airline within the Cathay Pacific group , maintaining its own Air Operator 's Certificate and with the brand unchanged , with 2 @,@ 976 employees worldwide . However , the airline will be downsized with five percent of the airline staff retrenched or transferred into Cathay Pacific . No Cathay Pacific staff were to be affected by this announcement . 
 By 2009 , services to Bangkok and Tokyo ; and the expansion plans to introduce services to Sydney , Seoul and the United States have been cancelled and terminated . In addition , the planned nine @-@ aircraft freight operation has also been eliminated , with three Boeing 747 @-@ <unk> freighters transferred to its parent fleet while the two remaining parked at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville , California .

 Dragonair 's own loyalty program , The Elite , that was launched on 12 February 2001 , was merged into Cathay Pacific 's The Marco Polo Club from 1 January 2007 . Existing Elite members were offered similar membership by The Marco Polo Club . On 1 August 2007 , the airline opened a joint regional office with Cathay Pacific in Beijing , that featured a dedicated area for the airline and its parent , and joined the Oneworld alliance as an affiliated member on 1 November , which its parent is a founding member . In addition , they opened the first airline @-@ branded arrival lounge , The Arrival , at Hong Kong International Airport on 1 October 2008 . The airline 's ground handling services subsidiary , Hong Kong International Airport Services Ltd ( <unk> ) , was merged with Hong Kong Airport Services Ltd ( HAS ) on 1 November 2008 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific on 1 December 2008 . 
 In January 2016 , Cathay Pacific announced it was rebranding Dragonair as Cathay Dragon .

 The previous livery is in white color with a red dragon on the cowling and on the vertical stabiliser ; and the airline 's name written in Chinese red lettering and in English black lettering above and below the front passenger windows , respectively . In addition , there is a 30 cm Oneworld logo next to the first left door and a Swire Group logo on the aft of the aircraft . 
 On 5 May 2005 , Dragonair celebrated its 20th Anniversary with a new Airbus A330 @-@ 300 ( B @-@ <unk> ) painted in a special livery . The work of art took 14 months to realise , from design tender to completed image . The special livery featured a waterside view with a junk and fishes leaping out of the water at the front of the aircraft ; a red dragon spread across the fuselage in the daylight ; and children playing with traditional Chinese lanterns by the waterside of an ancient village on the left side of the aircraft , representing the past . It also featured a waterside view with a Star Ferry at front of the aircraft ; and a red dragon spread across the fuselage in the Hong Kong night sky , representing the present . Stanley Hui , Dragonair 's CEO at the time , described the special livery " embodies the spirit of the Chinese dragons of old – a spirit that aspires to excellence " . The aircraft was removed from service in February 2013 , at the expiration of its lease . 
 In 2016 , Cathay Pacific , Dragonair 's Parent Company , announced that they would be re @-@ branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon . For this change , a new livery has been adopted . The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific 's new livery in the tail logo and font . The major difference is instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme , it has a light maroon theme .

 = Battle of Harlem Heights = 
 The Battle of Harlem Heights was fought during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War . The action took place in what is now the Morningside Heights and east into the future Harlem neighborhoods of northwestern Manhattan Island in what is now New York City on September 16 , 1776 . 
 The Continental Army , under Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief General George Washington , Major General Nathanael Greene , and Major General Israel Putnam , totaling around 9 @,@ 000 men , held a series of high ground positions in upper Manhattan . Immediately opposite was the vanguard of the British Army totaling around 5 @,@ 000 men under the command of Major General Henry Clinton . 
 An early morning skirmish between a patrol of Knowlton 's Rangers and British light infantry piquets developed into a running fight as the British pursued the Americans back through woods towards Washington 's position on Harlem Heights . The overconfident British light troops , having advanced too far from their lines without support , had exposed themselves to counter @-@ attack . Washington , seeing this , ordered a flanking manouevre which failed to cut off the British force but , combined with pressure from troops arriving from the Harlem Heights position , succeeded in driving them back . Meeting reinforcements coming from the south with artillery support , the British light infantry turned and made a stand in open fields on Morningside Heights . The Americans , also reinforced , came on in strength and there followed a lengthy exchange of fire . After two hours , with ammunition running short , the British force began to pull back to their lines . Washington cut short the pursuit , unwilling to risk a general engagement with the British main force , and withdrew to his own lines . The battle helped restore the confidence of the Continental Army after suffering several defeats . It was Washington 's first battlefield success of the war . 
 After a month without any major fighting between the armies , Washington was forced to withdraw his army north to the town of White Plains in southeastern New York when the British moved north into Westchester County and threatened to trap Washington further south on Manhattan . Washington suffered two more defeats , at White Plains and Fort Washington . After these two defeats , and also with the evacuation of Fort Lee ( named after his deputy , General Charles Lee ) across the Hudson River guarding the western shore in New Jersey , Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania . The New York and New Jersey campaign ended after the subsequent American Christmas victories at Trenton and Princeton , which reinvigorated the Continental Army and the new nation . 
 = = Background = = 
 On August 27 , 1776 , British troops under the command of General William Howe flanked and defeated the American army at the Battle of Long Island . Howe moved his forces and pinned the Americans down at Brooklyn Heights , with the East River to the American rear . On the night of August 29 , General George Washington , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Continental Army , evacuated his entire army of 9 @,@ 000 men and their equipment across the water to Manhattan . 
 On September 15 , Howe landed his army in an amphibious operation at Kip 's Bay , on the eastern shore of Manhattan , along the East River . After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore , 4 @,@ 000 British and Hessian troops landed at Battle of Kip 's Bay . The American troops began to flee at the sight of the enemy , and even with Washington 's arrival on the scene and taking immediate bold command , demanding his soldiers to fight , they refused to obey orders and continued to flee . 
 After scattering the Americans at Kip 's Bay , Howe landed 9 @,@ 000 more troops , but did not immediately cut off the American retreat from New York Town in the south of the island . Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the <unk> of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4 : 00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Early on September 16 , Washington received reports , which proved to be unfounded , that the British were advancing . Washington , who had been expecting an attack , had ordered a party of 150 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to reconnoiter the British lines . At daybreak , Knowlton 's troops were spotted by the pickets of the British light infantry . The British sent two or three companies to attack the enemy to their front . For more than half an hour the skirmish continued , with fighting in the woods between two farms . When Knowlton realized that the numerically superior British forces were trying to turn his flank , he ordered a retreat , which was conducted " without confusion or loss " , although perhaps ten men had been lost in the initial skirmish . 
 The British followed in rapid pursuit . As they advanced , the British light troops signalled with bugle calls , which to Colonel Joseph Reed were reminiscent of a fox hunt , and seemed to him to be intended as an insult . Probably about this time , the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry , along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements . Reed , who had met Knowlton , rode to Washington to tell him what was going on and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers . Instead of retreating , Washington , in what Edward G. Lengel calls " an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on " , devised a plan to entrap the British light troops . Washington would have some troops make a feint , in order to draw the British down into a an area of open ground known as ' The Hollow Way ' , and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British . 
 The feint party was composed of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British . After the British were in the hollow way , the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more men . All of the troops were stationed too far away from one another to do much damage . 
 The flanking party consisted of Knowlton 's Rangers , which had been reinforced by three companies of riflemen , in total about 200 men . As they approached , an officer accidentally misdirected the men , and the firing broke out on the British flank , not their rear . The British troops , realizing that they had almost been surrounded , retreated to a field , where there was a fence . The Americans soon pursued and , during the attack , Knowlton was killed . Despite this , the American troops pushed on ; driving the British troops beyond the fence to the top of a hill . When they reached the hill , the British forces received reinforcements ; including some artillery . For two hours , the British troops held their ground at the top of the hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat , into a buckwheat field . 
 Washington was originally reluctant to pursue the British troops , but after seeing that his men were slowly pushing the British back , he sent in reinforcements and permitted the troops to engage in a direct attack . By the time that all of the reinforcements arrived , nearly 1 @,@ 800 Americans were engaged in the buckwheat field . To direct the battle , members of Washington 's staff , including Nathanael Greene , were sent in . By this time , the British troops had also been reinforced ; bringing their strength up to about 5 @,@ 000 men . 
 For an hour @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half , the battle continued in the field and in the surrounding hills until , " having fired away their ammunition " , the British withdrew . The Americans kept up a close pursuit until it was heard that British reserves were coming , and Washington , fearing a British trap , ordered a withdrawal . Upon hearing Washington 's orders to withdraw , the troops gave a loud " <unk> " and left the field in good order . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The British casualties were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded . However , a member of Howe 's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded . David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded . The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded , including among the dead , Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch . The American victory raised morale in the ranks , even among those who had not been engaged . It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington 's command . 
 There was little fighting for the next month of the campaign , but Washington moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British were attempting to trap him on Manhattan . After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington , Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey , pursued by the British , into Pennsylvania . 
 The loss of Knowlton was a blow to the fledgling American intelligence operations , as he had created and led the first such unit of the Continental Army , at the direction of Washington .

 The Metallurgical Laboratory or " Met Lab " was the Chicago @-@ based part of the Manhattan Project – the Allied effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II . It was part of the Metallurgical Project headed by Arthur H. Compton , a Nobel Prize laureate and Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago , the objective of which was to create an atomic bomb using plutonium . The Metallurgical Laboratory was established in February 1942 , and produced the first controlled nuclear chain reaction on 2 December 1942 in Chicago Pile @-@ 1 , built at the University 's old football stadium , Stagg Field . In August 1942 its chemical section was the first to chemically separate a weighable sample of plutonium . 
 Chicago Pile @-@ 1 ceased operation in February 1943 , and was dismantled and moved to a site in the Argonne Forest , where the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile @-@ 2 . Another reactor , Chicago Pile @-@ 3 , was built at the Argonne site in early 1944 . This was the world 's first reactor to use heavy water as a neutron moderator . It went critical in May 1944 , and was first operated at full power in July 1944 . The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and the B Reactor at the Hanford Engineer Works in the state of Washington . 
 In addition to the work on reactor development , the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the chemistry and metallurgy of plutonium , and worked with DuPont to develop the Bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium . When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale , there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects , and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance . It was discovered that plutonium , like radium , was a bone seeker , making it especially hazardous . 
 The Metallurgical Laboratory was successively led by Richard L. Doan , Samuel K. Allison , Joyce C. Stearns and Farrington Daniels . Scientists who worked there included Enrico Fermi , Eugene Wigner and Glenn Seaborg . At its peak on 1 July 1944 , the Metallurgical Laboratory had 2 @,@ 008 staff . By 1 July 1945 , this had declined to 1 @,@ 444 . The Metallurgical Laboratory became Argonne National Laboratory on 1 July 1946 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 , followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 , and its theoretical explanation ( and naming ) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after , opened up the possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium . At Columbia University , Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved . Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt , warning of the possibility of a German nuclear weapon project , and convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co @-@ sign it . This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government . 
 In April 1941 , the National Defense Research Committee ( NDRC ) , asked Arthur Compton , a Nobel @-@ Prize @-@ winning physics professor at the University of Chicago , to report on the uranium program . Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile . If so , then plutonium @-@ 239 was likely to be . Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60 @-@ inch cyclotron there in May 1941 , and found that it had 1 @.@ 7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium @-@ 235 . While minute quantities of plutonium @-@ 239 could be created in cyclotrons , it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way . Compton conferred with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor , and with Robert Serber from the University of Illinois about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from . 
 On 20 December , soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into the war , Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project . Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium , to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium , and to design and build an atomic bomb . Although a successful reactor had not yet been built , the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts . It fell to Compton to decide which of these should be pursued . He proposed an ambitious schedule that aimed to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943 , and to have a deliverable atomic bomb by January 1945 . 
 Compton felt that having teams at Columbia , Princeton , the University of Chicago and the University of California created too much duplication and not enough collaboration , and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location . Nobody wanted to move , and everybody argued in favor of their own location . In January 1942 , soon after the United States entered World War II , Compton decided to concentrate the work at his own location , the University of Chicago , where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration , whereas Columbia was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts and was hesitant to add another secret project . Other factors contributing to the decision were Chicago 's central location and the availability of scientists , technicians and facilities in the Midwest that had not yet been taken away by war work . Housing was more readily available , and an inland city was less vulnerable to enemy attack .

 The new research establishment was formed in February 1942 , and named the " Metallurgical Laboratory " or " Met Lab " . Although some real metallurgy would eventually be carried out , the name was intended as a cover for its activities . The University of Chicago had been considering establishing a research institute into metals , and indeed would do so after the war , so its creation attracted little attention . Compton 's plutonium project then became known as the Metallurgical Project . The Metallurgical Laboratory was administered by the University of Chicago under contract to the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) . 
 Over 5 @,@ 000 people in 70 research groups participated in Compton 's Metallurgical Project , of whom over 2 @,@ 000 worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago . Despite offering good salaries , recruiting was difficult . There was competition for scientists and engineers from other defense @-@ related projects , and Chicago was expensive compared with university towns . 
 Norman Hilberry was associate director of the Metallurgical Project , and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the Metallurgical Laboratory . While Doan was an able administrator , he had difficulty with being accepted as the head of the laboratory , since he was not an academic . On 5 May 1943 , Compton replaced him with Samuel K. Allison , and appointed Henry D. Smyth as associate director . Initially there were three physics groups , which were headed by Allison , Fermi and Martin D. Whitaker . Frank Spedding was in charge of the Chemistry Division . He was later succeeded by Herbert McCoy , and then by James Franck . Compton placed Robert Oppenheimer in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942 . In November 1942 , this became a separate project , known as Project Y , which was located in Los Alamos , New Mexico . 
 After the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project in August 1942 , the Manhattan District coordinated the work . From 17 February 1943 , Compton reported directly to the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , instead of the OSRD S @-@ 1 Committee . The Manhattan District assumed full responsibility for the Metallurgical Laboratory contract on 1 May 1943 . Captain J. F. Grafton was appointed the Chicago Area Engineer in August 1942 . He was succeeded by Captain Arthur V. Peterson in December 1942 . Peterson remained until October 1944 . Captain J. F. McKinley became Chicago Area Engineer on 1 July 1945 . 
 = = Buildings = = 
 At first , most of the Laboratory office space was provided by the University of Chicago . The physicists took over space under the North and West Stands of Stagg Field and in the Service Building , where there was a cyclotron . The chemists took over the George Herbert Jones Laboratory and the Kent Chemical Laboratory . The health group took over space in the Anatomy Building , Drexel House , <unk> Hospital and the Killis Laboratory and the administrative offices went into Eckhart Hall . Szilard later wrote that " the morale of the scientists could almost be plotted in a graph by counting the number of lights burning after dinner in the offices at Eckhart Hall . " When the project outgrew its accommodation in Eckhart Hall , it moved into the nearby Ryerson Hall . The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually occupied 205 @,@ 000 square feet ( 19 @,@ 000 m2 ) of campus space . About $ 131 @,@ 000 worth of alterations were made to buildings occupied by the laboratory but the University of Chicago also had to make alterations for users displaced by it . 
 The University of Chicago made a 0 @.@ 73 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 30 ha ) site occupied by tennis courts available to the Manhattan District on a one dollar lease , for the construction of a new chemistry building with 20 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) of space . Stone and Webster commenced work on this in September 1942 and it was completed in December . It was soon found to be too small and an adjacent 0 @.@ 85 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 34 ha ) plot was added to the lease , on which a 30 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 800 m2 ) annex was built and completed in November 1943 . Extensive work was then carried out on the ventilation system to allow the laboratory to work with plutonium more safely . A site containing an ice house and stables owned by the University in Chicago was made available in April 1943 . Known as Site B , it was remodeled to provide 62 @,@ 670 square feet ( 5 @,@ 822 m2 ) of laboratories and workshops for the health and metallurgy groups . The 124th Field Artillery Armory was leased from the state of Illinois to provide more space in March 1944 and about 360 @,@ 000 square feet ( 33 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space was leased or built , at a cost of $ 2 million . 
 For reasons of safety and security , it was not desirable to locate the facilities for experiments with nuclear reactors in densely @-@ populated Chicago . Compton selected a site in the Argonne Forest , part of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) southwest of Chicago , which became known as Site A. The War Department leased 1 @,@ 088 acres ( 440 ha ) of land there from Cook County for the duration of the war plus one year for a dollar . Construction of facilities including laboratories and service buildings and an access road was commenced in September 1942 and completed in early 1943 . Compton appointed Fermi as the first director of the Argonne Laboratory .

 Between 15 September and 15 November 1942 , groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental reactors ( known at the time as " piles " ) under the Stagg Field stands . Fermi designed a new uranium and graphite pile that could be brought to criticality in a controlled , self @-@ sustaining nuclear reaction . Construction at Argonne fell behind schedule due to Stone & Webster 's difficulty recruiting enough skilled workers and obtaining the required building materials . This led to an industrial dispute , with union workers downing tools over the recruitment of non @-@ union labor . When it became clear that the materials for Fermi 's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed , Compton approved a proposal from Fermi to build the pile under the stands at Stagg Field . 
 Construction of the reactor , known as Chicago Pile @-@ 1 , began on the morning of 16 November 1942 . The work was carried out in twelve @-@ hour shifts , with a day shift under Walter Zinn and a night shift under Herbert L. Anderson . When completed , the wooden frame supported an elliptical @-@ shaped structure , 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high , 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) wide at the ends and 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) across the middle . It contained 6 short tons ( 5 @.@ 4 t ) of uranium metal , 50 short tons ( 45 t ) of uranium oxide and 400 short tons ( 360 t ) of graphite , at an estimated cost of $ 2 @.@ 7 million . On 2 December 1942 , it achieved the first controlled self @-@ sustaining nuclear reaction . On 12 December 1942 CP @-@ 1 's power output was increased to 200 W , enough to power a light bulb ; but lacking shielding of any kind , it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity . Thereafter , testing was continued , but at the lower power of 0 @.@ 5 W.

 The operation of Chicago Pile @-@ 1 was terminated on 28 February 1943 . It was dismantled and moved to Argonne , where the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile @-@ 2 ( CP @-@ 2 ) . Instead of being spherical , the new reactor was built in a cube @-@ like shape , about 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall with a base approximately 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) square . It was surrounded by concrete walls 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) thick that acted as a radiation shield , and with overhead protection from 6 inches ( 15 cm ) of lead and 50 inches ( 130 cm ) of wood . More uranium was used , so it contained 52 short tons ( 47 t ) of uranium and 472 short tons ( 428 t ) of graphite . No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts . CP @-@ 2 became operational in March 1943 . 
 = = = Chicago Pile @-@ 3 = = = 
 A second reactor , known as Chicago Pile @-@ 3 , or CP @-@ 3 , was built at the Argonne site in early 1944 . This was the world 's first reactor to use heavy water as a neutron moderator , something that had been unavailable when CP @-@ 1 was built but which was now becoming available in quantity thanks to the Manhattan Project 's P @-@ 9 Project . The reactor was a large aluminum tank , 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in diameter , which was filled with heavy water , which weighed about 6 @.@ 5 short tons ( 5 @.@ 9 t ) . The cover was pierced by regularly @-@ spaced holes through which 121 uranium rods sheathed in aluminum projected into the heavy water . The tank was surrounded by a graphite neutron reflector , which in turn was surrounded by a lead shield , and by concrete . Shielding on the top of the reactor consisted of layers of 1 foot ( 30 cm ) square removable bricks composed of layers of iron and masonite . The heavy water was cooled with a water @-@ cooled heat exchanger . In addition to the control rods , there was an emergency mechanism for dumping the heavy water into a tank below . Construction began on 1 January 1944 . The reactor went critical in May 1944 , and was first operated at full power of 300 kW in July 1944 . 
 During the war Zinn allowed it to be run around the clock , and its design made it easy to conduct experiments . This included tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors , or occur in impurities . They were also used for trials of instrumentation , and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials , and to train operators . 
 = = = Production piles = = = 
 The design of the reactors for plutonium production involved a number of problems , not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction . Issues such as the long @-@ term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory . Two types of reactors were considered : homogeneous , in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together , and heterogeneous , in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a geometric configuration called a " lattice " . By late 1941 , mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type , and so was chosen for CP @-@ 1 , and subsequently for the production reactors as well . For a neutron moderator , graphite was chosen on the basis of its availability compared with beryllium or heavy water . 
 The decision of what coolant should be used attracted more debate . The Metallurgical laboratory 's first choice was helium , because it could be both a coolant and a neutron moderator . The difficulties of its use were not overlooked . Large quantities would be required , and it would have to be very pure , with no neutron @-@ absorbing impurities . Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor , and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved . None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable . The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont , the company responsible for building the production reactors , and was initially accepted . 
 In early 1943 , Wigner and his Theoretical Group that included Alvin Weinberg , Katharine Way , Leo Ohlinger , Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a design for a production reactor with water cooling . The choice of water as a coolant was controversial , as it was known to absorb neutrons , thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor , but Wigner was confident that his group 's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available , water would work , while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project . 
 The design used a thin layer of aluminum to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water . Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond . Once the radioactivity subsided , the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted . After reviewing the two designs , the DuPont engineers chose the water @-@ cooled one . In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz , Ohlinger , Weinberg , Wigner , and Young . 
 The use of water as a coolant raised the problem of corrosion and oxidation of the aluminum tubing . The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect . It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic , so dilute sulfuric acid was added to the water to give it a pH of 6 @.@ 5 . Other additives such as sodium silicate , sodium dichromate and oxalic acid were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water . The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with the water , and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated . Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons . The aluminum canning process was given close attention , as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor , and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases . The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process . 
 An important area of research concerned the Wigner effect . Under bombardment by neutrons , the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite 's crystalline structure . Over time , this causes the graphite to heat and swell . Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found . 
 = = Chemistry and metallurgy = = 
 Metallurgical work concentrated on uranium and plutonium . Despite being discovered over a century before , little was known about uranium , as evidenced by the fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly 500 ° F ( 260 ° C ) . Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range , uranium could be hammered and rolled , and drawn into the rods required by the production reactor design . It was found that when uranium was cut , the shavings would burst into flame . Working with Alcoa and General Electric , the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug . 
 That the metallurgy of plutonium was completely unknown came as no surprise at all , for it had only recently been discovered . On August 1942 , Seaborg 's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory . Until reactors became available , minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis . The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the Bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium . 
 = = Health and safety = = 
 The dangers of radiation poisoning had become well @-@ known due to the experience of the radium dial painters . When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale , there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects . Robert S. Stone , who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California , was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project 's health and safety program . Simeon Cutler , a radiologist , assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago , before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site . Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project 's Medical Section . Over time , the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance . It was discovered that plutonium , like radium , was a bone seeker , making it especially hazardous . 
 The Metallurgical Laboratory 's Health Division set standards for radiation exposure . Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics , but this could be too late . Personal quartz fiber dosimeters were procured , as were film badge dosimeters , which recorded cumulative dosage . Stone 's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse 's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors , including portable Geiger counters . Herbert M. Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the roentgen equivalent man or rem . After the war , this replaced the roentgen as the standard measure of radiation exposure . Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works began producing it in 1943 . The project set a limit of 5 μg in the body , and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified to ensure that this standard was met . 
 = = Later activities = = 
 During 1943 and 1944 , the Metallurgical Laboratory focused on getting first the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works , and then the B Reactor at the Hanford Site up and running . By the end of 1944 , the focus had switched to training operators . Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943 , and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944 , particularly Hanford and Los Alamos . Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944 , and Zinn became the director of the Argonne Laboratory . Allison followed in November 1944 , taking with him a substantial number of the Metallurgical Laboratory 's staff , including most of the instrument section . He was replaced by Joyce C. Stearns . Farrington Daniels , who became associate director on 1 September 1944 , succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945 . 
 Where possible , the University of Chicago attempted to re @-@ employ workers who had been transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once that work had ended . Replacing staff was nearly impossible , as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze . The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division ; all the rest lost 20 percent or more of their staff . From a peak of 2 @,@ 008 staff on 1 July 1944 , the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1 @,@ 444 on 1 July 1945 . 
 The end of the war did not end the flow of departures . Glenn Seaborg left on 17 May 1946 , taking much of what remained of the chemistry division with him . On 11 February 1946 , the Army reached an agreement with University President Robert Hutchins for the staff and equipment of the Metallurgical Project to be taken over by a regional laboratory based at Argonne , which the university still manages . On 1 July 1946 , the Metallurgical Laboratory became Argonne National Laboratory , the first designated National Laboratory , with Zinn as its first director . The new laboratory had 1 @,@ 278 staff on 31 December 1946 , when the Manhattan Project ended , and responsibility for the national laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Commission , which replaced the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947 . The work of the Metallurgical Laboratory also led to the founding of the Enrico Fermi Institute , as well as the James Franck Institute , at the University of Chicago . 
 In 1974 , the United States government began cleaning up the old Manhattan Project sites under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program ( FUSRAP ) . This included those used by the Metallurgical Laboratory . Stagg Field had been demolished in 1957 , but 23 locations in Kent Laboratory were decontaminated in 1977 , and another 99 at the Eckhart , Ryerson , and the Jones Laboratory in 1984 . About 600 cubic feet ( 17 m3 ) of solid and three 55 @-@ gallon drums of liquid waste were collected and shipped to various sites for disposal . The Atomic Energy Commission terminated its lease on the Armory site in 1951 , and it was restored to the state of Illinois . Testing in 1977 , 1978 and 1987 indicated residual levels of radioactivity that exceeded Department of Energy guidelines , so decontamination was carried out in 1988 and 1989 , after which the site was declared suitable for unrestricted use .

 The Duncan Hunter presidential campaign , 2008 began when fourteen @-@ term Congressman and Vietnam War veteran Duncan Hunter of California announced his intentions to run for the 2008 Republican nomination for President of the United States in January 2007 . 
 In the campaign , Hunter emphasized his conservative credentials , focusing on the issues of border security , the War on Terrorism , and trade . Throughout 2007 , he was in the second tier of Republican candidates , consistently receiving three percent or less support among Republicans in national polls . However , the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll . 
 Though he qualified for one National Convention delegate at the Wyoming caucuses , Hunter dropped out of the race in January 2008 , following a poor turnout in the Nevada caucuses . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hunter served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War . He was awarded a Bronze Star , an Air Medal , and the Vietnam Service Medal for his efforts on the battlefield . Upon his return home , Hunter pursued a career in law and was admitted to the bar in 1976 . Four years later , he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in the Reagan Revolution . 
 At the onset of the 2008 campaign , Hunter had served in Congress since 1981 ; representing California 's 42nd ( 1981 – 83 ) , 45th ( 1983 @-@ 93 ) , and 52nd ( since 1993 ) congressional districts . During his tenure , he boasted a 92 % lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union ( ACU ) . Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14 @-@ mile double @-@ fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border . He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006 , which provided for the construction of an additional 670 miles of fence . As a member of the House Armed Services Committee , Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology . He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of the House in the 2006 mid @-@ term election . 
 = = Announcement = = 
 On October 30 , 2006 , before a crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront , Hunter announced the formation of an exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party 's 2008 presidential nomination . He reasoned , " [ t ] his is going to be a long road , it 's a challenging road , there 's going to be some rough and tumble , but I think it 's the right thing to do for our country . " He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision . The New York Times described the move as a " surprise . " Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter 's run was an attempt to find " something to do " in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House . Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign 's success . Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and " no following within the party " , Hunter " faces extremely long odds " . 
 After the announcement , Hunter received the endorsement of retired Air Force Brigadier General Chuck Yeager . He won the January 13 , 2007 Maricopa County , Arizona straw poll , edging all three projected top tier candidates including Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , Senator John McCain of Arizona , and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani . Ten days later , Hunter filed papers with the Federal Elections Commission to officially begin his presidential campaign .

 = = = First half of 2007 = = = 
 In order to build support early in the campaign , Hunter participated in local straw polls . On March 1 , at the Spartanburg , South Carolina poll , Hunter finished a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani . The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as , " a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support . " The following month he won the Anderson County , South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls . Hunter thanked the counties for their support , which he claimed provided " a huge boost . " He added , " [ i ] t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense , securing our border without amnesty , holding China accountable on trade , and protecting life are resonating with the voters . Our campaign is one of issues , not flash and expense . We don 't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff . We do have the conservative message that is true . In the end , that will be what Americans want . " 
 Hunter participated in all televised Republican Party ( GOP ) debates until January 5 , 2008 ; noted for his role in the May 15 South Carolina debate where he discussed his experience with border security . " I built the border fence in San Diego " , he claimed , arguing it contributed to reductions in the smuggling of narcotics by 90 % and a 50 % drop in crime . Speaking of the bill Congress passed to build 854 miles ( 1 @,@ 374 km ) of border fence across the Southwest , he noted that as of that moment ( May 15 , 2007 ) , only two miles of the fence had been built . He quipped " this [ Bush ] administration has a case of the slows on border enforcement . " 
 The next month , Hunter participated in the third GOP debate , featured on CNN . During the forum , he discussed his experience as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and voiced his support for the War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there . Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq . When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon , Hunter stated that he " would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [ to end development ] if there was no other way to preempt ... " After discussing foreign policy , Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration . He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience 's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district , joking " if they ( illegal immigrants ) get across my fence [ in San Diego ] , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately . " At the end of the debate , Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners : John McCain , Rudy Giuliani , and Mitt Romney . He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men , describing them as the " Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party . " 
 = = = Second half of 2007 = = = 
 A Gallup poll from early July 2007 showed Hunter with three percent support , placing the campaign behind only Rudy Giuliani , Fred Thompson , Mitt Romney , and John McCain . In addition , Hunter won the backing of political commentator Ann Coulter . Hunter described Coulter as " a particularly articulate spokeswoman for the conservative view . " 
 In late August 2007 , Duncan Hunter 's campaign communication 's director , Roy Tyler commented that the chances of Hunter winning the nomination were the same as " pushing a string through a maze . " This came as Hunter spoke to students at the Brown @-@ Lupton Student Center about two foci of his campaign : border security and fair trade with China . He continued campaigning after hearing of the statement and won the Texas Straw Poll a few days later with Tyler at his side . 
 After his victory in the Straw poll , Hunter received media attention for his response to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's invitation to speak to students at Columbia University . He criticized the school for its decision , stating that " if the left @-@ wing leaders of academia will not support our troops , they , in the very least , should not support our adversaries ... " He then called for a revocation of federal funding to the University . These statements resulted in criticism from liberals such as Glenn Greenwald , who described Hunter 's proposal as " dangerous " , " improper " and " unconstitutional " . 
 Later in the month , Hunter 's campaign website was hacked by anti @-@ war activists . For a few hours , the words , " hacked by <unk> <unk> <unk> [ dot ] org No War ! " above images of children in a warzone were posted to Hunter 's site . <unk> , cited in the hacking , appeared to have no connection as IP analysis identified the hackers location in Germany . Roy Tyler revealed that hackers had attempted to change the website at least six times , but this was the first successful alteration . 
 At the October 21 Florida GOP Debate , after expressing that questioner Carl Cameron was trying to divide the Republican Party , Hunter raised an issue he thought might bring the participants together . He reminisced of the time , he felt the " Democrat Party [ sic ] lost its identity " . He compared the Kennedy administration 's failed Bay of Pigs Invasion with President Ronald Reagan 's actions in El Salvador . He described Reagan 's El Salvador policy as successful in advancing freedom , and noted that as he spoke , the military of El Salvador was " fighting side by side with our guys ( The United States military ) in Iraq . " He then referred to the Republican Party as " the Party of Freedom . " 
 Following the debate , Hunter learned that parts of his congressional district were burning as a result of the California wildfires of October 2007 . He immediately stalled campaigning for a short period to help his constituents with the recovery effort . Hunter criticized those who connected the wildfires to the lack of resources because of the War in Iraq . He argued those conclusions were invalid because of San Diego 's direct access to troops , helicopters and equipment . During an update with Neil Cavuto , Hunter remarked that those critics " have got to have some creative writers to somehow link these ... " 
 In November 8 , Hunter received the endorsement of the Missouri Republican Assembly ( MRA ) . The assembly cited Hunter as a " true Republican " who shared their views . Two days later , on Veterans Day , Hunter and his campaign released a statement reflecting on Veterans : 
 We cannot thank them [ Veterans ] all sufficiently ... [ they ] have represented the finest of human qualities ... Our veterans have made [ a ] sacrifice unflinchingly , with a character that General Douglas MacArthur described as ' stainless ' . They make the sacrifice for their comrades in arms , their ' buddies ' and the immediate mission at hand . But in a greater sense they have made the sacrifice for millions of Americans whom they do not know and who do not know them . 
 San Diego selected Hunter as grand marshal for the city 's Veterans Day parade . He considered this selection as an honor . 
 Hunter participated in the November 28 , 2007 CNN / YouTube GOP Debate , and notably , received a question about the military 's " Don 't ask , don 't tell " policy . The questioner , former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked " ... why you [ Republican candidates ] think that American men and women in uniform are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians ? " Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was " unit cohesion , " mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell . After the debate , Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton 's Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee . Because of this , CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts . The next day , Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read : " Dear Hillary Clinton , Regarding the " plant " , retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr , that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN @-@ YouTube debate last night in Florida . Send more ! ! ! Merry Christmas , Duncan Hunter . " The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter . 
 In the December 8 American Research Group survey , excluding undecided voters , Hunter was statistically tied with Fred Thompson for fourth place in Nevada . In Michigan , Hunter was tied with Thompson and Ron Paul for fifth place at four percent , according to a WXYZ @-@ TV poll . Los Angeles Times columnist Don Frederick pointed out that Hunter 's support in the polls came almost entirely from Republican men , where he garnered 6 % among that demographic in the publication 's poll from December 2007 . Among women , his support was nearly zero . 
 Hunter received the endorsement of former U.S. Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire on December 21 . In a letter to New Hampshire Republicans ahead of the first @-@ in @-@ nation New Hampshire Primary , Smith cited Hunter as the best candidate to carry the " Reagan Torch " and the most qualified candidate to protect conservative values .

 Hunter finished seventh in the January 3 , 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses receiving only 0 @.@ 5 percent ( 515 of the 100 @,@ 593 votes cast ) and no delegates . ABC News subsequently denied him an invitation to the January 5 Debate , because Hunter did not meet the five percent polling threshold necessary for participation . However , Hunter focused only minimally on Iowa , putting more resources into the first primary state of New Hampshire . Unlike the other GOP candidates , Hunter traveled to Wyoming for the January 5 , 2008 Wyoming Republican County Conventions . The mainstream media largely ignored the event , and Hunter had campaigned in the state more than any other candidate . Hunter won one national delegate and one alternate delegate after finishing in third place in the caucus behind winner Mitt Romney and second place Fred Thompson . That same day , Hunter addressed the Nevada Republican Assembly at their Presidential Endorsing Convention . He won their endorsement after receiving a two @-@ thirds majority of all votes cast the next day . Members of the assembly cited Hunter as their choice for president " for his stand on the ... the sanctity of life , support of [ the ] constitution , 2nd Amendment rights , security of [ the ] borders , limited government ... " among other aspects of his campaign platform . At the first in the nation New Hampshire primary on January 8 , Hunter finished in seventh place with only one percent of the vote .

 After finishing in last place in the Michigan Republican primary ( receiving one percent ) , the Nevada Republican caucuses ( two percent ) , and the South Carolina Republican primary ( zero ) , Hunter dropped out of the race on January 19 , 2008 . In his withdrawal speech , delivered from the same Naval Base San Diego pier , where he announced his campaign in October 2006 , Hunter thanked his supporters , expressed the amusement he and his family had had on the campaign trail and the influence he had on the debate within the party : 
 The failure of our campaign to gain traction is mine and mine alone , but we have driven the issues of national security , the border fence , the emergence of China and the need to reverse bad trade policy . Because of that , this campaign has been very worthwhile , and for the Hunter family , a lot of fun . 
 Four days later , Hunter endorsed former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for the Republican nomination . Late Show with David Letterman poked fun at Hunter 's relative obscurity by making a mock statement regarding his withdrawal , saying " we don 't know what he actually looks like " and substituting Hunter 's picture with that of character actor Ben Gazzara .

 Nestlé Purina Petcare was formed in December 2001 , when Nestlé acquired Ralston Purina for $ 10 @.@ 3 billion and merged it with Nestlé 's pet food business , Friskies PetCare Company . Ralston , which started as a horse @-@ feed business in 1894 , had marketed the Dog Chow , Cat Chow and Pro Plan pet food brands , while Nestlé produced Friskies and Alpo brand pet foods . 
 The merger was opposed by consumer advocates , such as the Consumer Federation of America , due to anti @-@ trust concerns . The two companies combined would become the largest pet food brand by market @-@ share with a 45 percent share of the cat food market . The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners , creating the separate Meow Mix Company . Ralston 's St. Louis , Missouri location was chosen as the new company 's North America headquarters .

 Nestlé Purina Petcare continued integrating the two companies through 2002 . It cut back dry dog food manufacturing at facilities inherited from Friskies PetCare Company in Jefferson , Missouri , St. Joseph , Missouri and Arden Hills , Minnesota , then moved those operations to manufacturing facilities acquired from Ralston . Expanded manufacturing facilities were planned in Dunkirk , New York and the St. Joseph location was later expanded for wet @-@ food production . In Asia it shifted from a " dealer system " to managing its own distribution . In 2004 Nestlé Purina merged its North American and Latin America operations into a Nestlé Purina PetCare Americas division . 
 In 2003 , Nestlé Purina Petcare formed a partnership with the Canine Health Foundation to advance veterinary research . The following year the company donated 80 tons of pet food to pets affected by Hurricane Charley in Florida and donated $ 100 @,@ 000 to local animal shelters . Nestlé Purina Petcare grew from about 11 percent of Nestlé 's revenues in 2001 , to one @-@ third by 2005 . By 2006 it was the largest market @-@ share holder in the pet food industry with 32 percent of the market . 
 In 2005 , Nestlé Purina Petcare voluntarily recalled all of its dry pet food produced from a plant in La <unk> , Venezuela after an internal investigation verified contaminants that were causing illnesses in pets . According to Fortune Magazine , in 2007 the pet food market " plunged into turmoil " due to the widespread discovery of contaminated ingredients . During this period , Nestle Purina voluntarily recalled some of its Alpo Prime Cuts in Gravy product in the US that contained wheat gluten from China contaminated with <unk> . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 By 2009 , Purina was one of Nestlé 's fastest growing divisions , due to an increasing willingness by consumers to spend more money on <unk> . In 2008 , it formed a separate company called <unk> with headquarters in San Antonio , Texas that sold pet insurance . PetCare was later acquired by <unk> Inc. in 2013 . By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand . Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned solar panel system in the state . In September 2010 , Nestlé reached an agreement to acquire Waggin ' Train , a producer of pet treats with $ 200 million in annual revenues . 
 In August 2013 Purina recalled some of its Purina ONE Beyond dog food , because of one bag that was found to contain salmonella . In 2012 a consumer sued Nestlé Purina Petcare when his pet died after eating Waggin ' Train treats . The Food and Drug Administration received more than 900 reports from grieving pet owners that alleged the treat was causing illness or death in their pets due to chicken products from China . The FDA had issued warnings regarding these ingredients , but lab tests repeatedly confirmed there were no contaminants . Later that year , another consumer started a petition on Change.org asking retailers to voluntarily stop carrying the product . The petition attracted 60 @,@ 000 signatures . The following year , Waggin ' Train and Canyon Creek dog treats were voluntarily taken off the market temporarily after the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets identified trace amounts of antibiotic residue , which is allowed in Europe and China , but not approved in the US . In early 2014 , a $ 6 @.@ 5 million settlement was reached , pending approval by the court . According to The Washington Post , the company later re @-@ introduced the brands after " revamping its manufacturing process and overhauling its supply chain . " 
 In 2013 Nestlé Purina Petcare acquired the pet adoption website <unk> . The following year it acquired <unk> 's , a producer of cat and dog treats . From 2010 to 2012 Nestlé expanded its manufacturing operations in Australia , Hungary and Germany . It also implemented the company 's largest solar panel farm at its facilities in Atlanta , Georgia . In April 2014 Nestlé Purina Petcare opened the first " cat cafe " in the US .

Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn , whereas Purina said independent lab tests confirmed that they do . Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter @-@ suit less than a week later . It also alleged Purina was engaging in what it characterized as a " smear campaign " . The National Advertising Review Board and the Advertising Self @-@ Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo 's advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated . Blue Buffalo said it disagreed , but would obey the ruling .

 = Another World ( video game ) = 
 Another World , also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World ( <unk> , <unk> Wārudo ) in Japan , is a 1991 cinematic platformer action @-@ adventure game designed by Éric Chahi for Delphine Software . The game tells a story of Lester , a young scientist who , as a result of an experiment gone wrong , finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival . 
 Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and MS @-@ DOS , Another World was widely ported to other contemporary systems . Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers , consoles and mobile phones . In 2006 , Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for modern computers , and a subsequent 20th Anniversary Edition five years later that adapted the game for numerous consoles and mobile computing platforms . 
 Another World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real @-@ time and cutscenes , which earned the game praise amongst critics and commercial success . It also influenced a number of other video games and designers , inspiring such titles as Flashback , Ico , Metal Gear Solid , and Silent Hill . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Another World is a platform game , featuring a control scheme wherein the player uses either the keyboard , joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run , jump , attack and perform other , situation @-@ specific actions , such as rocking a cage back and forth . In the initial part of the game , the player 's character Lester is unarmed . He is able to kick at small creatures , but is otherwise defenseless . 
 Later in the game , the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe . The pistol has three capabilities : a standard fire mode , the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire , and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls . Eventually , Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes ( not featured in the original Amiga release ) . Enemies also have the same capabilities , requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them . 
 Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage , and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard . However , the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely . On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game , the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re @-@ enter it when restarting the game later . In any given scene , the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next , features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences , and no on @-@ screen text ; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The protagonist of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin , a young genius physicist . In the opening cinematic , Lester arrives at his high @-@ tech underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator , attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born . Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination , a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator , causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion , opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren , alien planet . 
 After evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals , Lester is captured by a race of humanoid aliens and taken to a subterranean prison camp . Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as " Buddy " and the two of them must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments , battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive . The duo traverse through the prison complex , a cave system and a tower structure . In the game 's climax , Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens , but , with the help of his alien friend , manages to kill his attacker and escape . After reaching the top of the tower , Lester collapses , but is promptly joined by Buddy , who picks up Lester and the two escape on a dragon @-@ like creature , flying off to the horizon . 
 = = Development = = 
 The game 's French designer Éric Chahi had previously worked as a game programmer and then as a graphic designer for video games since 1983 . It was the success of his earlier work with Paul Cuisset as a graphic designer for the adventure game Future Wars for Delphine Software and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop Another World " without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure . " After Future Wars was released in 1989 , Chahi had the choice to either work on Cuisset 's next game , Operation Stealth , or create his own game . As " there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the Amiga at that time , " Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming . 
 In August 1989 , Chahi was impressed by the flat @-@ color animations that the Amiga version of Dragon 's Lair had and thought that it would be possible to use vector outlines to create a similar effect using much less computer storage . After first attempting to write the graphical routines in C , he turned to assembly language . He wrote a polygon routine for the Motorola 68000 on an Atari ST to test his theory , with much success . Later , he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a frame rate of about 20 frames per second , later recognizing this as " a major turning point in the creation of the game " and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work . He was able to take advantage of the Amiga 's <unk> capabilities to create rotoscoped animations with the polygons , using video recordings of himself performing various actions . Though he had tried to use smaller polygons ( which Chahi called " <unk> " ) to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on Deluxe Paint artwork , the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow , and he returned to using bitmapped images . 
 While Chahi had a clear idea of how to implement his game engine , he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game , allowing the game to develop " layer by layer without knowing where it was going . " He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to Karateka and Impossible Mission . Because he wanted to create a dramatic , cinematic experience , the game features no HUD or dialog , giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story . However , with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story , he focused more on creating ambiance , rhythmic pacing , and narrative tension to the game . Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through <unk> BASIC coupled with the game 's engine in <unk> assembler , to control and animate the game , interpreted in real @-@ time by the game engine , effectively creating his own animation sequencer . 
 With the creation of the tools needed for building out the rest of the game by December 1989 , Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine . The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine . Chahi later considered this the " first step in the improvisation process " that he used throughout the rest of development . He finished the game 's introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first level . Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace , developing each section of the game in the chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time . For example , as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own , the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation , reflecting Chahi 's mood at the time . He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally , but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend , and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player imagine this world . 
 Later in the game 's development , Chahi added laser pistols , including the one that Lester carries for several effects . The idea was influenced by the Star Wars franchise , but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options . He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies also helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game . Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players . Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels ; Chahi had used these instead of stairways , as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these . 
 After 17 months of development , Chahi was only about one @-@ third completed with the game , and realized that this rate would have been impractical . He began to take steps to simplify the development , including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game 's puzzles . At the same time , he began to seek a publisher for the game . He first spoke to his former employer , Delphine Software , but also sought other distributors . One , Virgin Interactive , were favorable to Chahi 's game but had suggested that he change it to a point @-@ and @-@ click style adventure game . Chahi had considered changing the game by this request but realized " the effort to do this would have been too huge , and some friends who played the game loved it . " Ultimately , he accepted Delphine 's offer in June 1991 , and set a tentative release date in November . To meet this deadline , Chahi used storyboards to sketch out the rest of the game 's plot , balancing the overall pacing of the game . One ending captured on these storyboards , but abandoned , was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world . The game was finished in 1991 , which inspired the game 's tagline : " It took six days to create the Earth . Another World took two years " ; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project mirrors in the near @-@ death of Lester at the end of the game . 
 Upon publishing , Delphine did not perform a playtest of the full game , only having previously tested the first portion of the game . Delphine 's U.S. publisher Interplay undertook a full playtest and Chahi fixed a number of bugs that arose from this . Interplay had also requested additional changes in the game , including making the game longer and changing the game 's introduction music . Chahi was adamant about retaining the game 's opening music , and had attempted to change Interplay 's minds by sending them an " infinite fax " , a looped piece of paper , with the message " keep the original intro music " on it . Only until Delphine 's lawyer got involved and told Interplay they legally could not change the music did Interplay relax this change . 
 = = Release = = 
 The game was originally released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991 , running at a display resolution of 320 × 200 pixels . These versions received less play @-@ testing than other versions , making for a less @-@ fluid game , but the Amiga 's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports . The game released on the Atari ST is identical , but with a less refined sound , and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga . These versions had code wheel protection that made it difficult to use unauthorized copies , forcing the player to enter a code ( series of figures ) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game . The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game . Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions ; this feature was omitted from most other versions . 
 The game was published in North America under the title Out of This World in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated soap opera television series Another World . Coincidentally , the science fiction sitcom Out of This World aired at the same time of the game 's USA @-@ Canada release .

 Reviews praised the game 's graphics , sound , and gameplay , but criticized its short span . Chahi , working for 16 hours a day for two months , responded with creating a new level just before the amphitheatre scene , when the alien friend rescues Lester at the end of a long dead @-@ end corridor . Chahi said : " I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid . " Also added were more dangers and more save points . This ended up being the 1992 DOS version , which was coded by Daniel Morais , and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions . The Macintosh features higher resolution than the DOS version , but is otherwise identical . 
 Through Interplay Entertainment , the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) , the Sega Genesis ( Mega Drive ) , and the Apple IIGS in 1992 . The SNES , Sega CD , 3DO Interactive Multiplayer ( 3DO ) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a prologue before the introduction begins , which consists of an entry that comes from Lester 's diary . The Mega Drive port 's prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports . The Sega CD version of Another World combines the original game ( with CD quality new music by Freitas ) with the sequel , Heart of the Alien , and was released exclusively in North America as Heart of the Alien : Out of This World Parts I and II . 
 All of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay , and in the case of the Mega Drive conversion , use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions . This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments . Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles <unk> . They also wanted to exchange Jean @-@ François Freitas 's music for a different soundtrack , but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine 's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music . The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman , who said : " Since Interplay wouldn 't pay for a Super FX chip , I found a way to do it with static RAM on the cart and DMA which got me a great frame rate . Interplay wouldn 't pay for the static RAM either , so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction . Interplay wouldn 't pay for a 3 @.@ 6 MHz ROM either . So , frustrated , I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3 @.@ 6 MHz . It worked . I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a <unk> with pure software rendering . " Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS , which has the same <unk> microprocessor . 
 The 3DO port was developed by Interplay in 1993 , and features very detailed raster graphics backgrounds . However , Chahi believes that this actually detracts from the game , because the polygons do not fit in with this , and thus make the backgrounds look flat . The game 's soundtrack was changed again , albeit without any legal troubles , due to Chahi 's focus on a new project . Some new tunes were also added , all played from the disc , such as when Lester escapes the big pool in the first level and when he is grabbed by the guard that appears at the end . At the ending , there is a fragment of the introduction of the sequel , Heart of the Alien . Also included in some versions of this 3DO release is a separate minigame " <unk> " , in which the player pushes up stalactites shapes falling from the top of the screen . Another hidden feature of this version is the animation of Bill Heineman getting his head chopped off . 
 Chahi acquired the rights to Another World 's intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004 . Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones , and it was ported with help from Cyril <unk> . Chahi saw that the game 's playability could be improved , so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming certain parts of the script and made the graphics ' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones ' low resolutions . In July 2005 , almost a decade and a half after it was first released on the Amiga , the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system , thanks to <unk> and developer Magic Productions . In 2006 , Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5 @.@ 0 OS or later in QVGA ( 320 × 240 resolution ) . <unk> entered administration in 2008 , closing the Magic Productions studio . The administrator 's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold , but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name . 
 In 2012 , an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was confirmed and approved by Chahi . It was released as a limited collector 's item in cartridge form , complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro @-@ gaming Connexion ( <unk> ) in 2013 . The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the console 's several processors : the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering ; the GPU performs on @-@ the @-@ fly data decompression ; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects ; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts . The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16 @-@ color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256 @-@ color mode . It can be played in normal and speed @-@ run modes . It supports five languages : English , German , French , Italian , and Spanish . 
 = = = 15th Anniversary = = = 
 After the release of the Pocket PC version , in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version targeted at Windows XP . Emmanuel <unk> increased the resolution to 1280 × 800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds . He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution . The game still supports the original 320 × 200 resolution , as well as the original background art ( as an option ) , and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original , which makes it somewhat easier , as well as newly remixed sounds . 
 The game does not include Interplay 's extra music , but it includes the extra level , as well as the added enemies and hazards from the console versions . This version is part of the Another World 15th Anniversary Edition CD @-@ ROM released in 2007 , which also includes a development diary , an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD . The CD @-@ ROM version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology – upon installation , the game verifies the user 's serial number through the Internet , allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number . <unk> does not reset the count , so after five installations , the player must purchase a new copy . This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com. 
 = = = 20th Anniversary = = = 
 At the 2011 Game Developers Conference , Chahi announced that an Apple iOS port of the title would be created by DotEmu and distributed by <unk> . On September 22 , 2011 , <unk> released a special 20th anniversary edition for the iPhone / iPad , featuring a switch between the original and HD graphics , a new intuitive touch controls or classic D @-@ pad , three difficulty modes and remastered sound effects . The Android version was released in March 2012 , the Steam version was released April 4 , 2013 and <unk> version was released April 22 , 2013 ( 15th Anniversary Edition available on <unk> in the same package as 20th Anniversary Edition ) . 
 The console versions of the 20th Anniversary port were released by Digital Lounge for Xbox One , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita , Wii U , and Nintendo 3DS in June 2014 . The three PlayStation versions allow cross @-@ platform functionality . According to Digital Lounge , the goal was to " simply to deliver the original experience of Another World faithfully , with the benefits of today ’ s hardware and a high level of polish . Chahi said the animations were " refined to remove the rough edges revealed by such a high resolution rendering " of up to 2560 × 1600 pixels .

 The game was unofficially ported to multiple computer and console systems . Some of these ports were later officially authorized by Chahi : 
 In 2004 , Cyril <unk> ( nicknamed " Foxy " ) released an unofficial Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) port by reverse engineering the official Atari ST version . This version 's C code eventually led to a Symbian mobile port . Originally Chahi was against the port , but in 2005 he decided to authorize its distribution . The game was released as freeware for play on the Game Boy Advance on April 28 , 2005 , via a game engine recreation by <unk> . Around the same time , another unofficial GBA source port was made by Gil <unk> . This port was based on the 3DO version , and required the original 3DO CD to run so that only those who already owned the game would be able to play it . 
 A <unk> port of Another World was released on May 31 , 2005 , and a Dreamcast port on December 31 , 2005 , via a game engine recreation by Grégory <unk> ( <unk> ) called raw . An unofficial <unk> port was also made by Philippe Simons using reverse engineering by Grégory <unk> . The port won a prize during the <unk> 2005 competition . 
 In 2011 , Fabien <unk> analysed Another World by reverse engineering and reconstructed a complete C + + source code variant of the internal virtual machine .

 Another World was commercially successful , selling about one million copies during the 1990s . The game received critical acclaim . Computer Gaming World criticized the brief documentation and short length of gameplay , but praised the game 's graphics and Amiga sound , and called it " one of Europe 's most playable and enjoyable arcade efforts . " The Lessers of Dragon gave the game 5 out of 5 stars and called it " an adventure that will keep [ the player ] on the edge of [ one 's ] seat for some time to come . " Reviewing the 3DO version , GamePro said " Out of This World is destined to be a classic " , but that the 3DO version has too little improvement to be worthwhile for those who have already played the game . 
 Among many other accolades , Another World was named as number one top new Amiga game of 1992 by Amiga World and received the award for the Most Innovative New Game of the year from Electronic Gaming Monthly . In 2012 , it became one of the first 14 titles added to the video game art exposition at the Museum of Modern Art . 
 Retrospectively , Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called Another World " one of the most visionary and memorable games of its time . " Reviewing the 15th Anniversary Edition in 2010 , Eurogamer 's John Walker called it " still utterly beautiful " , adding that the game 's art style is " just fantastic . Chahi 's design is exquisitely simple and enormously evocative . Built from spare polygons , its paper @-@ craft @-@ like animation conjures the world , the creatures and the threat wonderfully . " In a 2014 review of the 3DS version , Bob Mackey of USGamer opined " Another World is definitely an experience every gamer should have — and not just for the sake of checking out a historical curiosity . Another World still feels incredibly forward @-@ thinking , almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade 's indie scene without even realizing it . " 
 In 2011 , Wirtualna Polska ranked the " visionary " Another World as the 15th best game for the Amiga , remembering it for a cinematic feel and " uncommonly " high difficulty ( for a first @-@ time player ) and calling it " one of the most important titles in the history of electronic entertainment . " In 2012 , 1UP.com ranked this " short @-@ but @-@ sweet cinematic action game " as the 99th most essential video game of all time , commenting : " Especially in an age of entertainment where fans cry out for pages upon pages lore and glossaries for the tiniest minutiae of their fiction , Out of this World 's dimension contains a sense of mystery that makes it all the more lonely , and often , quietly beautiful . The game can be brutal and heartbreaking , but Chahi 's amazing vision makes [ it ] a thoroughly gripping experience . " That same year , Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top " cult @-@ classic franchise " that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was , commenting that " despite a small cast of characters , minimalist gameplay , and some truly grueling difficulty , Another World ... resonated with gamers in ways they weren 't expecting . The game 's vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time , and the pacing of the heavy , nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape , " and adding that " slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard @-@ earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story . " 
 The alien " Beast " creature from the game 's first level was ranked sixth on the GameSpot 's 1999 top list of best monsters in gaming and IGN ranked the game 's laser gun as the 86th best weapon in gaming history in 2012 . The alien " Buddy " was ranked third on GameSpot 's list of the ten best sidekicks in 2000 , along with a comment that the " groundbreaking " Another World " is one of those rare games that everybody seemed to love . " Discussing " Buddy " in 2013 , Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's Adam Smith called him still " one of gaming ’ s greatest companions " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 A sequel titled Heart of the Alien was developed by Interplay and released exclusively for the Sega CD in 1994 . The game is similar in graphics and gameplay , as the player plays as Lester 's alien friend Buddy . Chahi had nothing to do with the development of the sequel , beyond suggesting " redesigning the game from the alien point of view , " by which he meant making an alternative version of the original game but was misunderstood . In 2014 , Polish filmmaker Bartek <unk> created a live @-@ action fan film titled Another World : The Movie . Chahi has stated in several interviews that he has no intention of making a sequel , as he wants the ending of the original to remain ambiguous and fans could make their own conclusion to Lester 's story . 
 The company that produced Another World , Delphine Software , has since gone into administrative receivership and Another World remains their most recognized game . Paul Cuisset 's best @-@ selling 1992 game Flashback , also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi , features similar gameplay and graphics and makes a few nods to Another World , including the use of personal force fields in combat , a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene , and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene . A very similar plot premise was used in 1999 's Outcast by Infogrames Entertainment , too from France . The game also had a big influence on several other game designers , especially in Japan . Fumito Ueda cited Another World as an inspiration for his creation of Ico . Hideo Kojima , creator of the Metal Gear series , said it was one of the five games that influenced him the most . Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game . 
 Chahi returned to the concept of cinematic platform games after leaving Delphine . In 1998 , he and his company Amazing Studio made Heart of Darkness , which is in many ways a spiritual successor to Another World . After that , Chahi disappeared from the game industry for several years , but in 2005 he regained interest in making video games . In 2011 , Ubisoft released his next game , From Dust .

Rosenberg 's father was Jewish , and her mother was of Irish Catholic background . 
 As a child , Rosenberg enjoyed presenting plays and recruiting other neighborhood children to perform in them . She attended a " massive public high school with a crowd of people bunched in a classroom and expected to learn " in Southern California . She later moved to New York City to join a small theatre company before moving again to Bennington , Vermont to attend Bennington College . She originally aspired to work in Dance and Choreography . She says she began too late , however , so she moved to Los Angeles , California to pursue a career in the film industry instead . She graduated from the University of Southern California 's ( USC ) Peter Stark Producing Program with a Master of Fine Arts degree in film and television producing . 
 = = Career = = 
 Rosenberg 's first project was a dance film commissioned by Paramount Pictures that was ultimately never made . She then shifted to television writing . She first wrote for Class of ' 96 in 1993 , and went on to work on shows including Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman ( 1995 – 1996 ) , Dark Skies ( 1996 ) , The Magnificent Seven ( 1998 ) , Ally McBeal ( 2001 ) and Birds of Prey ( 2002 ) before she came to join the writing staff of The O.C. in 2003 . Leaving The O.C. at the conclusion of its first season , she was hired to write her second screenplay , the 2006 dance film Step Up . ( Later , she was also offered the job of writing the sequel , Step Up 2 the Streets , but turned the offer down as she was busy with other projects . ) 
 Rosenberg went on to write for the television series Love Monkey ( 2006 ) and Dexter ( 2006 – 2010 ) . Her job on Dexter , which is broadcast on Showtime , was her first on a show written for cable — she stated in 2007 , " Cable is the place to be ... it 's just wonderful . " Rosenberg initially worked as a consulting producer and writer on the first season . She and the other members of the Dexter writing staff were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for best Dramatic Series at the February 2008 ceremony for their work on the first season . She gained a staff position as co @-@ executive producer and writer for the second season in 2007 and continued in this role for the third season in 2008 . The writing staff was again nominated for the WGA award at the February 2009 ceremony for their work on the third season . As part of the senior production team she was also co @-@ nominated for the Outstanding Drama Series award at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards . She was promoted to executive producer for the fourth season in 2009 and continued to write episodes . She was nominated for the WGA award a third consecutive time at the February 2010 ceremony for her work on the fourth season of Dexter . 
 Summit Entertainment , the production company which had produced Step Up , offered Rosenberg the chance to adapt Stephenie Meyer 's bestselling novel Twilight into a film of the same name , which she accepted . Her primary inspiration for the adaptation was Brokeback Mountain , which she described as a " great model " of forbidden love alongside Romeo and Juliet , and thought its adaptation from short story to film was " beautiful " . She was given a " manifesto " written by Meyer outlining everything that had to be included or could not be changed in the adaptation . She wrote a detailed 25 @-@ page outline in August 2007 , expecting to have another two months to write the actual screenplay , but had only five weeks to finish the script before the commencement of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . After the release of Twilight , she was hired by Summit to adapt the sequels New Moon and Eclipse , the second and third books in the series , respectively , and she had already begun drafting the New Moon screenplay by November 2008 . 
 In July 2010 , Rosenberg left her role of writer and executive producer on Dexter , explaining that " For the past four years I 've been writing Dexter and one Twilight or another . " She had been hired to adapt the final novel in the Twilight series , Breaking Dawn , which would be split into two films , but she said , " I can do one Twilight and Dexter , but I couldn 't do two . " She was regretful about leaving the series and called it her favorite television experience to date . She has recently signed on to write the script for a relaunch of the Highlander film franchise , with Justin Lin ( Fast Five ) directing . 
 Rosenberg was on the Writers Guild of America 's Board of Directors for five years before stepping back because " you can get really , really wrapped up in it " . She was very active , however , in the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , standing on the line as a strike captain . She is currently involved in the WGA Diversity Committee supporting female screenwriters , but is more active in the League of Hollywood Women Writers , which she and several other women set up while on strike , aiming to fight the " boys ' club mentality " in television writing rooms . 
 As of 2010 , Rosenberg has been developing a Jessica Jones TV series for ABC in which will be based on Alias comic book series by Brian Michael Bendis . However , later in 2012 , it was revealed that ABC had passed on the series and it is being shopped to other network . In October 2013 , following a deal made by Netflix and Marvel , the series was revived as a part of four series and one mini @-@ series commitment in which Rosenberg was brought up to be the showrunner . In December 2014 , the series had cast Krysten Ritter as Jones and revealed the official title of the series as Marvel 's A.K.A. Jessica Jones . In June 2015 , Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to Marvel 's Jessica Jones .

 = House and Senate career of John McCain , until 2000 = 
 John Sidney McCain III retired from the United States Navy in April 1981 . His last four years in the service had been spent as the Navy 's liaison to the United States Senate . He moved to Arizona with his new wife and , aided by a job from his father @-@ in @-@ law and the contacts it gave him , soon began a new career in politics . 
 In 1982 , he was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona 's 1st congressional district . After serving two terms there and making an impression as a rising political figure , he was elected U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986 . He became one of the senators entangled in the Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s , but survived it and was re @-@ elected in 1992 and 1998 . 
 While generally adhering to American conservatism , McCain established a reputation as a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues . In reaction to his Keating Five experience , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns . He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam . His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States . 
 = = Entry into politics and 1982 House campaign = = 
 Having moved to Phoenix in March 1981 , McCain went to work for Hensley & Co . , his new father @-@ in @-@ law Jim Hensley 's large Anheuser @-@ Busch beer distributorship , as Vice President of Public Relations . McCain had little interest in the beer business itself , instead preferring to talk to colleagues about current events . In carrying out his job , he was able to gain political support among the local business community , meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating , Jr . , real estate developer Fife Symington III , newspaper publisher Darrow " Duke " Tully , and locally @-@ well @-@ known auto dealer Lou Grubb , all the while looking for an electoral opportunity . 
 McCain 's original plan had been to run for a new U.S. House of Representatives seat from Arizona , created by reapportionment following the 1980 census , but that turned out to be too far from Phoenix . Then John Jacob Rhodes , Jr . , the longtime Republican congressman from Arizona 's 1st congressional district , announced his retirement in January 1982 after 30 years in Congress . This seat encompassed the East Valley portion of the Phoenix metropolitan area and was very close to where the McCains lived ; his wife Cindy McCain bought a house in the district the same day as Rhodes ' announcement . Rhodes suggested that McCain first run for the Arizona Legislature to gain more experience , but McCain had no interest in slowly working his way up . 
 McCain ran for the seat as a Republican , and formally announced his candidacy in late March 1982 . He faced three candidates in the Republican <unk> real contest in this heavily Republican <unk> of whom had entered the race before him : State Senator Jim Mack , State Representative Donna Carlson @-@ West , and veterinarian and active civic figure Ray Russell . The others were all given a good chance to win the primary election ; McCain ranked at best third in early polls . 
 During the spring and the 110 ° F heat of the Phoenix summer , McCain and his wife campaigned door @-@ to @-@ door six hours a day , six days a week . The exhausting schedule combined with his hair color led to him being nicknamed " The White Tornado " . He was assisted by George " Bud " Day , his former POW cellmate , and Day 's wife , who were familiar with legal and procedural matters . His supporters were dubbed " McCain 's navy " , and he stressed his familiarity with " the ways of Washington " and how his role as Navy Senate liaison had helped bring a defense contract to the district . Still , as a newcomer to the state , McCain was hit with repeated charges of being a carpetbagger . Finally , at a candidates forum , he gave a famous refutation to a voter making the charge : 
 Listen , pal . I spent 22 years in the Navy . My father was in the Navy . My grandfather was in the Navy . We in the military service tend to move a lot . We have to live in all parts of the country , all parts of the world . I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona , but I was doing other things . As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi . 
 Phoenix Gazette columnist John Kolbe would later label this " the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I 've ever heard . " 
 McCain 's campaign fell into early debt ; his wife began loaning him tens of thousands of dollars to keep it alive . Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives , but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned . By the close of the primary , McCain was able to outspend his opponents ; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $ 167 @,@ 000 that his wife lent to the campaign . ( The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family 's assets under her name ; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns . In the end , $ 93 @,@ 000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven . ) The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising , including a highly effective two @-@ minute mini @-@ documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country . Rival Mack later called that ad the best political commercial he had ever seen . 
 McCain was endorsed by Senator John Tower , a friend and mentor from his liaison stint who in turn got McCain the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and Senator Paul Fannin . Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater , the state 's most powerful political figure , was officially neutral in the race , but many of his aides were working for McCain 's opponents . Goldwater himself was said to view McCain as a political opportunist , despite admiring his military service . Late in the race , Goldwater appeared to make a public statement critical of McCain , but Tower persuaded Goldwater not to confirm it to reporters and the damage was limited . McCain benefited from the support of Duke Tully 's The Arizona Republic , the state 's most powerful newspaper . 
 McCain won the highly contested primary election on September 7 , 1982 , getting 32 percent of the vote compared to Russell 's 26 percent , Mack 's 22 percent , and Carlson @-@ West 's 20 percent . As expected , he skated to victory in the general election two months later , defeating Democrat William E. <unk> by a 66 percent to 31 percent margin .

 = = = House years = = = 
 McCain made an immediate impression in Congress . His POW background , social skills , and contacts from his Navy Senate liaison job made him popular and a star among new House members . He was elected the president of the 1983 Republican freshman class of representatives . After strenuously lobbying the Republican leadership , he was assigned to the Committee on Interior Affairs . He coveted this assignment because he wanted to develop expertise on issues relevant to his state , including water rights , public land management , and Native American affairs . He was also assigned to the Select Committee on Aging , important due to Arizona 's large retired population , and eventually to the chairmanship of the Republican Task Force on Indian Affairs . He fulfilled a campaign pledge to return to his congressional district every weekend , making 47 such trips in his first year . On them , he met frequently with constituents and make many public appearances . This , combined with his wife Cindy 's decision to live in Arizona rather than move to Washington , helped solidify his political base in Arizona . 
 McCain sponsored a number of Indian affairs bills , dealing mainly with distribution of lands to reservations and tribal tax status ; most of these bills were unsuccessful . In August 1983 , he voted against a bill making Martin Luther King , Jr . Day a federal holiday , saying it would be too expensive and that there were already enough federal holidays . The measure , which had failed four years earlier , now passed the House 338 – 90 and was signed into law later that year . 
 McCain ’ s politics at this point were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan , whom McCain would later describe as his greatest political influence : " I embraced all of the core Reagan convictions : faith in the individual ; skepticism of government ; free trade and vigorous capitalism ; anticommunism ; a strong defense ; robust internationalism that championed our values abroad ; and most important , his eloquently stated belief in America 's national greatness ... " McCain supported Reaganomics . He was in favor of school prayer and opposed abortion . He subscribed to most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration , including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union . He supported the Reagan administration 's policy towards Central American conflicts , including the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua . During the early 1980s , he served on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom , a chapter of the World Anti @-@ Communist League which was an international group that , among other things , aided the rebels in Nicaragua ; McCain suspected the council of illegal activity and resigned in 1984 . 
 McCain voted against a 1983 resolution allowing President Reagan to keep U.S. Marines deployed as part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon , on the grounds that he " [ did ] not foresee obtainable objectives in Lebanon . " After the catastrophic Beirut barracks bombing a month later , this stance against his party and president gained him national media exposure and started his reputation as a political maverick . McCain sided with Newt Gingrich 's group of young conservatives in some of their battles against the House Democratic leadership , but declined to join Gingrich 's Conservative Opportunity Society . McCain felt personal affection for Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O 'Neill , and established good relations with some Democrats in the House , such as Paul Simon and especially Mo Udall . 
 McCain won re @-@ election to the House easily in 1984 , facing no Republican primary opposition and defeating Democratic energy analyst Harry W. Braun with 78 percent of the vote to 22 percent in the general election . In this and subsequent Arizona campaigns , McCain rarely emphasized his Vietnam and prisoner of war experiences . 
 In the new term , McCain gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in addition to his existing assignments . McCain got the Indian Economic Development Act of 1985 signed into law , and the following year worked on early attempts at legislation regarding Indian gaming . He took moderate stands on the environment and on social issues , and applauded Jack Kemp 's concerns for African Americans and other underprivileged groups . In 1985 he returned to Vietnam with Walter Cronkite for a CBS News special , and saw the monument put up next to where the famous downed " air pirate Ma Can " had been pulled from the Hanoi lake ; it was the first of several return trips McCain would make there . In 1986 , McCain voted to override Reagan 's veto of the Comprehensive Anti @-@ Apartheid Act that imposed sanctions against South Africa . 
 In December 1985 , McCain visited Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and junta member Admiral José Toribio Merino . McCain told the U.S. Embassy in Santiago that both meetings were friendly and warm , but described Pinochet as obsessed with the dangers of communism and likened him to the John Birch Society . Merino 's statement to McCain that the junta would not support a Pinochet bid to remain president was made publicly known ( but McCain ’ s meeting with Pinochet was not declassified until 2008 , upon which it was widely reported in the Latin American mainstream press ) . McCain did not visit opposition leaders during the 1985 trip , as the U.S. Ambassador had recently been doing . Both Pinochet and his ministers refused to meet in January 1986 with a U.S. Senator who visited opposition leaders . McCain later called upon the Chilean government to respect the upcoming Chilean national plebiscite of 1988 . 
 = = = More children = = = 
 In 1984 McCain and his wife Cindy had their first child together , daughter Meghan . She was followed in 1986 by son John Sidney IV ( known as Jack ) , and in 1988 by son James . In 1991 , Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three @-@ month @-@ old girl , who badly needed medical treatment for a severe cleft palate , to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa ; the McCains decided to adopt her , and named her Bridget . A drawn @-@ out adoption process began , slowed down by uncertainty over the exact fate of the girl 's father , but in 1993 the adoption was ruled final . McCain then stood by his wife when she disclosed in 1994 a previous addiction to painkillers and said that she hoped the publicity would give other drug addicts courage in their struggles . Beginning in the early 1990s , McCain began attending the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ member North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona , part of the Southern Baptist Convention , later saying " [ I found ] the message and fundamental nature more fulfilling than I did in the Episcopal church . [ ... ] They 're great believers in redemption , and so am I. " Nevertheless , he still identified himself as Episcopalian , and while Cindy and two of their children were baptized into the Baptist church , he was not .

 McCain decided to run for United States Senator from Arizona in 1986 , when longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater retired . No Republican would oppose McCain in the primary , and according to his press secretary Torie Clarke , McCain 's political strength convinced his most formidable possible Democratic opponent , Governor Bruce Babbitt , not to run for the seat . Instead McCain faced a weaker opponent , former state legislator Richard Kimball , a young politician with an offbeat personality who slept on his office floor and whom McCain 's allies in the Arizona press characterized as having " terminal weirdness . " McCain 's associations with Duke Tully , who by now had been disgraced for having concocted a fictitious military record , as well as revelations of father @-@ in @-@ law Jim Hensley 's past brushes with the law , became campaign issues . 
 In the end , McCain won the election easily with 60 percent of the vote to Kimball 's 40 percent . A New York Times profile at the time said that McCain seemed " poised to emerge as a significant figure in national politics " . At the same time , McCain 's increasing involvement in Arizona state party politics caused resentment on the part of some other Republicans . This led to McCain falling out with Congressman Bob Stump and powerful state legislator Jane Hull .

 Upon entering the Senate in 1987 , McCain kept a low profile . He became a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work ; he was also given positions on the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee . For his first two years in the Senate , he sat at the Candy desk . 
 McCain was a strong supporter of the Gramm @-@ Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits . He voted in favor of Reagan 's failed 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court . 
 McCain often supported the Native American agenda , advocating economic development and self @-@ governance , as well as sovereignty and tribe control of adoptions . " Never deceived them , " McCain once said , " They have been deceived too many times in the last 200 years . " Along with Senator Daniel Inouye and Representative Mo Udall , McCain was one of the main drafters of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act , which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises and established the balance between Indian tribal sovereignty and regulatory oversight by the states of such activity . After its passage , McCain stated his personal opposition to Indian gaming , but said that when communities under poverty " are faced with only one option for economic development , and that is to set up gambling on their reservations , then I cannot disapprove . " The Act enabled the growth of what would become , two decades later , the $ 23 billion Indian gaming industry , and McCain has been called " one of the founding fathers of Indian gaming . " 
 Martin Luther King , Jr . Day had become a big issue in McCain 's home state , with Governor Evan Mecham making opposition to it his signature stance . McCain had continued his opposition to the holiday by supporting Mecham 's rescinding of the Arizona holiday for King in 1987 . In 1988 , Mecham was impeached and removed from office due to felony charges . McCain told Mecham , " You should never have been elected . You 're an embarrassment to the party . " By 1989 , McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday , but reversed position on the state holiday , due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one . He told Republicans opposing the state holiday , " You will damn well do this . You will make this a holiday . You 're making us look like fools . " In 1990 , a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held ; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it . However , Mecham led an effort that year that defeated the referendum . 
 During the late 1980s , McCain gained some national visibility . He delivered a speech , about a fellow Hanoi Hilton prisoner 's persistence in making an American flag despite beatings , that drew audience tears and a standing ovation at the 1988 Republican National Convention . He was mentioned by the press as being on the short list for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush 's vice @-@ presidential running mate , and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush . In 1989 , he became a staunch defender of his friend John Tower 's doomed nomination for U.S. Secretary of Defense ; McCain butted heads with Moral Majority co @-@ founder Paul <unk> , who was challenging Tower regarding alleged heavy drinking and extramarital affairs . Thus began McCain 's difficult relationship with the Christian right ; he would later write that <unk> was " a pompous self @-@ serving son of a bitch . " 
 McCain supported the United States invasion of Panama in 1989 . McCain partnered with Senator Al Gore on the 1989 Missile and Proliferation Control Act , which established sanctions on companies and nations that engaged in the trade or development of long @-@ range missile systems , and the 1992 Iran @-@ Iraq Arms <unk> Act ( commonly known as the Gore @-@ McCain Act ) , which established penalties for persons and companies assisting Iraq or Iran in acquiring missile technology . 
 = = = Keating Five scandal = = = 
 John McCain 's upward political trajectory was jolted when he became enmeshed in the Keating Five scandal , a highly visible part of the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s . Charles Keating Jr . ' s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association , a subsidiary of his American Continental Corporation , was insolvent as a result of some bad loans . In order to overcome its debt , Lincoln violated " direct investment " rules by directing accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into commercial real estate ventures . This caught the eye of federal regulators , who were looking to shut Lincoln down . Keating contacted five senators to whom he made contributions , looking for them to intervene with the regulators on his behalf . 
 McCain and Keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 . Between 1982 and 1987 , McCain had received $ 112 @,@ 000 in lawful political contributions from Keating and his associates . In addition , McCain 's wife Cindy and her father Jim Hensley had invested $ 359 @,@ 100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986 , a year before McCain met with the regulators . McCain , his family , and their baby @-@ sitter had made nine trips at Keating 's expense , sometimes aboard the American Continental jet . 
 By March 1987 , Keating was asking McCain to travel to meet with regulators regarding Lincoln Savings ; McCain refused . Keating called McCain a " wimp " behind his back , and on March 24 the two had a heated , contentious meeting . On April 2 and April 9 , 1987 , McCain and the other senators met at the Capitol with regulators , first with Edwin J. Gray , chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , and then members of the FHLBB San Francisco branch , to discuss the government 's investigation of Lincoln . McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two meetings was " the worst mistake of my life " . 
 News of the meetings first appeared in National Thrift News in September 1987 , but was only sporadically covered by the general media through April 1989 . Towards the end of that period , after learning Keating was in trouble over Lincoln , McCain paid a total of $ 13 @,@ 433 for his air trips . 
 The regulators backed off Keating , and Lincoln stayed in business . Still desperate for cash , it convinced customers to replace their federally @-@ insured certificates of deposit with higher @-@ yielding junk bond certificates of American Continental . In April 1989 , Lincoln failed ; about 23 @,@ 000 customers were left with worthless bonds , and many elderly investors lost their life savings . Federal regulators filed a $ 1 @.@ 1 billion civil racketeering and fraud suit against Keating . The five senators came under investigation for attempting to influence the regulators . 
 In the end , none of the senators was charged with any crime . Instead , the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them . Robert S. Bennett , who was the special investigator for the committee , wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn , on the grounds of insufficient evidence , but the committee disagreed . After public hearings , McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising " poor judgment " in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating 's behalf , but its 1991 report said that McCain 's " actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him .... Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate . " ( In later years , several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated a contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target . ) On his Keating Five experience , McCain said : " The appearance of it was wrong . It 's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators , because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence . And it was the wrong thing to do . " 
 The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue , for lack of jurisdiction , any possible ethics breaches in McCain 's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter 's expense , because they occurred while McCain was in the House . The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction , because McCain was no longer in the House . It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years , on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating 's company . McCain and his staff were suspected of having leaked to the press sensitive information about the investigation that came from some of the closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee . McCain denied doing so under oath , although several press reports , and later one of the investigators , concluded that McCain had been one of the main <unk> during that time . 
 McCain survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press . He held a lengthy press conference in which he answered all questions . With his blunt manner , he became a frequent guest on television newscasts and talk @-@ oriented news shows , especially once the 1991 Gulf War – which he had voted in favor of – began and his military and POW experience came into demand . McCain began campaigning against lobbyist money in politics from then on . 
 McCain 's 1992 re @-@ election campaign found his opposition split between Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and impeached and removed former Governor Evan Mecham running as an independent . Although Mecham garnered some hard @-@ core conservative support , Sargent 's campaign never gathered momentum and the Keating Five affair did not dominate discussion . Sargent , who had a failed race for the Arizona Legislature in her background , was slow getting her campaign underway and , although 1992 was the Year of the Woman in American politics , failed to get the endorsement of organizations such as Emily 's List . McCain outspent Sargent , $ 3 million to $ 350 @,@ 000 . 
 McCain again won handily , getting 56 percent of the vote to Sargent 's 32 percent and Mecham 's 11 percent . McCain 's victory put a final end to Mecham 's political career . During the same election Arizona finally passed a referendum , which McCain supported , enabling the state Martin Luther King , Jr. holiday . 
 = = = Vietnam redux = = = 
 McCain was a co @-@ sponsor of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 , which enabled disability benefits for Vietnam veterans afflicted with Agent Orange @-@ related diseases and established periodic scientific reviews to determine what levels of exposure and diseases would be covered . In January 1993 , McCain was named chairman of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute , a non @-@ profit democracy @-@ promotion organization with informal ties to the Republican party . The position would allow McCain to bolster his foreign policy expertise and credentials as well as his future fundraising prospects . At the same time , he was named head of recruiting and fund @-@ raising for Republican senatorial candidates . Further in 1993 , a melanoma was discovered on his shoulder and removed . In 1990 , McCain voted to confirm David Souter as a Supreme Court justice , and in 1991 , he supported the contentious but eventually successful nomination of Clarence Thomas . In 1993 and 1994 , McCain voted to confirm President Clinton 's nominees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer , whom he considered to be qualified for the Supreme Court despite differing judicial philosophies from his . He would later explain that " under our Constitution , it is the president 's call to make . " 
 McCain was a key member of the 1991 – 1993 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs , chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry , which was convened to investigate the Vietnam War POW / MIA issue : the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War . The committee 's work included more visits to Vietnam and persuading the Department of Defense to declassify over a million pages of relevant documents . The committee 's final report , which McCain endorsed , stated that , " While the Committee has some evidence suggesting the possibility a POW may have survived to the present , and while some information remains yet to be investigated , there is , at this time , no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia . " After many years of disliking Kerry due to his actions with Vietnam Veterans Against the War , McCain developed " unbounded respect and admiration " for him during the hearings . 
 The actions of the committee were designed to allow for improved ties between the two countries , although that goal was not shared by a large segment of Republicans . McCain pressed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam , partly because it was " a time to heal ... it 's a way of ending the war ; it 's time to move on , " and partly because he saw it in the U.S. national interest to do so , in particular envisioning Vietnam as a valuable regional counterbalance against China . In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution , sponsored by Kerry and McCain , that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam ; it was intended to pave the way for normalization . During his time on the committee and afterward , McCain was vilified as a fraud , traitor , or " Manchurian Candidate " by some POW / MIA activists who believed that large numbers of American servicemen were still being held against their will in Southeast Asia . They were angry that McCain did not share their belief and that he sought to normalize relations with Vietnam . McCain 's high profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs ; McCain and 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot , who had helped McCain 's wife Carol during her husband 's captivity , also had a falling out over the POW / MIA issue , which then extended to Perot blasting McCain 's remarriage to Cindy McCain . In return , McCain attacked those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action . 
 In response to the criticism of the committee 's findings , McCain said that he and Kerry had convinced the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records , and that he had spent thousands of hours trying to find real , not fabricated , evidence of surviving Americans . McCain 's push for normalization was opposed by some leading Senate Republicans , including Phil Gramm and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole . In 1995 , President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam . McCain 's and Kerry 's visible support during the announcement gave Clinton , who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military , some political cover . 
 These actions were of a piece with McCain 's attitude towards domestic reconciliation from the Vietnam era ; unlike many who went to Vietnam ( some of whom were his best friends ) , he did not hold grudges against those who did not go . In 1993 he had offered to escort Clinton on a speaking visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at a time when some veterans were angrily challenging Clinton 's moral right to go there . He also struck up a friendship with an anti @-@ war leader , David Ifshin , who had once traveled to Hanoi to make an anti @-@ American propaganda broadcast that McCain had heard in his cell . 
 = = = A maverick senator = = = 
 Having survived the Keating Five scandal , McCain made attacking what he saw as the corrupting influence of big money on American politics his signature issue . Starting in late 1994 he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform ; their McCain @-@ Feingold bill would attempt to put limits on " soft money " , funds that corporations , unions , and other organizations could donate to political parties , which would then be funneled to political candidates in circumvention of " hard money " donation limits . From the start , McCain and Feingold 's efforts were opposed by some of the interests targeted , by incumbents in both parties , by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech , and by those who wanted to lessen the power of what they saw as media bias . On the other hand , it garnered considerable sympathetic coverage in the national media , and from 1995 on , " maverick Republican " became a label frequently applied to McCain in stories . He has used the term himself , and one of the chapters in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For would be titled " Maverick " . The first version of the McCain @-@ Feingold Act was introduced into the Senate in September 1995 ; it was filibustered in 1996 and never came to a vote . 
 In 1993 , McCain opposed military operations in Somalia , saying it was " an unfocused mission that lacks an objective " ; after 18 American deaths in the Battle of Mogadishu , he introduced a resolution to bring U.S. forces home immediately , but it was defeated in the Senate . McCain similarly opposed Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994 . He was initially opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Bosnian War , voting against the George H. W. Bush administration on a 1992 resolution that would have authorized " demonstrations of force " in conjunction with the Operation Provide Promise humanitarian relief effort there . McCain 's view changed after the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre , and he voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the 1995 NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Bosnian Serb Army . 
 McCain attacked what he saw as pork barrel spending within Congress , believing that the practice did not contribute to the greater national interest . Towards this end he was instrumental in pushing through approval of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 , which gave the president the power to veto individual expenditures . Although this was one of McCain 's biggest Senate victories , the effect was short @-@ lived as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional in 1998 . In a more symbolic attempt to limit congressional privilege , he introduced an amendment in 1994 to remove free VIP parking for members of Congress at D.C. area airports ; his annoyed colleagues rejected the notion and accused McCain of grandstanding . He was the only Republican senator to vote against the Freedom to Farm Act in 1996 , saying that it catered to special interests rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy . He was one of only five senators to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , on the grounds that it put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers . 
 McCain became chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995 , and would hold that position into 1997 . McCain 's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg 's well @-@ received The Nightingale 's Song , a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military in American life . At the start of the 1996 presidential election , McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas Senator Phil Gramm . After Gramm dropped out , McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole , and was again on the short list of possible vice @-@ presidential picks . McCain formed a close bond with Dole , based in part on their shared near @-@ death war experiences ; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign . 
 In 1997 , McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee ; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee 's purview , but responded by saying that , " Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee " and that he restricted those contributions to $ 1 @,@ 000 and thus was not part of the big @-@ money nature of the campaign finance problem . In that year , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most Influential People in America " . McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998 , proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti @-@ smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers , increase research money on health studies , and help states pay for smoking @-@ related health care costs . The industry spent some $ 40 – 50 million in national advertising in response ; while McCain 's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups , most Republican senators opposed it , stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy . The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain . During 1998 a revised version of the McCain @-@ Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration ; in addition to banning soft money , it sought to restrict " issue ads " run by independent groups within 60 days of an election . While having majority support , it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds , and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture . 
 McCain easily won re @-@ election to a third senate term in November 1998 , gaining 69 percent of the vote to 27 percent for his Democratic opponent , environmental lawyer Ed Ranger . Ranger was a motorcycle enthusiast whose Harley @-@ Davidson was painted as the flag of Arizona and a political novice who had only recently returned from four years of working and living in Mexico . McCain carried Democratic stronghold Apache County by 54 – 42 percent and won Hispanic votes statewide by 52 – 42 percent . McCain took no " soft money " during the campaign , but still raised $ 4 @.@ 4 million for his bid , saying that he had needed it in case the tobacco companies or other Washington special interests mounted a strong effort against him . One of Ranger 's campaigning points had been that McCain was really more interested in running for president ; McCain indeed created a presidential exploratory committee the following month . 
 McCain had been uncomfortable and largely silent during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal , partly because his own personal life had not been without blemishes , and partly because his upcoming presidential nomination run restricted his political options . During the early 1999 Impeachment of Bill Clinton , McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts . In his remarks on the Senate floor , McCain said : " Although I may admit to failures in my private life , I have [ always ] kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country . I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives . I cannot — not in deference to public opinion , or for political considerations , or for the sake of comity and friendship — I cannot agree to expect less from the President . " 
 During 1999 , the McCain @-@ Feingold Act once again came up for consideration , this time with soft money prohibition features in but the issue ads provision out . McConnell challenged McCain to name specific senators who had been corrupted by existing campaign finance practices , but McCain refused . In the end , the same failure to gain cloture befell the legislation again . During that year , McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact this campaign finance reform ; McCain was cited for opposing his own party on the bill at a time when he was trying to win the party 's presidential nomination . Indeed , by April 1999 aspects of McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign were underway , and his stance regarding the Kosovo War and other issues would take place in that context .

 = Felling , Tyne and Wear = 
 Felling is one of the largest urban areas in Gateshead , Tyne and Wear , England . Formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century , the town of Felling was subsumed by neighbouring Gateshead in 1974 and it now forms part of the metropolitan borough of Gateshead . It lies on the <unk> Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass , less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of Gateshead town centre , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south east of Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne and 10 miles north west of the City of Sunderland . In 2011 , Felling had a population of 8 @,@ 908 . 
 The history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years . The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the Brandling family in 1509 . While Lords of the Manor , several members of this family served as Members of Parliament among other civic duties . They were also instrumental in bringing heavy industry to the area , and Felling Colliery ( John Pit ) , one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region , was developed on their estate . The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives , to which Sir Humphrey Davey and George Stephenson developed their safety lamps ( There is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary 's churchyard , Heworth ) . Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore , then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling , administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road . That council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead . 
 Felling today is broadly residential save some light industry located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling . It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party . The vast majority of residents identify as white British and , in the north areas particularly , there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation . It is well served by public transport ; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and Felling . Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a £ 13 @.@ 5 million regeneration project , with the demolition of the old Co @-@ op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units , which now run parallel to a new Asda <unk> long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings , several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed . It is served by several schools , though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low . Leisure provision is good , with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities . Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling , including former England international Chris Waddle , as does award @-@ winning author David Almond . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and , in 1920 , was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled . Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name , despite country @-@ wide tree felling , it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell , which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell , then still rising to High Fell , before descending down to the Tyne through Felling . Ing is a place name ending which means " the people of " . In the 13th century , the Prior of Durham enfeoffed Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling " to hold by homage , fealty , knights ' service , two marks rent , and suit at the prior 's every fortnight " . The estate then passed to Walter 's son , Adam , whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death , whereupon it was passed to Ralph de <unk> . In 1331 , the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by Bishop Lewis Beaumont , who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son , Thomas , inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old . Thomas lived only 35 years , but is notable for having been High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1422 . The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509 , when the last surviving member of that family died . 
 There followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate , which also included Low <unk> Manor near Darlington , was contested between the families Brandling , a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family , Blaxton and <unk> . While several elements of the estate where divided by share , in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by Deed of Partition to Robert Brandling and his heirs " for life and to the total extinction " of any other claims . 
 = = = The Brandling family = = = 
 Brandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne . He became sheriff of Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne in 1524 , was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the Duke of Somerset at <unk> . When he died in 1568 , the estate passed to his brother Thomas . In 1605 , Thomas ' grandson , Robert Brandling , inherited the manor . Robert Brandling was granted Newminster Abbey by King James in 1810 , served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth . When he died in 1636 , the estate passed to his son , Sir Francis Brandling . Francis was also an MP , albeit for Northumberland , between 1824 – 25 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at Alnwick Abbey . He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling , a cavalry colonel who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick . Charles had two brothers . The older of which , Ralph , was killed at the Battle of Marston Moor , while the second brother , Robert , also participated in the English Civil War and was captured in an otherwise successful Royalist engagement at Corbridge in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the Roundheads ; an action which earned his the reputation as " a very knave " which he carried until his death in 1669 . 
 = = = Early industrialisation 1680 – 1800 = = = 
 By the turn of the 18th century , Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages . However , Ralph Brandling , the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time , had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670 . He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth , and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt , glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area . At around 1750 , a large copper @-@ works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne ; the first such works to be developed on the river . Encouraged by these developments , Ralph Brandling 's son , Charles Brandling , firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near @-@ surface coal on his estate and then , encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate , began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction . The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779 , working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms . A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798 . 
 = = = Felling mining disasters = = = 
 On 19 January 1811 , the original High Main seam at Felling Colliery was closed , but by that time the colliery had grown enormously . The colliery was deepened to reach the Low Main seam . Two shafts were provided : John Pit and William Pit . The Low Main and began operation in October 1810 . Disaster struck Felling Colliery on 25 May 1812 when , despite the colliery containing the most up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures , firedamp ignited and at around 11 @.@ 30 am , " one of the most tremendous explosions in the history of coal mining took place " . Two explosions rocked the colliery , the blast appearing in both pits . A cloud of coal dust and debris over a radius of a mile and a half was ejected from the colliery . One account recalled : 
 Immense quantities of dust and coal rose high into the air in an inverted cone ... In the village of Heworth , this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it . As soon as the explosion was heard , wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit . Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance . The crowd soon collected to several hundreds , some crying out for a husband , others for a parent or a son , and all affected by a mixture of horror , anxiety and grief . 
 Following the first blast at 11 : 30 , rescue attempts started at 12 : 15 . At 14 : 00 the second blast occurred and no further rescues occurred . Some 29 men were saved , but the remaining 92 men and boys were killed . Two days later the decision was made to seal the colliery to starve the fire of oxygen . Just one year later , on 24 December 1813 , a further catastrophe occurred : 
 About half @-@ past one o 'clock on the morning , an explosion took place in Felling colliery , by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity , several others severely burnt , and all the underground horses but one destroyed . The accident occurred at the time of calling course , or when one set of men were relieving another . Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit , waiting to go down , when the blast occurred , and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft ; these were most miserably burnt and mangled . 
 The 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary 's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street . 
 = = = The Industrial Revolution = = = 
 In spite of the disaster , Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially . There now existed three distinct villages . Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling ; a residential village in the township of Heworth which had attracted several Wesleyan and Methodist preachers . Slightly to the north lay Low Felling . This was a more heavily industrialised village , containing Felling colliery , a large chemical works and other manufacturers , though in 1834 it was noted that there also existed " a few neat houses and many cottages for the colliery which , with small gardens attached , give an aspect of comfort to the village " . At the north and on the bank of the River Tyne , a populous manufacturing and trading village had developed known as Felling Shore , spreading across three miles of the bank of the Tyne . A Methodist church was built there in 1805 . This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay , coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built . Industry continued to flourish here ; the <unk> established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded , an oil and a paper mill had also developed , along with forging works for anchors and shovels . 
 In 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham . In 1834 a second large chemical works was established by Hugh Lee Pattinson , John Lee and George Burnett ; it soon employed around 300 men . Grindstone quarries produced high quality stone and a <unk> pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business . In 1842 , Brandling Station was opened at <unk> Street in Felling on the Brandling Junction railway linking Gateshead , South Shields and Sunderland . This is one of the oldest passenger stations in the world . 
 By around 1870 , Felling had reached its industrial peak . Historian John Marius Wilson noted : 
 <unk> , a large village and a chapelry in Jarrow parish , Durham . The village stands on the Northeastern railway , 1 ½ mile SE of Gateshead ; increased recently from two hamlets to its present condition ; is maintained by factories and by mining operations ; connects with Felling @-@ Shore , a coal @-@ shipping place on the Tyne ; and has a post @-@ office under Gateshead , a r. station , a church built in 1866 , four dissenting chapels , and a Roman Catholic chapel . The chapelry was constituted in 1866 . Population 5 @,@ 105 . The living is a vicarage . Value , £ 300 . Patrons , Five Trustees . 
 = = = 1870 – present day = = = 
 The industrial heights proved reasonably short @-@ lived . By 1860 , improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline . This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock , which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling . At around the same time , the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts . The industrial decline was matched by continuous residential growth , so that by the Victorian era those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged . 
 At 10 : 52 am on 26 March 1907 , an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station . The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink . The derailment , which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely , cost two passengers their lives , with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock . 
 The decline of heavy industry , meanwhile , continued apace . In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict , leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil . Felling Colliery , the oldest and most extensive of all Felling 's industry , had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs . Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison 's ship yard , but this too closed in 1964 . 
 In place of industry came housing . The high density terraced housing which had accompanied the industrial boom of the 19th century had sprawled south and was soon joined by a wave of development at the run of the 20th century . The earlier housing came at Stuart Street , Temple Street and Helmsdale Avenue in the form of Tyneside flats . In the inter @-@ war years , whole derelict industrial areas were cleared and large council estates of semi @-@ detached houses , with front and back gardens , were built at the Old Fold , Stoneygate , Brandling and Nest estates . By the time that Felling ceased to be an independent town and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1974 , Felling had become a " dormitory area " and remains so today . 
 = = Economy = = 
 There are two principal economic areas in Felling . The first of these is at Felling Shore , where the East Gateshead Riverside Park was built in 1966 and which , combined with the Felling Shore industrial estate , today houses 241 businesses employing around 6 @,@ 400 people . The second is in central Felling in the town centre area around Victoria Square . The town centre has seen massive investment over recent years , with the complete redevelopment of the main shopping centre and addition of a new Asda superstore , a Greggs bakery , Card Factory shop , Subway sandwich outlet and a local taxi business . Other amenities include a Post Office , Heron Foods store and several bookmakers , as well as 4 public houses and fast food outlets 
 The " North Felling Neighbourhood Profile Supporting Document " ( <unk> ) noted in 2006 that there were no clothing stores or shoe stores , no doctor or dentist and around 19 % of the units were occupied low @-@ end , discount traders . Some 26 @.@ 2 % of units were fast foot retailers or cafes . The vacancy rates were high at 30 % and the units tended to remain vacant for lengthy periods which gave the area a " run down " feel . 
 Levels of unemployment in Felling are high . Only 52 @.@ 4 % of the total working age population are in employment , as compared to 61 @.@ 7 % in the borough overall . Around 10 % of residents claim Jobseeker 's Allowance ; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough . Youth unemployment levels are also very high at 14 % , which compares to a borough average of 9 % and is also the highest figure in Gateshead . The average income of residents is only £ 18 @,@ 000 per annum ; this compares to a Gateshead average of £ 27 @,@ 000 and is the lowest figure in the borough . 
 = = Geography and topography = = 
 Felling , at latitude 54 @.@ 950 ° N and longitude 1 @.@ 564 ° W , lies less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south and east of Gateshead town centre on a bed of carboniferous sandstone and clay , interspersed with coal measures laid down around 300 million years . It is split bilaterally by the Felling By @-@ Pass to the north and by Sunderland Road more centrally . The distance from Felling to London is 255 miles ( 410 km ) . 
 The urban expansion of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries difficult to define . Although administratively considered one area , official documentation has split Felling into three distinct neighbourhoods : North , Central and High Felling . Felling North is roughly comparable to the old settlement at Felling Shore , bounded to the north by the River Tyne and the south by Sunderland Road . The other neighbourhoods also broadly follow their historical boundaries ; the central area includes Felling town centre and the surrounding streets , while High Felling incorporates Coldwell Lane and the adjoining streets moving south towards Windy Nook . 
 Felling lies on land which is steep at the riverbank but which initially flattens at the north then begins to climb , with some slope south to north centrally before consistently sloping , at times steeply , in High Felling . At the south @-@ west corner , the land reaches a maximum height of around 130 metres ( 430 ft ) above sea @-@ level . 
 Felling is now largely bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough . These are Windy Nook to the south , Deckham and the town of Gateshead to the west and Heworth and the Leam Lane Estate to the east . To the extreme north , Felling is bounded by the River Tyne , the largest river in the North East of England . This affords very good views into Newcastle upon Tyne . 
 Land use is mixed . The land to the extreme north adjacent to the river is mostly industrial , split by the Felling By @-@ Pass . The land south of the By @-@ Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest , Brandling , Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates . Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square . At High Felling , land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25 % green @-@ space , including a park , cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street . 
 = = Governance = = 
 In 1843 , High Felling , Low Felling and Felling Shore were independent villages in the <unk> of Heworth , along with High and Nether Heworth , Bill Quay , Windy Nook , Carr Hill , Wardley and <unk> . In 1894 the first Felling Urban District Council sat at Felling . The council " was the offspring of that ancient township and inherited its customs , its local government , its land and its people " , so that all of those villages combined to become the town of Felling . In 1902 , the council moved to new administrative buildings at Sunderland Road , known thereafter as Felling Town Hall . The urban council administered the Felling District until its final meeting , concluded with a rendition of the <unk> <unk> , on 28 March 1974 , when Felling was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 . 
 Immediately prior the creation of the metropolitan borough , Felling was an independent town but improved housing elsewhere and better transport links have seen the area decline in stature so that , today , Felling is simply a council ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead . It is approximately 3 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ) in area and has a population of 8 @,@ 202 . It is represented by three councillors . In June 2012 , they were Bill Dick , Paul McNally and Sonja Dickie . 
 Felling is part of the Westminster parliamentary constituency of Gateshead . It was previously in the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency which was abolished by boundary changes before the 2010 UK General Election . For many years the MP was Joyce Quin , who retired on 11 April 2005 and was awarded a life peerage into the House of Lords on 13 June 2006 and is now Baroness Quin . The present MP Ian Mearns , is a member of the Labour party and his office is in Gateshead . He replaced Sharon Hodgson who successfully campaigned in the newly formed constituency of Washington and Sunderland West . In the 2010 UK General Election , Mearns was elected with a majority of 12 @,@ 549 over Frank Hindle . The swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats was 3 @.@ 9 % . Felling is in a safe Labour seat . Mearns ' success in 2010 followed of Sharon Hodgson , who in the 2005 UK General Election polled over 60 % of the votes cast while in 2001 , Joyce Quin was returned with a majority of 53 @.@ 3 % . 
 = = Demography = = 
 According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 , Felling has a population of 7 @,@ 299 — 51 @.@ 5 % of the population are female , slightly above the national average , while 48 @.@ 5 % are male . Only 2 @.@ 3 % of the population were from a black or other minority ethnic group ( BME ) , as opposed to 9 @.@ 1 % of the national population . The average life expectancy is 71 years for men in Felling and 75 years for women . These compare unfavourably to borough averages of 76 and 81 years respectively . 
 The proportion of lone parent households varies hugely across the area ; in High Felling the figure is 11 @.@ 5 % , in Central Felling it is 12 @.@ 2 % but in North Felling the figure is 22 @.@ 3 % . The latter is the second highest figure in Gateshead and all compare with a borough average of 11 @.@ 5 % . A similar pattern emerges as regards households with dependent children ; in Central and High Felling the proportions are low at 16 @.@ 6 % and 23 @.@ 1 % , while in North Felling the figure 34 @.@ 8 % . These compare to figures to 29 @.@ 5 % nationally and 28 @.@ 4 % in Gateshead . The Index of Multiple Deprivation , which divides England into 32 @,@ 482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation , splits Felling into several areas and in 2010 listed North Felling , Old Fold , Sunderland Road and Falla Park in the top 10 % of all deprived areas in England in 2012 . 
 In 2011 however , there was a massive population increase from 7 @,@ 299 a decade earlier to 8 @,@ 908 . The ethnic minority population has also increased from being 96 @.@ 6 % White British in 2001 to 92 @.@ 3 % in 2011 . 
 Felling , like nearby Deckham , is a rapidly growing area with more and more people from other countries settling in the area . In 2011 , 7 @.@ 7 % of Felling 's population were non White British compared with only 3 @.@ 4 % in 2001 . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The suburb is bisected principally by the A184 . Built in 1959 , the road is commonly referred to as the Felling bypass though it " is really nothing of the kind " as the road splits residential areas of Felling almost neatly in half . Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre from the western fringe is approximately seven minutes and twelve minutes into the centre of Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne , while the journey time from the eastern parts of Felling is approximately ten minutes longer . Until the building of the bypass , the principal road in the settlement was <unk> Sunderland Road ; a former turnpike road and tram route where civic and commercial buildings still stand as a testament to the road 's past importance . While diminished in stature today , Sunderland Road remains an integral local distributor . 
 There are two Tyne and Wear Metro stations . Travelling towards Gateshead , the first is Felling Metro station , located between Sunderland Road and <unk> Street , around three minutes walk from Felling town centre . The station itself is described in one official document as " unwelcoming and even intimidating " which creates a negative impression and , although the principal public transport hub , is underused by residents who often prefer to walk to Pelaw Metro rather than risk encountering anti @-@ social behaviour at the station . Another Metro station located west of the suburb , at Shelley Drive , is Gateshead Stadium Metro station . This station to the west of Felling and is approximately five minutes walk from Gateshead International Stadium . 
 Pelaw Metro station and Heworth Metro station are located in the east of the area . 
 Felling lies on three major bus routes into Gateshead ; Split Crow Road / Crowhall Lane , Sunderland Road and the Felling Bypass . The provision through Crowhall Lane is particularly good . The suburb is served by several bus services , such as the Orbit 51 which travels to Heworth Interchange and terminates at Gateshead , the 93 / 4 Loop which travels to the Team Valley and the " 69 Pulse " which travels into the western Gateshead villages of Whickham and Blaydon . All of the buses which serve Low Fell are operated by Go North East under the administration of Nexus . 
 = = Culture = = 
 In 1963 , Felling was twinned with Saint @-@ Étienne @-@ du @-@ Rouvray , France . When it was absorbed into Gateshead in 1974 , the twinning arrangement was transferred to Gateshead . 
 = = = Listed buildings = = = 
 A number of listed buildings are located in and around the town centre . Arguably the most significant is Crow Hall , a Grade II * listed building , is an early 18th @-@ century sandstone and ashlar , one @-@ room deep building at Crowhall Lane . The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage and gate piers are Grade II listed buildings . At Victoria Terrace stands Felling post office ; a two @-@ story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof . Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club , built as a dance hall in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930 , at Victoria Square . Both are Grade II listed buildings . Also a Grade II listed building is <unk> ; the first house built at Holly @-@ Hill field in Felling constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows . The gates , gate piers and walls are also Grade II listed . Almost immediately next door stands a house and shop at 35 Davison Street ; another Grade II listed building . 
 Travelling north , the old Town Hall building at Sunderland Road is a Grade II listed building . Built in 1902 and designed Henry Miller , the Felling <unk> surveyor , this is another ashlar and sandstone building in the Baroque style . The five piers and lamp @-@ holders guarding the town hall are also Grade II listed . The Brandling Junction railway building , now an urban studies centre , has been restored and is also a Grade II listed building . At the extreme north of the town at Riverside Park , the former engine house of Tyne Main Colliery , built in 1820 , is also a Grade II listed building . 
 = = = Churches = = = 
 There are two churches in Felling which are also listed buildings . Christ Church , at Carlisle Street , is a Grade II listed building built in 1866 by Austin and Johnson . Built in the early English style , there are two stained glass windows , added in 1874 , and the north aisle was completed in 1903 by J Potts and Son . The church has been in continuous use since opening and today the Anglican church continues to offer religious worship and contributes to the local community through a variety of outreach programmes . Also a Grade II listed church is the Church of St Patrick at High Street . A Roman Catholic church built between 1893 – 95 by Charles Walker of Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne , St Patrick 's is a " bold though <unk> " sandstone , slate and ashlar building with considerable ornamentation to the exterior though the interior is considered " roomy but uninteresting " . Officially opened on St Patrick 's Day in 1895 , the church is a replacement for the older St Patrick 's RC Chapel at Felling Shore . The church presbytery is also a Grade II listed building . 
 = = Parks and leisure = = 
 There are four principal parks . Arguably the most notable is Felling Park , a landscape park which envelops the old Town Hall buildings at the eastern end of Sunderland Road and the Holly Hill area . Opened in 1910 , this park contains an open bandstand at the centre ( but was taken down due to vandalism ) , tennis courts and a bowling green and a traditional children 's play area . In the area leading uphill from Sunderland Road to the park there are numerous bedding plants which " brighten up Sunderland Road every spring " . Felling Park was locally listed as of special local historic interest by Gateshead Council in 2004 . Sunderland Road Park is at the western end of Sunderland Road approaching Gateshead town centre . This park is a former cemetery and at the front stands a Victorian water fountain replete with a religious inscription . Built in 1895 , the fountain had fallen victim to vandalism in recent years but this " important local landmark " was restored in 2011 . Also in Felling are Bede Community Park ; a large , open space park at the centre of the residential development at Old Fold Road which contains a traditional play area and Heworth Welfare Park ; a smaller park to the south at <unk> which also has a children 's play area , installed in 2006 , and an outdoor bowling green . 
 The principal leisure facility in Felling is the Gateshead International Stadium . The original stadium was opened in 1955 , on land reclaimed from chemical dereliction and at a cost of £ 30 @,@ 000 , by Jim Peters and contained a running and cycling track . The stadium was fitted with a synthetic running track in 1974 and was subject to major expansion in the 1980s , when football , rugby and hockey pitches were added along with an indoor sports hall and weights room . Said to have been the original driver of urban regeneration in Gateshead , the venue has hosted various world class athletics events , including the European Cup in 1989 and 2000 and also the British Grand Prix , a Diamond League meet , between 2008 – 10 . Two sporting clubs are currently based at the stadium . These are Gateshead Harriers , an athletic club who count the present triple jump world record holder Jonathan Edwards in their past alumni , and also Gateshead F.C. who currently play in the Conference National . 
 Other leisure facilities include the <unk> 's Way , a 14 @-@ mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore . Named from the keelboats used to transport coal from the various collieries in the area , the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator , Councillor Roy Deane . Also at Felling Shore , at Green Lane , is Friar 's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar 's Goose Water Sports Club , a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle @-@ aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing , yachting and angling on the River Tyne . Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally , and there are a wide selection of public houses , including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street , the Blue Bell in Victoria Square , the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest . 
 = = Education = = 
 Felling is served by a number of primary schools . Colegate Community primary school , at Colegate West , is a satisfactory school with well behaved pupils who make satisfactory progress . Falla Park Community primary school on Falla Park Road is an average sized school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals is well above the national average . This is a good school where pupils perform consistently well at key stage two . Also a good school is The Drive Community primary school ; a smaller than average school which achieves good results despite being located in an area of " considerable social disadvantage " . To the north , at Mulberry Street , lies Brandling primary school ; another good , smaller than average @-@ sized school . Bede Community primary school , at Old Fold Road , is in an area with a " high incidence of social and economic deprivation " with a very high proportion of children entitled to free school meals and with learning difficulties . Here children do not achieve as well in examinations but instead enjoy a high level of personal development and so , according to the latest OFSTED report , this too is a good school . 
 Roman Catholic school provision is also provided at Old Fold Road by St Wilfrid 's R.C. primary school . This small school , which includes a specific provision for traveller families , is satisfactory according to the latest OFSTED report . Alternative Catholic school provision had been available at St John the Baptist R.C. primary school , which also served Felling at Willow Drive but was closed down due to lack of pupils in the summer 2011 after 74 years of operation . The school is now a Jewish girls school . 
 Secondary school provision is provided by Thomas Hepburn Community Academy at <unk> Road . The school has around 700 students enrolled and the number of students entitled to free school meals is more than twice the national average . The latest inspection declared this to be a " satisfactory and improving " school where over 70 % of students obtain 5 or more grade A * – C in GCSE examinations and where those children from economically deprived backgrounds achieve better than similar children nationally . 
 Overall , levels of academic achievement in Felling are low . Only 59 % of adults have 5 or more GCSEs at grade A * – C. This compares to a borough average of 80 % and is the lowest figure in the borough . The figure falls to 33 % when GCSE English and Mathematics are included ; this is the second lowest figure in Gateshead and is lowered only by neighbouring Deckham . 28 % of school pupils have a special educational need ; the highest figure in the borough and 8 % higher than the Gateshead average . 
 = = Notable residents = = 
 Felling has a long history of producing professional footballers . Arguably the most notable of these is Chris Waddle . Waddle , born 14 December 1960 and a lifelong Sunderland supporter , was a professional footballer who played for Newcastle United , Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Marseille and who won 62 caps for England . Despite winning three league titles in France and playing in the 1991 European Cup Final , the skilful winger is probably most remembered for missing England 's fifth penalty in the semi @-@ final of the 1990 World Cup . 
 Other footballers include Albert Watson , born in Felling in 1903 , who made 373 appearances for Blackpool F.C. Watson is most remembered for scoring the " £ 10 @,@ 000 goal " which saved the club from relegation in the 1930 – 31 season . Peter Wilson was born in Felling in 1947 and emigrated to Australia in 1968 after failing to break into the first @-@ team at Middlesbrough F.C. Wilson , an uncompromising defender , made 64 appearances for Australia , including captaining the side during the 1974 World Cup finals . A " fascinating character " , he has not spoken publicly for two decades and lives as a recluse in Sydney . Also from Felling is Kevin Arnott who played for Sunderland & Sheffield United amongst others . Not forgetting of course local cult hero James J Boyle who represented Gateshead FC . 
 Author David Almond was born in Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne in 1951 and spent his childhood in Felling . His 1998 work Skellig reflected the loss of his baby sister when he was a child growing up and was a critical success ; winning the Carnegie Medal and Whitbread Book of the Year . Now a " staple in secondary schools " , Skellig was adapted into film and opera in 2008 . Almond has since released several other works to critical acclaim , including Kit 's Wilderness , The Fire Eaters and Clay . 
 Also a resident of Felling was Sir Godfrey Hilton Thomson . Born in Carlisle in 1881 , Thomson 's mother returned to her native Tyneside soon after his birth and settled at Low Felling , where he attended school . Thomson graduated from Kings College , Newcastle , becoming a Professor in 1920 and ultimately moving to the University of Edinburgh as Professor of Education in 1925 . An expert in <unk> , he devised numerous groundbreaking tests for children , which were widely used in the 1920s , and published several books , including Instinct , Intelligence and Character ( 1924 ) and A Modern Philosophy of Education ( 1929 ) . Thomson 's death in 1955 was described as a " great loss to psychology " .

 = Cauldron ( video game ) = 
 Cauldron is a two @-@ dimensional ( 2D ) shoot ' em up / platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software ( Palace ) . The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers . Players control a witch , who aims to become the " Witch Queen " by defeating an enemy called the " Pumpking " . 
 Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner , Cauldron originated as a licensed video game of the horror film Halloween . Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday . The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot ' em up and platform game , respectively . The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined . 
 The game received praise from video game magazines , who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play . A common complaint was Cauldron 's excessive difficulty . The following year , Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II : The Pumpkin Strikes Back . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Players navigate the witch protagonist through the 2D game world from a side @-@ view perspective . Cauldron is divided into two modes of play : shooting while flying and jumping along platforms . Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broom stick , while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns . In the flying segments , players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients . The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch 's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking . While traversing the game world , the witch encounters Halloween @-@ themed enemies such as pumpkins , ghosts , skulls , and bats , as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls . A collision with an enemy causes the witch 's magic meter ( which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies ) to decrease . The character dies once the meter is depleted . After dying , the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled . Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur , and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero . 
 = = Development = = 
 Cauldron began development as a game based on the 1978 film Halloween . Palace obtained the video game rights and assigned Steve Brown to the project . Unable to develop a concept he was happy with , Brown took the game in a new direction . Inspired by the Halloween holiday , he envisioned a game featuring witches and pumpkins . Stuart Hunt of Retro Gamer , however , attributed the switch to Mary Whitehouse 's campaign against so @-@ called ' video nasties ' in the 1980s . 
 Brown submitted concept drawings to Palace co @-@ founder Pete Stone , who approved further development . Influenced by what he deemed a " classical witch " , Brown designed the witch with a long nose and a broomstick . He created a Plasticine model of the character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game 's box art . Brown was joined by Richard Leinfellner , who served as the lead programmer . The two enjoyed different video game genres — Brown liked platform games , while Leinfellner preferred shoot ' em ups — and decided to create a game engine that could handle both methods of playing . Both developers play tested the game , but only played the segments individually rather than in a sequence . In retrospect , Brown attributes the game 's excess difficulty to this along with the fact that the two played with unlimited game lives . The game was released on three home computers : Amstrad CPC , Commodore 64 , and ZX Spectrum . The Spectrum and Amstrad versions lack scrolling graphics in the shoot ' em up levels and use flick @-@ screening to approximate it . A port of Palace 's 1984 game The Evil Dead , originally programmed for the Commodore 64 by Leinfellner , was included on the second side of the Spectrum cassette . Retailers feared a parental backlash , resulting a limited release for the game . Palace chose to include The Evil Dead to distribute the game to a wider audience . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The game was well received by the video game press , who focused on the graphical quality and game design . Computer and Video Games described the game as a " quality arcade @-@ adventure " and called the graphics stunning . Reviewers from Crash magazine praised the animation and detail of the graphics , as well as the gameplay . Three of Zzap ! 64 's reviewers — Julian Rignall , Bob Wade , and Gary Penn — echoed similar statements about the graphics . The group complimented the gameplay , specifically the adventure aspects , and considered the large game world a positive component . A Computer Gamer reviewer praised the flying portions of the game , calling the gameplay enjoyable . While he praised the platforming portions , the reviewer commented that design flaws made the game more difficult than it should have been . Clare Edgeley of Sinclair User praised the graphical quality of the ZX Spectrum version , but commented that the colors occasionally overlap and the screen flickers . ZX Computing 's reviewer praised the ZX Spectrum conversion , calling it superior to the Commodore 64 release . The reviewer lauded the graphics and gameplay of the flying segments , but bemoaned the platforming aspect and described it as a Jet Set Willy clone . 
 Publications dedicated to the ZX Spectrum platform considered the inclusion of The Evil Dead with the ZX Spectrum release a positive aspect that added value to the overall package . The game 's difficulty was a common complaint . Computer Gamer , Crash , and ZX Computing commented that playing the game with limited lives was very challenging . Retro Gamer 's Craig Grannell described the game as " unforgiving " , citing difficulty landing and excessive precision required in the flying and platforming segments respectively . Following the success of Cauldron , Palace released a direct sequel , Cauldron II : The Pumpkin Strikes Back , in 1986 . The game is set after the events of the first game , and features a bouncing pumpkin that survived the witch 's ascension to power . Players navigate the pumpkin around a castle in search of the Witch Queen to enact revenge . Cauldron was later re @-@ released along with its sequel as a compilation title on Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum computers .

 GRB 970508 was a gamma @-@ ray burst ( GRB ) detected on May 8 , 1997 , at 21 : 42 UTC . A gamma @-@ ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays , the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation , and often followed by a longer @-@ lived " afterglow " emitted at longer wavelengths ( X @-@ ray , ultraviolet , optical , infrared , and radio ) . 
 GRB 970508 was detected by the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor on the Italian – Dutch X @-@ ray astronomy satellite BeppoSAX . Astronomer Mark Metzger determined that GRB 970508 occurred at least 6 billion light years from Earth ; this was the first measurement of the distance to a gamma @-@ ray burst . 
 Until this burst , astronomers had not reached a consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth . Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way , but are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic . Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic . Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive , the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way , effectively ending the debate . 
 GRB 970508 was also the first burst with an observed radio frequency afterglow . By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals , astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light . This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions .

 A gamma @-@ ray burst ( GRB ) is a highly luminous flash of gamma rays — the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation . GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the Vela satellites ( a series of spacecraft designed to detect nuclear explosions in space ) . The initial burst is often followed by a longer @-@ lived " afterglow " emitted at longer wavelengths ( X @-@ ray , ultraviolet , optical , infrared , and radio ) . The first GRB afterglow to be discovered was the X @-@ ray afterglow of GRB 970228 , which was detected by BeppoSAX , an Italian – Dutch satellite originally designed to study X @-@ rays . 
 On Thursday May 8 , 1997 , at 21 : 42 UTC , BeppoSAX 's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor registered a gamma @-@ ray burst that lasted approximately 15 seconds . It was also detected by Ulysses , a robotic space probe designed to study the Sun , and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment ( BATSE ) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory . The burst also occurred within the field of view of one of BeppoSAX 's two X @-@ ray Wide Field Cameras . Within a few hours , the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box — a small area around the specific position to account for the error in the position — with a diameter of approximately 10 arcminutes . 
 = = Observations = = 
 After a rough position of the burst had been determined , Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Large Array . Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20 centimeters at 01 : 30 UTC , less than four hours after the discovery . While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski , who was working with the Hale telescope . Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey , but he found no new sources of light within the error box . Mark Metzger , a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory , conducted a more extensive analysis of the data , but was also unable to identify any new light sources . 
 The following evening Djorgovski again observed the region . He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May 8 and May 9 . Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity , but he assumed it was a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow . Titus Galama and Paul Groot , members of a research team in Amsterdam led by Jan van <unk> , compared images taken by the WIYN Telescope on May 8 and the William Herschel Telescope on May 9 . They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time . 
 After discovering the burst 's X @-@ ray afterglow , the BeppoSAX team provided a more accurate localization , and what Metzger had assumed to be a variable star was still present in this smaller error box . Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object . On May 10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery , which was later confirmed to be the burst 's optical afterglow . 
 On the night between May 10 and May 11 , 1997 , Metzger 's colleague Charles <unk> recorded the spectrum of the variable object at the W. M. Keck Observatory . He then sent the data to Metzger , who after identifying a system of absorption lines associated with magnesium and iron determined a redshift of z = 0 @.@ 8349 ± 0 @.@ 0002 , indicating that light from the burst had been absorbed by matter roughly 6 billion light @-@ years from Earth . Although the redshift of the burst itself had not been determined , the absorbent matter was necessarily located between the burst and the Earth , implying that the burst itself was at least as far away . The absence of Lyman @-@ alpha forest features in the spectra constrained the redshift to z ≤ 2 @.@ 3 , while further investigation by Daniel E. Reichart of the University of Chicago suggested a redshift of z ≈ 1 @.@ 09 . This was the first instance in which scientists were able to measure the redshift of a GRB . Several optical spectra were also obtained at the <unk> Alto Observatory at wavelength ranges of 4 @,@ 300 – 7 @,@ 100 Å ( 430 – 710 nm ) and 3 @,@ 500 – 8 @,@ 000 Å ( 350 – 800 nm ) , but no emission lines were identified . 
 On May 13 , five days after the first detection of GRB 970508 , Frail resumed his observations with the Very Large Array . He made observations of the burst 's position at a wavelength of 3 @.@ 5 cm and immediately detected a strong signal . After 24 hours , the 3 @.@ 5 cm signal became significantly stronger , and he also detected signals at the 6 and 21 cm wavelengths . This was the first confirmed observation of a radio afterglow of a GRB . 
 Over the next month , Frail observed that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly from day to day but increased on average . The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths , which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way . Such radio scintillations ( rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object ) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3 <unk> . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 BeppoSAX 's Gamma @-@ Ray Burst Monitor , operating in the energy range of 40 – 700 keV , recorded a fluence of ( 1 @.@ 85 ± 0 @.@ 3 ) × 10 − 6 erg / cm2 ( 1 @.@ 85 ± 0 @.@ 3 nJ / m2 ) , and the Wide Field Camera ( 2 – 26 keV ) recorded a fluence of ( 0 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 1 ) × 10 − 6 erg / cm2 ( 0 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 1 nJ / m2 ) . BATSE ( 20 – 1000 keV ) recorded a fluence of ( 3 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 2 ) × 10 − 6 erg / cm2 ( 3 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 2 nJ / m2 ) . 
 About 5 hours after the burst the apparent magnitude of the object — a logarithmic measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object — was 20 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 3 in the U @-@ band ( the ultraviolet region of the spectrum ) and 21 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 1 in the R @-@ band ( the red region of the spectrum ) . The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2 days after the burst was first detected — 19 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 3 in the U @-@ band at 02 : 13 UTC on May 11 , and 19 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 2 in the R @-@ band at 20 : 55 UTC on May 10 . 
 James E. Rhoads , an astronomer at the Kitt Peak National Observatory , analyzed the burst and determined that it was not strongly beamed . Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5 × 1050 ergs ( 5 × 1043 J ) , and Rhoads determined that the total gamma @-@ ray energy was approximately 3 × 1050 erg ( 3 × 1043 J ) . This implied that the gamma @-@ ray and kinetic energy of the burst 's ejecta were comparable , effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays . 
 = = Distance scale and emission model = = 
 Prior to this burst , astronomers had not reached consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth . Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested that they do not occur within the disk of the Milky Way , some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way 's halo , concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic . Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic . The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst 's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory , effectively ending the debate . 
 Throughout the month of May the radio scintillations became less noticeable until they ceased altogether . This implies that the radio source significantly expanded in the time that had passed since the burst was detected . Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended , Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light . While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball , this was the first strong evidence to support such a model .

 The afterglow of GRB 970508 reached a peak total luminosity 19 @.@ 82 days after the burst was detected . It then faded with a power law slope over about 100 days . The afterglow eventually disappeared , revealing the burst 's host , an actively star @-@ forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V 
 = 25 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 15 . The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0 @.@ 70 ± 0 @.@ 07 . The redshift of GRB 970508 's optical afterglow , z = 
 0 @.@ 835 , agreed with the host galaxy 's redshift of z = 0 @.@ 83 , suggesting that , unlike previously observed bursts , GRB 970508 may have been associated with an active galactic nucleus . 
 = Vespertine = 
 Vespertine is the fourth solo album by Icelandic musician Björk , released on 27 August 2001 , on One Little Indian Records . It was recorded at locations in Spain , Iceland , and the United States in 2000 ; production began during the filming of Dancer in the Dark , which was characterized by conflict between the singer and director Lars von Trier . Björk , a self @-@ titled coffee table book containing photographs of the singer throughout her career , was released simultaneously with the album . Vespertine 's sound reflected Björk 's newly found interest in the music of artists such as Opiate and Console , who were also enlisted as producers . 
 Björk wanted to make an album with an intimate , domestic sound , deviating from the sonority of her previous studio album , Homogenic . With the rising popularity of Napster and music downloads , she decided to use instruments whose sound would not be compromised when downloaded and played on a computer : these include the harp , the celesta , clavichord , strings and custom music boxes . Assisted by the duo Matmos , Björk created " <unk> " from various household sounds , such as that of shuffling cards and ice being cracked . Lyrically , it revolves around sex and love — sometimes explicitly — inspired by the singer 's new relationship with Matthew Barney . Other lyrical sources include a poem by E. E. Cummings , the play Crave , and her collaborator Harmony Korine . 
 Vespertine was widely acclaimed by critics . Praise centred on its erotic , intimate mood and sonic experimentation . The record has been featured in several publications ' lists of the best albums of 2001 and the best albums of the decade , and was often considered Björk 's best album to date . The album peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 in the US , and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart . Three singles were released from Vespertine : " Hidden Place " , " Pagan Poetry " , and " Cocoon " . The record was certified Gold in Canada , France and the UK . In 2001 , the singer enlisted Zeena Parkins , Matmos , and a choir of Inuit women to embark on the Vespertine World Tour . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In July 1996 , Björk published a poem titled " Techno Prayer " in Details magazine which would later be used as part of the lyrics of " All Neon Like " . It featured thematic ideas such as <unk> and thread @-@ weaving that she would later explore on Vespertine . Björk had released her previous studio album , Homogenic , in 1997 . The album was highly acclaimed on its initial release and stylistically differed from her previous two releases , described by her as " very emotionally confrontational and [ ... ] very dramatic " . In 2000 , she starred in Lars von Trier 's Dancer in the Dark , and composed its soundtrack , Selmasongs . The filming process was <unk> . Von Trier believes the problem was two @-@ fold : they were both used to being the " dictator " over their products , and Björk was unable to separate herself from her character while acting . Björk wrote " he has to destroy [ his female leads ] during the filming " and declared that she would never make another movie . Her performance was praised : the film was awarded the Palme d 'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and she received the Best Actress award . On 25 March 2001 , Björk attended the 73rd Academy Awards — as " I 've Seen It All " was nominated for Best Original Song — wearing a swan dress designed by Marjan <unk> that caused a media frenzy and was widely criticized . 
 While she worked on the film , she also began producing her next album , writing new music , and teaming with new collaborators . She has said " Selmasongs was the day job and Vespertine was the hobby " . The earliest sessions took place in Spain with programmer Jake Davies . Her new relationship with artist Matthew Barney , and the tension while filming Dancer in the Dark , have been referred to as the two major forces that shaped what would become Vespertine . As the process of filming demanded that she be extroverted , the new music she was creating became hushed and tranquil as a way to escape . Björk commissioned <unk> Sigurðsson to relocate some of his studio equipment from Iceland to Denmark where Dancer in the Dark was being filmed . While living in Copenhagen , she also contacted the electronic musician Thomas Knak ( also known as Opiate ) , after having enjoyed his 1999 album Objects for an Ideal Home . Björk 's musical taste shifted from the " clang and clatter " and " thumping techno " that characterized Homogenic , as she grew tired of " big beats " . 
 Björk then set about making a record with a domestic mood featuring " everyday moods and everyday noises translating into melodies and beats " , hence its working title Domestika . She began to use her laptop to write music , and Vespertine has been retrospectively referred to as " her laptop album " . For the string and music box arrangements , she used Sibelius <unk> software . In Iceland , programmers Jake Davies and Marius de Vries joined Björk for a writing session , laying down more tracks , in addition to nine already mixed . Then , she " set up camp [ ... ] during summer " in a New York City loft , and began to work with harpist Zeena Parkins . Much of Vespertine was " composed , crafted and edited " in that loft , in what has been called the " Domestika sessions " . Some tracks were recorded as an overdub " on top of a slave mixdown " of the Spanish sessions . As she wanted to write her own songs on music boxes , Björk contacted a music box company requesting transparent acrylic boxes because she wanted the sound to be " as hard as possible , like it was frozen " . Björk decided to use instruments whose sound would not be compromised when downloaded from sites such as Napster . She explained : 
 I use micro @-@ beats , a lot of whispery vocals , which I think sound amazing when they 're downloaded because of the secrecy of the medium . The only acoustic instruments I would use would be those that sound good after they 've been downloaded , so the harp , the music box , celeste and clavichord . They 're plucky sounds . [ ... ] And the strings [ ... ] ended up being more panoramic textures in the background . It ’ s all about being in a little house , on your own . [ ... ] The strings would be like white mountains outside . 
 In Homogenic , every track was built around a loud beat , but in Vespertine Björk wanted to make a " <unk> of thirty or forty beats interacting " . To do this , she recorded noises around her house to make beats out of them . Once the songs were almost finished , Björk contacted the duo Matmos , who she considered " virtuosos " in the field , and sent them various songs to work with . They added beats made from the noise of crushing ice and shuffling cards , among others . In her documentary Minuscule , Björk explained that this process consisted of " taking something very tiny and magnifying it up to big " , intending to convey the " sensation that you 've been told a secret " , that is also present in micrographs . 
 Her relationship with Barney influenced her lyrics , which were now more intimate , detailed , and revealing as opposed to those of her past works . A particular example is " Cocoon " , which is sexually explicit . The eventual title change of the record reveals its changing nature . Writer and critic Mark Pytlik notes that , " where [ Domestika ] signified a focus of extracting magic from the platitudes of everyday life , [ Vespertine ] [ ... ] suggested a creation of magic through much more powerful forces . In fine style , Björk had set out to write an album about making sandwiches . She 'd ended up with an album about making love " . 
 " Heirloom " was an existing instrumental track titled " <unk> " by electronic musician Console , from his 1998 album Rocket in the Pocket . Björk contacted Console in early 2000 and they met in London ; she then added her vocals on top . " Undo " was written during a two @-@ week session with Knak that January in Reykjavik . Björk recorded her vocals on top of Knak 's minimalist rhythmic backbone , and months later she had added a full choir and string section . " Cocoon " , also produced by Knak , was one of the last songs to be written for the album ; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him . Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track , similar to his own releases . His original treatment of " Cocoon " , made with an Ensoniq ASR @-@ 10 , appeared relatively intact in the final version . Björk also worked with Bogdan Raczynski on the song " Who Is It " , but the track did not follow the direction of the record and was subsequently included on the album Medúlla . 
 In a 2015 interview with The Pitchfork Review , Björk expressed frustration over to the lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums . She said : 
 I did 80 % of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album , because it was all <unk> — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece . Matmos came in the last two weeks and added percussion on top of the songs , but they didn ’ t do any of the main parts , and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album . [ Matmos ’ ] Drew [ Daniel ] is a close friend of mine , and in every single interview he did , he corrected it . And they don ’ t even listen to him . It really is strange . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Björk has stated that she wanted the album to sound like " modern chamber music " , referring to the times where " the most ideal music situation was in the home , where people would play harps for each other " . She argued that with the popularity of festivals like Woodstock , the situation became " the opposite " , and that with the advent of Napster , the Internet , music downloading and DVD , " we 've come full circle and the most ideal musical situation now , [ ... ] is back to the home " . She also considers Vespertine to be the opposite of her previous studio album Homogenic , the former being an introverted , quiet , winter record ; the latter a loud , dramatic , summer record . Writer and critic Mark Pytlik writes , " Her appetite for thumping techno had been , temporarily at least , subsumed by a desire for stark melodies and minimalist production " . Although generally considered an electronica album — a loosely defined umbrella term — , as with other Björk releases , it has been difficult for critics to classify Vespertine within a musical genre . The album — and Björk 's body of work in general — is also considered art pop . The Orlando Weekly wrote that with the album , Björk " [ took ] her modernist art @-@ pop further into the abstract " . Music journalists have noted the experimental nature of the record . According to Joseph Hale of Tiny Mix Tapes , Vespertine 's music " finally made good on its dubious " trip @-@ hop " label , " and described it as a combination of " psychedelic techno , chamber music , and chorale together into modal constructions that swelled and receded like emotions ( or <unk> ) " . The music was also considered psychedelia by The Dallas Morning News and American critic Jim DeRogatis . David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote " Vespertine is the closest any pop @-@ vocal album has come to the luxuriant Zen of the new minimalist techno " . Björk has also described the album as " more electronic folk music , " and Jason Killingsworth of Paste referred to the album as a " folktronica gem " . Vespertine 's music has also been categorised as ambient , glitch pop , and art rock . 
 Stylistically , Vespertine incorporates elements of both art and dance music . For example , the instrumentation of choir , strings , and harp is suggestive of Romantic art music , while the " synthesised keyboard sonorities , filtering effects and complex percussive sounds " are elements characteristic of dance @-@ based pop . According to Nicola Dibben : 
 ... the way in which classical and dance @-@ based elements are made to sit alongside one another as part of the same texture mediates the relationship between the two : the spiritual and the sensual are shown to be compatible , perhaps even suggesting that the sensual is spiritual , and that it can facilitate transcendence and hence grant access to a utopian world . 
 Vespertine is also characterized by " the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology — that is , the pervasive use of loops , static and white noise — despite the obviously digital orientation of twenty @-@ first @-@ century electronics . " Unlike previous albums like Debut and Post , " electronic sounds are the norm , and the acoustic sounds become the interjections . " Björk 's voice is used as a supplement to " the complex electronic textures " . Her vocals often appear to be recorded close to the microphone and with little treatment , and sung in a sometimes " unstable whisper " , conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the intimate lyrics .

 The album opens with " Hidden Place " , which features a soprano section and strings , " over the top of a warm , intimate melody " . Michael Hubbard of musicOMH felt the track was reminiscent of Homogenic 's " Hunter " , but less focused on the beats . NME called it progressive folk , while Drowned in Sound wrote it was electro . Björk sings about " how two people can create a paradise just by uniting " , as she intones : " I 'm so close to tears / And so close to / Simply calling you up / And simply suggesting / We go to that hidden place " . " Cocoon " is " based around an exploratory bassline and beats that sound like fingertips on skin " . Discussing the glitch nature of the track , Björk said , " when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks , where it ’ s faulty , you ’ re entering a mystery zone where you can ’ t control it " . Lyrically revolving around making love , the song alternates between metaphors like " Who would have known / That a boy like him / Would have entered me lightly / Restoring my <unk> " , and explicit lines such as " He slides inside / Half awake , half asleep " and " <unk> / He 's still inside me " . According to Michael Cragg of The Guardian , the song " best represents the album 's sense of heavy @-@ lidded , post @-@ coital hibernation " . Björk sings a breathy , " whispered , near @-@ cracking falsetto " on the track . 
 " It 's Not Up to You " has been described as a " dizzying ballad " and a song that lifts the album upward . Michael Paoletta of Billboard described the track as " melancholy " . Its lyrics are about " love for the unknown devices that culminate in ' perfect days ' " , and " pleas to find beauty in unlikely places " . The " caressing lyrics " of " Undo " assure that : " It 's not meant to be a strife / It 's not meant to be a struggle uphill " . Biographer Mark Pytlik writes , " Undo " is a held hand , a reassuring reminder that anything can happen once you let it . If you are in pain , undo it , Björk suggests , no hint of <unk> in her voice , over climbing strings and a rising choir " . " Pagan Poetry " is a " harp @-@ splashed " song that concerns unrequited love . The track builds slowly , " with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos , " until , at the four @-@ minute mark , " all the music drops away , leaving Björk utterly exposed " as she sings " I love him , I love him / I love him , I love him / I love him , I love him " . The song also features " a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian @-@ teahouse touch . " The instrumental interlude " <unk> " has been described as a " metallic tundra " . Its sound stems from a music box , creating an intimate , fairy tale @-@ like effect . 
 " <unk> " fades into " Aurora " , while " a warm , faintly crunchy sound " is heard . Those are samples of footprints in the snow — the work of Matmos — , re @-@ appropriated as the song 's " subtly shifting beat " . " Aurora " has been described as " something that appeals to a child @-@ like imagination " , and having a " magical and airy quality " . In the lyrics , she addresses a Nature goddess , and sings about " literally dissolving with pleasure " as she " prays to become one with the pure color of the northern lights " . One of Björk 's <unk> compositions , " An Echo , a Stain " is underpinned by a creeping choir line and nibbling clicks , and features an " unresolved , ominous tension " that is atypical of her writing style . Most of the song 's lyrics speak directly to incidents in Sarah Kane 's 1998 dark @-@ themed play Crave , so much so that it was titled " Crave " up to the last minute . " Sun in My Mouth " is an adaptation of E.E. Cummings ' poem " I will wade out / Till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers " , with an emphasis on the vocal and accompaniment provided by a string orchestra , a harp , and soft electronica . The track 's lyrics have been considered a " startling allusion to masturbation " , positioned " within the fantasy @-@ like imagery of burning flowers , sea @-@ girls , darkness and the sun " . This track , and the album in general , have a " resounding message of sexual liberation " that reinforces Björk 's " resistance to the socially constructed categories of gender , " which has generated analysis associating it with Donna <unk> 's 1983 essay , A Cyborg Manifesto . 
 " Heirloom " alters " between what sounds like a samba preset on a vintage Wurlitzer organ and skittering breakbeats , and is decorated with inverted <unk> and analog keyboards " . The song 's lyrics tell a " fuzzy story " about a recurring dream , while " [ likening ] the art of singing to swallowing and exhaling ' glowing lights ' " as Björk sings : " During the night / They do a trapeze work / Until they 're in the sky / Right above my bed " . Film director Harmony Korine wrote " Harm of Will " ' s lyrics . The Slate album review noted the minimalist nature of the track , pointing out a lack of hook , beat and melody . It is a slow song , as is the closing track , " Unison " . The latter " [ contains ] a refrain directly inspired by [ Björk 's ] experience in Dancer in the Dark and a healthy dollop of self @-@ effacing humor evoked to counter the balance " . It " brings beats and strings together in a final crescendo that also manages to incorporate a little jungle " .

 Once the album was finished , Björk wrote a manifesto describing a very introverted fictional character , " the character who did Vespertine " , and sent it to M / M Paris , Nick Knight and Eiko Ishioka . They directed the music videos for " Hidden Place " , " Pagan Poetry " , and " Cocoon " respectively . It was the threesome 's directorial debut . She said : 
 Vespertine is an album made by a character who 's very introvert . ( sic ) And it 's about the universe inside every person . This time around , I wanted to make sure that the scenery of the songs is not like a mountain or a city or outside , it 's inside , so it 's very internal . So I guess all three videos are very internal . [ ... ] Sort of how you communicate with the world in a very intimate , personal way . 
 The music video for " Hidden Place " was directed by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co @-@ directed by M / M ( Paris ) . It was shot in London over four days in February 2001 . It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs , but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine . The video consists of close @-@ up shots panning around Björk 's face , as fluids flow in and out of her facial orifices . M / M ( Paris ) explained the concept behind the video : 
 We always wanted to get as close to her as we could , as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the " real " and beautiful woman she is . This is somehow taboo , to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch . Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain . The loop idea was a main point for us as well , trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super @-@ fast editing , to make it hypnotising , mesmerising and irritating , like an eternally burning fireplace . 
 Nick Knight , who had previously shot the cover art for Homogenic , directed the music video for " Pagan Poetry " . It is about a woman preparing herself for marriage and for her lover , as she sews a wedding dress onto her skin . As she had asked him to make a video about her love life , Knight gave Björk a camcorder and asked her to shoot her own private scenes . Shots of skin being pierced were also recorded with this camera ; the people being pierced were five women who " were into subculture and piercings " and Björk herself , who only pierced her ear . This first two @-@ thirds of the video contains a great deal of post @-@ production by Peter Marin , who gave the image its abstract watercolor @-@ like effect . The shots of Björk with her Alexander McQueen topless wedding dress were filmed in super 35 format . The main idea behind the music video was : " to do something with the moving image that was a mirror of what was happening musically " . Although the music video has been well received by critics , it was highly controversial and banned from MTV in 2001 . 
 The music video for " Cocoon " was directed by Eiko Ishioka and was shot in April 2001 in New York City . One of Björk 's most avant @-@ garde music videos , it : " plays with minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows , treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body " . Red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose , finally enveloping her in a cocoon . Björk actually wore a very close @-@ fitting body suit . Although not as controversial as the " Pagan Poetry " music video , it was polemic and banned from MTV . The three music videos were included in the DVDs Volumen Plus ( 2002 ) and Greatest Hits - Volumen 1993 – 2003 ( 2002 ) .

 The album 's ethereal artwork mirrors its " delicacy and introverted romance " . The cover art , shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin in Los Angeles , California , is a black and white photograph of Björk lying down on the patterned ground next to a swimming pool , covering her eyes from the sun and wearing her Marjan <unk> swan dress that caused a stir at the 73rd Academy Awards . The duo M / M ( Paris ) , known for applying and integrating their work on photographs ( so called <unk> dans l ’ image , or " drawings in the picture " ) , illustrated the cover , featuring a swan and the album 's title with feathers . Björk thought swans embodied Vespertine 's music , describing them as " a white , sort of winter bird " and " very romantic " . Vespertine came with a booklet of M / M ( Paris ) artwork . 
 Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented positively on it , writing " the spine of the CD is entirely white , while the rest of the sleeve features innovative photography and artwork , preparing the listener before they even hear the album for something very special " . Jason Killingsworth of Paste wrote : " When I see the swan , my eye drifts past its beak to those pillowy white feathers , recalling the <unk> and warmth of a down comforter . Feathers so white they evoke the purity of freshly fallen snow blanketing the ground outside while you sip a coffee by the fire , both hands curled around the mug ’ s warm ceramic finish " . 
 Academic Nicola Dibben has likened Vespertine 's artwork and promotion to representations of the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan , <unk> the erotic overtones of both . She stated : 
 The cover art to Vespertine [ ... ] explores the theme of personal identity through visual means : hence Björk is featured in black and white , shading her eyes , lips slightly parted in an unmistakably erotic pose . For the first time in this context , however , she does not meet the viewer 's gaze directly . Instead , the superimposed image of a swan provides a protective shield between Björk and the viewer . Both this photograph and Björk 's subsequent appearances at promotional events dressed as a swan metonymically evokes not only the mythic figure of Leda , but more particularly the familiar legend in which she exchanges her husband , the Spartan king Tyndareus , for the God Zeus when he approaches her in disguised form . As in other visual representations of this myth , the entwined bodies of Leda and the swan permit a representation of erotic intimacy that would prove unacceptable if realised in a more literal fashion .

Anthony Carew from About.com gave the album the highest rating and said it was " quite possibly the best album of the ' 00s " . He considered the album to be self @-@ aware of " the digital epoch [ that ] had just dawned upon the realm of recorded music " in the early 2000s , noting that it is " not just a product of this brave new non @-@ world , but wholly informed by that .

Katy Widder , writer for PopMatters , believed the album was a masterpiece , stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender , particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book , The Sex Revolts : Gender , Rebellion , and Rock ' n ' Roll : " Women have seized rock ' n ' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes , but we ’ ve yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself . " Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy , describing its sonic palette as " a breath of fresh air . " Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer , musicOMH 's Michael Hubbard wrote that " It sounds like Björk has grown up [ ... ] ; while that would be a pity , it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music . She is a legend in her time . " 
 Billboard 's Michael Paoletta applauded Vespertine for its " positive [ introversion ] " , feeling some of the tracks " have the strength to bring tears ( of joy and pain ) to the eyes . " Q also praised the album , stating that it " quietly proves that cutting @-@ edge production and human contact aren 't mutually exclusive .

A more lukewarm review came from Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Schreiber , who felt that : " while undeniably beautiful , Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk 's preceding albums " . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said " her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end " and " her voice is at times stiff " , although he also wrote " when it all comes together , [ ... ] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals " . Almost Cool wrote : " if there 's one question to be raised with the album , it 's that it 's all simply so lush and nice that on some levels it fails to excite " . Various reviews named Vespertine Björk 's best album to date , including The A.V. Club , Rolling Stone , About.com , and PopMatters .
