 = Hasan al @-@ Kharrat = 
 Abu Muhammad Hasan al @-@ Kharrat ( Arabic : حسن <unk> 1861 – 25 December 1925 ) was one of the principal Syrian rebel commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate . His main area of operations was in Damascus and its Ghouta countryside . He was killed in the struggle and is considered a hero by Syrians . 
 As the qabaday ( local youths boss ) of the al @-@ Shaghour quarter of Damascus , al @-@ Kharrat was connected with Nasib al @-@ Bakri , a nationalist from the quarter 's most influential family . At al @-@ Bakri 's invitation , al @-@ Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 and formed a group of fighters from al @-@ Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity . He led the rebel assault against Damascus , briefly capturing the residence of French High @-@ Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment . 
 After his aborted operation in Damascus , al @-@ Kharrat continued to lead forays against French forces in and around the city . Towards the end of 1925 , relations grew tense between al @-@ Kharrat and other rebel leaders , particularly Sa 'id al- ' As and Ramadan al @-@ Shallash , as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants . Al @-@ Kharrat was killed in a French ambush in the Ghouta , and the revolt dissipated by 1927 , but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Al @-@ Kharrat was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861 , during Ottoman rule in Syria . He served as the night watchman of the city 's al @-@ Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood 's orchards . Damascus was captured by Arab rebels in October 1918 . Afterward , the Arab Club , an Arab nationalist organization , emerged in the city to raise support for the rebels . The club assisted the rebels ' leader , Emir Faisal , who formed a rudimentary government . Al @-@ Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al @-@ Shaghour . In July 1920 , Faisal 's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun . Afterward , the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate . 
 In the early years of French rule , al @-@ Kharrat was al @-@ Shaghour 's qabaday ( pl. qabadayat ) , the traditional leader of a neighborhood 's local toughs . The qabaday was informally charged with redressing grievances and defending a neighborhood 's honor against local criminals or the encroachments of qabadayat from other neighborhoods . He was popularly characterized as an honorable man , noted for his personal strength , and protection of minorities and the poor . The qabaday was considered an " upholder of Arab traditions and customs , the guardian of popular culture " , according to historian Philip S. Khoury . Khoury asserts that al @-@ Kharrat was " probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day " . Qabadayat normally shunned formal education , and historian Michael Provence maintains that al @-@ Kharrat was likely illiterate . Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods . Al @-@ Kharrat was allied with Nasib al @-@ Bakri , a Damascene politician and landowner . The al @-@ Bakri family was the most influential in al @-@ Shaghour , and al @-@ Kharrat served as the family 's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter .

 = = = Recruitment and early confrontations = = = 
 A revolt against French rule was launched in the mid @-@ summer of 1925 by the Druze sheikh ( chieftain ) , Sultan Pasha al @-@ Atrash , in the southern mountains of Jabal al @-@ Druze . As al @-@ Atrash 's men scored decisive victories against the French Army of the Levant , Syrian nationalists were inspired and the revolt spread northward to the countryside of Damascus and beyond . Al @-@ Bakri was the chief liaison between al @-@ Atrash and the emerging rebel movement in Damascus and the Ghouta . The Ghouta is the fertile plain surrounding Damascus , and its orchard groves and extensive waterways provided cover for the rebels and a base from which they could raid Damascus . In August , al @-@ Bakri convinced al @-@ Kharrat to join the uprising . According to Provence , al @-@ Kharrat was " ideal " for the job , possessing " a local following of young men , notoriety outside the quarter , good connections and a reputation for toughness " . The group of fighters he commanded was known as ′ isabat al @-@ Shawaghirah ( the band of al @-@ Shaghour ) . Though named after al @-@ Kharrat 's quarter , the band included twenty qabadayat and their armed retinues from other Damascus neighborhoods and nearby villages . His main areas of operation were in the vicinity of al @-@ Shaghour and the al @-@ Zur forest in the eastern Ghouta . Through his alliance with a Sufi religious leader , al @-@ Kharrat brought an Islamic holy war dimension to the largely secular revolt , something that was not welcomed by some involved . 
 Al @-@ Kharrat commenced guerrilla operations in September , targeting French forces posted in the eastern and southern Ghouta . His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus , during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage . In al @-@ Shaghour , Souk <unk> and <unk> , al @-@ Kharrat and his band burnt down all French @-@ held buildings . In the first week of October , sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al @-@ Kharrat and his fighters . The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al @-@ Malihah 's mukhtar ( village headman ) . In the evening , the rebels attacked the residence , killing one gendarme and capturing the rest ; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed . 
 On 12 October , French troops backed by tanks , artillery and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al @-@ Kharrat 's rebels in the al @-@ Zur forest . Al @-@ Kharrat 's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al @-@ Malihah . Positioned among the trees , the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops . The latter were unable to lure the rebels out and retreated . 
 As the French withdrew toward al @-@ Malihah , they looted the village and set it on fire . French intelligence officials justified the collective punishment of al @-@ Malihah as retaliation for the rebels ' capture and humiliation of the gendarmes during the previous week ; the French claimed a young boy from al @-@ Malihah had notified al @-@ Kharrat 's men of the French presence in the village . Though they were unable to engage al @-@ Kharrat and his forces directly , French troops executed around 100 civilians from Ghouta villages . Their corpses were brought to Damascus , and the bodies of sixteen men described by the French as " brigands " were put on display . 
 = = = Battle of Damascus and operations in Ghouta = = = 
 Spurred by French army actions in the Ghouta , al @-@ Bakri planned to capture the Citadel of Damascus , where French forces were concentrated , and the Azm Palace , where General Maurice Sarrail , the French high commissioner of Syria , would be residing on 17 – 18 October ( Sarrail was typically headquartered in Beirut ) . The high commissioner functioned as the overall administrator of Syria on behalf of France and exercised practically absolute power . The rebel units active in Damascus at the time were al @-@ Kharrat 's ′ isabat and a mixed force of Druze fighters and rebels from the al @-@ Midan quarter and the Ghouta . To compensate for the lack of rebel strength , al @-@ Bakri sent a letter to Sultan al @-@ Atrash requesting reinforcements . Al @-@ Atrash replied that he was currently occupied with operations in the Hauran , but would dispatch his entire force to back the Damascus rebels as soon as affairs there were settled . Before he received al @-@ Atrash 's reply , al @-@ Bakri decided to move ahead with the operation . 
 On 18 October , al @-@ Kharrat led forty rebels into al @-@ Shaghour from the old cemeteries adjacent to the southern gate of Damascus , announcing that the Druze had arrived to relieve the city from French occupation . Crowds of residents enthusiastically welcomed the rebels and many took up arms alongside them . Al @-@ Kharrat 's men captured the quarter 's police station , disarming its garrison . They were joined by Ramadan al @-@ Shallash , a rebel commander from Deir ez @-@ Zor , and twenty of his Bedouin fighters . The joint forces proceeded to the Hamidiyya Market and captured the Azm Palace , but Sarrail was not present , having already left to attend a meeting in the Hauran town of Daraa . The rebels plundered the palace and set it on fire . Provence asserts that capturing the palace without Sarrail " held no tactical importance " but was a highly symbolic achievement for the rebels because of the Azm Palace 's " importance as the historical seat of economic and political power in Damascus , now usurped by the French and totally undefended " . 
 While al @-@ Kharrat captured the Azm Palace , al @-@ Bakri and 200 rebels under his command rode through the city and were joined by civilians in increasing numbers . After sealing the Old City to prevent the entry of enemy reinforcements , al @-@ Kharrat issued an order to kill anyone linked to the French army . About 180 French soldiers were killed . Sarrail ordered the shelling and aerial bombardment of the city . About 1 @,@ 500 people were killed in the bombardment , which lasted two days . General chaos and scattered fighting ensued as whole neighborhoods , mosques and churches were leveled , French forces moved in , and hundreds of leading figures in the Syrian national movement were arrested , including al @-@ Kharrat 's son Fakhri . The latter was captured on 22 October during a botched nighttime raid by the rebels against the French , who by then were in control of Damascus . Al @-@ Kharrat was offered the release of his son in exchange for his own surrender , but refused . 
 The rebels withdrew from Damascus as a meeting was held between French army commander Maurice Gamelin and a delegation of Damascene notables . As a result of the meeting , the French agreed to end their bombardment in return for a payment of 100 @,@ 000 Turkish gold liras by 24 October . The fine was not paid by the French deadline , but the bombardment was not renewed , likely as a result of orders from the French government in Paris . International condemnation of Sarrail 's bombardment of Damascus and growing criticism in France of his mishandling of the revolt led to his dismissal on 30 October . He was replaced by politician Henry de Jouvenel , who arrived in Syria in December . On 22 November , al @-@ Kharrat commanded 700 rebels in a battle with about 500 French soldiers outside of Damascus . Al @-@ Kharrat 's men inflicted " trifling " losses on the French , but experienced heavy casualties themselves , with thirty dead and forty wounded according to Reuters . On 5 December , al @-@ Kharrat was one of the commanders of a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ strong force uniting rebels from disparate backgrounds , which assaulted the French Army barracks in al @-@ Qadam , south of Damascus . The French claimed to have inflicted significant casualties , but rebel activity continued . 
 = = = Tensions with rebel leaders = = = 
 Centralized order and oversight among the revolt 's armed participants was difficult to establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions . A meeting of rebel leaders was held in the Ghouta village of Saqba on 26 November . Sa 'id al- ' As accused al @-@ Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta , while al @-@ Kharrat alleged that al @-@ Shallash extorted the residents of al @-@ Midan and the Ghouta town of Douma . The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities , increase recruitment of the Ghouta 's inhabitants , coordinate military operations under a central command , and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies . The meeting also designated the area between the village of <unk> and north of the Douma @-@ Damascus road as being part of al @-@ Kharrat 's zone of operations . Despite his leading role in the rebels ' military efforts , al @-@ Kharrat was not included in the newly formed rebel leadership council , nor were any of al @-@ Bakri 's allies . Instead , al- ' As served as the rebels ' overall head . 
 Sharp divisions among rebel factions became apparent during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December . According to Syrian journalist Munir al @-@ <unk> , hostility between al @-@ Kharrat and al @-@ Shallash was well @-@ known among the rebels . Because al @-@ Shallash had levied war taxes on the major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta , al @-@ Kharrat 's benefactor al @-@ Bakri viewed him as a threat to the traditional landowning class to which al @-@ Bakri belonged . Al @-@ Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al @-@ Kharrat , who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al @-@ Shallash to Saqba . However , according to al- ' As , the summit was called by al @-@ Shallash , and once the latter arrived in the village , al @-@ Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse , weapons and money . 
 After his detention , al @-@ Shallash was given a brief trial during which al @-@ Kharrat accused him of making " impositions and ransoms and financial collections in the name of the revolt " , while al @-@ Bakri condemned him specifically for extorting the residents of Douma for 1 @,@ 000 giney ( Ottoman pounds ) , and imposing large fines on the inhabitants of Harran al @-@ Awamid , al @-@ Qisa and <unk> for his own personal enrichment . Al @-@ Kharrat and al @-@ Bakri decided al @-@ Shallash 's verdict , and dismissed him from the revolt . While many rebels with officer backgrounds similar to al @-@ Shallash disapproved of the judgement , they did not intervene . In his account of the meeting , al @-@ Rayyis condemned the rebel commanders for complacency in the " ridiculous trial " and accused al @-@ Kharrat of being motivated solely by personal animosity . Al @-@ Shallash was able to escape — or was released by al- ' As — when French planes bombed the meeting . Al @-@ Shallash would later surrender to Jouvenel and collaborate with French authorities .

 Al @-@ Kharrat was killed in an ambush by French troops in the Ghouta on 25 December 1925 .

Al @-@ Kharrat 's men continued to fight the French until the revolt ended in 1927 , although historian Thomas Philipp states that al @-@ Kharrat 's group dissipated after his death . In January 1926 , al @-@ Kharrat 's son Fakhri was sentenced to death and publicly executed , along with two other rebels , in Marjeh Square , Damascus . The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release , but Fakhri had refused . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman Shahbandar , a prominent Syrian nationalist leader , described al @-@ Kharrat as having played " the preeminent role " in the battle against the French in the Ghouta and Damascus . Historian Daniel <unk> wrote that al @-@ Kharrat was the " best @-@ known " of all of the Damascus @-@ based rebel leaders , although other leaders of the rebel movement attributed the publicity and praise of al @-@ Kharrat to the efforts of the Cairo @-@ based Syrian @-@ Palestinian Committee , with which al @-@ Bakri was closely affiliated . Al @-@ Kharrat and his son Fakhri are today considered " martyred heroes " by Syrians for their nationalist efforts and their deaths in the Syrian struggle for independence from France .

 = John Komnenos the Fat = 
 John Komnenos ( Latinized as Comnenus ) , nicknamed " the Fat " ( Greek : Ἰωάννης <unk> ὁ <unk> ) , was a Byzantine noble who attempted to usurp the imperial throne from Alexios III Angelos in a short @-@ lived coup in Constantinople on 31 July 1201 ( or 1200 ) . The coup drew on opposition to the ruling <unk> dynasty among both rival aristocratic families and the common people , who were dissatisfied by the dynasty 's failures against external foes . Hitherto an obscure figure , John became the figurehead of the uprising because of his imperial blood , as he was descended from the illustrious Komnenian dynasty ( 1081 – 1185 ) , but the real driving force behind his coup was probably the ambitious Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos . With the support of the capital 's populace , the plotters managed to seize most of the Great Palace in Constantinople 's southeastern corner , which the mob proceeded to loot , and John Komnenos was crowned in the Hagia Sophia . Alexios III , however , secure in his residence in the northwestern Blachernae Palace , sent forces by sea to land in the part of the Great Palace still held by the loyal Varangian Guard . With most of the urban mob dispersed for the night , the Varangians had little difficulty in suppressing the coup . John Komnenos with many of his followers were captured and executed . 
 = = Origin and political background = = 
 John was the son of the distinguished protostrator Alexios Axouch . The <unk> were a prominent family of Turkish origin , which was closely associated with the Komnenian dynasty and provided a number of distinguished generals . The two families also intermarried : John 's mother Maria was the daughter of Alexios Komnenos , eldest son and co @-@ emperor of Emperor John II Komnenos ( r . 1118 – 1143 ) . John was thus able to claim a pedigree comparable , if not superior , to the reigning Angeloi , albeit from the maternal side . 
 The reign of Alexios III Angelos ( r . 1195 – 1203 ) had been troubled from the outset : the aristocracy conspired against him , his pressing demand for new sources of revenue was blocked by the refusal of Senate , clergy and merchants to contribute , while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their discontent with riots against corrupt officials . The most notable of these was a large @-@ scale uprising in February 1200 against the warden of the praetorium , Constantinople 's chief prison , John Lagos , which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops . 
 John Komnenos himself was a rather unimportant figure in the court , and in a marginal note dating to the late 13th century , Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos , who briefly became emperor during Constantinople 's final siege by the Fourth Crusade , was named as the real mastermind behind the coup . He was certainly supported by a wider circle of nobles from the Komnenian era , possibly even the brothers Alexios Komnenos and David Komnenos , who later founded the Empire of Trebizond . Thus the historian Michael <unk> traces the coup 's inception to the events of early 1199 , when Alexios III married his two daughters Irene and Anna to Alexios Palaiologos and Theodore Laskaris respectively . This marriage not only spoke of increasing confidence for the Emperor , but also provided for the imperial succession and began the establishment of a separate aristocratic power @-@ base , which must have displeased many noble families . 
 However , the revolt was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the failures of the Angeloi , especially in terms of foreign policy . This much is evident from the – albeit embellished – account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites , whereby John Komnenos 's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania , that her enemies would be vanquished , and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople . 
 = = Coup = = 
 John 's coup was launched on 31 July 1201 , when the conspirators broke into the Hagia Sophia , where they swore to restore the Empire to its ancient bounds against the Vlach @-@ Bulgarians , Seljuk Turks and the Latin Crusaders . While John was being proclaimed emperor and crowned by a monk – since Patriarch John X Kamateros hid himself inside a cupboard – the capital 's populace rioted outside and set fire to a number of churches . Then the conspirators marched towards the Great Palace . Avoiding the Chalke Gate , which was held by the feared Varangian Guard , they made for the imperial box in the Hippodrome , the <unk> , which was connected to the palace precinct . John 's supporters indeed managed to drive off the Macedonian guard placed there and entered the palace through the <unk> Gate . 
 Having gained control of the western portions of the palace , John sat on the imperial throne , which broke under his great weight . He took no further actions to consolidate his position , other than appoint his chief followers to the Empire 's highest posts . At the same time , his supporters , who along with the urban mob included a sizeable group of Georgian and Italian mercenaries , began to loot the buildings . They even reached the Nea Ekklesia and the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos , the Empire 's chief depository of holy relics , which was defended by its <unk> , Nicholas Mesarites , with a small guard provided by John Komnenos . Mesarites and his men managed to drive the looters back , until he was wounded in the skirmish and withdrew to the Pharos Church . 
 With the coming of night , most of the crowd that had accompanied the storming of the palace earlier that day departed , intending to resume looting the next day . In the meantime , Alexios III , who resided in the Blachernae Palace in the city 's northwestern corner , rallied for a counter @-@ strike . A small force was dispatched with boats around the city 's peninsula to the Hodegetria Monastery north of the Great Palace . It was led by the emperor 's son @-@ in @-@ law Alexios Palaiologos , who at that point was likely regarded as his heir @-@ apparent , and quickly made contact with the Varangians who had held out in the palace 's northern parts . 
 The loyalist force marched to the Hippodrome , where they drove away most of John 's supporters . They then entered the palace , where they found scarce opposition from John 's attendants . John himself was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut off , to be displayed the next morning at the Forum of Constantine , while his body was displayed at Blachernae . A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night , while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators . Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair ( he is known to have been in prison in 1203 ) , and the two Komnenos brothers , Alexios and David , seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup 's failure . 
 = = Family = = 
 Some modern genealogical researchers consider John a possible father to Theodora <unk> , wife of Emperor Alexios I Megas Komnenos of Trebizond ( r . 1204 – 1222 ) , but that is conjectural : the family name <unk> is ascribed to her because her eldest son , the <unk> emperor John I Megas Komnenos <unk> ( r . 1235 – 1238 ) , bore it as well . 
 = Battle of Orašje = 
 The Battle of Orašje was fought during the Bosnian War , from 5 May to 10 June 1995 , between the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska ( Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS ) and the Bosnian Croat Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) for control of the town of Orašje and its surrounding area on the south bank of the Sava River . The offensive codenamed Operation Flame @-@ 95 ( Serbian : Operacija Plamen @-@ 95 ) and referred to by Croatian sources as Operation Revenge ( Croatian : Operacija <unk> ) was actually fought with varying intensity , with periods of combat interspersed by lulls lasting two to seven days . The heaviest fighting was reported on 15 May , when the VRS managed to break through a portion of the HVO defences near the village of Vidovice , but the breach was successfully contained and the lost ground was recovered by the HVO . 
 The HVO , supported by Croatian Army artillery deployed north of the river , managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle . This demonstrated the changed balance of power at this stage of the war . At the commencement of the war , the VRS had greater military capabilities than its opponents , particularly in terms of heavy weapons and organisation , but over three years from mid @-@ 1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA ) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan , its 55 @,@ 000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army , which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska ( Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS ) . This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992 , ahead of the referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina that took place between 29 February and 1 March 1992 . This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War . Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital , Sarajevo , and other areas on 1 March 1992 . On the following day , the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj . In the final days of March , Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery , resulting in a cross @-@ border operation by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) 108th Brigade . On 4 April 1992 , JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo . There were other examples of the JNA directly supported the VRS , such as during the capture of Zvornik in early April 1992 , when the JNA provided artillery support from Serbia , firing across the Drina River . At the same time , the JNA attempted to defuse the situation and arrange negotiations elsewhere in the country . 
 The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) , reporting to the Bosniak @-@ dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively , as well as the HV , which occasionally supported HVO operations . In late April 1992 , the VRS was able to deploy 200 @,@ 000 troops , hundreds of tanks , armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and artillery pieces . The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces ( Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS ) could field approximately 25 @,@ 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons , while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100 @,@ 000 troops , small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons . Arming of the various forces was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo introduced in September 1991 . By mid @-@ May 1992 , when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina . The extent of the control was extended to about 70 percent of the country by the end of the year . 
 A significant portion of the territory controlled by the VRS was located in western Bosnia , including the Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka . This portion of Bosnian Serb @-@ held territory was dependent on resupply from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia using a single road spanning the Bosnian Sava Basin from west to east through Derventa and Brčko . The same road was also used to resupply the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) , the Croatian Serb @-@ controlled areas of Croatia . After the capture of Derventa by the HVO and the HV in May 1992 , the VRS launched Operation Corridor 92 and regained control of the resupply route in late June . By October , it had eliminated all HV or HVO @-@ held pockets along the southern bank of the Sava and the border of Croatia , except a single bridgehead around the town of Orašje . Even though the fighting secured the route for the VRS , the corridor remained mere 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 miles ) wide at its narrowest point .

 The balance of military power in the Bosnian War had started to shift against the VRS in early 1994 , despite its advantages in heavy weapons . In early 1995 , the ARBiH exerted increasing pressure on the VRS , especially in the area of Mount Vlašić . While the HV and the HVO advanced west of Livno ( Operation Leap 1 ) , the VRS launched its own offensive — Operation Joint Action 95 ( Serbian : Operacija <unk> 95 ) . Operation Joint Action 95 was intended as a war @-@ winning offensive , and was launched south of the Derventa – Brčko corridor , but was also designed to widen the critical resupply route . Launched on 19 April , the VRS offensive faced determined resistance from the ARBiH and the HVO and had bogged down by the end of the month . 
 In early May , the HV launched a successful offensive , codenamed Operation Flash , against a RSK @-@ held part of western Slavonia in Croatia . The move caused the VRS to reorient its attention to the Orašje pocket , the only territory outside its control between the Derventa – Brčko road and the Sava River . The shift of VRS focus to Orašje may have been the result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia , or meant as a quick land @-@ grab before a peace settlement was accepted . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 The VRS earmarked Tactical Group 5 ( TG @-@ 5 ) for the offensive , normally deployed against HVO positions in the Orašje pocket . TG @-@ 5 , commanded by Colonel Dragoslav <unk> , normally consisted of approximately 6 @,@ 000 troops drawn from four infantry or light brigades , but for the offensive it received further 2 @,@ 000 reinforcements . Those included elite assault units assigned to the 1st Krajina Corps , elements of the 1st Armoured Brigade and corps @-@ level artillery . Furthermore , Colonel Generals Momir Talić and Ratko Mladić were present to directly supervise the operation . 
 The Orašje pocket was defended by the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ strong HVO Orašje Corps , consisting of one guards brigade and three Home Guard regiments . Overall command of the corps was held by Staff Brigadier Đuro <unk> . The defences lacked depth , and did not exceed 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) . To offset this , the HVO had prepared strong forward defences , including trenches and bunkers , built along the 18 km ( 11 mi ) front line . The HVO positions were supported by HV artillery and multiple rocket launchers deployed north of the Sava River , in Croatia . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 On 5 May , the 1st Krajina Corps launched its offensive aimed at capturing the Orašje pocket , codenamed Operation Flame @-@ 95 ( Serbian : Operacija Plamen @-@ 95 ) . It is also referred to by Croatian sources as Operation Revenge ( Croatian : Operacija <unk> ) . The offensive started off with a substantial artillery bombardment and ground assault , directed at <unk> Luka , at the centre of the front line . According to Croatian sources , the 5 May attack was not coordinated very well and it gave the HVO the chance to bolster its defences . While the fighting was in progress , the VRS artillery bombarded the town of Orašje itself . The attack was quickly defeated , and after this initial setback , the VRS paused for five days . 
 The offensive resumed on 10 May , when a number of VRS 9K52 Luna @-@ M short @-@ range artillery rockets , commonly known by their NATO designation of " FROG – 7 " , were fired at HVO positions . The opposing forces blamed each other for the resumption of fighting — the VRS accused the HVO of bombarding the Derventa – Brčko road to interdict traffic , while the HVO accused the VRS of bombarding the town of Orašje first . During the morning of 10 May , UN observers counted more than 1 @,@ 000 explosions in the area and described the fighting as " intense " , but said that it had lost some momentum by the afternoon . The primary axes of the attacks , directed at the centre and the east of the pocket and aiming towards Orašje and the village of Vidovice failed to gain ground . The secondary effort on the left flank made some progress towards <unk> before being beaten back by the HVO . During the fighting , rumours circulated that the Orašje area would be surrendered in exchange for territory lost to the HV in western Slavonia . 
 The VRS attacked at least seven more times over the next thirty days , with pauses of two to seven days between each attack . Some lasted for several days , and during each attack UN observers counted from 2 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 explosions . The most successful attack occurred on 14 – 15 May , when the VRS nearly reached Vidovice on the southern bank of the Sava River . On that occasion , a combined armour and infantry assault broke through three lines of trenches , with the assistance of strong artillery support including the bombardment of HVO positions with approximately 5 @,@ 000 shells and two 9K52 Luna @-@ M rockets . In the fierce combat to gain control of Vidovice , the VRS was pushed back by the 4th Guards Brigade and the 106th Home Guard Regiment to its start positions . According to Bosnian Serb sources , the HV fired six rockets from its positions in the Posavski <unk> and <unk> Selo areas against targets in Brčko , causing substantial damage but no casualties . Even though the fighting continued , including skirmishes between the VRS and the ARBiH in the area south of Orašje , its overall intensity had declined by 15 May . On 4 – 10 June , the HV and the HVO launched Operation Leap 2 against VRS @-@ held positions west of Livno . Even though the operation was not directly linked to the Battle of Orašje , its planners thought that it might force the VRS to redeploy a portion of its forces in the Orašje area to shore up its positions near the Livanjsko field . By 10 June , the VRS had called off Operation Flame @-@ 95 and the Battle of Orašje effectively ended . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The VRS failure in the battle demonstrated its declining capabilities relative to its adversaries over the preceding three years . The failure was despite the offensive being conducted competently , and applying VRS military doctrine calling for the use of armoured and assault infantry supported by artillery . By 1995 , the VRS was facing well @-@ organised militaries employing a comparable number of artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications . In consequence , the VRS was no longer capable of defeating its opposition by relying heavily on artillery superiority , and it was unwilling to commit its dwindling numbers of infantry to a decisive but risky attack . The battle resulted in no territorial changes , but both belligerents reported dozens of casualties , both military and civilian . Even though the battle was over , intermittent artillery exchanges continued in the area , and as early as 19 June , the VRS bombarded Orašje again . 
 = Cley Marshes = 
 Cley Marshes is a 176 @-@ hectare ( 430 @-@ acre ) nature reserve on the North Sea coast of England just outside the village of Cley next the Sea , Norfolk . A reserve since 1926 , it is the oldest of the reserves belonging to the Norfolk Wildlife Trust ( NWT ) , which is itself the oldest county Wildlife Trust in the United Kingdom . Cley Marshes protects an area of reed beds , freshwater marsh , pools and wet meadows and has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , Special Area of Conservation ( SAC ) , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) , and Ramsar Site due to the large numbers of birds it attracts . 
 The reserve is important for some scarce breeding species , such as pied avocets on the islands , and western marsh harriers , Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds , and is also a major migration <unk> and wintering site . There are also several nationally or locally scarce invertebrates and plants specialised for this coastal habitat . It has five bird hides and an environmentally friendly visitor centre and further expansion is planned through the acquisition of neighbouring land and improvements to visitor facilities . 
 The site has a long history of human occupation , from prehistoric farming to its use as a prisoner of war camp in the Second World War . The reserve attracts large numbers of visitors , contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village . Despite centuries of embankment to reclaim land and protect the village , the marshes have been flooded many times , and the southward march of the coastal shingle bank and encroachment by the sea make it inevitable that the reserve will eventually be lost . New wetlands are being created further inland to compensate for the loss of coastal habitats . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistory to 1926 = = = 
 Norfolk has a long history of human occupation . Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last glaciation between 100 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago , and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards . The archaeological record is poor until about 20 @,@ 000 years ago , partly because of the prevailing conditions , but also because the coastline was much further north than at present . As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic , the sea level rose , filling what is now the North Sea . This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line , so that many ancient sites are now under the sea . The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric <unk> flint blades possibly from 400 @,@ 000 years ago , but few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here . 
 Fragments of a Roman vase and jug have been found on the beach . A 1797 map showed what was described as the ruins of " Cley Chapel " , although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn . A 1588 map showed " Black Joy Forte " , which may have been intended as a defence against the Spanish Armada . There are a number of post @-@ medieval earthworks , presumably sea defences , and pits which may have been associated with salt @-@ making . 
 Until the mid @-@ 1600s , much of the area now known as Cley Marshes was part of a vast tidal marsh and was covered by seawater twice a day . The shoreline itself was hundreds of metres north of its present location . The raised area in the north @-@ west corner , called the " Eye " , has been farmed since the earliest human habitation . It was 28 ha ( 70 acres ) in extent in 1651 , but is now much reduced by coastal erosion . Access to the Eye was by an ancient causeway , passable at low tide . John Heydon started the process of embanking the marshes to reclaim the land in 1522 , and his banks were extended and improved by Dutchman Jan van <unk> from 1630 . Simon <unk> , Lord of the local Manor of Cley , completed the scheme by building the bank on the east side of the Cley channel . Only the east and west banks have survived ; the north bank was breached by the sea in 1897 , then rebuilt with a concrete facing , but abandoned after another bad storm in 1921 . 
 Cley and nearby Blakeney had been prosperous and important ports in the Middle Ages , but land reclamation schemes , especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 just to the west of Cley , led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf . Further enclosure in the mid @-@ 1820s aggravated the problem , and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley . In an attempt to halt the decline , Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822 , but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented , and by 1840 almost all of Cley 's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports . The population stagnated , and the value of all property decreased sharply . In the mid @-@ nineteenth century , the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes . 
 In the decades preceding World War I , this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling ; locals were looking for food , but some " Gentleman Gunners " hunted to collect rare birds . One of the best known of the latter was E. C. Arnold , who collected for more than fifty years , and gave his name to the marsh at the north @-@ east corner of the present reserve . 
 = = = Nature reserve era = = = 
 Cley Marshes reserve was created in 1926 when Norfolk birdwatcher Dr Sydney Long bought the land which now makes up the reserve for the sum of £ 5 @,@ 100 , to be held " in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary " . Long then established the Norfolk Wildlife Trust . 
 The reserve was extended in 1962 through the lease of the adjacent 11 @-@ hectare ( 27 @-@ acre ) Arnold 's Marsh from the National Trust ; this had long been the primary feeding area for waders , but much of the best habitat had been lost to the advancing shingle ridge . New pools and hides were created on the reserve from 1964 , and the sale of permits for access to the hides became a useful source of income for the NWT . Further pools and hides were established during the 1970s , and a visitor centre was built in 1981 on the site of the current building . 
 Over the long history of the reserve , it has had only three wardens , all from the same family . Robert Bishop was warden from 1926 to 1937 , and was followed by his grandson , Billy , from 1937 to 1978 . Billy 's son , Bernard , who was appointed in 1978 , is still managing the reserve . 
 The reserve now covers 176 hectares ( 430 acres ) , and is of international importance for its breeding and wintering birds . It was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) in 1954 , and in 1986 it was subsumed into the 7 @,@ 700 @-@ hectare ( 19 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ) North Norfolk Coast SSSI . The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000 , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) and Ramsar listings , and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . The reserve has been referred to as " a Mecca for birdwatchers " . 
 = = = Second World War coastal fortifications = = = 
 During the Second World War , Royal Artillery military fortifications were established at the beach end of the reserve , including two 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 24 cm ) guns , five buildings , two pillboxes , a minefield , and concrete anti @-@ tank blocks . A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited closer to the village . One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012 . 
 The military camp held 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war . Italian , but not German , prisoners were allowed to attend dances at the anti @-@ aircraft camp at nearby Stiffkey . Near the end of the war , the camp was used to house East European refugees , and it was finally pulled down in 1948 . Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955 , but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post . It was acquired by the NWT in 1983 , and the upper part was used as a look @-@ out , while the larger lower section became a beach café . The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008 and subsequently demolished . 
 = = Access and facilities = = 
 The reserve is to the north of the A149 coast road just east of the village of Cley next the Sea , 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) north of Holt . The visitor centre and car park are to the south of the road , opposite the reserve . The reserve can be reached by public transport using the bus service that stops outside the visitor centre . 
 The reserve is viewable from the visitor centre , footpaths next to the A149 and down the East Bank , the beach and the road running from the beach back to the main road . It can be accessed by footpaths at three points , each leading to one or more bird hides . Beach Road and the beach itself form part of the Peddars Way long distance footpath . 
 The present visitor centre , which opened in June 2007 , is on a small hill overlooking the reserve . It contains a café and shop , and is open daily . The reserve and hides are open at all times , with free access to NWT members , although non @-@ members must buy a permit . 
 The visitor centre is built on environmentally friendly principles . Its roof is covered with living <unk> plants , rainwater is collected for re @-@ use , and the building 's energy profile is reduced using solar water heating , wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps . It has won a number of awards including the Emirates Glass LEAF architectural award for the sustainability category . The success of the centre has led to plans to develop it further , offering more services and educational facilities and enhancing its profitability for the Trust . The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to wheelchair users . 
 In 2012 the NWT launched a public appeal to raise £ 1 million to purchase 58 hectares ( 143 acres ) of private land immediately to the east of the existing reserve , and adjoining the existing 66 ha ( 163 acre ) Trust reserve at Salthouse Marshes . This purchase would create a unified 8 km ( 5 mi ) stretch of NWT @-@ owned coastal land and expand the Cley reserve by one @-@ third . 
 = = Fauna and flora = = 
 = = = Birds = = = 
 The key breeding species are reed bed specialists such as the marsh harrier , Eurasian bittern and bearded <unk> , and the island @-@ nesting avocet . Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing , common redshank and sedge , reed and Cetti 's warblers . Eurasian spoonbills , ruffs and black @-@ tailed godwits are present for much of the year , and a pair of little egrets bred for the first time in 2010 – 2012 . 
 Spring migrants including little gull , black tern , Temminck 's stint and garganey may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere , and terns frequently visit from the colonies on Blakeney Point . In the autumn , birds arrive from the north . Some , such as <unk> , curlew sandpipers and little stints , just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south , others staying for the winter . Offshore , great and Arctic skuas , northern gannets and black @-@ legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds . Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve , including many Eurasian wigeons , Eurasian teals , mallards and gadwalls , goldeneyes and northern pintails . Red @-@ throated divers are usually on the sea , and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae . Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter , and snow bunting flocks can be found on the beach . 
 The reserve 's location means that migrants may be found , sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions are right . These may include vagrant rarities , including a western sandpiper in 2012 , a displaying great snipe in 2011 , a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009 . In order to maintain a good habitat , parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages . 
 = = = Other animals = = = 
 Water voles are a highly threatened species in the UK , with a huge decline in numbers of 70 – 90 % , mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink , but also habitat loss and water pollution . They are still common at Cley , which is one of a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species . Brown hares are widespread , and European otters may be seen , with <unk> regularly found at the southern end of East Bank . The common frog , common toad and common lizard all occur on the reserve . 
 Arnold 's Marsh and the other lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the percolation of seawater through the shingle bank . These saline lagoons may cover mud , firm sand or submerged vegetation , and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone , lagoon sand shrimp , Atlantic ditch shrimp , the mysid shrimps <unk> <unk> and <unk> integer , lagoon cockle , the bug <unk> rubidus and spire snail . Little whirlpool <unk> snail has been found in a freshwater channel . Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the <unk> species , and even here it is localised and hard to find . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 The shingle ridge that protects the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop , sea campion , yellow horned poppy , sea thrift , bird 's foot trefoil and sea beet . Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat . In the damper areas , sea wormwood , sea lavender and scrubby sea @-@ blite also thrive . The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions , with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established : first sea aster , then mainly sea lavender , with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants . The uncommon spiral <unk> and long @-@ <unk> sedge are other saltmarsh specialists . The upper saltmarsh has a number of scarce species including lesser centaury , curved hard @-@ grass and sea pearlwort , with soft <unk> in the dykes . 
 The drier areas of the reserve contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass . The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush , brackish water crowfoot , sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats . The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have <unk> rush , common <unk> and less common grasses such as annual beard grass , marsh foxtail and slender hare 's @-@ ear . The site is generally rich in plants , especially those that can cope with saline environments , but three species appear to have been lost : divided sedge was last recorded in 1999 , grey hair @-@ grass in 1982 and lax @-@ flowered sea lavender in 1977 . Lichens are not suited to the prevailing habitat , but the nationally rare soot lichen occurs on untreated wood . The locally rare bryophyte Heim 's <unk> occurs in the saltmarsh , and the coastal variety piliferum of cuspidate earth @-@ moss is found at Salthouse .

 A 2005 survey at Cley and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit . The 7 @.@ 7 million day visitors and 5 @.@ 5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £ 122 million , and created the equivalent of 2 @,@ 325 full @-@ time jobs . Cley Marshes , like Titchwell Marsh RSPB and Holkham NNR , attracts 100 @,@ 000 or more visitors annually . 
 Of the six sites , Cley and Titchwell have the highest proportion of pre @-@ planned visits , and Cley , together with neighbouring Blakeney , had the highest per capita spend per visitor . The equivalent of 52 full @-@ time jobs in the Cley area are estimated to result from the £ 2 @.@ 45 million spent by the visiting public . 
 The large number of tourists can have negative effects ; wildlife may be disturbed , particularly species that breed in exposed areas , such as ringed plovers , and plants can be trampled , which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle . Damage can be reduced by measures such as <unk> the breeding colonies and using fences , boardwalks and signs to control access . The access paths to the hides , other than the northernmost , are largely <unk> , and an extensive programme of fence replacement and improvements to the control of water levels on the reserve took place in 2010 – 2011 . 
 = = Threats = = 
 The reserve shelters behind a ridge of shingle that runs west from Weybourne along the Norfolk coast , before becoming a spit extending into the sea at Blakeney Point . Saltmarshes can develop behind the shingle , but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action . The amount of shingle moved by a single storm can be " spectacular " ; the spit has sometimes been breached , becoming an island for a time , and this may happen again . The northernmost part of nearby Blakeney was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages , probably due to a storm . 
 The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m per year , and for the last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified . Blakeney Chapel , just west of the reserve , was 400 m ( 440 yd ) from the sea in 1817 , but this had reduced to 195 m ( 215 yd ) by the end of the twentieth century . The landward movement of the shingle also means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often , leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village . The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas , and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £ 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 The sea defences at Cley were badly breached in 1742 , 1897 , 1953 and 1996 , with smaller incursions in 1993 and 1998 . The massive 1953 flood reached 8 km ( 4 mi ) inland at Cley . A 2 m ( 6 ft ) storm surge in December 2013 flooded much of the English east coast , and breached the shingle ridge at Cley , flooding the reserve and damaging or destroying the hides . Restoration of the reserve was assisted by Natural England , and the removal of salt was helped by natural freshwater springs . As of 2015 , the reserve was fully restored and functioning . 
 Although the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve currently outweigh the costs of maintaining the sea defences , managed retreat is likely to be the long @-@ term solution to rising sea levels at Cley and along much of the rest of the North Norfolk coast , and has already been implemented at other major sites including Titchwell Marsh . The important reedbeds at Cley will inevitably be lost due to increased saltwater flow into the marshes . To compensate , the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near Hilgay . The 60 @-@ hectare ( 150 @-@ acre ) Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks , ditches and a lake to manage water levels . The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long @-@ term plan to create a roughly 10 @,@ 000 @-@ hectare ( 25 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ) <unk> Living Landscape .

 Neifi <unk> Pérez ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; born June 2 , 1973 in Villa Mella , Dominican Republic ) is a former Major League baseball player . He stands 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall and weighs 175 pounds ( 79 kg ) . He was a switch hitter who threw right @-@ handed . During his career , he played with the Colorado Rockies , Kansas City Royals , San Francisco Giants , Chicago Cubs , and Detroit Tigers . 
 Pérez was originally signed by the Colorado Rockies in 1992 . Frequently praised for his defensive skills , Pérez reached the major leagues in 1996 and become the Rockies ' shortstop for good in 1997 . Over the next three years , he scarcely missed a game and won a Gold Glove in 2000 . During 2001 , he was traded to the Kansas City Royals , where he also played in 2002 . The trade proved to be unpopular with both teams , and Pérez joined the San Francisco Giants for 2003 and 2004 . He lost his starting job during the 2004 season and was released during that year . Pérez then signed with the Chicago Cubs , whom he finished the season with and spent most of the next two years with . He was the Cubs ' starting shortstop in 2005 but was used as a reserve player in 2006 before getting traded to the Detroit Tigers during the year . He finished his career in 2007 with the Tigers . As a Tiger , he turned a double play which saved Justin Verlander 's no @-@ hitter , but he also had a series of positive tests for amphetamines which effectively ended his career .

 As a child , Pérez played for Liga Mercedes in the Dominican Republic . The Colorado Rockies signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1992 at the age of 18 . Assigned to the single @-@ A Bend Rockies for the 1993 season , Pérez posted a .260 batting average and stole 19 bases . The Rockies , confident in Pérez 's potential , promoted him to the single @-@ A Central Valley Rockies . Pérez exhibited strong defensive skills , executing the first unassisted triple play in the history of the California League in a game against the Bakersfield Blaze . Pérez batted just .239 on the year but made the California League All @-@ Star game and was considered to be one of the Rockies ' top prospects on the basis of his defense . Rockies player development chief Dick <unk> expressed confidence that Pérez 's hitting would improve : " He 's got all the skills ... He 's just in a rush right now , like most young guys . " 
 Pérez moved up to the double @-@ AA New Haven Ravens where he batted .253 and improved his fielding percentage to .967 and was considered the Rockies ' top prospect at shortstop . The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple @-@ A Colorado Springs Sky Sox at the end of the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year . In fact , although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training , he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August , making his major league debut on August 31 . In his season with the Sky Sox , his batting average had improved to .316 . Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor : " He is the guy who had the year that traditionally earns a call up . I want to see what he can do . " Pérez hit .156 over 17 games and returned to the Sky Sox for the beginning of the 1997 season . 
 Although invited to 1997 spring training Pérez did not make the 25 @-@ man roster and once again returned to the Sky Sox for the first half of the season , where he batted .363 with a .975 fielding percentage . In mid @-@ June the Rockies summoned him in place of Jason Bates , this time for good . Pérez batted .291 on the year and gradually replaced Walt Weiss as the starting shortstop . Pérez remained Colorado 's primary shortstop for the next three seasons ( 1998 – 2000 ) , appearing in all but five games . His batting average hovered around .280 ( .274 , .280 , .287 ) and he averaged thirty doubles a year . His fielding percentage never dropped below .975 and he won a Gold Glove for the 2000 season . Despite his later reputation for anemic hitting , Pérez managed several offensive feats with the Rockies . On July 25 , 1998 , he hit for the cycle against the St. Louis Cardinals . In 1999 he tied Bobby Abreu and José Offerman for the most triples in Major League Baseball with 11 . Pérez got off to a strong start in 2001 but there was doubt over his future with Colorado . The Rockies had offered him a 4 @-@ year , $ 17 million contract which he had rejected ; accepting a 1 @-@ year $ 3 @.@ 55 million deal via arbitration . In the end the Rockies dealt Pérez to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three @-@ way deal in which the Royals sent Jermaine Dye to the Oakland Athletics who then sent Mario Encarnación , José Ortiz and Todd <unk> to Colorado . Denver Post sportswriter Woody Paige criticized the move , calling Pérez " the best shortstop in the National League " who was " an extraordinary defensive player , a capable offensive player and a classy team player . "

 Pérez arrived in Kansas City amid widespread anger over the departure of fan @-@ favorite Dye . Facing off against Dye in one of his first games as a Royal , Pérez took the low @-@ key approach : " I 'm just going to play my game . " Pérez finished out the 2001 season in Kansas City , batting .241 over 49 games . Pérez started at shortstop for the 2002 season but his batting average sank to .236 , leading sportswriters to question whether the rarefied air at Coors Field had inflated Pérez 's numbers . Pérez also may have sealed his fate by refusing to enter a late @-@ season game at the request of manager Tony Peña . At the end of the year the Royals were looking to move Pérez and his $ 4 @.@ 1 million salary ; he was eventually claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants and signed a two @-@ year , $ 4 @.@ 25 million contract . 
 = = = San Francisco Giants = = = 
 At the Giants Pérez hoped for a fresh start ; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about problems in the clubhouse , and it was no secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City . Commented Pérez : " I feel happy here . I like the National League . I was happy in Colorado and I am happy here . " Pérez hit .256 over the course of the 2003 season ; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days . Pérez returned for the 2004 season , but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable . Although signed as a starter at second base , he quickly became backup to José Cruz , Jr . , while he lost out at shortstop to <unk> Cruz . His batting average slumped to .232 . He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou , but in the end he was the " odd man out " and the Giants released him on August 14 , 2004 . Almost immediately the Chicago Cubs signed Pérez to a minor @-@ league contract . 
 = = = Chicago Cubs = = = 
 The Cubs assigned Pérez to the triple @-@ A Iowa Cubs , but he played only ten games before being called up to the expanded roster on September 1 . Pérez became a much needed spark plug in the lineup , going 6 for 6 in his first 6 at @-@ bats as a Cub and providing a needed backup to the ailing Nomar Garciaparra . In 23 games with the Cubs he hit .371 . The Cubs re @-@ signed Pérez to a one @-@ year contract worth $ 1 million , with up to an additional $ 1 @.@ 5 million in bonuses . 
 Manager Dusty Baker made Pérez the everyday shortstop in 2005 to replace Garciaparra , mainly on the strength of his defensive skills . His impatience at the plate led to a walk percentage of 3 @.@ 1 % , the worst in the National League . Pérez finished the season batting .274 , and his play at short won rave reviews from Baker : " It 's hard to play better shortstop defensively than Neifi has . " In the off @-@ season the Cubs signed Pérez to a two @-@ year , $ 5 million contract . 
 For the 2006 season Pérez lost the starting job at shortstop to Ronny Cedeño , and found himself playing a mixture of second base and short behind Cedeno and Todd Walker . Meanwhile , Pérez 's batting average sagged to .254 , while his on @-@ base percentage , never high , had fallen to .266 . In late August the Cubs traded him to the Detroit Tigers for minor @-@ league catcher Chris Robinson . The Tigers were seeking a replacement for their injured second baseman , Plácido Polanco , who had separated his shoulder . 
 = = = Detroit Tigers = = = 
 Pérez arrived in Detroit during the pennant chase which ended with their loss in the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals . Pérez faced almost immediate criticism from fans after getting off to a <unk> start , and manager Jim Leyland felt obliged to come to his defense : " These guys making a big deal about Neifi Pérez and Omar Infante don 't know what they 're talking about . They got no clue . " Pérez made 21 appearances during the regular season , with a batting average of .200 and an OBP of .235 . He appeared in three games during the playoffs but never reached base . 
 The Tigers retained Pérez for the 2007 season , although Leyland acknowledged that Pérez would have to improve his play : " I recommended that we trade for him . I take responsibility . I don 't want people to get the wrong impression . I like Neifi Pérez , but he did not perform well . It 's that simple . " Pérez , however , continued to struggle , posting a .172 batting average over the 33 games he played in a Tigers ' uniform . One bright spot came on June 12 , 2007 , when he saved Justin Verlander 's no @-@ hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning @-@ ending double play . 
 On July 6 , 2007 , Pérez was suspended 25 games by MLB for a second positive test for amphetamines ; on August 3 he was suspended an additional 80 games for a third positive test . On October 31 , 2007 , Pérez filed for free agency , ending his association with Tigers .

 In February 2008 there was talk of the Colorado Rockies signing Pérez to a minor league contract worth $ 750 @,@ 000 , which manager Clint Hurdle characterized as a " lifeline . " In the end Colorado backed out , citing younger players competing for the same position .

 Pérez has also had a significant foreign career . He participated in the Caribbean Series and was named the Series MVP in 1998 and 1999 .

In 2004 , he helped Escogido score 18 runs in an inning . In 2006 , he played in the Dominican Republic @-@ Puerto Rico All @-@ Star Game .

 Pérez 's poor offense after Colorado traded him to the Royals overshadowed his defensive skills . He was widely criticized because of his low on @-@ base percentage ( career .297 ) and lack of power . Nate Silver , a baseball statistician who analyzed Pérez 's statistics ( specifically value over replacement player ( <unk> ) ) , concluded that Pérez had a negative impact on the teams he played for . Chicago sportswriter Bruce Miles called Pérez " one of the worst offensive players in baseball history . " 
 = William Bostock = 
 Air Vice Marshal William Dowling ( Bill ) Bostock , CB , DSO , OBE ( 5 February 1892 – 28 April 1968 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . During World War II he led RAAF Command , the Air Force 's main operational formation , with responsibility for the defence of Australia and air offensives against Japanese targets in the South West Pacific Area . His achievements in the role earned him the Distinguished Service Order and the American Medal of Freedom . General Douglas MacArthur described him as " one of the world 's most successful airmen " . 
 A veteran of World War I , Bostock first saw combat as a soldier in the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli , then as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps on the Western Front , where he earned the Belgian Croix de guerre . He joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921 and by 1941 had risen to become its third most senior officer , serving as Director of Training from 1930 to 1931 , commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron from 1931 to 1936 , and Director of Operations and Intelligence from 1938 to 1939 . 
 The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of World War II , Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of Chief of the Air Staff in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore George Jones , a friend of twenty years . Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after , Bostock became involved in a bitter and long @-@ running dispute with Jones over control of the Air Force in the South West Pacific . Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946 , he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament . 
 = = Early life and World War I = = 
 Bostock was born in Surry Hills , an inner @-@ city suburb of Sydney , to an English father , also named William , and a Spanish mother , Mary . He was educated at The School , Mount Victoria , in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales , where he completed his junior certificate . The family later moved to Burwood , in Sydney 's Inner West . After leaving school Bostock was employed as an apprentice with the Marconi Company for two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , and spent time at sea as a wireless operator . 
 In November 1914 , Bostock joined the 2nd Signal Troop of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) as a sapper . He landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 , serving there until August , when he was evacuated suffering from dysentery . He returned to active duty in January 1916 , and was made lance corporal the following month . Promoted to sergeant , Bostock was posted to Egypt with the ANZAC Mounted Division in April 1916 , and saw action against Turkish forces in the Sinai Peninsula . 
 Bostock transferred from the AIF to the Royal Flying Corps Special Reserve on 18 February 1917 , and was commissioned as a probationary second lieutenant . He was posted to No. 48 Squadron in August , following pilot training in Egypt and England . Bostock fought on the Western Front and was awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre . He was invalided back to Britain in March 1918 , after which he transferred to the newly created Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . 
 = = Inter @-@ war years = = 
 Bostock married his Australian fiancée , Gwendolen Norton , in Southampton on 6 March 1919 . The couple had two daughters , one of whom , Gwendolen Joan , would serve as a cipher officer in the Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) during World War II . Bostock retired from the RAF and returned to civilian life in Australia that October . In September 1921 , he joined the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and was commissioned a flying officer . He became a friend and mentor to Flying Officer ( later Air Marshal Sir ) George Jones , another World War I veteran , who had flown with the Australian Flying Corps and had joined the Air Force in March . By mid @-@ 1922 Bostock had been promoted to flight lieutenant . 
 Having served at No. 1 Flying Training School ( No. 1 FTS ) , Point Cook , since entering the RAAF , Bostock was posted to Britain in 1926 to attend RAF Staff College , Andover . While there he was admonished by the college 's commandant , via letter , due to the particular school he had chosen for his daughter and because he did his own gardening ; Bostock was said to have returned the letter marked " noted and ignored " . On his return to Australia as a squadron leader in 1928 , he took charge of No. 1 FTS , and became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne , in December 1929 . From 1931 to 1936 Bostock was commanding officer ( CO ) of No. 3 Squadron , flying Westland Wapitis and , later , Hawker Demons . At the time , his position as No. 3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the unit 's base , RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales . A wing commander from 1934 , he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King 's Birthday Honours on 31 May 1935 . Following a two @-@ year posting in Britain on the staff of No. 1 Bomber Group , Bostock was promoted to group captain on 1 September 1938 and made Director of Operations and Intelligence . Within a year he had become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . 
 = = World War II = = 
 = = = Deputy Chief of the Air Staff = = = 
 The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff position that Bostock occupied at the outbreak of World War II was a new one that initially augmented , and later supplanted , an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role . Unlike the Assistant Chief , the Deputy had the authority to act in place of the Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) if required . This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia 's Joint Planning Committee . He was the RAAF 's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940 , where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill @-@ prepared for an attack by the Japanese , and recommended significant increases in air capability , both in Australia and the Pacific Islands , to meet the threat . Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period , becoming acting air commodore on 1 June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1 October 1941 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours . 
 Third in seniority in the RAAF after Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshal Stanley Goble , and considered to be " among the Air Force 's best brains " at the time , Bostock was a prime candidate for the position of CAS in May 1942 . He was also first choice of the incumbent CAS , Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett , whose two @-@ year term was coming to an end . However , Bostock 's closeness to Burnett , who had made no secret of his contempt for John Curtin 's Federal Labor government , damaged his chances for selection and his friend , George Jones , then only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore , took the position . Although he had expected to be made CAS , Bostock warmly congratulated Jones , possibly expecting that his ( Bostock 's ) new role as chief of staff to the Commander of Allied Air Forces , Lieutenant General George Brett , with responsibility for air operations in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , would prove the more important appointment in a time of war . 
 = = = Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command = = = 
 In August 1942 , General Douglas MacArthur , Supreme Commander SWPA , replaced Lieutenant General Brett with Major General ( later General ) George Kenney . Kenney created two new formations subordinate to Allied Air Forces Headquarters : the US Fifth Air Force and RAAF Command . Bostock was chosen to be Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command , with twenty @-@ four Australian squadrons at his disposal plus one each from the Netherlands , the United Kingdom and the United States . The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under Bostock 's command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF ( No. 9 OG ) , controlled by Fifth Air Force . RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia , except in the north @-@ east , protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea , and conducting operations against Japanese shipping , airfields and other installations in the Dutch East Indies . 
 By the end of 1943 , No. 9 OG , originally the RAAF 's mobile strike force , had become engaged in static garrison duties in New Guinea . Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function . Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation , which led to the establishment of No. 10 Operational Group ( No. 10 OG ) on 13 November 1943 at Nadzab , under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger . In February 1944 , RAAF Command took over many of the units of No. 9 OG , as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors . Bostock again recommended changing No. 9 OG 's name to Northern Area , and also proposed changing No. 10 OG 's name to Tactical Air Force , RAAF , in view of its increased strength from the infusion of new squadrons . On 11 April , No. 9 OG became Northern Command . On 14 September 1944 , Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin , wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command , particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations , and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces . Bostock concurred with Curtin ; the Prime Minister meanwhile authorised changing No. 10 OG 's name to First Tactical Air Force ( No. 1 TAF ) , with effect from 25 October . RAAF Command 's complement had now swelled to forty @-@ one Australian squadrons . 
 On 15 March 1945 , Bostock established a forward headquarters on Morotai Island to directly control No. 1 TAF for the upcoming Oboe operations , the reoccupation of Borneo . Kenney gave him responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines , and the Royal New Zealand Air Force ( RNZAF ) units which were based in the Solomon Islands to support the Bougainville Campaign were assigned to RAAF Command . Bostock wrote to Kenney , " I am particularly anxious that the 1st Tactical Air Force should continue to be employed as a forward offensive formation rather than in a garrison role " . In April , Kenney 's Allied Air Headquarters issued an order that Bostock would be named Air Officer Commanding @-@ in @-@ Chief RAAF Command , because he had several Air Officers Commanding ( AOCs ) reporting to him . Bostock duly passed on this change of nomenclature to his subordinate units but Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne vetoed the change in June . 
 Bostock had control of the USAAF Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces , as well as No. 1 TAF , during Operation Oboe One , the invasion of Tarakan , commencing 1 May 1945 . By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17 @,@ 000 personnel . On Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan – Brunei in June , Bostock also had at his disposal aircraft based in Australia under Western and North @-@ Western Area Commands . For Operation Oboe Two , the invasion of Balikpapan in July , Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons . His aim , in concert with that of Kenney and I Corps commander Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , was to deliver the heaviest aerial bombardment possible against enemy targets , to enable Australian assault forces to land with minimal casualties . Together with a naval barrage , this resulted in a " scene of indescribable ruin " on the battlefield , and allowed seventeen waves of troops to disembark their landing craft without loss . MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive " flawless " , while General Sir Thomas Blamey , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Australian Military Forces , congratulated Bostock on his " high order of control " and " ready and full cooperation " throughout the Borneo campaign . 
 = = = Rivalry with George Jones = = = 
 From 1942 , the structure of the RAAF was divided such that Bostock was in operational charge of the Air Force in the South West Pacific but relied on Air Vice Marshal Jones as CAS for supplies of manpower and equipment , while Jones was nominally in command of the entire RAAF but played no part in directing its major air operations against Japan . The situation was a source of " acute personal tension " between the two senior officers for the remainder of the war . It was exacerbated by the fact that while the CAS was de jure head of the RAAF , Jones ' rank of air vice marshal was no higher than Bostock 's . Air Force historian Alan Stephens later commented : " The system of divided command ... was not an ideal arrangement , but with men of goodwill it could have worked . Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind ... " 
 Bostock 's relationship to Kenney permitted him to ignore operational requests from Jones , while Jones continued to assert administrative control over Bostock 's command . When Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command in April 1943 and replace him with Air Commodore Joe Hewitt , AOC of No. 9 Operational Group , Bostock appealed to Kenney , who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command . Kenney threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government , and some time later MacArthur told Curtin that Hewitt " was not an adequate replacement " for Bostock . The matter was allowed to drop , but the rivalry continued . In January 1945 , an acrimonious series of cables was exchanged between the two Air Vice Marshals . Jones complained to Bostock of the latter 's " insubordinate tone " and " repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters " . Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was " responsible to Commander , Allied Air Forces , and not , repeat not , subordinate to you " , and that he would " continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference " . 
 Their feud was blamed for contributing to the low morale that precipitated the so @-@ called " Morotai Mutiny " of April 1945 , when a group of senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets . Alerted to the issue by No. 1 TAF 's commander , Air Commodore Harry Cobby , Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations . His methods were construed as an attempt to " make the situation go away or to at least cover it up " ; one of the " mutineers " , Squadron Leader John Waddy , quoted Bostock as saying , " I will leave these applications on the table and if you pick them up , all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it " . When the pilots refused to drop the matter , Bostock signalled Jones , advising that he found morale on the island to be at a " dangerously low level " and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore Scherger . Kenney concurred with Bostock , and Jones sacked Cobby . A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots ; one of them , Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger , told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock : " I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force . Every week there are instances of it . " 
 The conflict between the commanders reached its nadir during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945 , when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours . Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle . He later said that he would have thankfully " fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck " when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead , and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF 's absence . Over all , the dual system of control and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF 's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Bostock and Jones represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri on 2 September 1945 . RAAF Command was disbanded the same day . Bostock was one of several senior Air Force commanders summarily retired early in 1946 , in his case six years before the compulsory retirement age of 60 . Among the reasons for Bostock 's dismissal were , according to private government papers , an " inability to work in harmony with certain other high ranking RAAF officers " , and " lack of balance and appreciation of responsibility " . He appealed the decision , citing a letter from MacArthur that described him as " one of the world 's most successful airmen ... superior in every respect " , but was unsuccessful . Newspapers raised questions about Bostock 's departure , The Herald in Melbourne speculating on the part played by rivalries within the service . 
 After his retirement from the military , Bostock went into journalism and become an aviation correspondent for The Herald . He wrote a series of articles criticising the Air Force 's organisation and presenting his side of the story of RAAF Command , motivated partly by his belief that the official history of Australia in World War II would fail to adequately cover it . The articles caused considerable controversy and prompted the Minister for Air , Arthur Drakeford , to make a formal response in Federal Parliament , labelling Bostock 's allegations " malicious and unjustified " . 
 Bostock was decorated twice in 1948 for his war service , in March with the Distinguished Service Order " in recognition of distinguished services whilst in command of air operations in the Borneo Campaign during the period March to September , 1945 " , and in April with the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm . He entered politics in 1949 , standing as a Liberal Party candidate for the Federal Division of Indi in Victoria . Elected to the House of Representatives , he retained his seat until being defeated in the 1958 poll . Bostock served on a joint committee for foreign affairs and sometimes came into conflict with his own party on matters of defence policy . He continued to contribute to The Herald while in government . During parliamentary debates in 1951 and again in 1957 , Bostock spoke for " an integrated defence force with a single minister " , advocating amalgamation of the four separate Departments of Defence , Air , Navy and Army into one Department of Defence , headed by the Minister for Defence . He further proposed that a single Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief lead the Army , Navy and Air Force ; the Chief of the General Staff , the Chief of the Naval Staff , and the Chief of the Air Staff would report directly to the new position . In 1973 the single @-@ service departments were abolished in favour of an all @-@ encompassing Department of Defence , and by 1984 a Chief of the Defence Force position had evolved to directly command all three armed services through their respective chiefs . 
 Bostock 's wife Gwendolen died in 1947 , and he married 33 @-@ year @-@ old Nanette O 'Keefe in Melbourne on 1 June 1951 ; they had three sons . He owned a property near Benalla , in rural Victoria , where he died in 1968 . Survived by his second wife and his five children , Bostock was accorded an Air Force funeral and cremated . 
 = Fighting game = 
 Fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on @-@ screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent . These characters tend to be of equal power and fight matches consisting of several rounds , which take place in an arena . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter @-@ attacking , and chaining together sequences of attacks known as " combos " . Since the early 1990s , most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific button combinations . The genre is related to but distinct from beat ' em ups , which involve large numbers of antagonists . 
 The first video game to feature fist fighting was arcade game Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one @-@ on @-@ one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . In 1985 , Yie Ar Kung @-@ Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid @-@ 1990s , especially in arcades . This period spawned numerous popular fighting games in addition to Street Fighter , including successful and long running franchises like Mortal Kombat , The King of Fighters , Tekken , Virtua Fighter , Marvel vs. Capcom , Guilty Gear , and Killer Instinct . 
 The genre 's popularity stagnated as games became more complicated and as arcades began to lose their audience to increasingly powerful home consoles near the end of the 1990s , though new franchises such as Dead or Alive and the Soul series achieved success . In the new millennium , the genre remains popular but retains a much smaller proportion of enthusiasts than it once did , due to the increasing popularity of other genres . 
 Fighting games are almost always asymmetric games as each player fights in a different way . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Fighting games are a type of action game where on @-@ screen characters fight each other . These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements . Games traditionally show fighters from a side @-@ view , even as the genre has progressed from two @-@ dimensional ( 2D ) to three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphics . Street Fighter II , though not the first fighting game , popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre , and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games . Fighting games typically involve hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , but may also feature melee weapons . 
 This genre is distinct from beat ' em ups , another action genre involving combat , where the player character must fight many weaker enemies at the same time . During the 1980s publications used the terms " fighting game " and " beat ' em up " interchangeably , along with other terms such as " martial arts simulation " ( or more specific terms such as " judo simulator " ) . With hindsight , critics have argued that the two types of game gradually became dichotomous as they evolved , though the two terms may still be conflated . Fighting games are sometimes grouped with games that feature boxing , UFC , or wrestling . Serious boxing games belong more to the sports game genre than the action game genre , as they aim for a more realistic model of boxing techniques , whereas moves in fighting games tend to be highly exaggerated models of Asian martial arts techniques . As such , boxing games , mixed martial arts games , and wrestling games are often described as distinct genres , without comparison to fighting games and belong more into the Sports game genre . 
 = = Game design = = 
 Fighting games involve combat between pairs of fighters using highly exaggerated martial arts moves . They typically revolve around primarily brawling or combat sport , though some variations feature weaponry . Games usually display on @-@ screen fighters from a side view , and even 3D fighting games play largely within a 2D plane of motion . Games usually confine characters to moving left and right and jumping , although some games such as Fatal Fury : King of Fighters allow players to move between parallel planes of movement . Recent games tend to be rendered in three dimensions and allow side @-@ stepping , but otherwise play like those rendered in two dimensions . 
 Aside from moving around a restricted space , fighting games limit the player 's actions to different offensive and defensive maneuvers . Players must learn which attacks and defenses are effective against each other , often by trial and error . Blocking is a basic technique that allows a player to defend against attacks . Some games feature more advanced blocking techniques : for example , Capcom 's Street Fighter III features a move termed " parrying " which causes the attacker to become momentarily incapacitated ( a similar state is termed " just defended " in SNK 's Garou : Mark of the Wolves ) . In addition to blows such as punches and kicks , players can utilize throwing or " grappling " to circumvent " blocks " . Predicting opponents ' moves and counter @-@ attacking , known as " countering " , is a common element of gameplay . Fighting games also emphasize the difference between the height of blows , ranging from low to jumping attacks . Thus , strategy becomes important as players attempt to predict each other 's moves , similar to rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors . 
 = = = Special attacks = = = 
 An integral feature of fighting games includes the use of " special attacks " , also called " secret moves " , that employ complex combinations of button presses to perform a particular move beyond basic punching and kicking . Combos , in which several attacks are chained together using basic punches and kicks , are another common feature in fighting games and have been fundamental to the genre since the release of Street Fighter II . Some fighting games display a " combo meter " that displays the player 's progress through a combo . The effectiveness of such moves often relate to the difficulty of execution and the degree of risk . These moves are often beyond the ability of a casual gamer and require a player to have both a strong memory and excellent timing . Taunting is another feature of some fighting games and was originally introduced by Japanese company SNK in their game Art of Fighting . It is used to add humor to games , but can also have an effect on gameplay such as improving the strength of other attacks . Sometimes , a character can even be noted especially for taunting ( for example , Dan Hibiki from Street Fighter Alpha ) . 
 = = = Matches and rounds = = = 
 Fighting game matches generally consist of several rounds ( typically " best of three " ) ; the player who wins the most rounds wins the match . Fighting games widely feature life bars , which are depleted as characters sustain blows . Each successful attack will deplete a character 's health , and the game continues until a fighter 's energy reaches zero . Hence , the main goal is to completely deplete the life bar of one 's opponent , thus achieving a " knockout " . Beginning with Midway 's Mortal Kombat released in 1992 , the Mortal Kombat series introduced " Fatalities " in which the victor kills a knocked @-@ out opponent in a gruesome manner . Games such as Virtua Fighter also allow a character to be defeated by forcing them outside of the fighting arena , awarding a " ring @-@ out " to the victor . Round decisions can also be determined by time over ( if a timer is present ) , which judges players based on remaining vitality to declare a winner . Fighting games often include a single player campaign or tournament , where the player must defeat a sequence of several computer controlled opponents . Winning the tournament often reveals a special story – ending cutscene , and some games also grant access to hidden characters or special features upon victory . 
 = = = Character selection = = = 
 In most fighting games , players may select from a variety of characters who have unique fighting styles and special moves . This became a strong convention for the genre with the release of Street Fighter II , and these character choices have led to deeper game strategy and replay value . Although fighting games offer female characters , their image tends to be hypersexualized , and they have even been featured as pin @-@ up girls in game magazines . Male characters in fighting games tend to have extra @-@ broad chests and shoulders , huge muscles , and prominent jaws . Custom creation , or " create – a – fighter " , is a feature of some fighting games which allows a player to customize the appearance and move set of their own character . Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium was the first game to include such a feature , and later fighting games such as Fighter Maker , Soulcalibur III , Mortal Kombat : Armageddon , and Dragon Ball Z : Budokai Tenkaichi 2 adopted the concept . 
 = = = Multiplayer modes = = = 
 Fighting games may also offer a multiplayer mode in which players fight each other , sometimes by letting a second player challenge the first at any moment during a single player match . A few titles allow up to four players to compete simultaneously . Several games have also featured modes that involve teams of characters ; players form " tag teams " to fight matches in which combat is one @-@ on @-@ one , but a character may leave the arena to be replaced by a team mate . Some fighting games have also offered the challenge of fighting against multiple opponents in succession , testing the player 's endurance . Newer titles take advantage of online gaming services , although lag created by slow data transmission can disrupt the split @-@ second timing involved in fighting games . The impact of lag in some fighting games has been reduced by using technology such as <unk> , which keeps the players ' games in sync by quickly rolling back to the most recent accurate game state , correcting errors , and then jumping back to the current frame . Games using this technology include Skullgirls and Street Fighter III : 3rd Strike Online Edition . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Late 1970s to 1980s = = = 
 Fighting games find their origin in boxing games but evolved towards battles between characters with fantastic abilities and complex special maneuvers . Sega 's black and white boxing game Heavyweight Champ , which was released in 1976 , is considered the first video game to feature fist fighting . 1979 's Warrior is another title sometimes credited as one of the first fighting games . In contrast to Heavyweight Champ and most later titles , Warrior was based on sword fighting duels and used a bird 's eye view . In 1983 , Sega released another boxing game Champion Boxing , which was Yu Suzuki 's debut title at Sega . However , Data East and its related developer <unk> Japan 's Karate Champ from 1984 is credited with establishing and popularizing the one @-@ on @-@ one fighting game genre . In it , a variety of moves could be performed using the dual @-@ joystick controls , it used a best @-@ of @-@ three matches format like later fighting games , and it featured training bonus stages . It went on to influence Konami 's Yie Ar Kung Fu , released in January 1985 , which expanded on Karate Champ by pitting the player against a variety of opponents , each with a unique appearance and fighting style . The player could also perform up to sixteen different moves , including projectile attacks . The martial arts game The Way of the Exploding Fist , released in June 1985 , achieved critical success and subsequently afforded the burgeoning genre further popularity on home systems . Numerous other game developers tried to imitate the financial successes of Karate Champ , Yie Ar Kung @-@ Fu and The Way of the Exploding Fist with similar games ; Data East took unsuccessful legal action against Epyx over the computer game International Karate . Also in 1985 , Elite 's Frank Bruno 's Boxing introduced high and low guard , ducking , lateral dodging , and a meter which was built up with successful attacks , and when full enabled a special , more powerful punch , to be thrown . 
 Both Karate Champ and Yie Ar Kung Fu later provided a template for Capcom 's Street Fighter in 1987 . Street Fighter found its own niche in the gaming world , partially because many arcade game developers in the 1980s focused more on producing beat @-@ em @-@ ups and shoot ' em ups . Part of the game 's appeal was the use of special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls , which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game , although similar controller motions used for grappling maneuvers in the earlier Brian Jacks Uchi Mata were deemed too difficult . Following Street Fighter 's lead , the use of command @-@ based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre . Street Fighter also introduced other staples of the genre , including the blocking technique as well as the ability for a challenger to jump in and initiate a match against a player at any time . The game also introduced pressure @-@ sensitive controls that determine the strength of an attack , though due to causing damaged arcade cabinets , Capcom replaced it soon after with a six @-@ button control scheme offering light , medium and hard punches and kicks , which became another staple of the genre . In 1988 , Home Data released <unk> <unk> : Chinese Exorcist , also known as Last Apostle Puppet Show , the first fighting game to use digitized sprites and motion capture animation . Meanwhile , home game consoles largely ignored the genre . Budokan : The Martial Spirit was one of few releases for the Sega Genesis but was not as popular as games in other genres . Technical challenges limited the popularity of early fighting games . Programmers had difficulty producing a game that could recognize the fast motions of a joystick , and so players had difficulty executing special moves with any accuracy . 
 = = = Early 1990s = = = 
 The release of Street Fighter II in 1991 is often considered a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre . Yoshiki Okamoto 's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far . This allowed players to reliably execute multi @-@ button special moves , which had previously required an element of luck . The game was also highly successful because its graphics took advantage of Capcom 's CPS arcade chipset , with highly detailed characters and stages . Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer @-@ controlled fighters , Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other . The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry , as arcade owners bought more machines to keep up with demand . Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic , which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly . 
 SNK released Fatal Fury a few months before Street Fighter II . It was designed by Takashi Nishiyama , the creator of the original Street Fighter , which it was envisioned as a spiritual successor to . Fatal Fury placed more emphasis on storytelling and the timing of special moves , and added a two @-@ plane system where characters could step into the foreground or background . Meanwhile , Sega experimented with Dark Edge , an early attempt at a 3D fighting game where characters could move in all directions . Sega however , never released the game outside Japan because it felt that " unrestrained " 3D fighting games were unenjoyable . Sega also attempted to introduced 3 @-@ D holographic technology to the genre with <unk> in 1992 , though it was unsuccessful . Several fighting games achieved greater commercial success , including SNK 's Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown as well as Sega 's Eternal Champions . Nevertheless , Street Fighter II remained the most popular , spawning a special Champion Edition that improved game balance and allowed players to use additional characters . The popularity of Street Fighter II led it to be released for home game consoles and allowed it to define the template for fighting games . Fighting games soon became the dominant genre in the arcade game industry of the early 1990s . 
 Many American developers tried to capitalize on the template established by Street Fighter II , but it was Chicago 's Midway Games who achieved unprecedented notoriety when they released Mortal Kombat in 1992 . The game featured digital characters drawn from real actors , numerous secrets , and a " Fatality " system of finishing maneuvers with which the player 's character kills their opponent . The game earned a reputation for its gratuitous violence , and was eventually adapted for home game consoles . The home version of Mortal Kombat was released on September 13 , 1993 , a day that was promoted as " Mortal Monday " . The advertising resulted in line @-@ ups to purchase the game and a subsequent backlash from politicians concerned about the game 's violence . The Mortal Kombat franchise would ultimately achieve iconic status similar to that of Street Fighter with several sequels as well as movies , television series , and extensive merchandising . Numerous other game developers tried to imitate Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat 's financial success with similar games ; Capcom USA took unsuccessful legal action against Data East over the 1993 arcade game Fighter 's History . Data East 's largest objection in court was that their 1984 arcade game Karate Champ was the true originator of the competitive fighting game genre , which predated the original Street Fighter by three years . 
 Sega AM2 's first attempt in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival , but began to attract attention with the release of Virtua Fighter for the same platform the same year . It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action . Despite the graphics , players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games . With only three buttons , it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat , having six and five buttons respectively . By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan , the game and system were selling at almost a one @-@ to @-@ one ratio . Meanwhile , the 1993 title Mortal Kombat II captivated Western audiences , and a 2008 review considered the best Mortal Kombat game in retrospect . 
 The 1994 PlayStation launch title Battle Arena <unk> is credited for taking the genre into " true 3 @-@ D " due to its introduction of the sidestep maneuver , which IGN described as " one little move " that " changed the fighter forever . " The same year , SNK released The King of Fighters ' 94 in arcades , where players choose from teams of three characters to eliminate each other one by one . Eventually , Capcom released further updates to Street Fighter II , including Super Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo . These games featured more characters and new moves , some of which were a response to people who had hacked the original Street Fighter II game to add new features themselves . However , criticism of these updates grew as players demanded a true sequel . By 1995 , the dominant franchises were the Mortal Kombat series in America and Virtua Fighter series in Japan , with Street Fighter Alpha : Warriors ' Dreams unable to match the popularity of Street Fighter II . Throughout this period , the fighting game was the dominant genre in competitive video gaming , with enthusiasts popularly attending arcades in order to find human opponents . 
 = = = Late 1990s = = = 
 In the latter part of the 1990s , the fighting game genre began to decline in popularity , with specific franchises falling into difficulty . Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the excess of fighting games the " Most Appalling Trend " award of 1995 . Although the release of Street Fighter EX introduced 3D graphics to the series and continued the success of Street Fighter II and Street Fighter Alpha , the Street Fighter : The Movie arcade game was regarded as a failure . Street Fighter : The Movie used digitized images from the Street Fighter film . While a home video game also titled Street Fighter : The Movie was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn , it is not a port but a separately produced game based on the same premise . Capcom later released Street Fighter III in 1997 which featured improved visuals and character depth , but was also unable to match the impact of Street Fighter II . Despite excitement in Japan over Virtua Fighter 3 in arcades , the limited hardware capabilities of the Sega Saturn led Sega to delay a console release . Sega eventually released the game for its Dreamcast console , but the company became unprofitable and was forced to discontinue the console . Meanwhile , SNK released several fighting games on their Neo @-@ Geo platform , including Samurai Shodown II in 1994 , Real Bout Fatal Fury in 1995 , The Last Blade in 1997 , and annual updates to their The King of Fighters franchise . Garou : Mark of the Wolves from 1999 was considered one of SNK 's last great games , and the company announced that it would close its doors in 2001 . 
 In retrospect , multiple developers attribute the decline of the fighting genre to its increasing complexity and specialization . This complexity shut out casual players , and the market for fighting games became smaller and more specialized . Furthermore , arcades gradually became less profitable throughout the 1990s due to the increased technical power and popularity of home consoles . Even as popularity dwindled , the fighting game genre continued to evolve ; several strong 3D fighting games also emerged in the late 1990s . Namco 's Tekken ( released in arcades in 1994 and on the PlayStation in 1995 ) proved critical to the PlayStation 's early success , with its sequels also becoming some of the console 's most important titles . The Soul series of weapon @-@ based fighting games also achieved considerable critical success , beginning with 1995 's Soul Edge ( known as Soul Blade outside Japan ) to Soulcalibur V in 2012 . Tecmo released Dead or Alive in Japanese arcades in 1996 , porting it for the PlayStation in 1998 . It spawned a long running franchise , known for its fast paced control system and innovative counterattacks . The series again included titles important to the success of their respective consoles , including Dead or Alive 4 for the Xbox 360 . In 1998 , Bushido Blade , published by Square , introduced a realistic fighting engine that featured three @-@ dimensional environments while abandoning time limits and health bars in favour of an innovative Body Damage System , where a sword strike to a certain body part can amputate a limb or decapitate the head . 
 Video game enthusiasts took an interest in gaming crossovers which feature characters from multiple franchises in a particular game . An early example of this type of fighting game was the 1998 arcade release Marvel vs. Capcom : Clash of Super Heroes , featuring comic book superheroes as well as characters from other Capcom games . In 1999 , Nintendo released the first game in the Super Smash Bros. series , which allowed match @-@ ups such as Pikachu versus Mario . 
 = = = Early 2000s = = = 
 The early part of the decade saw the rise of major international fighting game tournaments such as Tougeki – Super Battle Opera and Evolution Championship Series , and famous players such as Daigo Umehara . Several more fighting game crossovers were released in the new millennium . The two most prolific developers of 2D fighting games , Capcom and SNK , combined intellectual property to produce SNK vs. Capcom games . SNK released the first game of this type , SNK vs. Capcom : The Match of the Millennium , for its Neo Geo Pocket Color handheld at the end of 1999 . GameSpot regarded the game as " perhaps the most highly anticipated fighter ever " and called it the best fighting game ever to be released for a handheld console . Capcom released Capcom vs. SNK : Millennium Fight 2000 for arcades and the Dreamcast in 2000 , followed by sequels in subsequent years . Though none matched the critical success of the handheld version , Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO was noted as the first game of the genre to successfully utilize internet competition . Other crossovers from 2008 included Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe . The most successful crossover , however , was Super Smash Bros. Brawl , also released in 2008 for the Wii . Featuring characters from Nintendo 's various franchises , the game was a runaway commercial success in addition to being lavished with critical praise . 
 In the new millennium , fighting games became less popular and plentiful than in the mid @-@ 1990s , with multiplayer competition shifting towards other genres . However , SNK reappeared in 2003 as SNK Playmore and continued to release games . Arc System Works received critical acclaim for releasing Guilty Gear X in 2001 , as well as its sequel Guilty Gear XX , as both were 2D fighting games featuring striking anime inspired graphics . The fighting game is currently a popular genre for amateur and doujin developers in Japan . The 2002 title Melty Blood was developed by then amateur developer French @-@ Bread and achieved cult success on the PC . It became highly popular in arcades following its 2005 release , and a version was released for the PlayStation 2 the following year . While the genre became generally far less popular than it once was , arcades and their attendant fighting games remained reasonably popular in Japan in this time period , and still remain so even today . Virtua Fighter 5 lacked an online mode but still achieved success both on home consoles and in arcades ; players practiced at home and went to arcades to compete face @-@ to @-@ face with opponents . In addition to Virtua Fighter and Tekken , the Soul and Dead or Alive franchises continued to release installments . Classic Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games were re @-@ released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade , allowing internet play , and in some cases , HD graphics . 
 = = = Late 2000s to present = = = 
 Street Fighter IV , which incorporated online multiplayer modes , was released in early 2009 to critical acclaim , having garnered praise since its release at Japanese arcades in 2008 . The console versions of the game as well as Super Street Fighter IV sold more than 6 million copies in total . Street Fighter 's successful revival has sparked a renaissance for the genre , introducing new players to the genre and with the increased audience allowing other fighting game franchises to achieve successful revivals of their own . Tekken 6 was positively received , selling more than 3 million copies worldwide as of August 6 , 2010 . Other successful titles that followed include BlazBlue : Calamity Trigger , Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds , Mortal Kombat ( 2011 ) , Street Fighter X Tekken , The King of Fighters XIII , and Guilty Gear <unk> . 
 Despite the critically acclaimed Virtua Fighter 5 releasing to very little fanfare in 2007 , its update Virtua Fighter 5 : Final Showdown has received much more attention in 2012 due to the renewed interest in fighting games . Dead or Alive 5 , is notable for making extensive use of destructible environments . Other titles following in the wake of the fighting game renaissance include Persona 4 Arena , Tekken Tag Tournament 2 , Soulcalibur V , and crossover titles such as PlayStation All @-@ Stars Battle Royale and Tekken X Street Fighter . 
 = German battleship Tirpitz = 
 Tirpitz was the second of two Bismarck @-@ class battleships built for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine ( navy ) during World War II . Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , the architect of the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) , the ship was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven in November 1936 and her hull was launched two and a half years later . Work was completed in February 1941 , when she was commissioned into the German fleet . Like her sister ship Bismarck , Tirpitz was armed with a main battery of eight 38 @-@ centimetre ( 15 in ) guns in four twin turrets . After a series of wartime modifications she was 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) heavier than Bismarck , making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy . 
 After completing sea trials in early 1941 , Tirpitz briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet , which was intended to prevent a possible break @-@ out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet . In early 1942 , the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion . While stationed in Norway , Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union , and two such missions were attempted in 1942 . Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being , forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship . 
 In September 1943 , Tirpitz , along with the battleship Scharnhorst , bombarded Allied positions on Spitzbergen , the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role . Shortly thereafter , the ship was damaged in an attack by British mini @-@ submarines and subsequently subjected to a series of large @-@ scale air raids . On 12 November 1944 , British Lancaster bombers equipped with 12 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) " Tallboy " bombs scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to capsize rapidly . A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets , which caused a large explosion . Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1 @,@ 204 . Between 1948 and 1957 the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation . 
 = = Construction and characteristics = = 
 Tirpitz was ordered as Ersatz Schleswig @-@ Holstein as a replacement for the old pre @-@ dreadnought Schleswig @-@ Holstein , under the contract name " G " . The Kriegsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven was awarded the contract , where the keel was laid on 20 October 1936 . The hull was launched on 1 April 1939 ; during the elaborate ceremonies , the ship was christened by the daughter of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , the ship 's namesake . Adolf von Trotha , a former admiral in the Imperial German Navy , spoke at the ship 's launching , which was also attended by Adolf Hitler . Fitting @-@ out work followed her launch , and was completed by February 1941 . British bombers repeatedly attacked the harbour in which the ship was being built ; no bombs struck Tirpitz , but the attacks did slow construction work . Tirpitz was commissioned into the fleet on 25 February for sea trials , which were conducted in the Baltic . 
 Tirpitz displaced 42 @,@ 900 t ( 42 @,@ 200 long tons ) as built and 52 @,@ 600 tonnes ( 51 @,@ 800 long tons ) fully loaded , with a length of 251 m ( 823 ft 6 in ) , a beam of 36 m ( 118 ft 1 in ) and a maximum draft of 10 @.@ 60 m ( 34 ft 9 in ) . She was powered by three Brown , Boveri & Cie geared steam turbines and twelve oil @-@ fired Wagner superheated boilers , which developed a total of 163 @,@ 023 PS ( 160 @,@ 793 shp ; 119 @,@ 903 kW ) and yielded a maximum speed of 30 @.@ 8 knots ( 57 @.@ 0 km / h ; 35 @.@ 4 mph ) on speed trials . Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1 @,@ 962 enlisted men ; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2 @,@ 500 men . As built , Tirpitz was equipped with Model 23 search radars mounted on the forward , foretop , and rear rangefinders . These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars , which had a larger antenna array . A Model 30 radar , known as the Hohentwiel , was mounted in 1944 in her topmast , and a Model 213 Würzburg fire @-@ control radar was added on her stern 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) Flak rangefinders . 
 She was armed with eight 38 cm SK C / 34 L / 52 guns arranged in four twin gun turrets : two superfiring turrets forward — Anton and Bruno — and two aft — Caesar and Dora . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm L / 55 guns , sixteen 10 @.@ 5 cm L / 65 and sixteen 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 83 , and initially twelve 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) antiaircraft guns . The number of 2 cm guns was eventually increased to 58 . After 1942 , eight 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) above @-@ water torpedo tubes were installed in two quadruple mounts , one mount on each side of the ship . The ship 's main belt was 320 mm ( 13 in ) thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) and 100 to 120 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) thick , respectively . The 38 cm turrets were protected by 360 mm ( 14 in ) thick faces and 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After sea trials , Tirpitz was stationed in Kiel and performed intensive training in the Baltic . While the ship was in Kiel , Germany invaded the Soviet Union . A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break @-@ out of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad . Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron , which consisted of the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer , the light cruisers Köln , Nürnberg , Leipzig , and Emden , several destroyers , and two flotillas of minesweepers . The Baltic Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax , patrolled off the <unk> Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941 , after which the unit disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training . During the training period , Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Hessen , which had been converted into a radio @-@ controlled target ship . The British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she was stationed in Kiel . 
 = = = Deployment to Norway = = = 
 Grand Admiral Erich Raeder , the commander of the Kriegsmarine , proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway . The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union , as well as act as a fleet in being to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway . Hitler , who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck , agreed to the proposal . The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment . The ship 's antiaircraft battery was strengthened , and the 10 @.@ 5 cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved outboard to increase their field of fire . The two quadruple 53 @.@ 3 cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit . The ship 's commander , Kapitän zur See ( KzS — Captain at Sea ) Karl Topp , pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942 . The following day , Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven , a move designed to conceal her actual destination . 
 The ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23 : 00 on 14 January and made for Trondheim . British military intelligence , which was capable of decrypting the Enigma messages sent by the German navy , detected the departure of the vessel , but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF . Admiral John Tovey , the commander in chief of the British Home Fleet , was not made aware of Tirpitz 's activities until 17 January , well after the ship had arrived in Norway . On 16 January , British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim . Tirpitz then moved to the Fættenfjord , just north of Trondheim . The movement was codenamed Operation <unk> ( Polar Night ) ; the battleship was escorted by the destroyers Z4 Richard Beitzen , Z5 Paul Jakobi , Z8 Bruno Heinemann and Z29 for the voyage . She was moored next to a cliff , which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest . The ship 's crew cut down trees and placed them aboard Tirpitz to camouflage her . Additional antiaircraft batteries were installed around the fjord , as were anti @-@ torpedo nets and heavy booms in the entrance to the anchorage . Life for the crew of Tirpitz was very monotonous during the deployment to Norway . Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting . The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning antiaircraft defences . Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit . 
 = = = Operations against Allied convoys = = = 
 Several factors served to restrain Tirpitz 's freedom of operation in Norway . The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support Operation Cerberus , the movement of the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen up through the English Channel . These caused a planned attack against the outbound convoy PQ 8 at the end of January to be abandoned . A planned British air attack at the end of January by four @-@ engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target , which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship . In early February , Tirpitz took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run @-@ up to Operation Cerberus . These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the North Sea . Later that month , the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Prinz Eugen and several destroyers . Prinz Eugen had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the Fættenfjord , and was therefore temporarily out of action . 
 In March 1942 Tirpitz and Admiral Scheer , along with the destroyers Z14 Friedrich Ihn , Z5 Paul Jakobi , Z7 Hermann Schoemann and Z25 and a pair of torpedo boats , were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP 8 and the outbound Convoy PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast ( Sports Palace ) . Admiral Scheer , with a design speed of 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , was too slow to operate with Tirpitz , and was left in port , as was the destroyer Paul Jakobi . The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation . On 5 March , Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ 12 near Jan Mayen Island ; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship HMS Duke of York or the battlecruiser HMS Renown , both of which escorted the convoy , along with four destroyers . Unknown to the Germans , Admiral Tovey provided distant support to the convoys with the battleship HMS King George V , the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious , the heavy cruiser HMS Berwick , and six destroyers . Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of Tirpitz 's attack , which allowed them to reroute the convoys . Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue Tirpitz on 9 March , but Admiral Otto Ciliax , the commander of the German squadron , had decided to return to port the previous evening . An air attack was launched early on the 9th ; twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups , and Tirpitz successfully evaded the torpedoes . Only three men were wounded in the attack . Tirpitz 's anti @-@ aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft . After the conclusion of the attack , Tirpitz made for Vestfjord , and from there to Trondheim , arriving on the evening of 13 March . On 30 March , thirty @-@ three Halifax bombers attacked the ship ; they scored no hits , and five aircraft were shot down . The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April . On the night of 27 – 28 April , thirty @-@ one Halifaxes and twelve Lancasters ; five of the bombers were shot down . Another raid , composed of twenty @-@ three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters , took place the following night . Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti @-@ aircraft defences . 
 The actions of Tirpitz and her escorting destroyers in March used up 8 @,@ 230 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 100 long tons ) of fuel oil , which greatly reduced the available fuel supply . It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys . Convoy PQ 17 , which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union , was the next convoy targeted by Tirpitz and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway , during Operation Rösselsprung ( Knight 's Move ) . Escorting the convoy were the battleships Duke of York and USS Washington and the carrier Victorious . Tirpitz , Admiral Hipper , and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim , while a second task force consisting of Lützow , Admiral Scheer , and six destroyers operated out of Narvik and Bogenfjord . Lützow and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port . Shortly after Tirpitz left Norway , the Soviet submarine K @-@ 21 fired two or four torpedoes at the ship , all of which missed . The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship . Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty , which ordered the convoy to disperse . Aware that they had been detected , the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U @-@ boats and the Luftwaffe . The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts , and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports . Tirpitz returned to Altafjord via the Lofoten Islands . 
 Following Operation Rösselsprung , the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogenfjord near Narvik . By this time , the ship needed a major overhaul . Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany , and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim . On 23 October , the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fættenfjord outside Trondheim . The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened ; additional anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed , and double anti @-@ torpedo nets were erected around the vessel . The repairs were conducted in limited phases , such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul . A caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship 's rudders . During the repair process , the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Chariot human torpedoes , but before they could be launched , rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them . By 28 December , the overhaul had been completed , and Tirpitz began sea trials . She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in the <unk> . On 21 February , Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer ; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway . Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway . 
 By the time Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943 , Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased . To give the ships an opportunity to work together , Admiral Karl Dönitz , who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942 , ordered an attack on the island of Spitzbergen , which housed a British weather station and refuelling base . Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile . The two battleships , escorted by ten destroyers , left port on 6 September ; in a ruse de guerre , Tirpitz flew the white ensign on the approach to the island the following day . During the bombardment , Tirpitz fired 52 main @-@ battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15 cm secondaries . This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target . An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners . By 11 : 00 , the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports .

 = = = = Operation Source = = = = 
 The British were determined to neutralise Tirpitz and remove the threat she posed to Allied lines of communication in the Arctic . Following the repeated , ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942 , the British turned to the newly designed X Craft midget submarines . The planned attack , Operation Source , included attacks on Tirpitz , Scharnhorst , and Lützow . The X Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations , where they could slip under anti @-@ torpedo nets to each drop two powerful 2 tonne mines on the sea bed under the bottom of the target . Ten vessels were assigned to the operation , scheduled for 20 – 25 September 1943 . Only eight of the vessels reached Norway for the attack , which began early on 22 September . Three of the vessels , X5 , X6 , and X7 , successfully breached Tirpitz 's defences , two of which — X6 and X7 — managed to lay their mines . X5 was detected some 200 m ( 660 ft ) from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges . 
 The mines caused extensive damage to the ship ; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar , and the second detonated 45 to 55 m ( 148 to 180 ft ) off the port bow . A fuel oil tank was ruptured , shell plating was torn , a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship , and bulkheads in the double bottom buckled . Some 1 @,@ 430 t ( 1 @,@ 410 long tons ) of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side , which caused a list of one to two degrees , which was balanced by counter @-@ flooding on the starboard side . The flooding damaged all of the turbo @-@ generators in generator room No. 2 , and all apart from one generator in generator room No. 1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables . Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated ; this was particularly significant , as there were no heavy @-@ lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings . The ship 's two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed . Repairs were conducted by the repair ship Neumark ; historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin remarked that the successful repair effort was " one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War . " Repairs lasted until 2 April 1944 ; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord .

 The British were aware that Neumark and the repair crews left in March , which intimated Tirpitz was nearly operational . A major air strike — Operation Tungsten — involving the fleet carriers Victorious and Furious and the escort carriers Emperor , Fencer , Pursuer , and Searcher , was set for 4 April 1944 , but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that Tirpitz was to depart at 05 : 29 on 3 April for sea trials . The attack consisted of 40 Barracuda dive @-@ bombers carrying 1 @,@ 600 @-@ pound ( 730 kg ) armor @-@ piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves , scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses . The aircraft achieved surprise , and only one was lost in the first wave ; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of Tirpitz 's antiaircraft batteries to be fully manned . The first wave struck at 05 : 29 , as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring . The second wave arrived over the target an hour later , shortly after 06 : 30 . Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners , only one other bomber was shot down . 
 The air strike caused significant damage to the ship and inflicted serious casualties . William Garzke and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others , while Hildebrand , Röhr , & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men , including the ship 's commander , KzS Hans Meyer . Two of the 15 cm turrets were destroyed by bombs , and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed . Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship . Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine , and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water . Some 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) of water flooded the ship , primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses . Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding . Dönitz ordered the ship be repaired , regardless of the cost , despite the fact that he understood Tirpitz could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support . Repair work began in early May ; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days . By 2 June , the ship was again able to steam under her own power , and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible . During the repair process , the 15 cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft , and specially @-@ fuzed 38 cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied . 
 = = = = Operations Planet , Brawn , Tiger Claw , Mascot and Goodwood = = = = 
 A series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months , but bad weather forced their cancellation . A repeat of Operation Tungsten , codenamed Operation Planet , was scheduled for 24 April . Operation Brawn , which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from Victorious and Furious , was to have taken place on 15 May , and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May . Victorious and Furious were joined by Indefatigable for Operation Mascot , which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters . The weather finally broke in late August , which saw the Goodwood series of attacks . Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August ; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers Furious , Indefatigable and Formidable and the escort carriers Nabob and Trumpeter launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids . The attacks failed to inflict any damage on Tirpitz , and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down . Goodwood III followed on 24 August , composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only . Forty @-@ eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage . One , a 1600 @-@ pound bomb , penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No. 4 switchboard room . Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate . The second , a 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb , exploded but caused only superficial damage . Six planes were shot down in the attack . Goodwood IV followed on the 29th , with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from Formidable and Indefatigable . Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored . One Firefly and a Corsair were shot down by Tirpitz 's gunners . The battleship expended 54 rounds from her main guns , 161 from the 15 cm guns and up to 20 percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition . 
 = = = = Operations Paravane and Obviate = = = = 
 The ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the Fleet Air Arm in mid @-@ 1944 led to the task of Tirpitz 's destruction being transferred to the RAF 's No. 5 Group . The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry 6 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 5 @.@ 4 t ) Tallboy bombs to penetrate the ship 's heavy armour . The first attack , Operation Paravane , took place on 15 September 1944 ; operating from a forward base at <unk> in Russia , 23 Lancasters ( 17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve JW mines ) , scored a single hit on the ship 's bow . The Tallboy penetrated the ship , exited the keel , and exploded in the bottom of the fjord . 800 to 1 @,@ 000 t ( 790 to 980 long tons ) of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in trim forward . The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to 8 to 10 knots ( 15 to 19 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 to 11 @.@ 5 mph ) . Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire @-@ control equipment . The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery . Repair work was estimated to take nine months , but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks , allowing Tirpitz to be moved further south to Tromsø . On 15 October , the ship made the 200 nmi ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) trip to Tromsø under her own power , the last voyage of her career . 
 The RAF made a second attempt on 29 October , after the ship was moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø . Thirty @-@ two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate . As on Operation Paravane , No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together , which resulted in only one near miss , partially the result of bad weather over the target . The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding . Tirpitz 's 38 cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high @-@ level bombers ; one aircraft was damaged by ground @-@ based anti @-@ aircraft guns . Following the attack , the ship 's anchorage was significantly improved . A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing , and anti @-@ torpedo nets were installed . Tirpitz retained a one @-@ degree list to port from earlier damage , and this was not corrected by counter @-@ flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible . The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform : fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo @-@ generators , and the crew was reduced to 1 @,@ 600 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = = = Operation Catechism = = = = 
 Operation Catechism , the final British attack on Tirpitz , took place on 12 November 1944 . The ship again used her 38 cm guns against the bombers , which approached the battleship at 09 : 35 ; Tirpitz 's main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily , but could not break up the attack . A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship , with two direct hits and one near miss . Several other bombs landed within the anti @-@ torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed ; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing . One bomb penetrated the ship 's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode . A second hit amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage . A very large hole was blown into the ship 's side and bottom ; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed . A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar . The amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20 degrees . In ten minutes , the list increased to 30 to 40 degrees ; the captain issued the order to abandon ship . Progressive flooding increased the list to 60 degrees by 09 : 50 , though this appeared to stabilise temporarily . Eight minutes later , a large explosion rocked turret Caesar . The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown 25 m ( 82 ft ) into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore , crushing them . Tirpitz rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor . 
 In the aftermath of the attack , 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the bottom hull plates . Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1 @,@ 204 . Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser Lützow in January 1945 . 
 The performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of Tirpitz was heavily criticised after her loss . Major Heinrich Ehrler , the commander of III . / Jagdgeschwader 5 ( 3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing ) , was blamed for the Luftwaffe 's failure to intercept the British bombers . He was court @-@ martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty . Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested . He was sentenced to three years in prison , but was released after a month , demoted , and reassigned to an Me 262 fighter squadron in Germany . Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco ; the aircrews had not been informed that Tirpitz had been moved off Håkøya two weeks before the attack . 
 The wreck of Tirpitz remained in place until after the war , when a joint German @-@ Norwegian company began salvage operations . Work lasted from 1948 until 1957 ; fragments of the ship are still sold by a Norwegian company . Ludovic Kennedy wrote in his history of the vessel that she " lived an invalid 's life and died a cripple 's death " . 
 = New Jersey Route 37 = 
 Route 37 is a state highway located in Ocean County , New Jersey , United States . The route runs 13 @.@ 43 mi ( 21 @.@ 61 km ) from Lakehurst at an intersection with Route 70 to an interchange with Route 35 in Seaside Heights . A four – to six – lane divided highway its entire length , Route 37 serves as the major east – west route through the Toms River area as well as a main route to the Barnegat Peninsula , crossing the Barnegat Bay on the Thomas A. Mathis and J. Stanley Tunney Bridges . The route through Toms River Township is lined with many businesses and named Little League World Champions Boulevard in honor of Toms River East Little League 's victory in the 1998 Little League World Series . Route 37 intersects many major roads in the Toms River area , including County Route 527 , the Garden State Parkway / U.S. Route 9 , Route 166 , County Route 549 , and County Route 571 . The route experiences congestion from both development in the area and from traffic bound for the barrier islands in the summer . 
 Route 37 was first legislated in 1927 in two sections : one running from Trenton to White Horse along the current U.S. Route 206 alignment that replaced part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 2 and the other running from Lakehurst to Point Pleasant that replaced part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 18 between Lakehurst and Toms River . In 1953 , Route 37 was legislated along its current alignment , with the designation dropped on the Trenton – White Horse segment to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 206 and the Seaside Heights – Point Pleasant section becoming a realignment of Route 35 . Route 37 was then proposed in the 1960s as a freeway running from White Horse to Seaside Heights . This freeway proposal was eventually altered to create Interstate 195 , running from Trenton to Wall Township . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 37 begins at the Lakehurst Circle intersection with Route 70 in Lakehurst , heading east on a four – lane divided highway . Soon after beginning , the route crosses into Manchester Township . It intersects Commonwealth Boulevard , which provides access to the Leisure Village West @-@ Pine Lake Park community , before crossing into Toms River Township . Route 37 continues east with many intersections that feature jughandles and at the intersection with Industrial Way , the road widens to six lanes . Route 37 passes to the north of Holiday City - Silver Ridge Park , an age @-@ restricted community which contributes to the large population of senior residents in the area . The route meets County Route 642 ( Mule Road ) and County Route 527 ( Oak Ridge Parkway / Lakehurst Road ) . After the intersection with County Route 527 , the route crosses over the North Branch of the Toms River . 
 Route 37 features a cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway / U.S. Route 9 . Past the Garden State Parkway , the route crosses the former alignment of U.S. Route 9 , Route 166 . Past this intersection , Route 37 becomes a road lined with several businesses . The route intersects County Route 549 ( Hooper Avenue ) and County Route 38 ( Clifton Avenue ) . County Route 627 ( Vaughn Avenue / West End Avenue ) intersects next and Route 37 runs along the border of Toms River and Island Heights , with Toms River to the north and Island Heights to the south . Route 37 meets the southern terminus of County Route 627 ( Central Avenue ) and fully enters Toms River Township again at the Gilford Avenue intersection . Further east , the route intersects County Route 549 Spur / County Route 571 ( Fischer Boulevard ) . 
 Route 37 crosses the Barnegat Bay on the Thomas A. Mathis and J. Stanley Tunney Bridges with the eastbound bridge featuring a drawbridge that allows ships to pass through while the westbound bridge is a higher @-@ level span . The route continues onto Pelican Island in the Barnegat Bay , crossing into a small piece of Berkeley Township . Route 37 crosses over a part of the Barnegat Bay and enters Seaside Heights on the Barnegat Peninsula , where the route comes to its eastern terminus at an interchange with Route 35 . 
 Due to the area 's vacationers , many of which come from New York and Northern New Jersey , Route 37 is routinely congested with seasonal traffic in the summer , especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the Garden State Parkway interchange as heavy tourist traffic converges on the shore . Additionally , the road sees congestion due to the area 's rapid growth in commercial development . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to 1927 , the route between present @-@ day Route 70 in Lakehurst and present @-@ day County Route 527 in Toms River was a part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 18 , which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 37 was legislated to run from Route 27 and Route 30 ( now U.S. Route 1 Business , U.S. Route 206 , and Route 31 ) in Trenton to Route 35 ( now Route 88 ) in Point Pleasant , passing through White Horse , Allentown , Lakehurst , Toms River , and Seaside Heights . The portion between Trenton and White Horse replaced part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 2 , while the portion between Lakehurst and Toms River replaced part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 18 . 
 Following the 1927 renumbering , Route 37 existed in two separate sections , one running from downtown Trenton to the White Horse Circle , concurrent with U.S. Route 206 , and one running from Route 40 ( now Route 70 ) in Lakehurst to Point Pleasant . The remainder of the route between White Horse and Lakehurst remained incomplete . There are , as of mid @-@ 2008 , a few old concrete bridges dating from the 1930s and 1940s between the White Horse Circle and Allentown , which list sections of what is now County Route 524 as having been Route 37 at that time , as well as one or two along County Route 539 south of Allentown . In addition , some maps labeled these routes as being part of Route 37 . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 37 was legislated to run along its current alignment from Route 70 in Lakehurst to Route 35 in Seaside Heights . The number was dropped between Trenton and White Horse in favor of U.S. Route 206 , while the section between Seaside Heights and Point Pleasant became a realignment of Route 35 . 
 Route 37 was proposed in the late 1960s as a freeway that was to run from Route 29 in the Trenton area to Seaside Heights . It was suggested that this freeway be completed by 1975 in order to handle a rapid growth of population in Central New Jersey . In 1967 , this proposal was altered to build a road that compromised with the proposed Route 38 freeway between Camden and Wall Township . It soon received federal funding and was built as Interstate 195 , running from Trenton to Wall Township . 
 The portion of Route 37 within Toms River Township was officially named Little League World Champions Boulevard in 1998 following Toms River East Little League 's victory in the 1998 Little League World Series .

 = Operation Winter Storm = 
 Operation Winter Storm ( German : Unternehmen Wintergewitter ) was a German offensive in World War II in which the German 4th Panzer Army unsuccessfully attempted to break the Soviet encirclement of the German 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad . 
 In late November 1942 , the Red Army completed Operation Uranus , encircling some 300 @,@ 000 Axis personnel in and around the city of Stalingrad . German forces within the Stalingrad pocket and directly outside were reorganized under Army Group Don , under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein . Meanwhile , the Red Army continued to allocate as many resources as possible to the eventual launch of the planned Operation Saturn , which aimed to isolate Army Group A from the rest of the German Army . To remedy the situation , the Luftwaffe attempted to supply German forces in Stalingrad through an air bridge . When the Luftwaffe proved incapable of carrying out its mission and it became obvious that a successful breakout could occur only if launched as early as possible , Manstein decided on a relief effort . 
 Originally , Manstein was promised four panzer divisions . Due to German reluctance to weaken certain sectors by redeploying German units , the task of opening a corridor to the German 6th Army fell to the 4th Panzer Army . The German force was pitted against several Soviet armies tasked with the destruction of the encircled German forces and their offensive around the lower Chir River . 
 The German offensive caught the Red Army by surprise and made large gains on the first day . The spearhead forces enjoyed air support and were able to defeat counterattacks by Soviet troops . By 13 December , Soviet resistance slowed the German advance considerably . Although German forces took the area surrounding Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy , the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December . Operation Little Saturn defeated the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don 's left flank , threatening the survival of Manstein 's entire group of forces . As resistance and casualties increased , Manstein appealed to Hitler and to the commander of the German 6th Army , General Friedrich Paulus , to allow the 6th Army to break out of Stalingrad ; both refused . The 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a corridor to the 6th Army on 18 – 19 December , but was unable to do so without the aid of forces inside the Stalingrad pocket . Manstein was forced to call off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position . Due to the failure of the 6th Army to breakout and the attempt to break the Soviet encirclement , the Red Army was able to continue the destruction of German forces in Stalingrad . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 23 November 1942 , the Red Army closed its encirclement of Axis forces in Stalingrad . Nearly 300 @,@ 000 German and Romanian soldiers , as well as Russian volunteers for the Wehrmacht , were trapped in and around the city of Stalingrad by roughly 1 @.@ 1 million Soviet personnel . Amidst the impending disaster , German chancellor Adolf Hitler appointed Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) Erich von Manstein as commander of the newly created Army Group Don . Composed of the German 4th Panzer and 6th Armies , as well as the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies , Manstein 's new army group was situated between German Army Groups A and B. Instead of attempting an immediate breakout , German high command decided that the trapped forces would remain in Stalingrad in a bid to hold out . The encircled German forces were to be resupplied by air , requiring roughly 680 t ( 750 short tons ) of supplies per day . However , the assembled fleet of 500 transport aircraft were insufficient for the task . Many of the aircraft were hardly serviceable in the rough Soviet winter ; in early December , more German cargo planes were destroyed in accidents than by Soviet fighter aircraft . The German 6th Army , for example , was getting less than 20 % of its daily needs . Furthermore , the Germans were still threatened by Soviet forces which still held portions of the Volga River 's west bank in Stalingrad . 
 Given the unexpected size of German forces closed off in Stalingrad , on 23 November Stavka ( Soviet Armed Forces High Command ) decided to strengthen the outer encirclement preparing to destroy Axis forces in and around the city . On 24 November , several Soviet formations began to entrench themselves to defend against possible German incursions originating from the West . The Soviets also reinforced the encircling forces in order to prevent a successful breakout operation by the German 6th Army and other Axis units . However , this tied down over ½ of the Red Army 's strength in the area . Planning for Operation Saturn began on 25 November , aiming for the destruction of the Italian 8th Army and the severing of communications between German forces west of the Don River and those operating in the Caucasus . Meanwhile , planning also began for Operation <unk> ( Ring ) , which aimed at reducing German forces in the Stalingrad pocket . 
 As Operation Uranus concluded , German forces inside the encirclement were too weak to attempt a breakout on their own . Half of their remaining armor , for example , had been lost during the defensive fighting , and there was a severe lack of fuel and ammunition for the surviving vehicles , given that the Luftwaffe was not able to provide adequate aerial resupply . Feldmarschall von Manstein proposed a counterstrike to break the Soviet encirclement of Stalingrad , codenamed Operation Winter Storm ( German : Wintergewitter ) . Manstein believed that — due to the inability of the Luftwaffe to supply the Stalingrad pocket — it was becoming more important to relieve them " at the earliest possible date " . On 28 November , Manstein sent Hitler a detailed report on Army Group Don 's situation , including the strength of the German 6th Army and an assessment on the available ammunition for German artillery inside the city . The dire strategic situation made Manstein doubtful on whether or not the relief operation could afford to wait to receive all units earmarked for the offensive . 
 Stavka postponed Operation Saturn until 16 December , as Soviet forces struggled to clear German defenders from the lower Chir River . The Red Army 's offensive in the area commenced on 30 November , involving around 50 @,@ 000 soldiers , which forced Manstein to use the 48th Panzer Corps in an attempt to hold the area . In response , the 5th Tank Army was reinforced by the newly created 5th Shock Army , drawn from existing formations of the South @-@ Western and Stalingrad Fronts ; the 5th Tank Army totaled nearly 71 @,@ 000 men , 252 tanks and 814 artillery guns . The Soviet offensive succeeded in tying down the 48th Panzer Corps , originally chosen to lead one of the main attacks on the Soviet encirclement . The Soviets were forewarned of the impending German assault when they discovered the German 6th Panzer Division unloading at the town of <unk> , and as a result , held back several armies from the attack on the lower Chir River to prepare for a possible breakout attempt by German forces inside Stalingrad .

 = = = Participating German forces = = = 
 The relief operation was originally scheduled to include the LVII Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army , under the command of General Friedrich Kirchner , including the 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions , and Army Detachment Hollidt , consisting of three infantry divisions and two armored divisions ( 11th and 22nd Panzer Divisions ) . In total , it was expected that four panzer divisions , four infantry divisions and three Luftwaffe Field Divisions were to take part in Operation Winter Storm . They would be tasked with temporarily opening a passage to the 6th Army . The Luftwaffe field divisions — formed of non @-@ combat soldiers , headquarters staffs and unit @-@ less Luftwaffe and Heer personnel — were poorly trained and lacked seasoned officers and enlisted soldiers , as well as sufficient anti @-@ tank and artillery guns . Many of the personnel promised for the relief effort never arrived , partly due to the poor transportation service to the front , while some units originally chosen to be transferred under the command of Army Group Don were retained by their original commands . Other units in Army Group Don were in no shape to conduct offensive operations , due to losses sustained in the past month of combat , while many new formations which had been promised did not arrive on time . 
 On the other hand , the 11th Panzer Division was one of the most complete German armored divisions on the Eastern Front since it had just been transferred out of the German Army 's reserve . The 6th Panzer Division was also complete because it had been transferred to Manstein 's control from Western Europe . However , the usefulness of the 11th Panzer Division was compromised when the Soviets launched their offensive against forces in the lower Chir River area , as this tied Army Detachment Hollidt down on the defensive . Because of this , and because Manstein believed that a thrust originating from the position of Army Detachment Hollidt would be too obvious , the German field marshal decided to use the 4th Panzer Army and the XLVIII Panzer Corps as the main components of the relief operation . However , despite attempts by the Germans to build strength for the offensive , their position along the lower Chir River became tenuous ; the Soviet breakthrough was only blunted by the arrival of the 11th Panzer Division , which was able to destroy the bulk of two Soviet tank brigades . Consequently , the XLVIII Panzer Corps became embroiled in the defensive battles for the Chir River , as the Soviets pushed in an attempt to overrun the airfield at <unk> ( being used to resupply German forces in Stalingrad by air ) . 
 Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly released to Army Group Don , by Army Group A , the 17th Panzer Division was ordered back to its original area of concentration , and did not prepare to go back to Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for . In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces , and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River , Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army . Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own , from the opposite side , upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap . Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out , and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket . On 10 December , Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours .

 For the purpose of Operation Uranus , Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov deployed eleven Soviet armies . In an effort to bolster the offensive capabilities of the Stalingrad Front , over 420 tanks , 111 @,@ 000 soldiers and 556 artillery guns were shipped over the Volga River in a period of three weeks . The Red Army and Red Air Force were able to amass over one million soldiers , 13 @,@ 500 artillery guns , 890 tanks and 1 @,@ 100 combat aircraft , organized into 66 rifle divisions , five tank corps , 14 tank brigades , a single mechanized brigade , a cavalry corps , and 127 artillery and mortar regiments . As the encirclement closed and the Soviets continued with secondary operations , the 51st Army was positioned on the edge of the outer encirclement with 34 @,@ 000 men and 77 tanks . South of them was the 28th Army , with 44 @,@ 000 soldiers , 40 tanks and 707 artillery guns and mortars . Concurrently , the Red Army began building its strength for Operation Saturn , in which it would aim to isolate and destroy German Army Group A in the Caucasus .

 On 12 December 1942 , Hoth 's Fourth Panzer Army 's LVII Panzer Corps began its north @-@ eastward drive toward German forces trapped in the Stalingrad pocket . The 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions made large gains , surprising the Red Army and threatening the rear of the Soviet 51st Army . The German drive was due to be spearheaded by the 503rd heavy tank battalion ( Germany ) of Tiger I heavy tanks , but the unit did not reach the Don front until 21 December . Initial progress of the offensive was rapid . Some units were able to travel up to 50 km ( 31 mi ) in the first day . The Germans were aided by the element of surprise , as Stavka had not expected the German offensive to begin so soon , while General Vasilevsky was unable to detach the 2nd Guards Army to use it as a blocking force against Manstein 's spearheads . The initial advance had been so quick that the 6th Panzer Division was able to capture Soviet artillery equipment intact . Soviet resistance decreased noticeably after the 6th and 23rd Panzer Divisions had overrun the main body of Russian infantry . In fact , the 302nd Rifle Division of the 51st Army was overrun by the end of 12 December . Although Soviet infantry quickly reinforced villages in the path of the German drive , the Red Army 's cavalry in the area was exhausted from weeks of combat and was incapable of putting up serious resistance against the German offensive . Despite early gains , the LVII Panzer Corps was unable to achieve decisive results . There were also reports of heavy pressure building against the 23rd Panzer Division , despite headway made on the first day of the German offensive . 
 On 13 December , the 6th Panzer Division made contact with the Soviet 5th Tank Army , which was engaged in the reduction of German defenses around the Chir River . German forces were able to engage and defeat Soviet armor , as the former forced the crossing of the Alksay River . At this point , a major armored battle began around the village of Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy . Although they sustained heavy losses , the Soviet forces were able to push German forces back to the banks of the Alksay River by the end of the day , while failing to retake the town . However , the losses sustained by the Red Army in the vicinity of Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy allowed the 6th Panzer Division to enjoy a brief superiority in tank numbers thereafter . Fighting for Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy continued for three days , as the Red Army launched a series of counterattacks against the German bridgeheads across the Alksay River and German defenders in the town . German defenders were able to pin Soviet tanks in Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy and destroy them using well emplaced anti @-@ tank artillery guns . With heavy support from the Luftwaffe , the Germans were able to achieve a local success and began to push toward the Myshkova river . The 6th Panzer Division took heavy losses during its drive , and took a brief respite after the battle to recondition . Minor damage to surviving tanks was repaired and the majority of the tanks incapacitated during the fighting at Verkhne @-@ Kumskiy were brought back to serviceable conditions . 
 = = = Soviet response : 13 – 18 December = = = 
 The Fourth Panzer Army 's offensive forced Stavka to recalculate its intentions for Operation Saturn , and on 13 December Stalin and Stavka authorized the redeployment of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front , where it would be ready to be used against German forces on 15 December . This army had a strength of roughly 90 @,@ 000 soldiers , organized into three guards rifle corps ( the 1st , 13th and 2nd ) . Operation Saturn was redesigned into Operation Little Saturn , which limited the scope of the attack to breaking through the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear . The offensive was also changed from a southward push to a drive in a southeastern direction , and the start date was pushed back to 16 December . In the meantime , the 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces in the vicinity of the Alksay River , trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army . 
 The Soviet 1st and 3rd Guard Armies , in conjunction with the Soviet 6th Army , launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December . Despite early troubles due to stubborn resistance from Italian troops , the Red Army was able to partially overrun the Italian 8th Army by 18 December . The breakthrough <unk> if small and quickly <unk> proved a possible threat to Army Group Don 's left flank , while the city of Rostov was threatened by the 3rd Guards Army . This , and mainly heavy losses sustained by the German armor divisions forcing their way to the Myshkova river , forced Manstein to reconsider continuing the offensive . The German field marshal decided that he could not defend his left flank while also sustaining the attempt to relieve the 6th Army . Although the 6th Panzer Division was able to cross the Myshkova River by the night of 19 December , the LVII Panzer Corps had still not made major advances against increased Soviet opposition , despite the arrival of the 17th Panzer Division ; in fact , it seemed as if the corps would have to go on the defensive . Furthermore , the Soviet raid on <unk> managed to destroy the airfield and several dozen aircraft being used by the Luftwaffe to resupply forces inside the Stalingrad pocket , forcing Manstein to order the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the defensive , instead of reserving it to bolster his forces directed toward the breakthrough to Stalingrad . To make matters worse for the Germans , on 18 December Hitler refused to allow the German 6th Army to begin a breakout operation towards the rest of Army Group Don , despite pleas from Manstein . 
 = = = Collapse : 19 – 23 December = = = 
 On 19 December , Manstein sent his chief intelligence officer — Major <unk> — into Stalingrad to give General Paulus an accurate image of the strategic situation which had befallen Army Group Don . Paulus was not impressed , although he agreed that the best option continued to be an attempted breakout as early as possible . The 6th Army 's Chief of Staff — Major General Arthur Schmidt — argued that a breakout was unfeasible and instead suggested that Army Group Don take steps to better supply entrapped Axis forces by air . Despite agreeing with <unk> earlier , Paulus then decided that a breakout was out of the question given the 6th Army 's incapability to conduct it and Hitler 's express orders against it . Although that day the LVII Panzer Corps managed to breakthrough the Alksay River and drive within 48 km ( 30 mi ) of the southern edge of the 6th Army 's front , the entrapped German forces made no attempt to link up with the relieving forces . Adam makes the point the 6th Army tanks only had fuel to go 30 km , after which they would need fuel and ammunition flown in to go any further . Thereafter , the 6th Army simply did not have the strength to attempt a breakout , operating less than 70 serviceable tanks , with limited supplies , while its infantry were in no condition to attempt an attack in the blizzard which had developed over the past few days . 
 Manstein ordered the 6th Panzer Division to end its offensive and redeploy to the southern Chir River , to bolster German defenses there against the continuing Soviet offensive , on 23 December . By 24 December , the Fourth Panzer Army was in full retreat , returning to its starting position . The inability to breakthrough to the 6th Army , and the latter formation 's refusal to attempt a breakout , caused Operation Winter Storm to collapse on 24 December , as Army Group Don returned to the defensive . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the German relief effort defeated , Stavka was free to concentrate on the destruction of Axis forces in the Stalingrad pocket and the westward expansion of the Red Army 's Winter offensive . The Red Army was able to bring to bear almost 150 @,@ 000 personnel and 630 tanks against the retreating 4th Panzer Army and although Volsky 's 4th Mechanized Corps ( renamed 3rd Guard Mechanized Corps on 18 December 1942 ) was withdrawn to be refitted , the 51st Army , the 1st Guards Rifle and 7th Tank Corps struck at German units withdrawing between the <unk> and Aksai Rivers . In three days , the attacking Soviet units broke through the Romanian positions guarding the LVII Panzer Corps ' flank and threatened the 4th Panzer Army from the south , forcing the Germans to continue withdrawing to the southwest . All the while , the XLVIII Panzer Corps — led mainly by the 11th Panzer Division — strove to maintain its position along the Chir River . Despite success , the XLVIII Panzer Corps was rushed to the defense of Rostov as a Soviet breakthrough seemed imminent after the partial collapse of the Italian 8th Army . As the Red Army pursued the 4th Panzer Army toward the Aksai River and broke through the German defense on the banks of the Chir River , it also began to prepare for Operation Ring — the reduction of the forces in Stalingrad . 
 German forces in Stalingrad soon began to run out of supplies , some soldiers were forced to live on horse meat . By the end of 1942 , the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over 65 km ( 40 mi ) , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak . Hitler 's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army . The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue in its efforts to cut @-@ off German forces in the Caucasus , which would begin in the middle of January . On the other hand , the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops , which affected Soviet operations on other sectors . 
 = George Tucker ( politician ) = 
 George Tucker ( August 20 , 1775 – April 10 , 1861 ) was an American attorney , politician , historian , author , and educator . His literary works include the first fiction of colonial life in Virginia and another which is among the nation 's earliest science fictions . Tucker also published the first comprehensive biography of Thomas Jefferson , as well as a history of the United States . 
 Tucker was the son of the first mayor of Hamilton , Bermuda . He immigrated to Virginia at age 20 , was educated at the College of William and Mary , and was admitted to the bar . His first marriage ended with the death of his childless wife Mary Farley in 1799 ; he remarried and had six children with wife Maria Carter , who died at age 38 in 1823 . His third wife , of 30 years , was Louisa Thompson who died in 1858 . 
 Aside from his law practice , Tucker wrote distinctive monologues for various publications . His topics ranged widely from the conceptual to the technical — from slavery , suffrage , and morality to intracoastal navigation , wages , and banking . He was elected in 1816 to the Virginia House of Delegates for one term , and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825 . From his youth until early middle age , Tucker 's lofty social lifestyle was often profligate , and occasionally scandalous . Nevertheless , upon completion of his congressional term , his eloquent publications led Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to extend to him an appointment to serve as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the newly founded University of Virginia ; he accepted and held that post until 1845 . 
 After retiring , Tucker relocated to Philadelphia and continued to research , and expound upon , a variety of subjects including monetary policy and socio @-@ economics until his death in Virginia at the age of 86 . 
 = = Family and early life in Bermuda = = 
 George Tucker was born in Bermuda at St. George 's Island on August 20 , 1775 . He was the second son of Daniel and Elizabeth Tucker , who were distant cousins . Daniel and his brothers established a mercantile partnership with a fleet of vessels shipping goods to America , Newfoundland , and the West Indies . Daniel was also a founder and Mayor of the port of Hamilton , Bermuda . 
 Tucker was educated in Bermuda primarily by a tutor engaged from Great Britain and also by Josiah Meigs . His assigned reading included Tom Jones , The Vicar of Wakefield , and Arabian Nights , among the mainstays of an education on the American continent . At age fifteen he helped form a literary club , the <unk> Society ; Meigs later became a professor and reprised the name of the club at Yale . Tucker at age 16 began to read the law under a successful and prosperous lawyer , George <unk> . At <unk> 's death , the firm 's clients urged Tucker to assume their representation , but feeling quite unqualified , he declined , deciding to begin plans for a career in the United States . 
 = = Immigration to America , education and first marriage = = 
 Shortly after his mother 's death in 1795 , Tucker sailed for Philadelphia , intending to continue his legal education in the United States . He briefly considered London for his studies but discarded the idea , in order to optimize his chances for " political advancement " . After a free @-@ spending time with other <unk> in the capital city , he ran out of funds , and proceeded to Williamsburg , Virginia to seek advice and borrow money from his famous cousin St. George Tucker , a maneuver he would repeat . He was admitted at the College of William & Mary , where he studied law under St. George and graduated after two years . Tucker was pleased to find the academic work undemanding , and his social life entertaining , as he gained access to the finer homes through his cousin . 
 Tucker traveled to New York and Philadelphia and , with letters of introduction in hand , was able to further acquaint himself with his adopted country and meet noted leaders , including George Washington and New York governors John Jay and George Clinton . Despite his enjoyment of this high society , he returned to Williamsburg and there began a courtship with Mary Byrd Farley , who was possessed of much charm and fortune , and to whom he proposed . Though he had initially preferred to delay the wedding until he had passed the bar , he gave in to his heart 's desire , borrowed the needed funds from an uncle , and they married in October of 1797 . To help Mary , who was chronically ill with consumption , Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda . The stay there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed his desire to be in Virginia . They returned to Williamsburg , setting up residence , with his intention to read for the bar exam . Except for trips to North Carolina to collect rents on his wife 's property , Tucker avoided his work , attended horse races in Fredericksburg , and frequented fashionable watering places with friends and family ; he made Thomas Jefferson 's acquaintance at this time . Mary never recovered from her infirmities , and died childless in 1799 . 
 Mary 's death complicated Tucker 's facile life , as her considerable estate was fraught with legal problems . It included a sugar plantation , thousands of acres of land , and a share in the Dismal Swamp Company . After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua , and on to Martinique and Bermuda , he returned to Williamsburg and then determined his future was in the nearby state capital of Richmond , Virginia as a practicing attorney . Tucker ultimately succeeded in salvaging only part of his late wife 's fortune . 
 = = Richmond society , second marriage , slavery and politics = = 
 Tucker arrived in Richmond with a letter of introduction from St. George to Governor James Monroe . His cousin 's letter is said to have accurately portrayed Tucker 's character and also foretold his future there : " To the best qualities of the heart he unites an excellent understanding , which has been well cultivated , and a very comprehensive knowledge of the world ; nature has blessed him with a most exuberant flow of spirits , which sometimes betray him into acts of levity ... " Tucker effectively entered the desired social circles in Richmond , bolstered by a well @-@ furnished home near the Governor 's own , and soon could count among his acquaintances not only the Governor ( whom Tucker called " that slow dull man " ) , but also George Wythe , Edmund Pendleton , George Hay and most notably Charles Carter ( 1765 – 1829 ) , who introduced him to daughter Maria Ball Carter — the granddaughter of Betty Washington Lewis . They soon fell in love , and in February 1802 he married Maria , age seventeen and pregnant . 
 While Tucker began writing for publication , as an attorney he was initially deficient , being disabled by his fear of speaking in the courtroom ; he later gained the requisite self @-@ confidence . Tucker became a founding member of the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society in Richmond , an effort led by John Marshall and John Floyd ; Tucker was named to the Society 's Standing Committee . 
 Politically , Tucker was a Jeffersonian Republican , delighted at the split in the Federalists between John Adams and Alexander Hamilton , and joined in the resentment toward Federalist attempts to " appoint a president " by party caucus . But in time he departed his near @-@ Jacobin leanings and became a pro @-@ bank Republican . He once gave a speech in support of a Federalist in a local election , and a staunch Republican , Lewis Harvey , called him a party traitor and liar . In reaction , the often hot @-@ tempered Tucker took a swing at him but missed due the intervention of a neutral party . Assuming his challenge unsuccessful , Tucker demanded satisfaction which Harvey accepted . Tucker carefully arranged the duel , stipulating an extraordinary distance in paces , so as to diminish the superior marksmanship of his opponent . Fortunately for Tucker the duel was avoided at the last moment — though not before he had completed his will and arranged his estate for his expecting wife . Their first child , Daniel George , was born November 23 , 1802 . 
 = = = Positions on slavery = = = 
 Tucker sought out the foremost authors in Richmond to advance his interest in literature and the arts , and soon published an essay entitled Letter to a Member of the General Assembly of Virginia on the Subject of the Late Conspiracy of the Slaves with a Proposal for Their Colonization ( 1801 ) , proposing a remedy to slavery . Tucker 's Letter expressed his early opposition to slavery , portraying it as unproductive and uneconomical . He wrote that no country " can attain great heights in manufactures , commerce or agriculture where one half of the community labours unwillingly , and the other half does not labour at all . " He recommended that revenues be secured ( with a tax on slaveholders ) and used to establish a colony for the slaves west of the Mississippi . He further asserted that the slave 's inferiority was a result of time and circumstance , and not natural causes . 
 In the 1820s however , Tucker 's views of slavery changed notably with personal experience , and profit , realized in his purchase and sale of slaves for his account and that of his father @-@ in @-@ law , Charles Carter . For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical , then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial , commercially oriented , society was inevitable . Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery , he predicted its eventual death . Indeed , he freed his own slaves in 1845 , 16 years prior to his death . 
 = = Scandal , rustic life and valor = = 
 = = = <unk> lottery = = = 
 Tucker 's law practice could not support the expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits , which included gambling at cards and races , and he proceeded to waste the capital from Mary Tucker 's estate . He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal . In 1803 , he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery to raise funds for the Richmond Academy . He allegedly bought several chances for himself and , as remaining chances dwindled , resold some of them for a profit ; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner . He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum . 
 Tucker was asked for reimbursement , and after negotiation , paid it in part , borrowing the remainder from members of the academy board . He also acted as custodian of other funds , blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation . Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly . Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing , the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond . Meanwhile , Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter , Eleanor Rosalie , on May 4 , 1804 . 
 = = = Rural settings = = = 
 Tucker relocated his family in 1806 , including a newborn daughter Maria , to the Carters ' home in Frederick County , Virginia , and attempted to put his financial house in order . Business required his frequent return to Richmond , and on one occasion he was arrested there for a delinquency owed to a loan company . The immediate problem was solved with the intervention of St. George . Tucker economized for two years , living a rural life with the Carters and other family and was able to purchase a home near the Dan River . 
 In May 1808 the family moved to " Woodbridge " in Pittsylvania County , where daughter Eliza was born in December . Maria was then faced with rearing four children in more rural , less favorable living conditions . For his part , Tucker was disappointed with an absence of the desired social life . While he thought all his neighbors " friendly and civil " , they were also " unpolished and plain " . With an increased effort in his law practice , Tucker discovered more success and acquired more clients , spread across four counties . He was also elected Commonwealth 's Attorney for Pittsylvania county . Maria gave birth to daughter Lelia in October 1810 and Harriett in May 1813 .

 In 1811 , Tucker was in Richmond to attend a benefit performance , and put his life in danger during the infamous Richmond Theatre fire . The event , including a play entitled The Father , or Family Feuds and a pantomime afterwards named Raymond and Agnes , was held in December . It being Christmas time , the auditorium was packed — with 518 adults and 80 children . 
 In his autobiography Tucker relates that , " The play was over ... and there appearing to be much delay in bringing on the afterpiece ... I had fortunately quitted the [ play ] house while it was on fire , tho ' I did not know the fact ... but the cry of fire prevented my reaching my lodgings , and hurried me back to witness a spectacle of human woe which I have never seen equalled . I was instrumental in saving several females from the flames . " In the process , he suffered a head injury when struck by a falling timber , and was left with a permanent scar above his eye . The tragedy took the lives of 72 people , including the sitting Governor of Virginia George William Smith . Victims also included many of the upper echelons in Richmond society . 
 = = Elective office and early writing = = 
 Tucker 's maritime roots in Bermuda instilled an interest in navigation , and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures of North Carolina and Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke , Dan , and Staunton Rivers , in order to avoid inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond . This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County , which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816 . Tucker and Maria then suffered the first loss of a child , Harriett , from whooping cough at age three . 
 Tucker continued his work in literature along with that in the law , and in 1814 – 1815 the Philadelphia Port Folio published a series of his essays entitled Thoughts of a Hermit . Financial success was for once his as a result of these endeavors ; he also realized profits from land sales near the Dan River , and the sale of Woodbridge when the family moved again , to Lynchburg , Virginia in 1818 . 
 The death of daughter Harriett had been painful enough , but Maria 's depression became uncontrollable and chronic when daughter Rosalie died unexpectedly at age 14 in 1818 . Also during this period Maria 's father , Charles Carter , encountered his own financial setbacks , and prevailed upon Tucker for assistance ; Tucker , with the help of Lawrence Lewis , was able to settle the Carters at " <unk> " , sharing part of the profits from Charles ' management there . 
 With financial success came more clients and opportunities to serve his community . Tucker received many cases in debt collection , and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul 's Episcopal Church . Tucker was also elected to serve in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825 , representing the Lynchburg area in the 16th , 17th , and 18th United States Congresses . His financial largess was short @-@ lived , as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington , not to mention the increased expenses of a larger immediate family . 
 Though Tucker and Maria were warned against her having more children in her vulnerable physical and emotional state , she again conceived , and died in pregnancy in February 1823 . In the carriage to Washington after the funeral , Tucker muffled his face with a handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to <unk> . Maria 's death indeed weighed heavily upon him , as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails . He also was much concerned for his son Daniel 's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son 's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia . 
 Due in part to these personal trials , he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia 's interests , with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record . He did serve as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War . There are notable disparities between Tucker 's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later . In his essay On Instructions to Representatives , he provides an explanation in political theory — an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another , in compliance with constituent preferences . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Near the end of Tucker 's third congressional term in 1824 , Thomas Jefferson presented him with an offer on behalf of the fledgling University of Virginia , sanctioned by Trustees James Madison and Joseph C. Cabell , to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy . The offer met the school 's desire to appoint a non @-@ Federalist to the post , and Tucker 's connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection . Another factor was Tucker 's recent 1822 Essays on Various Subjects of Taste , Morals , and National Policy , which included papers from the Port Folio . Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson , saying they were " among the best answers to the charges of our national ... backwardness . " Tucker 's selection may as well have been an accommodation to some of the school 's opponents , including Episcopalians , Federalists , and notable western Virginians , many of whom were friends of Tucker 's . Presumably , his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant . 
 From Tucker 's perspective , the offer was most opportune , as he considered his congressional seat in jeopardy , as well as his pocketbook . The professorship included a steady income , extra fees from philosophy students , tenure , and rent @-@ free quarters on the University Lawn . Tucker accepted the offer , effective in 1825 , and also was chosen chairman of the faculty . As well as his primary discipline , he also assumed charge of the subjects of Political Economics and Rhetoric for the University . He was content with family life in Charlottesville , Virginia , though he " found solitude unbearable " after Maria 's death and began an earnest search for a wife , whom he found in Louisa A. Thompson , a widow from Baltimore . In their thirty years together Tucker later said he had found " the same warmth and devoted affection with which I have been previously blest " . 
 Tucker 's effectiveness in the lecture hall is not objectively certain , and he may well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as he had in the courtroom previously . His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues , and he published numerous works — including one satire , a fiction , three books on economics and statistics , a Jefferson biography , as well as two pamphlets . Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum ( 1829 – 1830 ) in which he published voluminous writings ; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines .

 = = = Politics = = = 
 Some of Tucker 's writing reflected a growing political skepticism of the workings of democracy beginning with the 1796 election . By the late 1820s , he was persuaded that political leadership positions should be reserved primarily for prosperous people with a tangible , and taxable , interest in government . Andrew Jackson 's election in 1828 was for Tucker an example of the " triumph of democratic demagoguery which could bring about class warfare . " Tucker worked arduously in Virginia to oppose Jackson and was a solid supporter of Henry Clay , with his second choice being Daniel Webster . 
 He opposed universal suffrage , and favored limiting the franchise to half of free men , and allowing slaveholders to cast votes on behalf of three @-@ fifths of their slaves ; he also argued in favor of eliminating the secret ballot . Tucker also promoted the Second National Bank and strongly criticized Jackson for <unk> it . 
 = = = Works of fiction = = = 
 Tucker 's premier literary work was The Valley of Shenandoah ( 1824 ) , the first fictional tale of life in Virginia . In relating the downfall of an aristocratic family in the Commonwealth 's valley , it drew upon his personal witness of the financial ruin of his in @-@ laws , the family of Charles Carter , and described the inability of an estate owner to manage his monetary affairs , such as he had personally experienced . Tucker further used the novel 's characters , again reflecting personal experience , to emphasize that happiness in love and life resulted from the moderation of one 's passions . The Valley stressed Tucker 's professorial objective , that history must inform the reader with " the progress of society and the arts of civilization ; with the advancement and decline of literature , laws , manners and commerce . " He also conveyed through the fiction his view that gentility was independent of wealth , that the relationship between masters and slaves was imbued with mutual trust and happiness , and that the strong currents of socio @-@ economic change were on the whole beneficent . 
 Using the pseudonym Joseph <unk> , in 1827 he wrote the satire A Voyage to the Moon : With Some Account of the Manners and Customs , Science and Philosophy , of the People of <unk> , and Other Lunarians . It is one of the earliest American works of science fiction , and was relatively successful , earning Tucker $ 100 from the sale of 1000 copies . It received positive reviews from the American Quarterly Review and the Western Monthly Review . Tucker uses The Voyage to ridicule the social manners , religion and professions of some of his colleagues , and to criticize some erroneous scientific methods and results apparent to him at the time . 
 = = = First biography of Jefferson = = = 
 In 1836 , Tucker completed his manuscript of a comprehensive biography , The Life of Thomas Jefferson , Third President of the United States . He sent his composition to James Madison for his approval , as the latter had assisted in its formation . Tucker included for his sanction a proposed dedication to the recipient . Madison replied with his full approbation and signature on June 26 , 1836 , just hours before his death the following day . 
 This premier study of the life of Jefferson was published in two volumes the following year , and received complimentary review in the Edinburgh Review from Lord Brougham , as " a very valuable addition to the stock of our political and historical knowledge . In it , Professor Tucker does not always accord with the illustrious subject of his biography . The work , indeed , manifests a laudable desire to do justice , and to decide impartially on contested topics ; and hence , perhaps , it failed to give satisfaction to the ardent supporters , as well as to the bitter opponents , of Mr. Jefferson . "

 Tucker considered a trip abroad would enhance his insight and resume generally , and specifically prepare him for a possible , though not likely , diplomatic appointment . He expected there was much to be learned for his country 's benefit in the British factories , great estates and crowded cities . With his finances in order and a three @-@ month leave from the university , in 1839 he made a trip to Great Britain and after some time in Shakespeare country , Stratford @-@ Upon @-@ Avon , he settled in Liverpool . He did not succeed in making all the expected social connections , with the exception of the 1st Earl of Leicester and his wife , with whom he frequently discussed politics and agriculture . Though admiring the succinct debates in Parliament , he found Queen Victoria 's procession " more fit to amuse a child than one of my age " . On the whole he found conversation did not come easy with the British , and concluded " there were more churls in England than in all of Europe besides . " This journey , along with his interest in the doctrines of Thomas Robert Malthus on populace , inspired Tucker to expound upon the mixed blessings of a prospective urbanized world . Some of his hypotheses were included in The Progress of the United States in Population and Wealth ( Boston , 1843 ) . This work gained him one of his proudest honors , a membership in the Statistical Society of Paris . 
 His enthusiasm for teaching at the university ebbed in his final years there . He was also perturbed by an increase in religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement , which he mildly protested . Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors , and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $ 1500 to $ 1000 . Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life , he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary . 
 = = = Resignation from faculty and relocation = = = 
 With the death of his last contemporary on the faculty in 1845 , Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia , where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries , meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison . Nevertheless , there were drawbacks – for one , the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him — he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville . He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had , by law , been exiled from Virginia , and shortly thereafter died . As well , the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there . 
 Social life in the urban setting did not initially live up to his expectations , but after a time his writing and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void . He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics . He as well engaged in a debate , as antagonist of Malthusian population theory with proponent Alexander Everett .

 In 1856 , Tucker completed his four @-@ volume History of the United States , From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress , in 1841 . Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work : " To aid him in the execution of his work , as [ Tucker ] himself remarks , it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many , who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution , and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded . The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841 , which is as far as Tucker thought he could prudently go . " The work includes a brief review of slavery , in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson 's decades @-@ old view in his Notes on the State of Virginia ( 1781 ) , that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Though Tucker may have displayed in his old age " a spirit of pugnacity becoming earlier years " , as one critic claimed , such a nature was not in evidence with his family . He corresponded positively and frequently with his children and vacationed with them in the summers in Virginia and New York . He appears to have been consistent in his devotion to his family , which was returned by them in kind . And his exchanges with them were replete with a concern for their financial well being . Musing his own past errors , he told them that " except for the loss of friends , a want of prudence in money matters has contributed nine tenths of the pain and vexation of [ my ] life " . 
 Even after the death of his wife Louisa in 1858 , Tucker 's vitality persisted and , not long before the American Civil War began , in January 1861 he journeyed south through Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia to Alabama to visit a friend in Mobile . In reaction to Georgia 's secession from the union , speaking from his lingering southern loyalty , he commented , " it seems a poor remedy for an unpopular President " . He thought the overriding need for " a wise provident government " would bring the southern states back under a modified constitution . But after some time spent in the south , he was compelled to say the people " seemed to be crazed in the fancies of imaginary evils and their strange remedies . " Indeed , Tucker 's youthful loyalties to the agrarian south had in his own maturation given way to a belief in the necessity and value of a commercial @-@ industrial society . Nationalism had become the foundation of his politics over statism , and he could not understand why a compromise in lieu of war would not be embraced . 
 Tucker sustained head injuries at Mobile Bay when , awaiting his ship 's departure for return to the north , he was struck by a large bale of cotton being loaded on board . He was moved to the home of daughter Eleanor and husband George Rives in Albemarle County , Virginia , where he died on April 10 , 1861 , two days prior to the Battle of Fort Sumter and the beginning of the American Civil War . He was buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery .

 = Hurricane Irene ( 2005 ) = 
 Hurricane Irene was a long @-@ lived Cape Verde @-@ type Atlantic hurricane during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 and crossed the Atlantic , turning northward around Bermuda before being absorbed by an extratropical while situated southeast of Newfoundland . Irene persisted for 14 days as a tropical system , the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season . It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record @-@ breaking season . 
 Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength . After almost dissipating on August 10 , Irene peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16 before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system late on August 18 . Although there were initial fears of a landfall in the United States due to uncertainty in predicting the storm 's track , Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage ; however , swells up to 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) and strong rip currents resulted in one fatality in Long Beach , New York . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 1 , initially weakening due to cooler sea surface temperatures . It moved westward and passed near Cape Verde , where convection started to increase . The system became more organized and developed into Tropical Depression Nine on the afternoon of August 4 , 690 miles ( 1100 km ) southwest of the Cape Verde Islands . Early on August 5 , the depression abruptly turned to the northwest into an area of higher wind shear , causing some computer models to predict that the depression would dissipate , while others predicted steady strengthening . The sudden threat to the storm 's existence prompted National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) forecaster Dr Lixion Avila to comment , " How little we know about the genesis of tropical cyclones . " Despite the unfavorable conditions in its vicinity and its poor organization , Tropical Depression Nine continued to strengthen , becoming Tropical Storm Irene on August 7 . 
 Because Irene was in an environment laden with dry air and high shear , it soon weakened to a tropical depression , on August 8 . On the morning of August 10 , as it was passing north of the Lesser Antilles , Irene nearly dissipated into a remnant low , but forecasters predicted with " very low confidence " that the storm would survive . Contrary to these expectations , warmer waters and less wind shear allowed Irene to become gradually more organized while south of Bermuda , and it became a tropical storm once again early on August 11 . 
 Due to uncertainties about how the region 's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene , the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm 's future . Some of the models predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina , while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate . The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward , which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15 . Soon after , upper @-@ level shear weakened greatly , and Irene rapidly intensified , first to a hurricane , then to its peak strength as a 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) Category 2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 16 , while located 350 miles ( 560 km ) northeast of Bermuda ; at the same time it also attained minimum pressure of 970 mbar . Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane , they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude . 
 Irene entered a region of increased wind shear and began to weaken , and as a result it was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 18 , when it was 520 miles ( 830 km ) south of Cape Race , Newfoundland . All convection within 230 mi ( 370 km ) of the cyclone dissipated on August 18 . Irene was subsequently absorbed by an extratropical cyclone later that day . Irene lasted for 14 days as a tropical system , the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season . 
 = = Impact , records and naming = = 
 As Hurricane Irene stayed well away from land , no coastal warnings or watches were issued for it . Despite Irene 's long life there were no reports of tropical storm force winds affecting ships . There were no damage or fatalities as a result of Irene . However , the hurricane generated strong waves and increased the risk of rip currents along the East Coast of the United States . Many beaches in New Jersey restricted swimming activities , and lifeguards at one beach performed more than a hundred rescues over a three @-@ day period . Waves along the coastline of New York reached 4 to 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) . On August 14 , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy drowned after being caught in a rip current near Long Beach , New York on August 14 . His body was recovered on August 16 after washing ashore . 
 When Tropical Storm Irene formed on August 7 , it was the earliest date for the formation of the ninth tropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season , beating the previous record held by a storm in the 1936 season by 13 days . This storm also marked the fifth occasion the name Irene had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic . Due to the lack of effects on land from Hurricane Irene , the name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and was reused in the 2011 Atlantic season ; however , due to the extreme damage caused by the storm , it was retired in 2012 and was replaced with the name Irma . 
 = Demographics of New Zealand = 
 The demographics of New Zealand encompass the gender , ethnic , religious , geographic , and economic backgrounds of the 4 @.@ 6 million people living in New Zealand . New Zealanders , informally known as " Kiwis " , predominantly live in urban areas on the North Island . The five largest cities are Auckland ( with one @-@ third of the country 's population ) , Christchurch ( in the South Island , the largest island of the New Zealand archipelago ) , Wellington , Hamilton and Tauranga . Few New Zealanders live on New Zealand 's smaller islands . Waiheke Island ( near Auckland ) is easily the most populated smaller island with 8 @,@ 900 residents , while Great Barrier Island , the Chatham and Pitt Islands and Stewart Island each have populations below 1 @,@ 000 . New Zealand is part of a realm and most people born in the realm 's external territories of Tokelau , the Ross Dependency , the Cook Islands and Niue are entitled to New Zealand passports . In 2006 , more people who identified themselves with these islands lived in New Zealand than on the Islands themselves . 
 The majority of New Zealand 's population is of European descent ( 69 percent identify as " New Zealand European " ) , with the indigenous Māori being the largest minority ( 14 @.@ 6 percent ) , followed by Asians ( 9 @.@ 2 percent ) and non @-@ Māori Pacific Islanders ( 6 @.@ 9 percent ) . This is reflected in immigration , with most new migrants coming from Britain and Ireland , although the numbers from Asia are increasing . In 2001 an estimated 460 @,@ 000 New Zealanders lived abroad , mostly in Australia , representing nearly one @-@ quarter of NZ 's highly skilled workforce . The largest Māori iwi is Ngapuhi with 122 @,@ 211 people or 24 percent of the Māori population . Auckland is the most ethnically diverse region in New Zealand with 56 @.@ 5 percent identifying as Europeans , 18 @.@ 9 percent as Asian , 11 @.@ 1 percent as Māori and 14 @.@ 4 percent as other Pacific Islanders . The ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years is more diverse ( 72 percent European , 24 percent Māori , 12 percent Pacific and 10 percent Asian ) than the population aged 65 years or older ( 91 percent European , 5 percent Māori , 4 percent Asian and 2 percent Pacific ) . Recent increases in interracial marriages have resulted in more people identifying with more than one ethnic group . 
 Estimates based on the 2013 census in New Zealand classify 14 @.@ 90 % of the population of New Zealand as Maori , 11 @.@ 80 % of the population as Asian ( deriving from various nations in Asia ) , 7 @.@ 40 % as of Pacific Islander origin ( including from the Cook Islands , Niue , and Tokelau , all of which are dependent states of New Zealand in the Pacific ) , and 1 @.@ 20 % as individuals of Middle @-@ Eastern , Latin American , and African descent . Approximately three @-@ quarters of the population of New Zealand during the census were of European ethnicity . 
 English , Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages , with English predominant . New Zealand English is mostly non @-@ rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English , with a common exception being the centralisation of the short i . The Maori language ( te reo ) has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 4 @.@ 1 percent of the population . New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification . In the adult population 14 @.@ 2 percent have a bachelor 's degree or higher , 30 @.@ 4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22 @.@ 4 percent have no formal qualification . As of the 2013 census , just under half the population identify as Christians , with Hinduism , Buddhism and Islam being the most significant minority religions . New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40 % of the population do not have a religion . 
 Farming is a major occupation in New Zealand , although more people are employed as sales assistants . Most New Zealanders earn wage or salary income , with a median personal income in 2006 of $ 24 @,@ 400 . Unemployment stood at 6 @.@ 0 percent in May 2014 . 
 = = New Zealanders = = 
 While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander , the informal " Kiwi " is commonly used both internationally and by locals . The name derives from the kiwi , a native flightless bird , which is the national symbol of New Zealand . The Māori loanword Pākehā usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent , although some reject this appellation , and some Māori use it to refer to all non @-@ Polynesian New Zealanders . Most people born in New Zealand or one of the realm 's external territories ( Tokelau , the Ross Dependency , the Cook Islands and Niue ) before 2006 are New Zealand citizens . Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards . 
 = = Population = = 
 In 2014 New Zealand has an estimated population of just over 4 @.@ 5 million , up from the 4 @,@ 027 @,@ 947 recorded in the 2006 census . The median child birthing age was 30 and the fertility rate is 2 @.@ 1 births per woman in 2010 . In Māori populations the median age is 26 and fertility rate 2 @.@ 8 . In 2010 the Age @-@ standardized mortality rate was 3 @.@ 8 deaths per 1000 ( down from 4 @.@ 8 in 2000 ) and the infant mortality rate for the total population was 5 @.@ 1 deaths per 1000 live births . The life expectancy of a New Zealand child born in 2008 was 82 @.@ 4 years for females , and 78 @.@ 4 years for males . Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline . In 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5 @.@ 3 million , the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older rising from 18 percent to 29 percent . During early migration in 1858 , New Zealand had 131 males for every 100 females , but following changes in migration patterns and the modern longevity advantage of women , females came to outnumber males in 1971 . As of 2012 there are 0 @.@ 99 males per female , with males dominating under 15 years and females dominating in the 65 years and older range . 
 = = Geographic locations = = 
 Over three @-@ quarters of New <unk> population live in the North Island ( 76 percent ) with one @-@ third of the total population living in the Auckland region . This region is also the fastest growing , accounting for 46 percent of New Zealand 's total population growth . Most Māori live in the North Island ( 87 percent ) , although less than a quarter ( 24 percent ) live in Auckland . New Zealand is a predominantly urban country , with 86 percent of the population living in an urban area . About 72 percent of the population live in the 16 main urban areas ( population of 30 @,@ 000 or more ) and 53 percent live in the four largest cities of Auckland , Christchurch , Wellington , and Hamilton . 
 Approximately 14 percent of the population live in four different categories of rural areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand . About 18 percent of the rural population live in areas that have a high urban influence ( roughly 12 @.@ 9 people per square kilometre ) , many working in the main urban area . Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6 @.@ 5 people per square kilometre account for 26 percent of the rural population . Areas with low urban influence where the majority of the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42 percent of the rural population . Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14 percent of the rural population . 
 The vast majority of the population live on the main North and South Islands , with New Zealand 's major inhabited smaller islands being Waiheke Island ( 7 @,@ 689 ) , Great Barrier Island ( 850 ) , Chatham and Pitt Islands ( 609 ) , and Stewart Island ( 402 ) . In 2006 , 15 @,@ 342 people were residents of the Cook Islands , with two thirds living on Rarotonga , and the other third spread over the other 14 islands . The resident population of Tokelau and Niue was 1 @,@ 466 and 1 @,@ 625 respectively in 2006 . At the time 58 @,@ 008 Cook Islanders , 22 @,@ 476 <unk> and 6 @,@ 819 <unk> lived in New Zealand . 
 = = Migration = = 
 East Polynesians were the first people to reach New Zealand about 1280 , followed by the early European explorers , notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline . Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony , immigrants were predominantly from Britain , Ireland and Australia . Due to restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies limitations were placed on non @-@ European immigrants . During the gold rush period ( 1858 @-@ 1880s ) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields . Apart from British , there were Irish , North Germans , Scandinavians , Italian and many Chinese . The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866 . By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland . From 1900 there was also significant Dutch , Dalmatian , Italian , and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia , North America , South America and South Africa . Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased . In 2008 – 09 , a target of 45 @,@ 000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service ( plus a 5 @,@ 000 tolerance ) . 
 Just over 25 percent of New Zealand 's population at the 2013 Census was born overseas , up from 23 percent in 2006 and 20 percent in 2001 . Over half ( 51 @.@ 6 percent ) of New Zealand 's overseas @-@ born population lives in the Auckland Region , including 72 percent of the country 's Pacific Island @-@ born population , 64 percent of its Asian @-@ born population , and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African- born population . In the late 2000s , Asia overtook the British Isles as the largest source of overseas migrants ; today around 32 percent of overseas @-@ born New Zealand residents were born in Asia ( mainly China , India , the Philippines and South Korea ) compared to 26 percent born in the UK and Ireland . The number of fee @-@ paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s , with more than 20 @,@ 000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002 . 
 To be eligible for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health , provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English . Migrants working in some occupations ( mainly health ) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before they can work within that area . Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa , while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa . Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit for two years and are then eligible to apply for residency . Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer , cultural or sporting talent , looking for work where there has been a long @-@ term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency . 
 While most New Zealanders live in New Zealand , there is also a significant diaspora abroad , estimated as of 2001 at over 460 @,@ 000 or 14 percent of the international total of New Zealand @-@ born . Of these , 360 @,@ 000 , over three @-@ quarters of the New Zealand @-@ born population residing outside of New Zealand , live in Australia . Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are concentrated in other English @-@ speaking countries , specifically the United Kingdom , the United States and Canada , with smaller numbers located elsewhere . Nearly one quarter of New Zealand 's highly skilled workers live overseas , mostly in Australia and Britain , more than any other developed nation . However many educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries have recently migrated to New Zealand . A common pathway for New Zealanders to move to the UK is through a job offer via the Tier 2 ( General ) visa , which grants a 3 @-@ year initial stay in the country and can later be extended with three more years . After 5 years the person can apply for permanent residency . Another popular option is the UK Working Holiday visa , also known as " Youth Mobility Scheme " ( <unk> ) , which grants New Zealanders 2 @-@ year rights to live and work in the UK . 
 = = Ethnicity = = 
 New Zealand is a multiethnic society , and home to people of many different national origins . Originally composed solely of the Māori who arrived in the thirteenth century , the ethnic makeup of the population has been dominated since the mid 19th century by New Zealanders of European descent . Settlers brought diseases for which the Māori population had no immunity - by the 1890s , the Māori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre @-@ contact . From about 1820 , a large number of children born were of mixed parentage , especially in the North of New Zealand where chiefs forced huge numbers of slave women and many children into prostitution with visiting sailors . One French captain described a chief forcing upwards of 150 girls and young women on his crew of 80 . Most New Zealanders are of British and Irish ancestry , with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as French , Dutch , Scandinavian and German . In the 2006 census , 67 @.@ 6 percent identified ethnically as European and 14 @.@ 6 percent as Māori . Other major ethnic groups include Asian ( 9 @.@ 2 percent ) and Pacific peoples ( 6 @.@ 9 percent ) , while 11 @.@ 1 percent identified themselves simply as a " New Zealander " ( or similar ) and 1 percent identified with other ethnicities . This contrasts with 1961 , when the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92 percent European and 7 percent Māori , with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 percent . 
 During the 2013 census in New Zealand , it was estimated that 14 @.@ 90 % of the population of New Zealand were Maori , 11 @.@ 80 % of the population were Asians ( deriving from various nations in Asia ) , 7 @.@ 40 % were of Pacific Islander origin ( including from the Cook Islands , Niue , and Tokelau , all of which are dependent states of New Zealand in the Pacific ) , and 1 @.@ 20 % were individuals of Middle @-@ Eastern , Latin American , and African descent . 
 The largest Māori iwi is Ngapuhi with 122 @,@ 211 people ( or 18 @.@ 97 per cent ) of the Māori population . The next largest iwi are Ngāti <unk> , Ngāti <unk> , Ngāi Tahu / Kāi Tahu , Te Arawa , Ngāti <unk> , Ngāti Maniapoto , Waikato and <unk> . A total of 102 @,@ 366 people ( or 15 @.@ 90 per cent ) of Māori descent did not know their iwi . A group of Māori migrated to the Chatham Islands and developed their distinct Moriori culture . The Moriori population was decimated , first , by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and , second , by Taranaki Māori , with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full @-@ blooded Moriori dying in 1933 . People identifying as having Moriori descents have increased in number in recent years , from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006 . 
 Auckland is the most ethnically diverse region in New Zealand with 56 @.@ 5 percent identifying as Europeans , 18 @.@ 9 percent as Asian , 11 @.@ 1 percent as Māori and 14 @.@ 4 percent as other Pacific Islanders . Recent increases in interracial marriages has resulted in the New Zealand population of Māori , Asian and Pacific Islander descent growing at a higher rate than those of European descent . In 2006 10 @.@ 4 percent of people , identified with more than one ethnic group in 2006 , compared with 9 @.@ 0 percent in 2001 . The ethnic diversity of New Zealand is projected to increase . Europeans ( including " New Zealanders " ) will remain the largest group , although it is predicted to fall to 70 percent in 2026 . The Asian , Pacific and Māori groups are the fastest growing and will increase to 3 @.@ 4 percent , 10 percent and 16 percent respectively . The ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years at 30 June 2006 was 72 percent European , 24 percent Māori , 12 percent Pacific and 10 percent Asian . The population aged 65 years or older consisted of 91 percent European , 5 percent Māori , 4 percent Asian and 2 percent Pacific . 
 The maps below show the percentages of people in each census area unit identifying themselves as European , Māori , Asian , or Pacific Islander ( as defined by Statistics New Zealand ) . As people could identify themselves with multiple groups , percentages are not cumulative . 
 = = Language = = 
 English is the predominant language in New Zealand , spoken by 98 percent of the population . New Zealand English is mostly non @-@ rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago . It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart . In New Zealand English the short i ( as in kit ) has become centralised , leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like " <unk> and chups " to the Australian ear . The words rarely and really , reel and real , doll and dole , pull and pool , witch and which , and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones . Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown , thrown and mown using two syllables , whereas groan , throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable . New Zealanders often reply to a question or emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation at the end of the sentence . 
 From 1880 Māori MPs in parliament were keen that Māori should be taught in English rather than Māori . At that time missionary schools still taught Māori . This trend was further enforced by the Young Maori Party of the early 20th century which consisted of highly qualified Western educated Māori graduates such as <unk> and Ngata who believed that learning English would help Māori integrate into the modern world . After WW2 Māori , who had previously lived mainly in isolated rural areas migrated into urban areas where there were few Māori speakers . Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language ( te reo Māori ) in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas . It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation , being declared an official language in 1987 , and is spoken by 4 @.@ 1 percent of the population . There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels , the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime @-@ time content delivered in Māori . Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years . Samoan is the most widely spoken non @-@ official language ( 2 @.@ 3 percent ) , followed by French , Hindi , Yue and Northern Chinese . New Zealand Sign Language is used by approximately 28 @,@ 000 people and was made New Zealand 's third official language in 2006 . 
 = = Education = = 
 Education follows the three @-@ tier model , which includes primary schools , followed by secondary schools ( high schools ) and tertiary education at universities or polytechnics . The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked New Zealand 's education as the seventh highest in 2009 . The Education Index , published with the UN 's 2008 Human Development Index and based on data from 2006 , listed New Zealand at 0 @.@ 993 , tied for first with Denmark , Finland and Australia . 
 Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16 with most children starting at 5 . Early leaving exemptions may be granted to 15 @-@ year @-@ old students that have been experiencing some ongoing difficulties at school or are unlikely to benefit from continued attendance . Parents and caregivers can home school their children if they obtain approval from the Ministry of Education and prove that that their child will be taught " as regularly and as well as in a registered school " . There are 13 school years and attending state ( public ) schools is nominally free from a person 's fifth birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday . 
 The academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions , but generally runs from late January until mid @-@ December for primary and secondary schools and polytechnics , and from late February until mid @-@ November for universities . New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent , and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification . In the adult population 14 @.@ 2 percent have a bachelor 's degree or higher , 30 @.@ 4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22 @.@ 4 percent have no formal qualification . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Christianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand at just under half of the population at the 2013 New Zealand Census , although regular church attendance is probably closer to 15 percent . In the 2006 Census , 55 @.@ 6 percent of the population identified themselves as Christians , while another 34 @.@ 7 percent indicated that they had no religion ( up from 29 @.@ 6 percent in 2001 ) and around 4 percent affiliated with other religions . Immigrants make up 80 percent of most of the non @-@ Christian religions , with the traditional Māori religion , Judaism ( 24 percent immigrant ) and Bahá 'í ( 20 percent immigrant ) being the exceptions . 
 The traditional religion of the indigenous Māori population was animistic , but with the arrival of missionaries from the early 19th century most of the Māori population converting to Christianity . In 2006 , 2 @,@ 412 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs . The main Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism , Anglicanism , Presbyterianism and Methodism . There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Pentecostal , Baptist , and Latter @-@ day Saint churches and the New Zealand @-@ based <unk> church has adherents among Māori . According to census figures , other significant minority religions include Hinduism , Buddhism , and Islam . New Zealand has no state religion and freedom of religion has been protected since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi . 
 = = Income = = 
 New Zealand 's early economy was based on sealing , whaling , flax , gold , kauri gum , and native timber . During the 1880s agricultural products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand . Farming is still a major employer , with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census , although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector . The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93 @,@ 840 people . Most people are on wages or salaries ( 59 @.@ 9 percent ) , with the other sources of income being interest and investments ( 24 @.@ 1 percent ) and self @-@ employment ( 16 @.@ 6 percent ) . 
 In 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per @-@ capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank . In 2010 the estimated gross domestic product ( GDP ) at purchasing power parity ( PPP ) per capita was roughly US $ 28 @,@ 250 , between the thirty @-@ first and fifty @-@ first highest for all countries . The median personal income in 2006 was $ 24 @,@ 400 . This was up from $ 15 @,@ 600 in 1996 , with the largest increases in the $ 50 @,@ 000 to $ 70 @,@ 000 bracket . The median income for men was $ 31 @,@ 500 , $ 12 @,@ 400 more than women . The highest median personal income were for people identifying with the European or " other " ethnic group , while the lowest was from the Asian ethnic group . The median income for people identifying as Māori was $ 20 @,@ 900 . 
 Unemployment peaked above 10 percent in 1991 and 1992 , before falling to a record low of 3 @.@ 4 percent in 2007 ( ranking fifth from twenty @-@ seven comparable OECD nations ) . Unemployment rose back to 7 percent in late 2009 and was 6 @.@ 8 percent during the June 2010 quarter . The 2006 census reported that while the proportion of people with no source of income was the same as 2001 , the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit dropped 48 percent . Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work , more women volunteer ( 92 percent ) than males ( 86 percent ) .

The Pacific Rim <unk> will involve several combined and joint military exercises in Japan , Korea , Thailand , Philippines , and Australia . Part of I Corps ' objectives for these exercises will be Joint Task Force certification in support of United States Pacific Command missions . 
 Activated in World War I in France , I Corps oversaw US Army divisions as they repelled several major German offensives and led them into Germany . The corps was deactivated following the end of the war . 
 Reactivated for service in World War II , the corps took command of divisions in the south Pacific , leading US and Australian forces as they pushed the Japanese army out of New Guinea . It went on to be one of the principal leading elements in the Battle of Luzon , liberating the Philippines . It then took charge as one of the commanding headquarters in the occupation of Japan . 
 Deployed to Korea at the start of the Korean War , the corps was one of three corps that remained in the country for the entire conflict , commanding US , British , and South Korean forces through three years of back @-@ and @-@ forth campaigns against North Korean and Chinese forces . Following the end of the war , it remained in Korea for almost 20 years guarding the Korean Demilitarized Zone . Active today , the corps acts as a subordinate headquarters of United States Army Forces Command , and has also seen deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom .

 Following the American declaration of war on Germany , on 6 April 1917 , I Corps was organized and activated on 15 – 20 January 1918 , in the National Army in Neufchâteau , France , the first of several corps @-@ sized formations intended to command divisions of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War I. Assisted by the French XXXII Corps , the headquarters was organized and trained ; on 20 January , Major General Hunter Liggett took command . 
 In February , the corps consisted of the 1st , 2nd , 26th , 32nd , 41st , and 42nd Infantry Divisions . From February to July , 1918 , the German Army launched four major offensives , attempting to secure victory before the full American forces could be mobilized . The final offensive , started in July 1918 , was an attempt to cross the Marne , in the area of Château @-@ Thierry , but I Corps and other formations on the American lines held , and the attack was rebuffed . 
 With the defeat of these German drives , I Corps conducted its first offensive mission , participating in the Second Battle of the Marne from 18 July until 6 August , which resulted in the reduction of the more important salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives . After a brief period in the defensive sectors of Champagne and Lorraine between 7 August and 11 September , the corps took part in the St. Mihiel attack on 12 September , which reduced the German salient there during the next four days . Then followed another period on the defense in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war . On 26 September , I Corps troops began the attack northward that opened the Meuse @-@ Argonne Offensive . From that day until 11 November 1918 when the war ended , I Corps was constantly moving forward . 
 The I Corps shoulder sleeve insignia was first worn by members of I Corps after approval from the AEF on 3 December 1918 , but it was not officially approved until 1922 . I Corps continued to train in France , until it was demobilized on 25 March 1919 . 
 During its time in World War I , I Corps commanded the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 26th , 28th , 32nd , 35th , 36th , 41st , 43rd , 77th , 78th , 80th , 82nd , 90th , 91st , 92nd Infantry Divisions at one point or another . Also assigned to the corps were the French 62nd , 167th and 5th Cavalry Divisions .

 On 15 August 1927 , XX Corps was reconstituted in the Regular Army . Two months later , on 13 October 1927 , the XX Corps was redesignated as I Corps . However , the corps headquarters remained inactive during peacetime , until the US Army 's buildup following the outbreak of War in Europe . On 1 November 1940 , I Corps was reactivated at Columbia , South Carolina . For the next nine months , the corps supervised training and large scale divisional maneuvers . 
 = = = = New Guinea Campaign = = = = 
 On 6 July 1942 Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger took command of the corps which he would lead through the majority of its service in the war . In the summer of 1942 the corps was ordered to Australia , closing into the area at Rockhampton on 17 October 1942 . This move was to be part of a larger overall offensive in the south Pacific region . The corps at this time comprised the 41st and 32nd Divisions , engaged in the defense of British New Guinea , the beginning of the New Guinea campaign . Though the Japanese advanced rapidly at first , a number of factors slowed their progress against the Allied forces . Stubborn resistance from two Australian brigades bought time for I Corps reinforcements to arrive while the terrain proved more difficult than the Japanese had anticipated . Supplies , which were already insufficient for the Japanese forces , were shortened even more as Japan 's high command diverted them to the Guadalcanal campaign . The Japanese attack stalled , and once the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia was abated , I Corps launched an offensive to push back the Japanese . With the 32nd Division and the 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 41st Division , the offensive was launched across the Owen Stanley Mountains of New Guinea . This force , later augmented by the Australian 7th Division , fought the Battle of Buna @-@ Gona , slowly advancing north against a tenacious enemy under harsh weather and terrain conditions . Overstretched Japanese forces , low on supplies , were eventually overcome by US and Australian forces . Despite being surrounded , trapped , and outnumbered , the Japanese forces continued to fight until they were completely wiped out by Allied forces . Buna , on the north coast of the island , fell on 22 January 1943 . The campaign was the first major Allied victory against the Japanese Army , and I Corps received the Presidential Unit Citation . This victory marked the turn of the tide in the ground war against Japan . 
 After this campaign I Corps returned to Rockhampton , where it was engaged in the training of the Allied forces beginning to arrive in that area for the coming campaigns . From February 1943 until March 1944 I Corps prepared for its next assignment , Operation Cartwheel . That mission was the capture of Hollandia on the north coast of Dutch New Guinea ; the units allocated to the corps for this task were the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions . The Task Force established itself ashore after a successful amphibious assault on 19 April 1944 . It then began an offensive in that area to remove Japanese forces , before establishing air bases there . The battle was a vicious one ; the jungles and swamps made difficult fighting ground , and it was not until 6 June that the area was secured . The entire Japanese 18th Army was cut off from its bases by the force . Following this campaign the corps directed the seizure of the island of Biak , which was secured by 24 June , to complete the advances necessary for the subsequent invasion of the Philippine Islands . On 20 August Major General Innis P. Swift succeeded General Eichelberger as commander of the corps . 
 = = = = Luzon = = = = 
 The corps was assigned to the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the offensive in the Philippines from the assets of the Philippine Commonwealth Army , Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrilla units . On 9 January 1945 , I Corps successfully landed on the coast of the Lingayen Gulf in Northern Luzon with the mission of establishing a base for future operations to the north and of denying the enemy northern access to the South China Sea . As a part of the Sixth Army with an overall force of 175 @,@ 000 men , the American forces faced over 260 @,@ 000 Japanese in Luzon . In a sustained drive of thirty @-@ four days which covered over 100 miles , I Corps crossed central Luzon and thus separated the Japanese forces in the north from those in southern Luzon , destroying Japanese armored units along the way . Additional landings at Samar and Palawan were conducted in February , reducing the pressure on the forces of I Corps . Following this accomplishment , the corps turned northward and began the systematic reduction of the enemy positions on the approach to the Cagayan Valley . The breakthrough into the valley was followed by a swift exploitation that took the corps to the north coast . This advance covered two hundred miles in little over 100 days ; eliminating effective enemy resistance in northern Luzon . Manila was recaptured by the Allies after heavy fighting that ravaged the city . The intense fighting that ensued cost 8 @,@ 000 killed and 30 @,@ 000 wounded in the Sixth Army , compared to 190 @,@ 000 dead for Japan . As the Sixth Army finished off the Japanese on Luzon , the Eighth United States Army in the south sent units all throughout the Philippines to eliminate remaining Japanese resistance on the islands . The Tenth United States Army in the north commenced securing Okinawa and Iwo Jima . With the defeat of the Japanese at each of these places , the US forces had locations from which to launch attacks into mainland Japan . 
 Allied forces then began preparing for the invasion of mainland Japan , Operation Downfall . I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps under the command of the Sixth Army , with a strength of 14 divisions . I Corps was to lead the assault on Miyazaki , in southern Kyūshū , with the 25th , 33rd , and 41st Infantry Divisions . Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army , with the 154th , 156th , and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions . Before the assault could be launched , Japan surrendered , following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
 During World War II , the 6th , 8th , 9th , 24th , 25th , 30th ( during training in U.S. only ? ) , 32nd , 33rd , 37th , 41st , 43rd , 77th and 98th Infantry Divisions were assigned to I Corps at one time or another , along with the 2nd Marine Division , 7th Australian Division , and elements of the 11th Airborne Division . 
 = = = = Occupation of Japan = = = = 
 After the end of hostilities , I Corps was assigned to occupation duty in Japan . On 19 September 1945 the corps , with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division , sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan , landing on the island of Honshū on 25 September , three weeks after Japan 's formal surrender . The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced ; Japanese military installations and material were seized , troops were disarmed and discharged , and weapons of warfare disposed of . The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry , repatriation of foreign nationals , and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government , economics , education , and industry . 
 By 1948 , as the purely occupational mission was accomplished , troops of the corps focused more military training and field exercises designed to prepare them for combat . Its force was eventually downsized to the 24th Infantry Division on Kyūshū and 25th Infantry Division on mid @-@ Honshū . The US Army continued a slow and steady process of post @-@ war drawdown and demobilization on its own , and on 28 March 1950 , the corps was formally inactivated in Japan , and its command consolidated with other units . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 Only a few months later , the Korean War began , and units from Japan began streaming into South Korea . The Eighth United States Army , taking charge of the conflict , requested the activation of three corps headquarters for its growing command of U.N. forces . I Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , on 2 August 1950 . 
 = = = = Pusan Perimeter = = = = 
 Advance elements of the headquarters took their place in the Pusan perimeter on 27 August . The headquarters , designated " Task Force Jackson " , assumed control of the South Korean I Corps , the 21st Regimental Combat Team , and the 3rd Battalion Combat Team of the 9th Infantry Regiment . On 12 September , under command of Lieutenant General Frank W. Milburn , the corps became operational . It took command of the 1st Cavalry Division , 24th Infantry Division , and South Korean 1st Infantry Division , along with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade , defending the Naktong River area against attacking North Korean units . 
 Amphibious landings at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean forces from behind , allowing I Corps and IX Corps to break out of Pusan . Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead . Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration ; the link @-@ up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September . The offensive was continued northwards , past Seoul , and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October . The momentum of the attack was maintained , and the race to the North Korean capitol , Pyongyang , ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city . The advance continued , but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance . On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops . By the end of October the city of Chongju , forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea , had been captured . 
 = = = = Chinese Intervention = = = = 
 On 27 November , China entered the war on the side of North Korea against the UN . Massed Chinese attacks were immediately launched against troops of the corps . The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties , ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River , south of the 38th parallel , having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force . In the wake of the retreat , the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re @-@ formed . I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division , the 24th Infantry Division , and the 27th British Brigade , taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place . On 1 January 1951 , 500 @,@ 000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army 's line at the Imjin River , forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul . The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them , and their attack stalled . The Eighth Army , battered by the Chinese assault , began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground . 
 Following the establishment of defenses south of the capital city , General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I , IX , and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces , Operation Thunderbolt . Between February and March , the corps participated in Operation Killer , pushing Chinese forces north of the Han River . This operation was quickly followed up with Operation Ripper , which retook Seoul in March . After this , Operations Rugged and Dauntless in April saw Eighth Army forces advance north of the 38th parallel and reestablish themselves along the Kansas Line and Utah Line , respectively . 
 As I Corps troops approached the Iron Triangle formed by the cities of Chorwon , Kumhwa , and Pyongyang , Chinese resistance increased . By that time , the 1st South Korean Infantry Division was relieved from the corps and assigned to one of the Korean corps . The 1st Cavalry Division was returned to the corps in its place . 
 In late April , the Chinese launched a major counterattack . Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions were able to hold their ground against the Chinese 9th Chinese People 's Volunteers ( CPV ) Army Corps , the South Korean 6th Infantry Division , to the east , was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps , which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the American divisions . The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April . The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold . 
 = = = = Stalemate = = = = 
 In September , the UN Forces launched another counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division at the center of the line , west of the Hwachon Reservoir . Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions , the 24th advanced past Kumwha , engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies . In November , the Chinese attempted to counter this attack , but were unsuccessful . It was at this point , after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground , that the two sides started serious peace negotiations . In late 1951 , the 1st Cavalry Division , depleted after having suffered 16 @,@ 000 casualties so far in the conflict , was relegated to the Far East reserve to rebuild . It was replaced by the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard , which was newly arrived in the theater . 
 In March 1952 , the corps grew in size as the 25th Infantry Division was relieved from its command and it gained command of 1st British Commonwealth Division and the South Korean 1st Division , 8th Division , and 9th Divisions . In June 1952 , a ten @-@ day attack against 45th Infantry Division outposts was repulsed . September 1952 began with renewed enemy attacks against the outposts that protected the main line . Enemy attacks up to regimental size against garrisons of platoon and company strength were turned back by Corps troops . Outposts at Bunker Hill , The Hook , Kelly , Old Baldy Hill , Nori , and Pork Chop Hill were defended in heavy fighting within I Corps ' area of responsibility . All along the front , the enemy was driven back with thousands of casualties . 
 In January 1953 , the corps underwent its last major reorganization of the war , losing command of the US 3rd , 24th , and 45th Infantry Divisions , the South Korean 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions , and the British 1st Commonwealth Division , while taking command of the US 2nd , 7th , and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Marine Division . On 23 January 1953 , the first major action of the year was initiated with a raid by aggressive infantrymen of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division against the enemy 's Big Nori positions . The next months saw many such raids which harassed the enemy , captured prisoners , and destroyed defensive works . Beginning in March , the Communists continually attacked the corps outposts . In that month , troops on Old Baldy were withdrawn , on orders from I Corps , after suffering heavy casualties from the Chinese . On 10 April 1953 Lieutenant General Bruce C. Clarke , who was to see the corps through the remainder of its combat , assumed command . 
 The fighting on the outposts continued ; the 7th Infantry Division stopped wave after wave of troops that the Chinese threw against Pork Chop Hill . Troops of the Turkish Brigade , attached to the 25th Infantry Division , defended Outposts Berlin , Vegas , Carson , and Elko in fierce hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . They were ordered to evacuate all but the Berlin position at the end of May . The 1st British Commonwealth Division ejected the Chinese after their assault on the Hook . The 1st ROK Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen , Bak , and Hill 179 when heavy enemy assaults divested them of their tactical value . The closing days of the fighting saw the 7th Infantry Division withdrawn from Pork Chop and the 1st Marine Division ordered to evacuate the Berlin positions for the same reason . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 After the 1953 armistice , the defense of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies . The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west . For the next 18 years , the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ , seeing only occasional incidents with the North Korean army . In 1971 , under Nixon 's détente policy , the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn , leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea . I Corps remained in Korea as a two @-@ division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army ( <unk> ) . 
 In 1980 , Fort Lewis , Washington was notified of a major change of structure . A corps headquarters was to be activated in March 1982 . I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981 , much earlier than expected . On 1 August 1983 , the corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis , to include the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord , California , and the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Alaska , which then became part of the 6th Infantry Division . In 1988 , the distinctive unit insignia was approved for the corps . This was the fourth design held by the corps , with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942 , 1970 , and 1982 . 
 = = = Gulf War = = = 
 Following the end of the Cold War in 1989 , the US government conducted careful restructuring of national priorities and of the defense establishment . Fort Lewis , ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region , was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall . Thus , while most of the Army was downsizing , Fort Lewis began to grow , however , several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized . 
 The 3rd Brigade , 9th Infantry Division became the 199th Infantry Brigade , attached to I Corps , remaining under I Corps until its redesignation as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment , and its departure for Fort Polk , Louisiana in 1993 . 
 Also in 1990 , the U.S. intervened in the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm . During that intervention , Fort Lewis deployed 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia . I Corps also contributed to the command structure , with the I Corps Commander , LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander , MG Paul R. Schwartz , assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf , the Commander of the American Forces . I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick @-@ response corps . For several months , I Corps was the nation 's worldwide contingency corps , while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War . This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis , as the post restructured itself to support the corps ' new mission , and to insure that it had a smooth , rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world . This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States . The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured , no @-@ mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command . This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units . 
 In preparation for these new requirements , Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which were coming out of Europe . One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group . On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade , also from Europe , was activated . In 1997 , the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss , Texas , to join other air defense brigades . The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units in and out of the area through 2000 . Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region . Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea . 
 = = = War on Terrorism = = = 
 With the events of 11 September 2001 , I Corps began providing support for Army units deploying in support of the War on Terrorism . Its assets were active in providing combat support and combat service support missions , including Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan , Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and the domestic Operation Noble Eagle . 
 On 4 February 2004 , I Corps forward headquarters deployed to Iraq . The element , called Task Force Olympia , deployed to Mosul , Iraq in January 2004 , where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division to form a headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq . It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams , attached engineers , civil affairs , signal , and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces , eventually numbering more than 12 @,@ 000 . The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions , three Border Police battalions , several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion . After more than a year in Iraq , the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005 . 
 In 2008 , it was announced that I Corps was to deploy to Iraq in 2009 , to replace XVIII Airborne Corps in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom . Soldiers of the corps trained for a year in preparation for the deployment , which began on 9 April 2009 . I Corps filled the role of Multi @-@ National Corps - Iraq at Al @-@ Faw Palace . In January 2010 , Multi @-@ National Corps - Iraq integrated with Multi @-@ National Forces - Iraq ( MNF @-@ I ) and Multi @-@ National Security Transition Command – Iraq ( <unk> @-@ I ) to form United States Forces - Iraq ( USF @-@ I ) . Over its one @-@ year deployment , the corps oversaw the responsible drawdown of major components of US Forces in Iraq . I corps returned from Iraq in March 2010 following their RIP / <unk> with III Corps .

 = Andrianampoinimerina = 
 Andrianampoinimerina ( Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ̥ ] ) ( 1745 – 1810 ) ruled the Kingdom of Imerina from 1787 until his death . His reign was marked by the reunification of Imerina following 77 years of civil war , and the subsequent expansion of his kingdom into neighboring territories , thereby initiating the unification of Madagascar under Merina rule . Andrianampoinimerina is a cultural hero and holds near mythic status among the Merina people , and is considered one of the greatest military and political leaders in the history of Madagascar . 
 Andrianampoinimerina took power upon deposing his uncle , King Andrianjafy , who had ruled over Imerina <unk> ( Northern Imerina ) . Prior to Andrianampoinimerina 's reign , Imerina <unk> had been locked in conflict with the three other neighboring provinces of the former kingdom of Imerina that had last been unified under King Andriamasinavalona a century before . Andrianampoinimerina established his capital at the fortified town of Ambohimanga , a site of great spiritual , cultural and political significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 . The king 's original royal lodgings can still be visited at Ambohimanga today . From this position , he progressively extended his domain first over all Imerina and then over the greater Highlands , absorbing the Betsileo , Sihanaka , Bezanozano and Bara territories . Having reigned for 23 years at the time of his death , Andrianampoinimerina had successfully reunited Imerina and vastly expanded the Merina kingdom , with the intent to ultimately unify all of Madagascar under Merina rule . His son and heir , Radama I , continued the conquests Andrianampoinimerina had begun , and over the next two decades largely achieved his father 's vision . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 Andrianampoinimerina was born Ramboasalamarazaka ( short form : Ramboasalama ) around 1745 in <unk> , in central Madagascar , to Princess <unk> , daughter of King Andriambelomasina of Imerina ( 1730 @-@ 1770 ) , and her husband <unk> , an andriana ( noble ) of the Zafimamy royal family in the independent kingdom of Alahamadintany to the north of Imerina . His mother 's brother Andrianjafy was named Andriambelomasina 's successor and was king of Imerina Avaradrano , the northern quadrant of the former Kingdom of Imerina , from 1770 to 1787 . 
 Ramboasalamarazaka was born during a period when conflict and famine afflicted Imerina . For almost a century , from the end of the reign of King Ralambo ( 1575 – 1600 ) to King Andriamasinavalona ( 1675 – 1710 ) , the Kingdom of Imerina in Madagascar 's central highlands had generally enjoyed prosperity , expansion and civil peace . This stability and the unity of Imerina collapsed after Andriamasinavalona divided the kingdom among his four favorite sons , leading to 77 years of civil war that weakened the ability of subsequent princes to respond effectively to the pressures of slave trading and a growing population . Merina kings had long intended to extend their kingdom to the North by absorbing the Zafimamy kingdom of Alahamadintany , and the Zafimamy kings of Alahamadintany had also wished to extend their land to the South by absorbing the Merina Kingdom . The marriage between Ramboasalamarazaka 's parents was a political alliance contracted as part of Andriambelomasina 's strategy to mitigate the threat of invasions by the Alahamadintany @-@ Zafimamy alliance to the North . The marriage agreement stipulated that after the reign of Andriambelomasina 's son , Andrianjafy , the throne would pass to his daughter 's son , Ramboasalamarazaka . The alliance between these two royal families represented a fair and peaceful compromise : the prince born of this union would rule over both states and unify the two kingdoms . 
 Andrianampoinimerina 's Zafimamy ancestors practiced endogamy and therefore rarely mixed with the descendants of the legendary first inhabitants of Madagascar , the Vazimba . However , Ramboasalamarazaka had partial Vazimba ancestry on his mother 's side through her antecedent , King Andriamanelo ( 1540 – 1575 ) , son of Vazimba Queen Rafohy ( 1530 – 1540 ) and her Merina husband <unk> . He was born during the first quarter of the moon ( <unk> ) of the month <unk> , the sign of a highly auspicious birth according to popular belief . Following the Merina customs of the time , his parents gave him the humble name Ramboasalama ( Ra @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , " The healthy dog " ) to protect him from attracting the undesirable attention of jealous rivals or evil spirits , before being changed in childhood to Ramboasalamarazaka . 
 = = = Childhood and education = = = 
 Ramboasalamarazaka spent his early childhood in his father 's Zafimamy court at <unk> . There he received a traditional education , including mastery of fanorona , a local board game believed to develop intelligence and the ability to think strategically . Young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform kabary ( a stylized form of public address ) , including the judicious use of <unk> ( proverbs ) to persuasively make a point . Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha , a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles . Around the age of 12 , Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under the supervision of his grandfather , King Andriambelomasina , at <unk> and the royal court in Ambohimanga . 
 = = = Merchant = = = 
 As a young man , Ramboasalamarazaka worked as a merchant and may have also traded in slaves . During this period he gained a reputation as a champion of the commoner , committed to defending them against raids by Sakalava warriors and slave traders and fighting against corruption . Regarded as a self @-@ made man who did not rely on his privileges as a prince , his independence , temperament , tenacity and sense of justice made him popular among the commoners and the slaves of Ambohimanga . His popularity stood in contrast to public discontentment with his uncle , King Andrianjafy , who was viewed as a despotic and incompetent ruler . Ramboasalamarazaka frequently made promises to the populace regarding his future reign , which led Andrianjafy perceived as a threat to his authority , leading him to execute citizens of his territory who engaged his nephew in such promises ; contrary to his intentions , this response only served to turn popular opinion against Andrianjafy . 
 = = = Conflict with Andrianjafy = = = 
 Although Andrianjafy may have initially intended for Ramboasalamarazaka to succeed him , this appears to have changed following the birth of his son , whom his wife persuaded him to name as successor in disregard of his father 's earlier decree . Andrianjafy consequently made several attempts to have his nephew killed , but on each occasion Ramboasalamarazaka was warned by Andrianjafy 's brother and managed to avert the plot . In 1787 , when Ramboasalamarazaka was 42 years old , the conflict between the men reached a turning point : Andrianjafy decided to send a group of assassins to Ramboasalama 's residence in Ambohimanga . Andrianjafy 's brother again took action and warned Ramboasalamarazaka to flee , but rather than leave Ambohimanga , Ramboasalama followed the advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection . The elder then gathered the twelve most respected men of Ambohimanga and thirty soldiers , and rallied them to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina by overthrowing Andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to Ramboasalama . After the success of the coup , the new king adopted his ruling name , Andrianampoinimerina . The support of the Tsimahafotsy , inhabitants of Ambohimanga , ensured the defense of the city against efforts by Andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority . 
 Andrianjafy rallied the people of his home village of Ilafy to fight against those of Ambohimanga . Both sides were armed with spears and firearms . An initial battle at <unk> saw the Ilafy army defeated . Both sides regrouped for a second confrontation at <unk> , which took place at night and did not end in a definitive win for either side . In the morning , Andrianjafy moved his army north of Anosy and the two sides clashed again in a battle that lasted two days . The Ilafy army lost the skirmish and retreated to their village . After losing these battles , the residents of Ilafy decided to submit to Andrianampoinimerina . To rid themselves of Andrianjafy , the people encouraged him to travel to Antananarivo and Alasora to seek allies in the defense of their town . Once he had departed , the villagers barred the town gates and announced their desire to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina . Seeking support to recapture the throne , Andrianjafy traveled to Antananarivo , <unk> , Alasora and <unk> to secure an alliance , but each time he was rebuffed . The conflict came to an end in 1787 when Andrianampoinimerina exiled his uncle ; varying sources report that shortly afterward Andrianjafy either died in exile or was killed by Andrianampoinimerina 's followers .

 = = = Reunification of historic Imerina = = = 
 Continuing his conquests in the 1790s , Andrianampoinimerina began establishing control over a comparatively large part of the highlands of Madagascar including the twelve sacred hills of Imerina . Andrianampoinimerina conquered Antananarivo in 1793 and concluded treaties with the kings of Antananarivo and Ambohidratrimo . He shifted the kingdom 's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794 . By 1795 he had gained the allegiance and submission of all the territories that had formed Imerina at its largest extent under Andriamasinavalona , effectively achieving the reunification of Imerina . The former kings of Antananarivo and Ambohidratrimo periodically engaged in resistance against his authority in disregard of the treaties they had concluded , prompting Andrianampoinimerina to launch renewed campaigns to eliminate both kings ; the re @-@ pacification of Antananarivo began in 1794 and achieved definitive success in 1797 , with Ambohidratrimo reconquered shortly afterward . By 1800 , he had absorbed several other previously independent sections of Imerina into his kingdom . He reinforced alliances with powerful nobles in conquered regions of Imerina through marriage to local princesses , and is said to have wed 12 women in total . He placed each wife at a house built at each of the twelve sacred hills . After the political capital of Imerina was shifted back to Antananarivo , Andrianampoinimerina declared Ambohimanga to be the spiritual capital of Imerina . 
 = = = Conquest of greater Madagascar = = = 
 The latter half of Andrianampoinimerina 's reign from around 1800 was marked by an effort to unite the island 's 18 ethnic groups under his rule . This effort began with the sending of royal messengers bearing invitations to become vassal states under Andrianampoinimerina 's sovereignty , or face a military conquest . The first focus of this expansion was territory that had historically been inhabited by the Merina people but had come under the rule of other groups , particularly including the eastern lands held by the Sihanaka and Bezanozano peoples . Andrianampoinimerina then consolidated Merina power in neighboring southern central Betsileo territories , establishing military outposts to protect Merina settlers as far south as the Ankaratra mountains and <unk> . Kingdoms that united with Imerina as a result of diplomatic efforts included the Betsileo around <unk> ; the Betsileo , Merina and <unk> <unk> of Betafo ; and the western region of Imamo . The Sakalava of Menabe and <unk> rejected these offers and actively resisted Merina domination ; the Bezanozano territories likewise resisted , although the Merina managed to preserve a tenuous hold over the area . 
 The gradual conquest of surrounding lands by Andrianampoinimerina and his Merina army was vigorously opposed by the Sakalava , who remained a major threat to Andrianampoinimerina and his people . Throughout his reign , bands of Sakalava mounted slave raids in Imerina and brought captured Merina to the coast for sale to European slave traders . Sakalava armies mounted repeated incursions into Imerina and nearly breached the capital city on more than one occasion . Andrianampoinimerina launched several campaigns to pacify the Sakalava but none were successful . He also sought to establish peace through marriages intended to form political alliances , but without achieving lasting peace or an end to the slave raids . 
 Certain Merina nobles and several members of the royal family also posed a threat to Andrianampoinimerina 's rule . After deposing Andrianjafy , the fallen king made an attempt on Andrianampoinimerina 's life . This assassination attempt was foiled by an informant who had learned about the conspiracy by chance . Andrianampoinimerina rewarded the informant by marrying his daughter to his son , future King Radama I. Andrianampoinimerina furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after Radama . The marriage did not produce children , however , and following Radama 's death in 1828 , this royal wife would rule Madagascar for 33 years as Queen Ranavalona I. <unk> 's authority was also threatened by his adopted son , <unk> , who plotted to kill Radama ; when these efforts failed , he attempted to assassinate Andrianampoinimerina , but was discovered and executed . 
 = = Governance of the Kingdom of Imerina = = 
 Beginning in 1797 , Andrianampoinimerina ruled his expanding kingdom from Antananarivo , the traditional capital of the Kingdom of Imerina . He is credited with major development and reorganization of the city . His vision for the capital was to serve as a microcosm of his kingdom and a model of urban planning that would be replicated in each new territory . In keeping with sacred Merina symbolism associated with height , space and cardinal orientation , he retained the royal compound - the Rova of Antananarivo - at the crest of the highest hill in the city , and in the center of the urban space that expanded around it . He also undertook significant expansion of the sacred rova compound and improved its venerable buildings . This included the reconstruction in 1800 of Besakana , the " throne of the kingdom " built by king Andrianjaka in the early 1600s as the first royal residence at Antananarivo - one of several houses used as residences by Andrianampoinimerina at the palace , the other principal residence being Mahitsielafanjaka after he moved his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo . He implanted representatives of ethnic groups he had recently conquered in specified neighborhoods of the city . Each Merina social class had its designated districts : slaves lived south of the rova ( a disfavored direction in Merina cosmology ) , the mainty ( royal servant class ) lived to the southeast in <unk> , important hova clans were allotted the district to the west of the royal compound , and each of the seven sub @-@ classes of andriana nobles were assigned to a district to the sacred north and northeast of the palace . Within this broad district structure , each clan ( <unk> ) was assigned a specific neighborhood in an orientation roughly corresponding to the orientation of their home village vis @-@ a @-@ vis the capital city . In the popular imagination of the residents of modern @-@ day Antananarivo , the city in the time of Andrianampoinimerina is envisioned as a perfect and harmonious urban space embodying the best of Merina ingenuity and spiritual significance . 
 The legitimacy of Andrianampoinimerina 's reign was bolstered by his characterization of other Merina rulers ' claims to power as <unk> hova - rule by hova ( commoners ) , whose lineages were only weakly tied to the line of succession relative to his own . In addition , like Merina kings before him , he consolidated the power of the sampy ( royal idols ) and attributed the success and legitimacy of his reign to the proper respect shown toward these conduits of supernatural power . He balanced this strengthening of the supernatural and ancestral legitimacy of his kingship against inclusiveness of the commoner class by making several hova from the <unk> and Tsimahafotsy clans into powerful and trusted advisers . He also consulted a group of ombiasy ( royal advisers of the Antaimoro clan ) , who were literate in the sorabe script historically used on the east coast to inscribe a series of ancient texts considered to contain powerful magic and specialized scientific and ritual knowledge . 
 The population of Imerina was governed through a mixture of traditional practices and innovative measures . While all land technically belonged to the sovereign , its administration was carried out by andriana who were assigned a menakely ( subdivision of land ) to govern . These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers . The land was cultivated by commoners , who were given a parcel to farm based on the size of the family it was meant to feed , and each family paid taxes to the king in return . Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day 's end , and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others ' fields , provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot . In this way , the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met . 
 = = = Social organization = = = 
 The hierarchy of Merina andriana sub @-@ classes established in the 16th century under Andriamanelo was revised by Andrianampoinimerina , as it had been done by Andriamasinavalona . He decreed new rights and responsibilities for the andriana , including the privilege of placing sculptures or images of the <unk> ( black kite ) on their homes to indicate their noble status . 
 In order to strengthen relationships within clans and communities , and to promote moderation and equitable distribution of resources , Andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger , monolithic stone tombs to hold the remains of all family members , and that the construction of these tombs was to be undertaken as a shared responsibility among members of the family to be entombed there . 
 Modifications and expansions on several traditional royal rituals under Andrianampoinimerina enabled him to develop a state religion in which he was the central figure . The tradition of the fandroana festival established by the 17th century Merina king Ralambo was made a much larger event intended to symbolically renew the nation and the cosmic power that legitimized and strengthened Andrianampoinimerina 's reign as well as the power of the state . This served to further unify his citizens while legitimizing and strengthening his rule . 
 = = = Public works = = = 
 The long @-@ established royal Merina tradition of fanompoana ( labor as a form of tax ) was continued and expanded under Andrianampoinimerina . Major public works were carried out under his reign , including the further expansion of irrigated paddy fields in the Betsimitatatra plains surrounding Antananarivo . He devised systems for organizing work teams , motivated their efforts by setting up competitions between teams , and punished those who failed to contribute their due share of effort . He mobilized groups of hiragasy village musicians to entertain work teams and later employed them to travel among towns and villages across the kingdom , broadcasting news , announcing new laws and promoting proper social behavior . 
 = = = Laws = = = 
 Andrianampoinimerina developed a legal system that applied throughout the territories he ruled . He was the first Merina king to establish formal civil and penal codes , the latter ameliorated and transcribed by his son Radama . He declared twelve crimes to be capital offenses , while many others entailed collective punishment for the guilty party and his or her family members including forced labor in chains and being reduced to slave status . These harsh penalties were intended to act as a strong disincentive to engage in antisocial acts ; the consumption of alcohol , marijuana and tobacco were also outlawed , although they remained prevalent . To judge infractions of his laws , the king often relied on the tradition of tangena , whereby surviving the ingestion of poison indicated an accused person 's innocence . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 Under Andrianampoinimerina , regulations were established to manage trading in slaves and other commodities . Estimates put the number of slaves traded by the king at around 1 @,@ 800 per year , mainly in exchange for firearms and principally to French merchants who sold them on to Mauritius and Reunion . This brought order to the kingdom 's economy , enriched the crown , and enabled the king to monopolize trade in certain particularly lucrative goods , thereby weakening opportunities for political rivals to amass enough wealth and influence to unseat him . While this soured his relationship with certain andriana , it increased his popularity among the commoner and slave classes . His practice of commonly deciding in favor of commoners in disputes with nobles further strengthened his image as a fair ruler . 
 Andrianampoinimerina regulated commerce and the economy by creating official markets ( <unk> ) and standardizing market scales ( <unk> ) and other units of measurement , including length and volume . King Andrianampoinimerina established the first marketplace in Antananarivo on the grounds today occupied by the Analakely market 's tile @-@ roofed pavilions , constructed in the 1930s . Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday ( Zoma ) as market day , when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols . This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley , forming what has been called the largest open air marketplace in the world . Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever @-@ growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997 . Prosperity for the masses in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina 's reign , leading to growth in population density . 
 = = = Military organization = = = 
 Finally , he established a citizen army called the <unk> ( the " 100 @,@ 000 soldiers " ) . Men fit for military service were recruited to engage in Andrianampoinimerina 's campaigns of conquest between periods designated for public works projects . These campaigns served to enrich Imerina by capturing slaves for labor and service to the Merina andriana and hova classes , or for sale or trade to coastal communities in exchange for firearms . His military was equipped with the sizeable stock of arms he procured from coastal traders in western Madagascar . 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 Andrianampoinimerina died in the Mahitsielafanjaka house on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo on 6 July 1810 at the age of 65 , having fathered eleven sons and thirteen daughters by his many wives . In the Vazimba tradition of Merina kings before him , the body of Andrianampoinimerina was placed in a canoe made of silver ( rather than the customary hollowed out log ) and interred in one of the royal tranomasina tombs at Ambohimanga . Shortly after the French established a colonial presence on the island in 1896 , they destroyed Andrianampoinimerina 's original tomb in March 1897 , removed his remains , and relocated them to the rova of Antananarivo where they were interred in the tomb of his son . This was done in an effort to desanctify the city of Ambohimanga , break the spirit of the Menalamba resistance fighters who had been rebelling against French colonization for the past year , weaken popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors , and relegate Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past . Andrianampoinimerina was succeeded by his 18 @-@ year @-@ old son , Radama I. In order to fulfill his oath that the child of his son Radama would follow in the line of succession , Andrianampoinimerina had his oldest son , <unk> , killed to prevent any contest for the throne . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Historian <unk> <unk> states Andrianampoinimerina is " regarded as the most important of Imerina 's kings " . Historian Catherine Fournet @-@ Guérin notes he is an " object of great admiration in the popular imagination . " A French trader who had conducted business with him declared in 1808 , " He is without doubt the richest , the most feared , the most enlightened , and has the largest kingdom , of all the kings of Madagascar . " Malagasy textbooks characterize him as a hero and the originator of the notion of a unified Malagasy national identity . 
 The primary source of information about the reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara , a Malagasy language book relating the oral history of the Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary , Francois <unk> , in the late 19th century . Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s , references to the king in academic and popular writing during the colonial period de @-@ emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority , instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced . Beginning in the 1970s , historians began to focus more on the spiritual aspects of his role as king , and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign . 
 Innovations during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina were to have long @-@ standing consequences for the structure of Malagasy society in the 19th century . Madagascar specialist Francoise Raison @-@ <unk> attributes the widespread conversions of the masses following the conversion to Christianity of Ranavalona II in 1869 to the precedent established by Andrianampoinimerina of a state religion in which the sovereign is the head and the people are expected to follow . Similarly , Andrianampoinimerina 's decision to empower the hova and the two families of advisers in particular led over the next fifty years to the strengthening of the hova middle class that formed the backbone of the merchant , craftsman , farming and administrative cadres . By the reign of Radama II , hova power rivaled and ultimately exceeded the power of the nobles , leading to the aristocratic coup d 'etat that ended Radama 's reign and the absolute power of the monarch , and established a joint system of government in which the hova Prime Minister and his cabinet governed while the sovereign was reduced to a symbolic figurehead of ancestral power and authority . Ambohimanga , which Andrianampoinimerina declared the spiritual capital of Madagascar , remains among the country 's most important spiritual and cultural sites , and was recognized as Madagascar 's only cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 . A major street in Antananarivo , running parallel to the Avenue de l <unk> and one block east , is named after him . 
 = Abe Waddington = 
 Abraham " Abe " Waddington , sometimes known as Abram Waddington ( 4 February 1893 – 28 October 1959 ) , was a professional cricketer for Yorkshire , who played in two Test matches for England , both against Australia in 1920 – 21 . Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire , and in all first @-@ class cricket played 266 matches . In these games , he took a total of 852 wickets with his left arm fast @-@ medium bowling . Capable of making the ball swing , Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his bowling action . He was a hostile bowler who sometimes sledged opposing batsmen and questioned umpires ' decisions , behaviour which was unusual during his playing days . 
 Waddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War , when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements . He made an immediate impression in 1919 , his first season ; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire 's victory in the County Championship that year . After a similarly successful season in 1920 , he was selected for the 1920 – 21 Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) tour of Australia , during which he appeared in two of the five Tests . However , the England team were outclassed ; used in an unfamiliar tactical role , Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again . He continued to be effective for Yorkshire , particularly against the weaker counties , but was often inconsistent . His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex . A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first @-@ class cricket in 1927 . He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business , a fat @-@ refining firm , but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket . 
 In the early 1920s , Waddington played several football matches for Halifax Town as a goalkeeper , and after his retirement from cricket enjoyed some success as an amateur golfer . He was in trouble with the police on more than one occasion and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers , the Ministry of Food ; he was found not guilty . He died in 1959 at the age of 66 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Abraham Waddington was born in Clayton , Bradford , on 4 February 1893 , the eldest of three brothers . His family owned a fat @-@ refining business managed by his father , Sam . When he left school , Waddington joined the family firm as a lorry driver , occasionally working in the refinery . He began playing cricket for Crossley Hall in the West Bradford League at the age of 11 ; as a teenager he played in the Bradford League for <unk> Green and then Laisterdyke , gaining a local reputation as a fast @-@ medium bowler . He helped Laisterdyke win the League championship in 1913 , before moving to Wakefield for the 1914 season , where he took 98 wickets at an average of 12 @.@ 00 . He played for Yorkshire Second XI in August 1914 , alongside future First XI teammates Herbert Sutcliffe and Cec Tyson , but the outbreak of the First World War prevented him making any further appearances for the county . 
 When war was declared , Waddington volunteered for Lord Kitchener 's New Army , joining the Bradford Pals battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment . On 1 July 1916 , during the first day of the Battle of the Somme , Waddington was wounded by shrapnel at Serre , and took shelter in a crater in no man 's land with other wounded soldiers . One of these was the Yorkshire cricketer Major Booth , who was mortally wounded . Waddington comforted Booth while the cricketer died in his arms , an experience which haunted Waddington for the rest of his life . After recovering , Waddington transferred to the Royal Flying Corps . 
 = = First @-@ class cricketer = = 
 = = = County debut = = = 
 Yorkshire 's bowling attack was severely depleted when cricket resumed in 1919 owing to a combination of retirements and deaths in the war . Additionally , George Hirst was past his best , meaning that Yorkshire needed to recruit new fast bowlers . In May and June , the team struggled to dismiss opposing sides on hard pitches ; their results were poor and when two important matches were lost in June , Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack suggested that " things looked very black " . 
 At this point in the season the Yorkshire cricketers Roy Kilner and Arthur Dolphin , who like Waddington had also been wounded at the Somme , recommended him to the Yorkshire committee , probably after seeing him take part in cricket matches in the army . Having returned to play for Laisterdyke in the Bradford League , Waddington was called into the Yorkshire side at the beginning of July for the County Championship match against Derbyshire . On his first @-@ class debut , he took four for 26 ( four wickets for 26 runs ) in 26 overs , and after missing the next match , he followed up with nine wickets against Essex in his second game , taking his first five wicket haul in the second innings of that match . From Waddington 's debut , Yorkshire 's results improved and the team won the Championship . Wisden judged that Waddington 's contribution was crucial : " Without him Yorkshire would certainly not have won the Championship " . He and Wilfred Rhodes formed an effective bowling partnership and , according to Wisden , " Rhodes and Waddington , with E. R. Wilson , for a few weeks , and [ Emmott ] Robinson to help them , carried the eleven from success to success " . It described Waddington as bowling " left @-@ hand , medium pace inclining to fast " , with a " delivery that seems part of himself — free from any suggestion of labour or undue effort " ; it noted that he always bowled a good length and made the ball bounce sharply after pitching . The writer judged Waddington 's first season had been one of " exceptional promise " and predicted that Waddington would go on to " great things " . In the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club , Derek Hodgson suggests that Waddington 's versatility brought him success , as did the line which he bowled to the batsmen . He finished with 100 wickets at an average of 18 @.@ 74 , with eight five @-@ wicket returns . Waddington was only the sixth bowler in first @-@ class cricket history to reach 100 wickets in his debut year . 
 Yorkshire fell to fourth in the Championship in 1920 ; most of the bowling responsibility fell once more on Waddington and Rhodes , and the other bowlers provided little support . Despite a good start to the season , the team faded in the latter part of the year . Wisden suggested that " in the circumstances [ Rhodes and Waddington ] did wonders , Waddington having some irresistible days against the weaker counties . " He took 141 wickets in the season at an average of 16 @.@ 79 . His best figures came in the two matches against Northamptonshire : in the first game he took 11 wickets , and in the second took 13 wickets for 48 runs , including seven for 18 in the first innings , and a hat @-@ trick . Waddington 's season concluded with his selection for the professional " Players " teams in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival . He was one of four players from Yorkshire chosen to tour Australia that winter with the MCC . Hodgson suggests that he was chosen as " the discovery of the first post @-@ war period " . 
 = = = Test selection and leading bowler = = = 
 The 1920 – 21 MCC tour to Australia was unsuccessful for the tourists . Captained by J. W. H. T. Douglas , the team was overwhelmed by Australia , losing all five Test matches . Wisden stated that the " chief cause of failure was the bowling " . The MCC had been reluctant to tour so soon after the war , and critics had predicted the bowling would be weak in Australian conditions , where the pitches were generally hard and good for batting . 
 At the beginning of November , before the first @-@ class matches began , Waddington was operated on for abscesses , and missed the first five games . He played only one first @-@ class match before the first Test , but took wickets in several minor matches . Selected for the first Test , he took the first wicket to fall in the game , that of Charlie Macartney , but failed to take another wicket in the match while conceding 88 runs , hampered by a leg injury in the later stages . He did not play another Test until the fourth , where he bowled five overs for 31 runs . Waddington ended the tour with seven wickets at an average of 46 @.@ 71 ; his single Test wicket was at a cost of 119 runs . The tour was a frustrating experience for Waddington , who found the heat difficult to deal with ; he was also unhappy that most of his appearances came in the non @-@ first @-@ class country matches , many against opponents fielding more than eleven players to make a more even fight . Throughout the tour , the press criticised Douglas for the way he used bowlers . Although Yorkshire used Waddington in short bursts with the objective of taking wickets , Douglas used him to bowl long defensive spells with the prime objective of run @-@ saving , a task to which Waddington was unsuited . Considered a failure — Wisden later described his tour as " a sad disappointment " — Waddington did not play for England again and was never seriously considered for a recall . He did have one batting success on the tour , scoring his maiden first @-@ class fifty against an " Australian XI " . 
 In the 1921 season , Waddington took 105 wickets at an average of 18 @.@ 94 . The introduction of the pace bowler George Macaulay into the team gave him more support , but according to a later edition of Wisden , Waddington 's form was poor that year . The almanack 's review of the 1921 season suggested that , when at full strength , Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship , but the team finished third . Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year : the county won the first of four successive championships , and Waddington took 133 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 08 . He was often effective in the most important matches . Wisden suggested that " Yorkshire were very good at every point , but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling ... [ Waddington ] was , on occasions , more successful against strong sides than he had ever been before . He had days of astonishing success and once , at least , bowled with a bewildering swerve [ i. e. swing bowling ] that recalled George Hirst at his best . " Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire ( the best of his career ) , seven wickets for six runs in a Sussex total of 20 and eight for 35 against Hampshire . His season ended with festival games at Eastbourne , where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex @-@ Royal Air Force servicemen . 
 = = = Injury and controversy = = = 
 Waddington was less effective in 1923 , and despite a good bowling average , he was inconsistent . In July , he slipped on wet grass when he was about to bowl against Leicestershire at <unk> Ground , Huddersfield ; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season , apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs . In September , the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament . The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective . In total , before his injury , he took 65 wickets at 18 @.@ 23 in 1923 . That season , he recorded his best figures with the bat ; after never having a first @-@ class batting average better than 12 in an English season , he scored 317 runs at 24 @.@ 38 , including his first fifty in England . 
 On his return in 1924 , Waddington bowled little in his first matches , but was used more in Yorkshire 's defeat by Middlesex at Lord 's where he bowled 42 overs to take three for 116 . Several Yorkshire players were absent , playing representative matches , but the game had consequences later in the season . In the return match at Sheffield in July , the Yorkshire players seemed determined to have revenge but could only secure a draw . Critics thought that the Yorkshire bowlers appealed excessively to the umpires , and the Middlesex players were barracked by the crowd . The journalist Alfred Pullin described the match as " a sorry exhibition of ill feeling and bad manners . " 
 The umpires reported Waddington to the cricket committee of the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out . Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires , finding him guilty of dissent , and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him to write a letter of apology to the MCC secretary . After the game , Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire ; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped . Later in 1924 , Yorkshire had another controversial match , this time against Surrey , where there were disputes on the field , but no official complaint was made . The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire 's problem ; Geoffrey Wilson resigned at the end of the season , and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team . The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period , although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match . Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 55 , but appeared less effective than before his injury . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Waddington took more than 100 wickets in a season for the final time in 1925 . Although his form was mixed , he achieved some good performances . Wisden attributed Yorkshire 's championship victory to their bowlers and suggested that " Waddington enjoyed a well @-@ merited success " . In total , he took 109 wickets at an average of 20 @.@ 24 . In 1926 both he and the other bowlers were less successful as Yorkshire slipped to second . Wisden noticed a decline in his bowling , but expected him to recover his form . He took 78 wickets at an average of 23 @.@ 30 , and scored his highest aggregate with the bat in a season , making 525 runs with two fifties . In the English winter of 1926 – 27 , he travelled to India and worked as a cricket coach . 
 Waddington 's bowling declined further in 1927 , to the point where Wisden suggested his record was poor and his " work was only occasionally worthy of his reputation " . The effectiveness of the other bowlers was similarly reduced , and combined with a cautious , safety @-@ first approach , Yorkshire had a mixed season and finished third . Waddington took 45 wickets at 32 @.@ 02 , and conceded a high number of runs on many occasions . However , in what was his last season , he scored his only first @-@ class century , an innings of 114 against Worcestershire . His final first @-@ class appearance was for the North against the South at the Folkestone Festival , where he bowled 16 overs without taking a wicket . At the end of the season , Waddington was offered a new contract despite his decline in bowling and continuing problems from his injured shoulder . He turned it down , ending his county cricket career . In all first @-@ class matches , Waddington took 852 wickets at an average of 19 @.@ 75 and scored 2 @,@ 527 runs at an average of 12 @.@ 89 with four fifties as well as the century . The following season , Yorkshire awarded him a testimonial of £ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 Waddington bowled with control , maintaining a good length while his action made the ball swing away from the batsman . For variation , he delivered an off @-@ cutter and when he bowled , the ball seemed to increase its speed after bouncing . He often bowled around the wicket . His curved run @-@ up began from the on side of the wicket , and he ran behind the umpire . He then released the ball from the corner of the bowling crease , creating a sharp angle for the batsman to face , sometimes using short deliveries with a ring of leg side fielders . Waddington modelled his bowling on that of George Hirst , a fellow left @-@ arm paceman who also acted as a coach and mentor to him in his early career , but Derek Hodgson notes that the two men were very different in personality : Waddington was far more quick @-@ tempered than Hirst . Waddington 's bowling action was noted for its excellence and perfection . Neville Cardus , the journalist and cricket writer , described it as " gloriously rhythmical " , and " so lovely that one simply cannot deny he is a good bowler . " But too often , Cardus suggested , he was " ever raising hopes that real greatness will come from him , only to disappoint again and again " . 
 Although Waddington scored a first @-@ class century in his final season , he did not live up to his batting potential despite a good style . A lower @-@ order batsman , he was inclined to be dismissed through playing irresponsible shots . Herbert Sutcliffe believed that , had he not been a bowler , Waddington may have developed into a leading batsman ; he wrote that Waddington " had as delightful a batting style as he had a bowling style . " But Sutcliffe suggested that Waddington did not possess the required patience : " He used to hit up a brilliant 30 or 40 before making a perfectly silly shot " . 
 Waddington resented the class divisions in English cricket , his feelings fuelled by experiences of officers in the war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920 – 21 . He fully embraced Yorkshire 's hard @-@ edged competitiveness in the early 1920s : he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen , both of which were unusual at the time . His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic <unk> , although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled . Anthony Woodhouse , the cricket historian , describes Waddington as a " wild and irresponsible ... quick @-@ tempered individual " . But there was another side to his personality ; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes , including monogrammed silk shirts . Sutcliffe , a close friend and team @-@ mate of Waddington , called him " a genial fellow in the dressing room ; a man with a rare personality , proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room , Abe generally ruled it , to all intents and purposes , the chairman . " The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that " at his best , [ Waddington ] was a magnificently hostile bowler with one of the most beautiful actions ever seen in cricket , and his pace and break @-@ back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen " . The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up : " Yes , a man of temper , Waddington , but a fine cricketer . " 
 = = Later life = = 
 When Waddington retired from first @-@ class cricket , he took over the family business . He played as a professional in the Birmingham League in 1928 , and for Accrington in 1929 and 1930 . He maintained friendships with several members of the Yorkshire team and was a pallbearer at Kilner 's funeral in 1928 . In 1954 – 55 , the Yorkshire player and England captain Len Hutton invited Waddington to accompany the members of the MCC team to Australia . En route by sea , the team visited the grave of Hedley Verity , the Yorkshire bowler who was killed in Italy in the Second World War and buried there . Including his visit as a player , Waddington made five trips to Australia . 
 Waddington had success in other sports , especially as an amateur football goalkeeper . He was with Bradford City in the 1920 – 21 football season , but did not play a match for them . For the 1921 – 22 season , he played for Halifax Town , making seven appearances in the Football League . He was a good enough golfer to represent Yorkshire , to partner Henry Cotton , and to play in the qualifying rounds of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1939 . Sutcliffe wrote that leading golfers told him that had Waddington not been a cricketer , he had the talent to have succeeded as a golfer , although he was prone to carelessness in his play . One Bradford golf club banned him after he poured a glass of beer over the captain , who Waddington believed had used inappropriate language in front of a woman . A motorcycling enthusiast , he regularly attended the Isle of Man TT , although his love of fast cars brought him trouble from the police at times . After one incident in 1938 , he was fined £ 5 for assaulting a policeman and using obscene language after being asked to dip his headlights . In 1950 , he was fined and banned from driving for a year after being found drunk while attempting to start up his car . In mitigation , his lawyer claimed he was suffering from " overwork , worry and insomnia . " 
 At the start of the Second World War , Waddington was appointed chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food . His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats . When the war concluded , he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered . The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944 , Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £ 1 @,@ 600 between them which should have gone to the latter 's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased . Waddington denied all knowledge ; his brother Priestley , another director at the family firm , said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington 's co @-@ defendant without the knowledge of Waddington . Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled that there was no way that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter , or that he was in any way responsible . 
 Waddington was married twice . In 1925 , he married Mabel <unk> ; none of his Yorkshire team @-@ mates were aware that he was getting married . In 1952 , he married Doris Garforth ; on this occasion , many of his former cricketing colleagues attended . After a long illness , Waddington died in a Scarborough nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66 . He was cremated in Bradford . 
 = 1995 Japanese Grand Prix = 
 The 1995 Japanese Grand Prix ( formally the XXI Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix ) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 October 1995 , at the Suzuka Circuit , Suzuka . It was the sixteenth and penultimate round of the 1995 Formula One season . The 53 @-@ lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after he started from pole position . Mika Häkkinen finished second in a McLaren , and Johnny Herbert third in the other Benetton car . 
 Jean Alesi , driving for Ferrari , started second , alongside Schumacher . However , Alesi was forced to serve a 10 @-@ second stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty because his car moved forward before the start . Alesi climbed back up to second , before retiring on lap 25 . Schumacher 's rival in the Drivers ' Championship , Damon Hill , started fourth amidst pressure from the British media after poor performances at previous races . Hill moved up to second because of Alesi 's retirement , but spun off the track on lap 40 . 
 Schumacher 's win was his ninth of the season , matching the record set in 1992 by Nigel Mansell . Benetton was confirmed Constructors ' Champions as Williams could not pass its points total in the one remaining race .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Heading into the penultimate race of the season , Benetton driver Michael Schumacher had already won the season 's Drivers ' Championship , having clinched the title at the previous race , the Pacific Grand Prix . Schumacher led the championship with 92 points ; Damon Hill was second with 59 points . A maximum of 20 points were available for the remaining two races , which meant that Hill could not catch Schumacher . Although the Drivers ' Championship was decided , the Constructors ' Championship was not . Benetton were leading on 123 points and Williams were second with 102 points heading into the 16th race , with a maximum of 32 points available . In the week leading up to the race , Hill was criticised by the British media after poor performances in previous races ; there was continued speculation that Williams were going to replace him with Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen or Gerhard Berger for the 1996 season . Despite the rumours , Williams team boss Frank Williams gave Hill " an unequivocal vote of confidence " heading into the race . 
 There were two driver changes heading into the race . Having been in one of the two Sauber cars since the fifth race of the season at Monaco , Jean @-@ Christophe Boullion was released from the team and replaced by Karl Wendlinger . The Austrian was given another chance to prove himself after suffering an accident at the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix , which left him in a coma for weeks . The second driver change was Mika Häkkinen 's return to McLaren after missing the Pacific Grand Prix because of an operation for appendicitis . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying = = = 
 Two practice sessions were held before the race ; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning . Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout . Schumacher was fastest in the first session , posting a time of 1 : 40 @.@ 410 , two @-@ tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen . The Williams and Ferrari cars occupied the remaining top six positions ; Williams drivers Hill and David Coulthard third and fifth respectively . The Ferraris were fourth and sixth fastest ; Jean Alesi ahead of Berger . Häkkinen lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1 : 40 @.@ 389 . Eddie Irvine took second place in the Jordan car , three @-@ tenths of a second behind Häkkinen . Hill was third in the Williams , two @-@ tenths behind Häkkinen , with Schumacher fourth behind Hill . The Ferraris were fifth and eighth ; Alesi in front of Berger . Frentzen 's Sauber and Coulthard 's Williams split the Ferraris . Despite both the Williams cars going off into the gravel , Hill and Coulthard made the top 10 . 
 The qualifying session was split into two one @-@ hour sessions ; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon . The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid position . Schumacher clinched his tenth career pole position , in his Benetton B195 , with a time of 1 : 38 @.@ 023 . He was joined on the front row by Alesi , who was eight @-@ tenths of a second behind . Schumacher was particularly pleased with the performance of his Benetton , saying that " I have rarely had such a good car ... I think I can be confident for the race " . Alesi was satisfied about his performance , but worried about a mechanical problem which had caused him to crash on Friday , accusing the Ferrari team of withholding information from him . Alesi was scheduled to leave Ferrari for Benetton in a swap with Schumacher at the end of the season , and the relationship between him and the team was becoming increasingly strained . Häkkinen was third in the McLaren , with Hill fourth , a second slower than Schumacher . Despite Häkkinen 's best qualifying effort of the season alongside his Belgium third place , his teammate , Mark Blundell , had a disappointing qualifying session . In the first part of qualifying , Blundell crashed into the wall , meaning he could not set a time as his car was too badly damaged . Blundell had his second crash of the weekend at the 130R corner in Saturday practice , which was more serious than the first . Following medical advice , Blundell did not participate in the second qualifying session . He was unable to set a time , leaving him at the back of the grid . Aguri Suzuki crashed his Ligier during Saturday qualifying ; he was unable to start the race since he was in a hospital with a broken rib .

 The track surface was damp for most of the race , which meant that lap times were slower than the previous days ' qualifying sessions . The drivers took to the track at 09 : 30 JST ( GMT + 9 ) for a 30 @-@ minute warmup session . Despite underperforming in qualifying , both Williams cars performed better in the wet weather warmup session ; Hill had the fastest time of 2 : 00 @.@ 025 . Coulthard was third in the other Williams car ; Schumacher split them in second position . Alesi completed the top four , eight @-@ tenths of a second behind Hill . Though 24 cars qualified for the race , only 22 took the start : Suzuki was unable to start because of his crash in qualifying and Roberto Moreno 's Forti car suffered a gearbox problem . For the first time since the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka in 1987 , tickets for the race did not sell out , despite the fact that three Japanese drivers entered the race . 
 The race started at 14 : 00 JST . All of the drivers opted to start on wet weather tyres as the track was damp from the morning rain . Schumacher , from pole position on the grid , held onto the lead into the first corner . Alesi , who started alongside Schumacher , was judged to have jumped the start , and served a 10 @-@ second stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty on lap three , from which he returned to the race in tenth place . Alesi 's teammate Berger also jumped the start and received the same penalty . Gianni Morbidelli , near the back of the field in one of the Footwork cars , spun at the first corner on lap one after being hit from behind by Wendlinger 's Sauber . Morbidelli stalled his car in the process , forcing him to retire from the race . On lap seven , Alesi stopped at the pits to change to dry weather slick tyres , as the track was beginning to dry . On returning to the race , he began to make his way through the field constantly recording fastest laps ; the first of which was 1 : 54 @.@ 416 , five seconds faster than the remainder of the field . Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 10 for slicks , handing the lead to Häkkinen for a lap before he too pitted . Alesi 's progress was interrupted when he spun attempting to pass Pedro Lamy 's Minardi for 15th place , but he made his way up to second by lap 10 , overtaking Hill around the outside in the final chicane to take the place . Alerted by Alesi 's pace on the slick tyres , the other drivers came into the pits to change to slick tyres . 
 The two Jordan cars collided on lap 15 . Rubens Barrichello spun in the final chicane when he attempted to brake later than his teammate Irvine . Barrichello hit a wall , which damaged his car 's rear wing and caused him to retire from the race . Irvine was involved in another collision at the chicane on lap 20 when Frentzen hit him from behind . Irvine continued without damage , but Frentzen had to pit for a new front wing . At the front , Alesi was lapping faster than Schumacher , even though Schumacher was on dry tyres . Alesi was only six seconds behind Schumacher when his Ferrari 412T2 suffered an apparent differential failure on lap 25 . It was later discovered that the problem was a driveshaft failure , possibly as a result of his earlier spin . Schumacher pitted for a second time on lap 31 , returning to the race in second place behind Hill . Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on lap 33 , and regained his lead on the next lap when Hill made his pit stop . Behind them , Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth respectively before their pit stops , but Coulthard pitted six laps later than Häkkinen and returned to the track in third place , one place ahead of the Finn . Johnny Herbert was fifth in the second Benetton car after the second round of pit stops , with Irvine rounding out the point @-@ scoring places in sixth . 
 At this stage , the rain began to fall again , but only at the Spoon Curve end of the track . The Williams drivers were second and third until Hill ran off the track at Spoon Curve two laps after his pit stop . He damaged his front wing in the process and returned to the track in fourth . Hill returned to the pits to let his pit crew replace the damaged wing . He rejoined fifth , but was then given a ten @-@ second stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty for speeding in the pitlane . Coulthard made the same mistake as his teammate by running through the gravel trap at the Spoon Curve but looked like he was going to escape with only minor damage . However , as he braked for 130R , the next corner , the gravel which had entered his sidepods flew out , causing him to lose control and get his car stuck in the gravel trap . Hill was told by his team on the radio to speed up as he had not yet taken his stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty , but later that lap he spun off at Spoon Curve and retired from the race without having taken the penalty . Blundell , Irvine and Frentzen also left the track at Spoon Curve but all finished the race . With his closest challenger out , Schumacher won the race after 53 laps to secure his ninth victory of the season in a time of 1 : 36 : 52 @.@ 930 . The win , along with Herbert 's third place and the retirements of Hill and Coulthard , gave Benetton the 1995 Constructors ' Championship . Häkkinen finished second in his McLaren , 20 seconds behind Schumacher . Irvine was fourth in his Jordan with Olivier Panis fifth in his Ligier . Mika Salo took sixth place and the final point in his Tyrrell . Despite starting last , Blundell finished in seventh , just 1 @.@ 6 seconds behind Salo . The delayed Frentzen , Luca Badoer , Wendlinger , Lamy and Taki Inoue completed the finishers .

 This was Schumacher 's last win for Benetton , as he moved to the Ferrari team for the 1996 season . Herbert reiterated Schumacher 's opinion by stating that Benetton did " a fantastic job " . Hill was disappointed about the race and the season as a whole ; he said afterwards : 
 Just when you think that it couldn 't get any worse , it does . There is no easy way out of this , you just have to keep pressing on . The easiest thing to do is to give up , and it would probably be less painful that way , but that is not an option . While we were in the race we were competitive and I was in with a shout , I suppose , all the time I was on the track . But things took a massive turn for the worse , I am afraid . I drove through the rain and the second time I spun off I think it was oil rather than rain . It is not a glorious end to the season but the ingredients are all there and there is no reason why we should not get into the winning habit again . 
 As a result of Hill not taking his 10 @-@ second stop @-@ and @-@ go penalty because of his retirement , Williams were fined $ 10 @,@ 000 by Formula One 's governing body , the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) . In an interview with Motor Sport magazine in 2008 , Hill said that the 1995 season , as a whole , " went down , mentally , and it all just got to me " . He also said he believed that it was in 1995 that Frank Williams and Patrick Head decided to replace him for the 1997 season . 
 1980 Formula One World Champion Alan Jones praised Alesi 's performance , saying that it " will go down as one of the great drives in Grand Prix racing " . Alesi stated that if his driveshaft had not failed , he would " have fought for it , all the way to the end " . Alesi added that he believed he did not jump the start , but admitted that " the car crept forwards by a few centimetres " because of the downhill slope of the grid . In an interview with Autosport magazine in 2009 , Alesi said that he went to see the race director before the race to see how he could avoid a penalty at the downhill start and that he was " totally fed up " with the penalty decision given . Berger also questioned his penalty , claiming that his car did not move before the green light went on .

 = German FK cruiser designs = 
 The German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) created a series of fleet cruiser designs — designated <unk> — in 1916 to follow the Cöln @-@ class cruisers ordered in 1915 . They were initially intended to favor high speed for reconnaissance over the heavier gun armament of the Cöln class , though by the final iterations , they were as powerful as the earlier class . The design staff ultimately drew up five different designs : FK 1 , FK 1a , FK 2 , FK 3 , and FK 4 . The proposals ranged in size from 3 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ; 3 @,@ 300 short tons ) to 7 @,@ 500 t ( 7 @,@ 400 long tons ; 8 @,@ 300 short tons ) designed displacement and were armed with a main battery of between five and eight 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns . Each proposed design grew in size over the preceding draft , as the weaponry and propulsion systems were increased . None of the designs were built , owing to shifting construction priorities in the German Navy in the last year of World War I. 
 = = FK 1 and FK 1a = = 
 By 1916 , thirteen German light cruisers had been lost in the course of World War I. To replace them , the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers of the Cöln class . The next design , under the provisional name FK 1 , or <unk> ( Fleet cruiser ) , was prepared in 1916 . The design , which emphasized the reconnaissance role and high speed over combat power , was based on the British C @-@ class cruisers at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II . A modified design , named FK 1a , was a slightly larger vessel . 
 FK 1 was 128 meters ( 420 ft ) long at the waterline and 130 m ( 430 ft ) long overall . The design had a beam of 11 @.@ 6 m ( 38 ft ) ; its forward draft was 4 @.@ 9 m ( 16 ft ) and the aft draft was 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 ft ) . The ship would have had a double bottom of approximately 52 percent of the length of the hull , and fifteen watertight compartments . The hull was constructed with longitudinal steel frames . As designed , the ship would have had a displacement of 3 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ; 3 @,@ 300 short tons ) , with a full load combat displacement of 3 @,@ 800 t ( 3 @,@ 700 long tons ; 4 @,@ 200 short tons ) . The modified FK 1a was slightly larger , at 131 meters ( 430 ft ) long at the waterline and 136 m ( 446 ft ) long overall . The modified design had a beam of 12 @.@ 4 m ( 41 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft ) . The ship 's hull would have been constructed as in FK 1 , with the same number of watertight compartments and extent of double bottom . As designed , the ship would have had a displacement of 4 @,@ 025 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 961 long tons ; 4 @,@ 437 short tons ) , with a full load combat displacement of 4 @,@ 850 t ( 4 @,@ 770 long tons ; 5 @,@ 350 short tons ) . 
 Both designs would have been powered by two sets of Marine @-@ type steam turbines that each drove a three @-@ bladed screw 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) wide in diameter . FK 1 would have been equipped with five Marine @-@ type oil @-@ fired watertube boilers , while FK 1a would have had improved double @-@ ended models . The propulsion system of FK 1 was rated at a maximum of 48 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 36 @,@ 000 kW ) for a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . The improved engines of FK 1a were rated at 52 @,@ 000 shp ( 39 @,@ 000 kW ) and a maximum speed of 33 kn ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . The designs carried up to 1 @,@ 000 t ( 980 long tons ; 1 @,@ 100 short tons ) and 1 @,@ 150 t ( 1 @,@ 130 long tons ; 1 @,@ 270 short tons ) of fuel oil , respectively , which permitted a cruising radius of 2 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 200 km ; 3 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 17 kn ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . Both designs were equipped with three diesel generators that produced 300 kilowatts ( 400 hp ) at 220 volts . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . 
 The armament of both designs consisted of five 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in single mounts , one forward , two abreast of the conning tower , and two in a superfiring pair aft of the rear superstructure . The 15 cm gun fired a 45 @-@ kilogram ( 99 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 740 ft / s ) . FK 1 and FK 1a were supplied with 500 and 650 shells for their main batteries , respectively . The guns had a range of 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) . Both designs were equipped with a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns , mounted on the centerline amidships . The guns were equipped with 100 rounds of ammunition each . These guns fired a 10 kg ( 22 lb ) shells . Both ships would have carried four 60 cm ( 24 in ) torpedo tubes mounted on the deck in swivel launchers . FK 1a was also equipped with 100 mines . Both designs called for a crew of 15 officers and 342 enlisted men .
