 The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets . This is because of the implications of the Mundell – Fleming model , which implies a central bank cannot ( without capital controls ) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously , because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency . In the years following the Single European Act , the EU has liberalised its capital markets , and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy , the exchange @-@ rate regime of the euro is flexible , or floating . The result of the ECB maintaining historically low interest rates and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe 's main trading partners . However , in 2010 , the euro started on a sharp decline . Starting at U.S $ 1 @.@ 60 in 2008 , and dropping to US $ 1 @.@ 04 in 2015 . The Canadian Dollar despite seeing a decline in value against the USD , has seen a growth in EURO - > [ CAD ] .

 The euro is the second @-@ most widely held reserve currency after the U.S. dollar . After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 ( 25 October vs the U.S. dollar , 26 October vs Japanese Yen , 3 May vs Pound Sterling ) . Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 ( 15 July vs U.S. dollar , 23 July vs Japanese Yen , 29 December vs Pound Sterling ) . With the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell , only to regain later . Despite pressure due to the European sovereign @-@ debt crisis the euro remained stable . In November 2011 the euro 's exchange rate index – measured against currencies of the bloc 's major trading partners – was trading almost two percent higher on the year , approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007 .

 The formal titles of the currency are euro for the major unit and cent for the minor ( one hundredth ) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages ; according to the ECB , all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular . This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages , e.g. , those where there is no eu diphthong . Bulgaria has negotiated an exception ; euro in the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as <unk> ( <unk> ) and not <unk> ( euro ) in all official documents . In the Greek script the term <unk> ( <unk> ) is used ; the Greek " cent " coins are denominated in <unk> / <unk> ( <unk> / á ) . Official practice for English @-@ language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural , although the European Commission 's Directorate @-@ General for Translation states that the plural forms euros and cents should be used in English .

 Nobel memorial prize @-@ winning economist James Meade thought that a central bank should not make price stability the objective of aggregate demand management . When prices are likely to be pushed up due to increase of indirect taxes or adverse terms @-@ of @-@ trade shocks , the surge in prices must be cancelled out by decline in domestic money wage costs , as long as such a price stability policy is adopted . There would be unemployment in the all industrial sectors under a price stabilisation policy , suggesting that in the short run the elasticity of demand for labour is low . 
 Under the ECB 's price stabilisation policy , many people in the eurozone have difficulty finding a job . The unemployment rate of Spain is around 25 percent in 2014 , and an economic forecast says that the figure will not decrease below 20 percent until 2017 . 
 <unk> , the statistics agency of Greece , shows that Greece 's unemployment rate was 27 percent in June 2014 . OECD forecasts that Greece 's unemployment rate will remain around 27 percent until 2016 . Due to long @-@ term unemployment , skills of jobless persons have been depreciated and their motivation of finding jobs has been lost , which causes the country 's level of unemployment to remain high . 
 Spain 's youth unemployment rate is 53 @.@ 8 percent in July 2014 , and this is the highest figure in the eurozone . This figure is comparable to 53 @.@ 1 percent of the Greek youth unemployment in May 2014 . 
 In July 2014 , the averaged unemployment rate of the eurozone is 11 @.@ 7 percent , slight decrease from 11 @.@ 9 percent in 2013 . 
 Likewise , Paul Krugman argued that the existence of a single shared currency across the entire eurozone , in combination with tight money policies of the ECB ( motivated by insistence of Germany on low inflation ) , placed much of the Southern Europe in a state of permanent high unemployment . According to Krugman , during the period between the creation of the euro and the 2008 financial crisis , countries of Southern Europe experienced abnormally high rates of wage growth due to high influx of investor money . Between 2000 and 2008 , unit labor costs actually declined slightly in Germany , but rose by 30 % in Spain and Greece . This created an imbalance that put these countries at competitive disadvantage relative to Northern Europe . Returning to full employment at this point requires that the labor costs gap is somehow cancelled . If Spain and Greece had their own currencies , this would have easily happened through exchange rate adjustment . Since they don 't , it can either happen through a decrease in nominal wages in Spain and Greece , also known as " internal devaluation " , ( an extremely difficult and slow process , since nominal wages , in general , exhibit downward rigidity ) , or through an equal increase in nominal wages ( i.e. inflation ) in Northern Europe , which does not happen because of active resistance from Germany . 
 = María Teresa Ferrari = 
 María Teresa Ferrari ( 11 October 1887 – 30 October 1956 ) was an Argentine educator , medical doctor , and women 's rights activist . She was the first female university professor in Latin America and one of the first women allowed to teach medicine . She was a pioneering researcher in women 's health , studying the use of radiation therapy rather than surgery for uterine tumors and developing a vaginoscope which revolutionized women 's health care in Brazil . She established the first maternity ward and gynecological services at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires in 1925 , which provided the first incubation services in the country . 
 Born into a wealthy family , whose forebears had been involved in ensuring Argentina 's independence from Spain , she was not expected to work outside the home . Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career , she insisted on participating in the male @-@ dominated medical profession . She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher , then graduated in medicine in 1911 . After completing her residency , she applied to teach at the university level , but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery . Outraged , she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career . In 1927 , Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate . Finally in 1939 , she was awarded a full professorship . 
 Ferrari undertook additional medical study in Europe and the United States , learning pioneering techniques that she brought back to Argentina . She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris , earning the first diploma ever given to a woman . She designed a vaginoscope , studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute , and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University . She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital . An ardent feminist , she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936 , and pushed for recognition of both civil and political rights for women . When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s , she was pushed out of the hospital and later , in the early 1950s , out of teaching . She died in 1956 .

 María Teresa Ferrari Alvarado was born on 11 October 1887 in Buenos Aires , Argentina to David Ferrari White and Catalina Alvarado . Her family were among the founding citizens of Argentina : her paternal great @-@ grandfather , Guillermo Pío White had provided money to assist the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata in defeating the Spanish and her maternal great @-@ grandfather <unk> Alvarado had served in the Army of the Andes . 
 Ferrari enrolled at the Normal School Nº 1 of Buenos Aires , receiving her teaching certificate in 1903 . For a woman of Ferrari 's social class , paid work was unusual at the time . It was understood that in cases of financial necessity poor women might nurse or teach , because both were considered charitable , but upper class women were expected to be no more than wives and mothers . Ignoring convention , she embarked on a career in medicine , but also began teaching . Ferrari taught at the Colegio William Morris and the Escuela Nº 3 Bernardino Rivadavia . She had studied psychology in a cutting @-@ edge field known as " experimental psychology " and applied it to her classes , which caused the authorities to launch an investigation into her teaching methods . She was allowed to continue teaching , as her techniques of motivating students and encouraging them to learn proved effective . 
 In 1904 , Ferrari enrolled in medical school at the National University of Buenos Aires while continuing to teach . There had been five other women in the history of Argentina who had earned medical degrees , and though her enrollment was not desired , there was no legal precedent to bar her admittance . In her first year , she was assigned to work as an assistant to Joaquín <unk> in his pathology research , which inspired her continued participation in medical research . Ferrari graduated in 1911 , and that same year , she married another graduating doctor , Nicolás M. Gaudino . In 1918 the couple had their only child , <unk> <unk> Gaudino . Ferrari was sometimes known as María Teresa Ferrari de Gaudino or simply María Teresa de Gaudino .

 = = = Struggle for a university professorship = = = 
 In 1914 , Ferrari started work at the obstetrics clinic of the Hospital Ramos Mejía of Buenos Aries . She applied to teach obstetrics at the university but was turned down . In the proceedings of the Honorable Consejo <unk> ( HCD ) on 23 June 1915 , it was stated : " Despite their qualifications , for physiological and psychological reasons people of the feminine sex do not meet the required conditions to be engaged as professors in the Faculty [ of Medicine ] " . The following year , she was permitted to teach at the School of Midwifery , but this lacked the prestige and credentials of a professorship at the university . When an opening for an alternate professorship appeared in 1919 , Ferrari reapplied to the university but was met with resistance . The members of the HCD delayed calling together the jurors to fill the vacancy until 1925 , altering evidence , ignoring recommendations , and evading a decision . In 1926 , she sent a detailed outline of her accomplishments to the committee , stating that she had taught in secondary schools for 20 years and had dedicated 15 years to her field of medicine , and had enrolled in university courses for nine years . One adviser , Dr. Speroni , having read her qualifications , sent a message to the dean imploring that they admit her , on the grounds that she was qualified , had shown dedication and the school was understaffed . It was not until 1927 , that the jurors met and her application for an alternate professorship was approved by a vote of thirteen to two . The news of the first female university professor in Latin America made headlines throughout Spanish @-@ speaking countries . Newspapers in Argentina including La Prensa , La Nación , La Razón and others of the capital , El Censor in <unk> , Los Andes in Mendoza , Buenos Aires Sud in Florencio Varela , and the Italian La Patria degli Italiani and Spanish El Diario Español carried stories of her triumph . 
 In the interim , rather than await a decision , Ferrari continued her studies . Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe , including facilities in Austria , Belgium , England , France , Germany and Italy . She assisted in the clinic of Marie Curie in Paris as well as in the Columbia Hospital for Women and Lying @-@ In Asylum in Washington , DC . The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring . In 1924 , she designed a vaginoscope , which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple <unk> than previous models . The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil , and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro . The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville , Spain . 
 Ferrari was particularly interested in investigating alternatives to surgery and her studies on radiation therapy at the Curie Institute became the basis for a 1928 thesis on " Treating Uterine tumors with radiation " . In 1925 , she was appointed as the Argentine governmental delegate to the First Child Welfare Congress in Geneva . One of the major topics of the conference was the training of midwives in labor and hygiene practices . When her professorship was finally approved and she returned to Argentina , a celebration was held on 11 August 1927 at the Jockey Club of Buenos Aires , attended by the Minister of the Interior , José P. <unk> ; the Director of the Hospital Militar , Alberto <unk> ; her research mentor , Joaquín <unk> ; and many colleagues , peers , family members and friends . Ferrari was appointed head of gynecology and maternity at Hospital Militar in Buenos Aires , a post which she held until 1939 . 
 = = = Mid @-@ career development = = = 
 Ferrari traveled to Mexico , the United States , and Canada in 1929 , studying for eight months and attending conferences . In the United States , she participated in a Caesarean section at Columbia University , becoming the first Argentine to have performed a surgery in Washington , D.C .. The baby born as a result of the surgery was named " Argentina " . In 1930 , she served as the Argentine delegate for the VII Medical Congress of Latin America held in Mexico and presided over the first general session . She presented three papers ; one addressed uterine tumors and the other two were about syphilis . She was also the delegate for the 2nd Congress of the Pan @-@ American Medical Association in Panama . Between 1930 and 1932 she returned to the United States for additional studies which focused on <unk> , septicemia , puerperal infections , investigating whether vaccines could be developed to prevent the development of conditions resulting from childbirth or miscarriage . 
 In 1936 , Ferrari founded the Argentina Federation of University Women ( FAMU ) with the goal of improving the social and legal standing of women and specifically opening educational doors . She recruited professional women , including doctors , dentists and lawyers and organized scientific and cultural discussions and seminars . FAMU had regular courses in French , German , physical education and mathematics , which it offered to its nearly 100 members . The political and civic limitations that threatened these women 's careers was clearly a concern and the organization 's official statement supported enfranchisement as " not a mere political aspiration for women , but a real right acquired by suffering , work and deprivation experienced by women ... " In 1938 , the Argentine organization joined the International Federation of University Women , which had served as Ferrari 's inspiration . 
 = = = Military hospital and later career = = = 
 In 1925 , Ferrari was called to assist a military wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires , which had no gynecological unit . After she proposed that one be developed , Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies . The military gazette began <unk> from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital . As military wives became aware of the services , the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms , their own sterilization facility , a recovery unit , and forty beds in private rooms . She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator , the first of its kind in Argentina . Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina . Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades , there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it . Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases , advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary . A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of the maternity unit was attended by the Minister of War , the Director General of Health , the Hospital Director and other senior officials , as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families . A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari 's unit made a substantial donation . Despite her success , the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile . Following the 1930 coup d 'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country 's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade , Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939 . 
 Ferrari 's disappointment at having to leave the hospital was offset in 1939 , when she was finally made a full professor , receiving the title " <unk> <unk> " of the Obstetrics Faculty . Throughout the 1940s she continued her education , traveling to Cuba , New York , Pennsylvania , Peru , and Puerto Rico , publishing her research in a variety of journals . In 1946 she resigned as president of the Argentina Federation of University Women , but continued to represent the organization at conferences , like the Primer Congreso <unk> de Mujeres , which she attended in Guatemala City in 1947 . 
 After 43 years of teaching at Normal School Nº 3 , Ferrari was forced into retirement by the Ministry of Education because she refused to participate in a political contribution fund . She was also asked to resign from her position as Professor of Psychology at Colegio William Morris . In 1952 , rather than join the Peronista supporters and betray her ideals , she took full retirement . When elected , Perón had instituted a massive overhaul of the health system of Argentina . He appointed Ramón Carrillo as his health minister , and in the beginning , hospital beds were added , vaccination programs were instituted , a campaign against malaria was launched , and other improvements were made . However , by the early 1950s it was clear that policies were unevenly applied , implementation was erratic , and political cronyism was working against the provision of health services for those most in need . Two years after Ferrari resigned , Carrillo also resigned , disillusioned with the Perón administration . 
 Ferrari was a full member of the Argentine Association of Surgery , the Argentine Medical Association and the Argentine Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Buenos Aires . She also was a correspondent member of the Society of Medicine and Surgery of Rio de Janeiro . 
 Ferrari died on 30 October 1956 in Buenos Aires .

 = Kepier power station = 
 Kepier power station refers to a cancelled coal @-@ fired power station on the River Wear at Kepier , 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) north east of Durham , County Durham , North East England . Planned by the North Eastern Electric Supply Company ( NESCo ) in 1944 , it was never realised as the scheme faced stiff opposition from those who claimed it would obstruct views of the historic Durham Cathedral from the East Coast Main Line . A number of people supported the scheme as it would help meet the increasing demand for electricity and provide much needed jobs in the post @-@ depression , post @-@ war economy of Britain . The station , which had been designed by architect Giles Gilbert Scott , would have been operational by the late 1940s and would have generated 150 megawatts of electricity . However , following a public inquiry the plans were not approved and instead NESCo installed new capacity at their existing power stations . 
 = = Background = = 
 After several years of preliminary planning , surveying sites and drawing up plans , the North Eastern Electric Supply Company ( NESCo ) bought the site of a large rifle range , over both sides of the River Wear , at Kepier , 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) north east of the city of Durham , and in early 1944 publicly announced their plans to build a large coal @-@ fired power station on the site . The station was part of a post @-@ war plan by NESCo , and the scheme had a projected cost of £ 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . The site was chosen in the mid @-@ Durham area to be close to the coal supplies . It also needed to be a short distance from the River Wear , downstream of Durham , and on solid foundations . Mine workings in County Durham restricted the number of possible sites which could meet the requirement for solid foundations . The site also required good road and rail access . 
 The estimated build time for the station was around four years , and once completed the station was expected to employ around 300 people . In June 1944 , NESCo formally submitted their plans for consent of construction . 
 = = Design = = 
 The station 's site plans and elevations were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott . He had previously designed Battersea Power Station in London , and so the designs of the Kepier station were considered to have been of a very high architectural quality . NESCo claimed that the design of the station would be considered " a credit to the whole district " . The main station building was to be 135 feet ( 41 m ) in height . 
 The station would have burned between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 tonnes of low @-@ grade coal per week , to produce 150 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity . The coal was to be taken from mines in County Durham , and transported to the station by the Durham goods branch of the <unk> Line railway , which terminated at nearby <unk> . New sidings would have been required to reach the site from the railway line , which would have required cutting into the hillside above Kepier . Upon arriving at the station , coal would have been discharged from the wagons 135 feet ( 41 m ) above the station and transported via a conveyor belt over six arches down to the station itself . 
 The coal burnt would have had an estimated ash content of between 14 % and 22 % , and so at a cost of £ 160 @,@ 000 , the company were to install electrostatic precipitators , to remove 97 % of the dust from the smoke and waste gases from combustion , before leaving the two 350 feet ( 110 m ) high chimneys . The view at the time was that the remaining dust that would leave the chimney 's would not have caused " any appreciable pollution " , and the waste gases , consisting of carbon dioxide , were thought not to " cause any injury or harm to the inhabitants of the city , to buildings or to vegetation . " 
 Between 350 and 450 tonnes of bottom ash clinker would be produced by the station per week . NESCo intended to sell this on to local construction companies as a construction material and believed there was a ready market for this . Fly ash from the precipitators would also have built up , and NESCo claimed they would have spread this on land to the west of the station , and mixed it with soil to produce a 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) high spoil tip . 
 The station would have featured six 170 feet ( 52 m ) high cooling towers . It was said that there would be provision to prevent excessive amounts of steam leaving the cooling towers , with no haze coming from the towers on 95 % of days of the year . 
 = = Criticism and support = = 
 When the plans were first announced the county surveyor raised no objections , and it was not until October 1943 and onwards that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning began to increasingly warn of the opposition that was bound to arise against the scheme . 
 The plans were strongly opposed by Thomas Wilfred Sharp , an urban planner from Durham , who thought that the station would intrude on the city 's skyline . They were also opposed by The City of Durham Preservation Society ( now the City of Durham Trust ) which had been founded two years earlier . At the time the station had been given the go ahead by Durham City Council and the planning authority , but the Trust believed the station 's tall chimneys and cooling towers would dwarf the nearby Durham Cathedral . 
 NESCo argued that they thought the power station would enhance the city 's attractions , with people coming to see the power station itself . At the least , they tried to assure the public that if built , the station would take as little away from the city as possible . An official statement from the company stated : 
 " Consultants of every kind will be employed in connection with the construction , and the City Corporation can rest assured that every precaution will be taken both in the design and the working of the station to cause as little harm as possible to the amenities of the City . " 
 NESCo also argued that they had chosen the site to protect the city 's amenities , in that it was outside the city boundary , partially surrounded by higher ground , and in the lee of prevailing winds . They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings . 
 Local trade unions , Durham County Council , and even the Farmers ' Union were in support of the scheme , along with a number of private persons , the general reason being that it would bring a new form of employment to the city and surrounding areas . Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region , and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city 's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station . Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built , County Durham coal would be used in it , and that despite NESCo 's claims , there may be more suitable sites elsewhere . The critics claimed that Durham 's functioning as a cultural , educational , administrative and tourist centre , would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation . 
 At a meeting of Durham County Council on 26 July 1944 , J.W. Foster , chairman of the Finance Committee of the council , spoke in favour of the proposals , claiming they would fulfill the Government 's White Paper on Employment Policy , and its policy on the rehabilitation of depressed areas . At the outbreak of war , the north of the country had still not fully recovered from the Great Depression of the 1930s , and Foster believed the employment the station 's construction and maintenance provided would help prevent a return to those conditions . It was also seen that the station would generally improve the supply of electricity for industry . He pointed out that the criticism of the scheme was based entirely on assumption that the station would " destroy the Medieval charm of the city " , without taking into account the thoughts of the experts who designed the station . He also pointed out that the critics made their comments without any suggestion of an alternative , and that their campaign against the scheme had attracted publicity through a BBC broadcast . 
 Foster also claimed that if any other feasible site could be found , then it should be used to avoid any violation of the view . However , he warned that the interest of the county 's economy should be put in front of the concerns of " those ill @-@ informed critics , who view Durham from the railway ... passing from one more fortunate district to another . " Durham MP Charles Grey later referred to the development as " vital to the well being of the County of Durham " . 
 British architect Frederick Gibberd published a diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station typical of the design of the time , like the one planned at Kepier . This made clear that , although the Cathedral was one of the largest in the country , it still would looked small next to the projected power station . It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously , the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral . Somewhat ironically , Gibberd 's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003 . 
 Although geographically located 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north east and 100 feet ( 30 m ) lower , it was thought that Kepier power station would dominate any view into which it entered and that it would enter into most of the views in the city . A Northern Echo reader summarised these ideas in 1944 : 
 " As the traveller by train approaches Kepier and Durham from the North there would meet his eye in the foreground this vast power station . Kepier , a local beauty spot , and the picturesque remains of Kepier Hospital , a building of much historic interest , would be blotted out , the Castle and Cathedral beyond would be dwarfed by an incongruous mass of concrete buildings ill sorting with the landscape . " 
 = = Inquiry = = 
 After the suggestion by the head of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed , the Government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened . A public inquiry into the plans was opened in December 1944 , with the hearing lasting for three days . The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the inquiry . The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New . The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society , chaired by Cyril Alington . 
 NESCo were represented by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner . The NESCo representatives argued that although the company already supplied around 85 % of the North East region , a great deal more generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come , and that the mid @-@ Durham area was the best place to erect a new station . Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham . John Hacking , chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board , backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined , and consent and new arrangements had to be made , they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948 . 
 A 11 @.@ 8 kilograms ( 26 lb ) Plasticine model of the station , city and surroundings was used in the inquiry . It was accompanied by a certificate of <unk> , issued by the Electricity Commissioners . Photographs of the city were also shown with the power station superimposed . 
 During the hearing , Hurcomb pointed out a letter published in The Times in July 1944 , in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham , and Warden of the Durham Colleges , had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line , an idea compounded by the publication a few days later of a photograph taken from the proposed site . He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined , and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church , Hurcomb emphasised that the majority of the beautiful views around the city would remain . Pepler also found that from the railway station , the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously . The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go @-@ ahead , based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon . 
 The City of Durham Preservation Society , however , argued that with so many of Europe 's finest monuments being destroyed in the Second World War , Durham and its Cathedral was a gem which had survived both the war and the " industrial despoliation which had laid waste so much of the rest of the County " . Pepler supported the view that Durham was more suited as an administrative , shopping , and tourist centre , than it was for large @-@ scale industrial development . 
 Legal and political difficulties caused a long delay in reaching a decision . An important issue was whether or not the inquiry was subject to the new Town and Country Planning Act of 1944 . NESCo from the beginning challenged the right of the Minister of Town and Planning , W. S. Morrison , to convene an inquiry at all . The initial legal advice to the Government was that it was not subject , and the inquiry was convened with terms of reference that they were to consider whether a proposed new or extended station could supply sufficient electricity to meet the needs of consumers at no greater cost than any alternative source of supply . In Hurcomb 's view the inquiry could not refuse consent if these conditions were met . A later decision by the Treasury Solicitor that the inquiry was , in fact , subject to the Act had the effect of paralysing decision making . 
 If Hurcomb persisted in adhering to his terms of reference and approved the power station , but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent on the grounds of the objections , NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site . The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of the question that they would be able to afford the large amount involved and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves . If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to do just that . Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed . The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times , and Frank Tribe , secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power , wrote to Hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring the inquiry to a decision . 
 Eventually , Hurcomb put forward at a ministerial meeting a solution whereby the members of the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme , but due to the opposition of Morrison , they had decided not to proceed to a decision . Although NESCo were initially hostile , in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds , thus entitling them to <unk> . The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections , and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage , they would have refused consent anyway .

 Ultimately , the decision of the inquiry went against NESCo and those in support of the station , and the company dropped their plans . NESCo received an ex gratia payment of £ 6 @,@ 650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point . The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it . On 9 October 1945 , Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis <unk> made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier , sufficing the demand for electricity , and meaning no station was needed at Kepier . 
 = Brummer @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Brummer class consisted of two light mine @-@ laying cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy in World War I : SMS Brummer and SMS Bremse . When the war broke out , the Germans had only two older mine @-@ laying cruisers . Although most German cruisers were fitted for mine @-@ laying , a need for fast specialized ships existed . The Imperial Russian Navy had ordered a set of steam turbines for the Borodino @-@ class battlecruiser Navarin from the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin . This machinery was confiscated on the outbreak of war and used for these ships . Both vessels were built by AG Vulcan . 
 The two ships laid a series of minefields during their career , though their most significant success came in October 1917 , when they attacked a British convoy to Norway . They sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships from the convoy . They escaped back to Germany without damage . The two ships were interned at Scapa Flow after the end of the war , and were subsequently scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 . Brummer was sunk in deep water and was never raised , but Bremse was brought up in 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932 – 1933 .

 In 1914 , AG Vulcan in Stettin was building two sets of high @-@ powered steam turbines for the Russian Navy for use in their new battlecruiser Navarin , then under construction in Russia . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , which saw Germany and Russia on opposing sides , the German government seized the turbines . At that time , the Kaiserliche Marine possessed only two cruisers equipped for mine @-@ laying operations , the cruisers Nautilus and Albatross . The Kaiserliche Marine ordered AG Vulcan to split Navarin 's propulsion system in half and to design a pair of cruiser hulls around the engines . The ships were to be fast mine @-@ layers , capable of mining an area under cover of darkness and quickly returning to port before they could be intercepted . They were designed to resemble the British Arethusa class cruisers to aid in their ability to operate off the British coast . 
 Design work on the ships was completed quickly in 1914 . Brummer was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in early 1915 . Work proceeded quickly , and the ship was launched on 11 December 1915 . After the completion of fitting @-@ out work , the ship was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 2 April 1916 . Bremse followed her sister the same year at AG Vulcan . She was launched on 11 March 1916 and completed in less than four months ; the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1916 . During construction , the shape of their bow and its resemblance to British cruisers was covered by sheet metal .

 Brummer and Bremse were 135 meters ( 443 ft ) long at the waterline and 140 @.@ 40 m ( 460 ft 8 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 13 @.@ 20 m ( 43 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 6 m ( 19 ft 8 in ) forward and 5 @.@ 88 m ( 19 ft 3 in ) aft . The ships had a designed displacement of 4 @,@ 385 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 316 long tons ) , and at full combat load , they displaced 5 @,@ 856 t ( 5 @,@ 764 long tons ) . Their hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames . The hulls were divided into twenty @-@ one watertight compartments and incorporated a double bottom that extended for forty @-@ four percent of the length of the keel . Brummer differed slightly , as she had a row of portholes amidships that her sister Bremse did not have . 
 Brummer and Bremse were fitted with masts similar to the British Arethusa @-@ class cruisers , and similarly to the British ships , the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck . Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa @-@ class ships to further disguise the vessels . The ships had a complement of 16 officers and 293 enlisted men . They carried several smaller vessels , including one picket boat , one barge , and two dinghies . The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats , having gentle motion . The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius , and only lost slight speed in a head sea . In hard turns , they lost up to sixty percent speed . They were very crank , however .

 The two ships ' propulsion systems consisted of two turbines powered by two coal @-@ fired Marine <unk> double @-@ ended boilers and four oil @-@ fired Öl @-@ Marine double @-@ ended boilers . The turbines drove a pair of three @-@ bladed screws , which were 3 @.@ 20 m ( 10 ft 6 in ) in diameter . The engines were rated at 33 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) for a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . On trials , Brummer reached 42 @,@ 797 shp ( 31 @,@ 914 kW ) while Bremse made 47 @,@ 748 shp ( 35 @,@ 606 kW ) ; they averaged a top speed of 30 @.@ 2 knots ( 55 @.@ 9 km / h ; 34 @.@ 8 mph ) with a light load . The ships were capable of speeds up to 34 knots ( 63 km / h ; 39 mph ) , though only in short bursts . 
 Coal storage was 300 t ( 300 long tons ; 330 short tons ) as designed , though up to 600 t ( 590 long tons ; 660 short tons ) could be carried . Fuel oil was initially 500 t ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) , and could be similarly increased to 1 @,@ 000 t ( 980 long tons ; 1 @,@ 100 short tons ) . At a cruising speed of 12 kn ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , the ships could steam for 5 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 700 km ; 6 @,@ 700 mi ) . At a higher speed of 25 kn ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , the range fell considerably , to 1 @,@ 200 nmi ( 2 @,@ 200 km ; 1 @,@ 400 mi ) . Electrical power was provided by two turbo generators and one diesel generator . Steering was controlled by a single , large rudder .

 The ships were armed with four 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts ; all four were placed on the centerline so all four guns could fire on the broadside . One was placed forward on the forecastle , a second was located between the first and second funnel and two were arranged in a superfiring pair aft . These guns fired a 45 @.@ 3 @-@ kilogram ( 100 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 840 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ) . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 742 ft 9 in ) . They were supplied with 600 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . Brummer and Bremse also carried two 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels . These guns fired a 10 kg ( 22 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 750 to 770 m / s ( 2 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ) . The ships were also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with four torpedoes in a swivel mount amidships . Designed as mine @-@ layers , they carried up to 450 mines , depending on the type . Two rails ran down the main deck to the stern to allow the mines to be dropped behind the ship . 
 The Brummer @-@ class cruisers ' armor was fabricated from Krupp cemented steel . The ships were protected by a waterline armored belt that was 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick amidships ; the bow and stern were not armored . The deck was covered with 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) thick armor plate . Gun shields 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick protected the 15 cm gun battery crews . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick roof . Atop the conning tower was the bridge , which included a splinter @-@ proof chart house . All three funnels were equipped with a steel glacis for splinter protection .

 After their commissioning , Brummer and Bremse served with the High Seas Fleet , including on a sortie into the North Sea in October 1916 . The ships laid a minefield off Norderney in January 1917 and guarded minesweepers between March and May that year . In October 1917 , Admiral Reinhard Scheer sent the two ships to attack a British convoy to Norway to divert forces protecting convoys in the Atlantic . Scheer chose Brummer and Bremse because of their high speed and large radius of action . Shortly after dawn on 17 October , the two cruisers attacked the convoy , which consisted of twelve merchant ships , two destroyers , and two armed trawlers . The German ships quickly sank the escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve cargo vessels . The British Admiralty was not informed of the attack until Brummer and Bremse were safely steaming back to Germany . 
 Along with the most modern units of the High Seas Fleet , Brummer and Bremse were included in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers . The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 in single file , commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter . Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , and so he ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships . Brummer sank at 13 : 05 ; she was never raised for scrapping and remains on the bottom of Scapa Flow . Bremse sank at 14 : 30 and was ultimately raised on 27 November 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932 – 1933 in Lyness . 
 = Bolokhoveni = 
 Bolokhoveni , also <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ( Romanian : <unk> ; Ukrainian : <unk> ) , were a 13th @-@ century ethnic group that resided in the vicinity of the Rus ' principalities of Halych , Volhynia and Kiev . Their ethnic identity is uncertain ; although their ethnonym identifies them as Romanians ( who were called Vlachs in the Middle Ages ) , archeological evidence and the Hypatian Chronicle ( which is the only primary source that documents their history ) suggest that they were a Slavic people . Their princes , or <unk> , were in constant conflict with Daniil Romanovich , Prince of Halych and Volhynia , between 1231 and 1257 . After the Mongols sacked Kiev in 1240 , the Bolokhoveni supplied them with troops , but the Bolokhoveni princes fled to Poland . The Bolokhoveni disappeared after Romanovich defeated them in 1257 .

 According to a scholarly theory , the name " Bolokhoveni " may have derived from <unk> , the East Slavic term for Romanians , or Vlachs . If this theory is correct , the Bolokhoveni were Romanians living in the western regions of Kievan Rus ' . Place names , hydronyms , and personal names of Romanian origin abound in written sources relating to those regions . However , this theory is contradicted by archaeological evidence , which indicates that the Bolokhoveni 's material culture resembled that of its contemporaries in the western parts of Kievan Rus ' . Furthermore , it is well @-@ documented that the Bolokhoveni princes had family ties with boyars of the Principality of Halych . 
 The ethnonym seems to be connected to the name <unk> , an early medieval settlement that the Hypatian Chronicle – an accurate source of the history of Kievan Rus ' – mentioned around 1150 . According to historian Victor Spinei , this town may have been the same town as <unk> , which was recorded by the same chronicle in 1172 . Alternatively , Spinei states , <unk> may be the same town as <unk> ( now <unk> , Ukraine ) , which was mentioned as the " town called ' the Vlachs ' " in a Polish charter from 1472 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Hypatian Chronicle refers to the " land of Bolokhoveni " only once . Based on the chronicle , modern historians say that this land bordered the principalities of Halych , Volhynia and Kiev . <unk> <unk> , along with other Bolokhoveni towns mentioned in the chronicle , were situated along the <unk> and <unk> rivers . According to the Encyclopedia of Ukraine , the Bolokhoveni inhabited the region around the sources of the <unk> , Boh , Horyn and <unk> rivers . 
 On the other hand , historian Alexandru V. <unk> believes that the Bolokhoveni 's land was located between the Dniester and Dnieper rivers . He also says that the Bolokhoveni were located southeast of the present @-@ day town of <unk> ( Romanian : <unk> ) .

 The Hypatian Chronicle first refers to the " princes of the Bolokhoveni " when documenting a war between Daniil Romanovich , Prince of Halych and Volhynia , and the Hungarians in 1231 . The Bolokhoveni princes fought in alliance with the Hungarians . The Bolokhoveni princes supported a rebellion against Daniil Romanovich , and they besieged an important stronghold , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi , in 1233 or 1235 . However , the princes were captured and brought to the court of Daniil Romanovich in Vladimir . When Mikhail , Prince of Chernigov , and Iziaslav , Prince of Novgorod @-@ <unk> , requested their release , they referred to the princes of the Bolokhoveni as their " brothers " . 
 After the Mongols destroyed Kiev in 1240 , the Mongols moving westward did not attack the " land of Bolokhoveni " . However , they did force the Bolokhoveni to supply their army with crops . At the same time , the Bolokhoveni princes fled to the Duchy of Masovia ( now in Poland ) . They promised Duke Bolesław I of Masovia that they would accept his suzerainty , but the duke captured them . They were released after Daniil Romanovich and his brother , Vasilko Romanovich , promised to give Duke Bolesław I many gifts . 
 The Mongol invasion of Rus ' did not end the conflicts among the local rulers . The Bolokhoveni princes supported Rostislav Mikhailovich when he besieged <unk> , a major town held by Daniil Romanovich 's officials , in 1241 . In revenge for the attack , Daniil Romanovich invaded and pillaged the land of the Bolokhoveni , and destroyed their fortified towns . Archaeological research at Gubin and <unk> , two Bolokhoveni towns , shows that the town walls were dug up by Romanovich 's army . However , no corpses or traces of fire were found , implying that Romanovich took the towns ' inhabitants to his own principality . Their defeat by Romanovich 's troops in 1257 was the last recorded event of the Bolokhoveni 's history .

 The word Mannargudi is derived from the Tamil word Mannar referring to Vishnu and <unk> referring to a place , meaning the " Place of Vishnu " . The town was also called " <unk> " or " <unk> " after the Rajagopalaswamy temple . The town is locally referred as " Mannai " . Hindus refer the place as " Dakshina Dwarka " , meaning Southern Dwarka . The town was known during the period of Nayaks for the 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall compound wall around the Rajagopalaswamy temple , leading to the adage Mannargudi <unk> Azhagu , ( meaning " the walls of Mannargudi are beautiful " ) . The town is also called " Koil <unk> <unk> Nagaram " referring to the compound wall around the temple . 
 = = History = = 
 Mannargudi was founded as an <unk> village as Rajadhiraja <unk> by the Medieval Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola ( 1018 – 1054 CE ) , who constructed the Jayam <unk> temple and the <unk> temple . The Rajagopalaswami temple is believed to have been constructed by Kulothunga Chola I ( 1070 – 1125 CE ) , with bricks and mortar , indicated by various stone inscriptions found at the site . The town started to grow around the temple . Successive kings of the Chola empire , Rajaraja Chola III ( 1216 – 56 CE ) and Rajendra Chola III ( 1246 – 79 CE ) , and Thanjavur Nayak king Achyuta Deva Raya ( 1529 – 1542 CE ) expanded the temple . The temple contains inscriptions of the Hoysala kings and information about grants by Vijayanagara kings , and many records of the later Nayaks and Marathas . A fort was constructed under the rule of the Hoysala kings , and Hindu temples were built under the leadership of both Hoysala and Pandya rulers . 
 Mannargudi was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1311 CE . Following brief occupations by the Madurai Sultanate and the Hoysalas , it became a part of the Vijayanagar Empire . After the decline of Vijayanagar Empire , Mannargudi was ruled by the Thanjavur Nayaks . The Thanjavur Nayaks made the temple as their dynastic and primary shrine and made significant additions . The current temple structure , hall of thousand pillars , main gopuram ( temple gateway tower ) and the big compound wall around the temple were built by the king Vijaya Raghava Nayak ( 1532 – 1575 CE ) . <unk> , a doctrine by Nayaks explains the donation of an armour studded with precious stones to the main deity of the temple by the king . It is believed Vijaya Raghava Nayak erected the large tower in front of the temple so that he could view the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple . He was also called " <unk> " as he carried out extensive renovations of the Rajagopalaswami temple complex and is credited by some to have reclaimed the land from the surrounding forest . 
 The Thanjavur Marathas gained control during the later part of 18th century until its annexation by the British East India Company in 1799 . It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 and was a part of the erstwhile Tanjore district . The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk . The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule . Rice , betel leaves , groundnut , oil , metal articles and clothes were the major exports . A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century . During 1944 , Chinese copper coins were unearthed from <unk> village in the region , dated to Sui period ( 585 CE ) to the end of Song period ( 1275 CE ) .

 The story begins on April Fools ' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart throughout the day . Bart , angered by the numerous tricks he has fallen for , attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker . When Homer opens the beer , it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital , paralyzed and placed in a wheelchair . While everyone waits for Homer to get well , the family remembers surviving similar hardships , shown in the form of clips from past episodes . 
 At the hospital , Homer sees a candy machine and , while trying to get chocolate , accidentally tips it on himself . The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma . After that , Mr. Burns then tries to pull the plug on Homer 's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer 's health insurance . As Homer lies unconscious in the hospital bed , Bart tearfully confesses that he was the one who put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank . Having heard this , Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank . Despite this , Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well . The episode ends with Homer , still under the assumption that it is April Fools ' Day , trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii . However , Bart , Lisa , and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16 , that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks , and that he lost 5 % of his brain as a result . The family laughs it off even though Homer 's not sure why he is laughing .

 The episode originally aired on April Fools ' Day , 1993 on the Fox network . It was directed by Carlos Baeza , and written by Jon Vitti with contributions from Al Jean , Mike Reiss , Jay Kogen , Wallace Wolodarsky , John Swartzwelder , Jeff Martin , George Meyer , and Nell Scovell . The idea for the 32 " D 'oh ! " s in a row footage was from David Silverman 's montage that he had assembled for his traveling college show . 
 " So It 's Come to This : A Simpsons Clip Show " was The Simpsons ' first clip show , created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show 's overworked staff . There was intense pressure on producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit . However , writers and producers felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series . The Fox network 's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce , but they could sell syndication rights at full price . Despite the nature of the clip show , the episode still contained an act and a half of new animation , including the extra scene from " Bart the Daredevil " in which Homer falls down Springfield Gorge a second time after the ambulance crashes into a tree . 
 The network censors initially refused to let the phrase " beer causes rectal cancer " into the show . The censors eventually relented when they found a medical textbook which stated the link between beer and cancer , but still asked them to " go easy " on beer in the future . 
 As the family reminisces together about the past events , Bart raises a seeming non sequitur about an Itchy & Scratchy episode . Marge asks " Why did you bring that up ? " to which Bart replies " It was an amusing episode , " half looking at the camera , before quickly adding " of our ... lives . " Bart knows he is on a television show and knows the kinds of tricks his own writers use to fill up airtime . Such self @-@ consciousness allows The Simpsons to serve as a lesson in modern media discontinuity .

 The scene where Barney attempts to smother Homer with a pillow and breaks a hospital window with a water fountain is a parody of a scene in Miloš Forman 's 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Professor Frink 's suggestion of shrinking a crew of men to microscopic size and sending them into Homer in a small submarine is a reference to Richard Fleischer 's 1966 film Fantastic Voyage . There are also many cultural references in the clips from previous episodes . The clip of Homer picking up Marge and carrying her off in his arms into the distance is a reference to the theme of the 1982 film , An Officer and a Gentleman . Bart stealing Homer 's penny jar and trying to escape is an almost shot @-@ for @-@ shot parody of the opening sequence in the 1981 film , Raiders of the Lost Ark , while John Williams ' " Raiders March " plays throughout . The scene in which Maggie hits Homer over the head with a mallet is an extensive parody of the shower scene from Psycho ; the music and camera angles are almost identical . When Grandpa visits Homer in the hospital , he recites the line " This world was never meant for someone as beautiful as you " , which is from Don McLean 's 1972 single " Vincent " .

 In its original American broadcast , " So It 's Come to This : A Simpsons Clip Show " finished fourteenth in the ratings for the week of March 28 to April 4 , 1993 , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 9 . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . The episode has received positive reviews , being labeled " as good as a clip show ever gets " , and containing some memorable gags . It has been seen as one " of the most consistently funny episodes of the series " , which " strikes that perfect balance between perfectly selected classic moments and all new story segments ... " The episode 's reference to One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest was named the 43rd greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . 
 In 2015 , executive producer Al Jean reacted to a hypothesis that Homer is still in a coma and all episodes since this one have been imaginary , hence a perceived surrealism and frequent guest appearances . He said that the hypothesis belongs in the " intriguing but false file " .

 The Trylon Microcinema is a 50 @-@ seat movie theater in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis , Minnesota . The <unk> was founded and is currently run by Take @-@ Up Productions , a group of volunteers who got their start at the Oak Street Cinema before establishing the Trylon in a former storefront . Since opening in 2009 , the theater has featured a variety of regular programming ranging from career retrospectives of famous directors to B movies and cult films . The Trylon has been well received by critics who have praised its film lineup , intimacy , and atmosphere . 
 = = History = = 
 Minneapolis 's Oak Street Cinema , a volunteer @-@ run repertory cinema , ran films seven days per week until cutbacks in programming had to be made for financial reasons . A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take @-@ Up Productions , which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses . The organization began with outdoor screenings , starting with Watermelon Man , which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop , and then began to rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area , including the Riverview , Heights , and Parkway . Some screenings , such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films , drew hundreds of viewers . 
 Barry Kryshka of Take @-@ Up Productions owns and manages the Trylon . The Microcinema sits in an old storefront in the Longfellow neighborhood along Minnehaha Avenue that was rented , in 2009 , at a rate of $ 800 a month . Kryshka contracted Bright Star Systems , Inc. to retrofit the space with 50 old rocking seats purchased from a nearby cinema chain , a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) projection screen , two 35 mm movie projectors , and a minute concessions stand . Trylon acquired its name from an eponymous theater in Kryshka 's native Queens , New York , itself named for the Trylon sculpture at the 1939 New York World 's Fair . The Trylon opened on the weekend of July 17 – 18 , 2009 , with a showing of Sherlock Jr. featuring live musical accompaniment from Dreamland Faces , a local accordion – musical saw duo . Each of the venue 's first 12 showings sold out .

 Every three months , the Trylon Microcinema publishes a full schedule of screenings , approximately 10 percent of which are of first run films . The venue features a variety of regular exhibitions , ranging from the Trash Film <unk> series of B movies , to the Defenders in which local cinephiles curate and defend screenings of personal favorite cult films , to Sound Unseen , a documentary project covering behind @-@ the @-@ scenes aspects of musicians ' creative processes . The Trylon also hosts showcases of the films throughout various directors ' careers . Take @-@ Up Productions continues to use other venues such as the Heights and the Riverview for screenings necessitating larger houses . The Microcinema is staffed entirely with volunteers . 
 Critical reception for the Trylon has been positive . It was voted the best movie theater in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area in 2011 and 2012 by City Pages , who wrote in 2011 that " no theater in the Twin Cities can match [ the Trylon 's ] passion and energy for the movies . " In an unranked list of Minneapolis – Saint Paul 's best cinemas written for WCCO , Eric Henderson called the Trylon the " <unk> upstart in the Twin Cities " and described the experience of walking into the theater as " <unk> [ ing ] onto the set of a Michel Gondry fantasy @-@ noir about a scrappy theater thriving in the midst of a Prohibition @-@ style ban on the moviegoing experience . " J. L. Sosa lauded the Trylon on Film School Rejects , praising the concessions selection , the physical intimacy of the space , and the cinema 's programmers for their " impeccable taste in both high- and lowbrow culture .

 = Azerbaijan = 
 Azerbaijan ( / <unk> / AZ @-@ ər @-@ by @-@ <unk> ; Azerbaijani : <unk> [ <unk> ] ) , officially the Republic of Azerbaijan ( Azerbaijani : <unk> <unk> ) , is a country in the Transcaucasian region , situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe . It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east , Russia to the north , Georgia to the northwest , Armenia to the west and Iran to the south . The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east , Iran to the south and west , while having a short border with Turkey in the north west . 
 The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 . The country was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic . The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991 , before the official dissolution of the USSR . In September 1991 , the disputed Armenian @-@ majority Nagorno @-@ Karabakh region re @-@ affirmed its willingness to create a separate state as the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic . The region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent since the ending of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War in 1994 , these regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan until a final solution to status of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh is found through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE . 
 Azerbaijan is a unitary semi @-@ presidential republic . The country is a member state of the Council of Europe , the OSCE and the NATO Partnership for Peace ( PfP ) program . It is one of the six independent Turkic states , being an active member of the Turkic Council and the <unk> community . Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations . It is one of the founding members of <unk> , the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons . A member of the United Nations since 1992 , Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 May 2006 ( the term of office began on 19 June 2006 ) . Azerbaijan is also a member state of the Non @-@ Aligned Movement , holds observer status in World Trade Organization and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union . 
 The Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion , and all major political forces in the country are secularist , but the majority of people and some opposition movements adhere to Shia Islam . Azerbaijan has a high level of human development which ranks on par with most Eastern European countries . It has a high rate of economic development and literacy , as well as a low rate of unemployment . However , corruption in Azerbaijan is widespread , especially in the public service . The ruling party , New Azerbaijan Party , has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 According to a modern etymology , the name of Azerbaijan derives from that of Atropates , a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire , who was later reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander the Great . The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once @-@ dominant Zoroastrian religion . In the Avesta , <unk> <unk> ( " Hymn to the Guardian Angels " ) , there is a mention of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which literally translates from Avestan as " we worship the <unk> of the holy Atropatene . " 
 Atropates ruled over the region of Atropatene ( present Iranian Azerbaijan ) . The name " Atropates " itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian , probably Median , compounded name with the meaning " Protected by the ( Holy ) Fire " or " The Land of the ( Holy ) Fire " . The Greek name is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo . Over the span of millennia the name evolved to <unk> ( Middle Iranian ) then to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( New Persian ) and present @-@ day Azerbaijan . In Armenia , the country is called <unk> , yet another archaic form . Ultimately , the name Azerbaijan comes from Azar @-@ <unk> . This word is translatable as Guardian of Fire , " The Treasury " and " The Treasurer " of fire or " The Land of Fire " in Modern Persian . The name was changed to Azerbaijan following the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD ; Arabic lacked the letters G and P , so Arabic speakers modified the spelling of <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Antiquity = = = 
 The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the <unk> culture of the <unk> Cave . The Upper Paleolithic and late Bronze Age cultures are attested in the caves of <unk> , <unk> , Zar , <unk> @-@ <unk> and in the necropolises of <unk> and <unk> . 
 Early settlements included the Scythians in the 9th century BC . Following the Scythians , Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras . The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 – 700 BC , which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC . The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism . Later it became part of Alexander the Great 's Empire and its successor , the Seleucid Empire . During this period , Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene . Caucasian Albanians , the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan , ruled that area from around the 4th century BC , and established an independent kingdom that came under the cultural influence of the Armenians . 
 In the 4th and 3rd centuries BC , following the overthrow of the Achaemenid Empire , the southwestern part of modern Azerbaijan was part of the Kingdom of Armenia ruled by the <unk> Dynasty ; between the years 189 BC and 428 AD the western half of modern Azerbaijan , including the exclave of Nakhchivan , were included into the Kingdom of Greater Armenia ruled by Armenia 's <unk> and Arsacid dynasties , the latter itself a branch of the eponymous Arsacid dynasty of Parthia . 
 After the partition of the Kingdom of Armenia by Persia and Byzantium in 387 AD , the provinces of Artsakh and <unk> , which had an ethnically mixed population , passed to Caucasian Albania . 
 = = = Feudal era = = = 
 The Persian Sassanids turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in AD 252 , while King <unk> officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century . Despite Sassanid rule , Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century , while fully subordinate to Sassanid Persia , and retained its monarchy . In the first half of the 7th century AD , the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the Caucasus region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance , led by King <unk> , was suppressed in 667 . Caucasian Albania however , came already under nominal Muslim rule through the Muslim conquest of Persia , as it made up part of the Sassanid territory upon advent of the Muslim conquest . The power vacuum left by the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the <unk> , <unk> , Shaddadids , <unk> and Buyids . At the beginning of the 11th century , the territory was gradually seized by waves of Turkic Oghuz tribes from Central Asia . The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the Seljuqs , which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067 . 
 The pre @-@ Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijani Republic spoke several Indo @-@ European and Caucasian languages , among them – Armenian and an Iranian language called the Old Azari language , which was gradually replaced by a Turkic language , the early precursor of the Azerbaijani language of today . To distinguish it from the Turkic Azerbaijani or Azeri language , this Iranian language , is designated as the Azari language ( or Old Azari language ) , because the Turkic language and people are also designated as " <unk> " or " Azari " in the Persian language . However some linguists have also designated the Tati dialects of Iranian Azerbaijan and the Republic of Azerbaijan , like those spoken by the Tats , as a remnant of Azari . Locally , the possessions of the subsequent Seljuq Empire were ruled by <unk> , who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans , being sometimes de facto rulers themselves . Under the Seljuq Turks , local poets such as Nizami <unk> and <unk> Shirvani gave rise to a blossoming of Persian literature on the territory of present @-@ day Azerbaijan . The next ruling state of the <unk> was short @-@ lived and fell under the conquests of Timur . 
 The local dynasty of the Shirvanshahs became a vassal state of Timur 's Empire , and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh . Following Timur 's death , two independent and rival states emerged : Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu . The Shirvanshahs returned , maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539 . During their conquest and persecution by the Iranian Safavids in 1501 , the last dynasty imposed Shia Islam upon the formerly Sunni population , as it did over its territories in modern @-@ day Iran , as it was battling against the Sunni Ottoman Empire . This , in combination with another series of events , the Safavids laid the foundation for the fact that both the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran are the only Shia majority countries ever since . Despite efforts of the Safavids , the Ottomans briefly managed to occupy swaths of present @-@ day Azerbaijan twice over the centuries . Also , Baku and its environs were briefly managed by the Russians in the early 18th century through the consequences of the Russo @-@ Persian War . Despite these very brief intermissions by Safavid Iran 's neighboring rivals , the land of what is nowadays Azerbaijan remained under intermittent Iranian rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 After the Safavids , the area was ruled by the Iranian dynasties of Afshar and Zand and briefly by the <unk> , until the latters forced ceding to Russian empire in the course of the 19th century . However self @-@ ruling khanates with various forms of independence emerged in the area , especially following the collapse of the Zand dynasty and in the early Qajar era . These khanates , though often self @-@ ruling , were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah ( King ) . The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West . From the late 18th century and on , Imperial Russia changed to a more aggressive geo @-@ political stance towards its two neighbors ( and rivals ) to the south , namely Iran and Turkey . Following a chain of events that started with the re @-@ subjugation of Georgia into Iran in 1795 , Russia would now actively contest and battle with the latter over possession of the Caucasus region which was , for most of its part , in the hands of Iran . The successful Russian campaigns in the later stages of the Russo @-@ Persian War ( 1804 – 13 ) were concluded with the Treaty of Gulistan , in which the shah 's claims to some of the <unk> of the Caucasus were dismissed by Russia on the ground that they had been de facto independent long before their Russian occupation . 
 Following Qajar Iran 's loss in the 1804 – 1813 war , it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates ( alongside Georgia and Dagestan ) to the Russian Empire per the Gulistan treaty . The area to the north of the river Aras , amongst which the territory of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan , was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century . Under the Treaty of Turkmenchay which finalised the Russo @-@ Persian War , Qajar Iran was forced to recognize Russian sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate , the Nakhchivan Khanate and the remainder of the Lankaran Khanate , comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands . After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia , the new border between the two was set at the Aras River , which , upon the Soviet Union 's disintegration , subsequently became part of the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic . 
 Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century , which thus included the territory of the modern @-@ day Azerbaijan Republic , while as a result of that cession , the Azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations : Iran and Azerbaijan . Furthermore , the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran far outnumber those in neighbouring Azerbaijan . 
 After the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I , Azerbaijan , together with Armenia and Georgia became part of the short @-@ lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic . 
 It was followed by the March Days massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire . When the republic dissolved in May 1918 , Azerbaijan declared independence as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic ( ADR ) . The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Muslim world . Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women , making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men . Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University , which was the first modern @-@ type university founded in Muslim East . 
 By March 1920 , it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much @-@ needed Baku . Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku 's oil . Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it , establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on 28 April 1920 . Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh , Azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918 – 20 quickly or easily . As many as 20 @,@ 000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest . 
 On 13 October 1921 , the Soviet republics of Russia , Armenia , Azerbaijan , and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars . The previously independent <unk> SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars . On the other hand , Armenia was awarded the region of Zangezur and Turkey agreed to return Gyumri ( then known as Alexandropol ) . 
 During World War II , Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union , with most of the Soviet Union 's oil on the Eastern Front being supplied by Baku . By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942 , the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals . Operation Edelweiss carried out by the German Wehrmacht targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy ( petroleum ) dynamo of the USSR . A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945 . Approximately 681 @,@ 000 people with over 100 @,@ 000 of them women went to the front , while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3 @.@ 4 million at the time . Some 250 @,@ 000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front . More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named Heroes of the Soviet Union . Azerbaijani Major @-@ General <unk> <unk> was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union . 
 = = = Republic era = = = 
 Following the politics of glasnost , initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev , civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union , including Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR . The disturbances in Azerbaijan , in response to Moscow 's indifference to already heated conflict , resulted in calls for independence and secession , which culminated in Black January in Baku . Later in 1990 , the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words " Soviet Socialist " from the title , adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag . On 18 October 1991 , the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991 , when the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991 . 
 The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh war with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh backed by Armenia . By the end of hostilities in 1994 , Armenians controlled up to 14 – 16 percent of Azerbaijani territory , including Nagorno @-@ Karabakh itself . During the war many atrocities were committed including the massacre at <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> and the Khojaly massacres . Furthermore , an estimated 30 @,@ 000 people had been killed and more than a million people had been displaced . Four United Nations Security Council Resolutions ( 822 , 853 , 874 , and 884 ) demand for " the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan . " Many Russians and Armenians left Azerbaijan during the 1990s . According to the 1970 census , there were 510 @,@ 000 ethnic Russians and 484 @,@ 000 Armenians in Azerbaijan . 
 In 1993 , democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov , which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan , Heydar Aliyev . In 1994 , Surat Huseynov , by that time a prime minister , attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev , but Huseynov was arrested and charged with treason . A year later , in 1995 , another coup was attempted against Aliyev , this time by the commander of the OMON special unit , <unk> <unk> . The coup was averted , resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan 's OMON units . At the same time , the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy . In October 1998 , Aliyev was reelected for a second term . Despite the much improved economy , particularly with the exploitations of Azeri @-@ Chirag @-@ <unk> oil field and Shah Deniz gas field , Aliyev 's presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and corruption . 
 Ilham Aliyev , the son of Heydar Aliyev , assumed as the chairmen of the New Azerbaijan Party as well as the office of presidency when his father died in 2003 . He was reelected to a third term as president in October 2013 . He then launched a crackdown on opposition elements . In November , he put two prominent opponents on trial for inciting riots ten months earlier : <unk> Mammadov , the chairman of the opposition Republican Alternative ( <unk> ) ; and <unk> Mammadov , the deputy chairman of the New Equality Party ( <unk> ) . In addition the dissident Islamic theologian <unk> <unk> was sentenced to two years ’ imprisonment . The opposition newspaper <unk> was closed down . Three men were sentenced to life in prison on charges of plotting attacks in Baku in a conspiracy with Iran . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Azerbaijan is in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia , straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe . It lies between latitudes 38 ° and 42 ° N , and longitudes 44 ° and 51 ° E. The total length of Azerbaijan 's land borders is 2 @,@ 648 km ( 1 @,@ 645 mi ) , of which 1007 kilometers are with Armenia , 756 kilometers with Iran , 480 kilometers with Georgia , 390 kilometers with Russia and 15 kilometers with Turkey . The coastline stretches for 800 km ( 497 mi ) , and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km ( 283 mi ) . The territory of Azerbaijan extends 400 km ( 249 mi ) from north to south , and 500 km ( 311 mi ) from west to east . 
 Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan : the Caspian Sea , whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east ; the Greater Caucasus mountain range to the north ; and the extensive flatlands at the country 's center . There are also three mountain ranges , the Greater and Lesser Caucasus , and the Talysh Mountains , together covering approximately 40 percent of the country . The highest peak of Azerbaijan is mount <unk> ( 4 @,@ 466 m ) , while the lowest point lies in the Caspian Sea ( − 28 m ) . Nearly half of all the mud volcanoes on Earth are concentrated in Azerbaijan , these volcanoes were also among nominees for the New7Wonders of Nature . 
 The main water sources are surface waters . However , only 24 of the 8 @,@ 350 rivers are greater than 100 km ( 62 mi ) in length . All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country . The largest lake is <unk> ( 67 km ² ) , and the longest river is Kur ( 1 @,@ 515 km ) , which is <unk> . Azerbaijan 's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometers . 
 Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991 , the Azerbaijani government has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan . But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the Baku @-@ Tbilisi @-@ Ceyhan pipeline . Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country 's territory . Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection . 
 = = = Landscape = = = 
 Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes . Over half of Azerbaijan 's land mass consists of mountain ridges , crests , <unk> , and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400 – 1000 meters ( including the Middle and Lower lowlands ) , in some places ( Talis , <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) up to 100 – 120 meters , and others from 0 – 50 meters and up ( <unk> , Absheron ) . The rest of Azerbaijan 's terrain consist of plains and lowlands . <unk> marks within the Caucasus region vary from about − 28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4 @,@ 466 meters ( <unk> peak ) . 
 The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold arctic air masses of Scandinavian anticyclone , temperate of Siberian anticyclone , and Central Asian anticyclone . Azerbaijan 's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country . The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north . That leads to the formation of subtropical climate on most foothills and plains of the country . Meanwhile , plains and foothills are characterized by high solar radiation rates . 
 Nine out of 11 existing climate zones are present in Azerbaijan . Both the absolute minimum temperature ( − 33 ° C or − 27 @.@ 4 ° F ) and the absolute maximum temperature ( 46 ° C or 114 @.@ 8 ° F ) were observed in Julfa and Ordubad . The maximum annual precipitation falls in Lankaran ( 1 @,@ 600 to 1 @,@ 800 mm or 63 to 71 in ) and the minimum in Absheron ( 200 to 350 mm or 7 @.@ 9 to 13 @.@ 8 in ) . 
 Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan , they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period . This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country . The country 's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities . Artificial rivers ( canals ) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan 's water systems . In terms of water supply , Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 3 @,@ 531 @,@ 467 cubic feet ) per year of water per square kilometer . All big water reservoirs are built on Kur . The <unk> of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea basin . 
 There are 8 @,@ 350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan . Only 24 rivers are over 100 kilometers long . The Kura and Aras are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan , they run through the Kura @-@ Aras Lowland . The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea , originate mainly from the north @-@ eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur – <unk> and Lankaran lowlands . 
 <unk> Dag , translated as " burning mountain " , is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku , which itself is known as the " land of fire . " Flames jet out into the air from a thin , porous sandstone layer . It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers . Animal carvings on architectural monuments , ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times . The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century . Unlike fauna , the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals , but also the number of individual species . 
 There are 106 species of mammals , 97 species of fish , 363 species of birds , 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan . The national animal of Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse , a mountain @-@ steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan . The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper , speed , elegance and intelligence . It is one of the oldest breeds , with ancestry dating to the ancient world . However today the horse is an endangered species . 
 Azerbaijan 's flora consists of more than 4 @,@ 500 species of higher plants . Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan , the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus . About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be found in Azerbaijan . 
 = = Politics = = 
 The structural formation of Azerbaijan 's political system was completed by the adoption of the new Constitution on 12 November 1995 . According to the Article 23 of Constitution , the state symbols of the Azerbaijan Republic are the flag , the coat of arms and the national anthem . The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues , but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements . 
 The government of Azerbaijan is based on the separation of powers among the legislative , executive and judicial branches . The legislative power is held by the unicameral National Assembly and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic . Parliamentary elections are held every five years , on the first Sunday of November . The Yeni Azerbaijan Party , and independents loyal to the ruling government , currently hold almost all of the Parliament 's 125 seats . During the 2010 Parliamentary election , the opposition parties , <unk> and Azerbaijani Popular Front Party , failed to win a single seat . European observers found numerous irregularities in the run @-@ up to the election and on election day . 
 The executive power is held by the president , who is elected for a five @-@ year term by direct elections , and the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan . The president is authorized to form the Cabinet , a collective executive body , accountable to both the President and the National Assembly . The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the Prime Minister , his Deputies and Ministers . The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly , but he has the right to veto its decisions . To override the presidential veto , the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes . The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court , Supreme Court and the Economic Court . The President nominates the judges in these courts . 
 The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president , and he organizes it according to the Constitution . It was established on 10 April 1997 . The administrative department is not a part of the president 's office but manages the financial , technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office . 
 Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy , it remains classified as " not free " ( on border with " partly free " ) by Freedom House . In recent years , large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists , bloggers , lawyers , human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities . A resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September 2015 described Azerbaijan as " having suffered the greatest decline in democratic governance in all of Eurasia over the past ten years , " noting as well that its dialogue with the country on human rights has " not made any substantial progress . " 
 Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats for promoting its causes abroad and legitimizing its elections at home , a practice which has been termed as ' caviar diplomacy ' . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 The short @-@ lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries , sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland . The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan 's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year . The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain , on 6 November 1996 . Full diplomatic relations , including mutual exchanges of missions , were first established with Turkey , Pakistan , the United States , Iran and Israel . Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its " Special Relationship " with Turkey . 
 Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations . It holds observer status in the Non @-@ Aligned Movement and World Trade Organization and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union . On 9 May 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly . The term of office began on 19 June 2006 . 
 Foreign policy priorities of Azerbaijan include , first of all , the restoration of its territorial integrity ; elimination of the consequences of the loss of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan ; integration into European and Euro @-@ Atlantic structure ; contribution to international security ; cooperation with international organizations ; regional cooperation and bilateral relations ; strengthening of defense capability ; promotion of security by domestic policy means ; strengthening of democracy ; preservation of the ethnic and religious tolerance ; scientific , educational , and cultural policy and preservation of moral values ; economic and social development ; enhancing internal and border security ; and migration , energy , and transportation security policy . 
 The Azerbaijani government , in late 2007 , stated that the long @-@ standing dispute over the Armenian @-@ occupied territory of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh is almost certain to spark a new war if it remains unresolved . The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget . Furthermore , an attack by the Azerbaijani military in 2016 on Armenian villages in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh has caused physical damage and raised controversy over the future of peaceful relations between Azerbaijan and its neighbor , Armenia . 
 Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism . The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq . Azerbaijan is an active member of NATO 's Partnership for Peace program . It also maintains good relations with the European Union and could potentially one day apply for membership . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Azerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regions ; 66 rayons ( <unk> , singular rayon ) and 77 cities ( <unk> , singular <unk> ) of which 12 are under the direct authority of the republic .

 The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918 , when the National Army of the newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918 . When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the Law on the Armed Forces of 9 October 1991 . The original date of the establishment of the short @-@ lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day ( 26 June ) in today 's Azerbaijan . As of 2002 , Azerbaijan had 95 @,@ 000 active personnel in its armed forces . There are also 17 @,@ 000 paramilitary troops . The armed forces have three branches : the Land Forces , the Air Forces and the Navy . Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub @-@ groups that can be involved in state defense when needed . These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service , which includes the Coast Guard as well . The Azerbaijan National Guard is a further paramilitary force . It operates as a semi @-@ independent entity of the Special State Protection Service , an agency subordinate to the President . 
 Azerbaijan adheres to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and has signed all major international arms and weapons treaties . Azerbaijan closely cooperates with NATO in programs such as Partnership for Peace and Individual Partnership Action Plan . Azerbaijan has deployed 151 of its Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq and another 184 in Afghanistan . 
 The defense budget of Azerbaijan for 2011 was set at US $ 3 @.@ 1 billion . In addition to that , $ 1 @.@ 36 billion was planned to be used for the needs of the defense industry , which bring up the total military spending to billion . Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on 26 June 2011 that the defence spending reached $ 3 @.@ 3 billion that year . 
 Azerbaijan 's defense budget for 2013 is $ 3 @.@ 7 billion . 
 Azerbaijani defense industry manufactures small arms , artillery systems , tanks , armors and <unk> devices , aviation bombs , pilotless vehicles , various military vehicles and military planes and helicopters . 
 = = Economy = = 
 After gaining independence in 1991 , Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank . The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan , commercial banks and non @-@ banking credit organizations . The National ( now Central ) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank , an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR . The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan 's central bank , empowered to issue the national currency , the Azerbaijani <unk> , and to supervise all commercial banks . Two major commercial banks are <unk> and the state @-@ owned International Bank of Azerbaijan , run by Dr. Jahangir <unk> . 
 Pushed up by spending and demand growth , the 2007 Q1 inflation rate reached 16 @.@ 6 % . Nominal incomes and monthly wages climbed 29 % and 25 % respectively against this figure , but price increases in non @-@ oil industry encouraged inflation in the country . Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so @-@ called " Dutch disease " because of the fast @-@ growing energy sector , which causes inflation and makes non @-@ energy exports more expensive . 
 In the early years of this century the chronically high inflation was brought under control and this led to the launch of a new currency , the new Azerbaijani <unk> , on 1 January 2006 , to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy . 
 In 2008 , Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the World Bank 's Doing Business Report . 
 Azerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007 / 08 , with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of regulatory reform . Azerbaijan started operating a one @-@ stop shop in January 2008 that halved the time , cost and number of procedures to start a business . Business registrations increased by 40 % in the first six months . Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $ 1 @,@ 100 , more than doubling the number of borrowers covered by the credit registry . Also , taxpayers can now file forms and pay their taxes online . Azerbaijan 's extensive reforms moved it far up the ranks , from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business . 
 Azerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2010 – 2011 , which is above other CIS countries . By 2012 the GDP of Azerbaijan increased 20 @-@ fold relative to its 1995 level . 
 = = = Energy = = = 
 Two @-@ thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas . The region of the Lesser Caucasus accounts for most of the country 's gold , silver , iron , copper , titanium , chromium , manganese , cobalt , molybdenum , complex ore and antimony . In September 1994 , a 30 @-@ year contract was signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic ( SOCAR ) and 13 oil companies , among them Amoco , BP , ExxonMobil , <unk> and Statoil . As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation , Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development . Meanwhile , the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established as an extra @-@ budgetary fund to ensure the macroeconomic stability , transparency in the management of oil revenue , and the safeguarding of resources for future generations .

Azerbaijan 's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures , horticulture and subtropical crops , green vegetables , viticulture and wine @-@ making , cotton growing and medicinal plants . In some lands it is profitable to grow grain , potatoes , sugar beets , cotton and tobacco . Livestock , dairy products , and wine and spirits are also important farm products . The Caspian fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga . In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships . 
 Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally ( among them are Coca Cola by Coca Cola <unk> LTD , beer by <unk> @-@ Kastel , parquet by <unk> and oil pipes by <unk> Pipe <unk> Azerbaijan ) . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan . The country was a well @-@ known tourist spot in the 1980s . However , the fall of the Soviet Union , and the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War during the 1990s , damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination . 
 It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover , and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays . In the recent years , Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious , spa , and health care tourism . During winter , the <unk> Mountain Resort offers skiing with state of the art facilities . 
 The government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority . It is a national strategy to make tourism a major , if not the single largest , contributor to the Azerbaijani economy . These activities are regulated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries , such as the Silk Road and the south – north corridor , highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country 's economy . The transport sector in the country includes roads , railways , aviation , and maritime transport . 
 Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials . The Baku – Tbilisi – Ceyhan pipeline ( BTC ) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1 @,@ 774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan , Georgia and Turkey . The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets . The South Caucasus Pipeline , also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan , Georgia and Turkey , became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field . Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year . Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU @-@ sponsored Silk Road Project . 
 In 2002 , the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions . In the same year , the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic . The highest priority being ; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country , as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy . 
 In 2012 , the construction of Kars – Tbilisi – Baku railway expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey 's Marmaray to the European railway system in the west . Broad @-@ gauge railways in 2010 stretched for 2 @,@ 918 km ( 1 @,@ 813 mi ) and electrified railways numbered 1 @,@ 278 km ( 794 mi ) . By 2010 , there were 35 airports and one heliport .

 In the 21st century , a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in Azerbaijan 's science and technology sectors , and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation . The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production . 
 Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector , mostly uninfluenced by the global financial crisis ; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years . 
 The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector . The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies ( <unk> ) , as well as being an operator through its role in <unk> , is both a policy @-@ maker and regulator . Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks . Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration . As of 2009 , there were 1 @,@ 397 @,@ 000 main telephone lines and 1 @,@ 485 @,@ 000 internet users .

 Since independence , one of the first laws that Azerbaijan 's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a modified @-@ Latin alphabet to replace Cyrillic . Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change . Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education ( banned during the Soviet period ) and curriculum changes that have <unk> the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content .

Azerbaijani pop and Azerbaijani folk music arose with the international popularity of performers like Alim <unk> , Rashid <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Muslim <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Azerbaijan is an enthusiastic participant in the Eurovision Song Contest . Azerbaijan made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest . The country 's entry gained the third place in 2009 and fifth the following year . Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song " Running Scared " , entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012 , in Baku . They have never missed a Grand Final . 
 There are dozens of Azerbaijani folk dances . They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the <unk> , which is well @-@ preserved within the national dances . Most dances have a very fast rhythm . The national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Among the medieval authors born within the territorial limits of modern Azerbaijani Republic was Persian poet and philosopher Nizami , called <unk> after his place of birth , Ganja , who was the author of the <unk> ( " The <unk> " ) , composed of five romantic poems , including " The Treasure of Mysteries , " " Khosrow and <unk> , " and " <unk> and <unk> . " 
 The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature was <unk> <unk> , who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Turkic ghazals . In Persian ghazals he used his pen @-@ name , while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of <unk> . 
 Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in 14th century based on the various dialect Early Middle Ages dialects of Tabriz and Shirvan . Among the poets of this period were Gazi <unk> , <unk> ( pen @-@ name of Jahan @-@ shah Qara <unk> ) , and Habibi . The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of <unk> <unk> , one of the greatest Turkic <unk> mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history , who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic . The divan and ghazal styles were further developed by poets Qasim al @-@ Anvar , Fuzuli and <unk> ( pen @-@ name of Safavid Shah Ismail I ) . 
 The Book of Dede <unk> consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century , was not written earlier than the 15th century . It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads . The 16th @-@ century poet , Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical <unk> in Arabic , Persian , and Azerbaijani . Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment , and building upon the legacy of his predecessors , Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society . His major works include The Divan of Ghazals and The <unk> . In the same century , Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik ( Azerbaijani : <unk> ) poetic genre of bards . During the same period , under the pen @-@ name of <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> for sinner ) Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani , which were later published as his Divan . A unique literary style known as <unk> ( Azerbaijani : <unk> for improvization ) was introduced in this period , and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor , Shah Tahmasp I. 
 In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries , Fizuli 's unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as <unk> of Tabriz , Shah Abbas Sani , Agha <unk> Shirvani , Nishat , Molla Vali <unk> , Molla <unk> <unk> , Amani , Zafar and others . Along with Turks , Turkmens and Uzbeks , Azerbaijanis also celebrate the Epic of <unk> ( from Azerbaijani : <unk> <unk> for blind man 's son ) , a legendary folk hero . Several documented versions of <unk> epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan . 
 Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly , while in Iran it is based on the <unk> one . The first newspaper in Azerbaijani , <unk> was published in 1875 . In the mid @-@ 19th century , it was taught in the schools of Baku , Ganja , Shaki , Tbilisi , and Yerevan . Since 1845 , it has also been taught in the University of Saint Petersburg in Russia . 
 = = = Folk art = = = 
 Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture , a major part of which is decorative and applied art . This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts , such as chasing , jeweler , engraving in metal , carving in wood , stone and bone , carpet @-@ making , lasing , pattern weaving and printing , knitting and embroidery . Each of these types of decorative art , evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation , is very much in favor here . Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants , travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times . 
 The Azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes , with dense texture and a pile or pile @-@ less surface , whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan 's many carpet @-@ making regions . In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage by UNESCO . 
 Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts . The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture , stock raising , metal working , pottery , ceramics , and carpet @-@ weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC . Archeological sites in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts . 
 Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups . Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov , a prominent scientist and artist . It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan , Guba @-@ Shirvan , Ganja @-@ Kazakh , Karabakh and Tabriz . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes . Fresh herbs , including mint , cilantro ( coriander ) , dill , basil , parsley , tarragon , leeks , chives , thyme , marjoram , green onion , and watercress , are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table . Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes , which are based on fish from the Caspian Sea , local meat ( mainly mutton and beef ) , and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens . Saffron @-@ rice <unk> is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage . Azerbaijanis often use traditional <unk> ( pear @-@ shaped ) glass as they have very strong tea culture . Popular traditional dishes include <unk> ( lamb soup that exists in several regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables ) , <unk> ( fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat ) and <unk> ( sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor ) . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of East and West . Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Walled City of Baku survive in modern Azerbaijan . Entries submitted on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list include the <unk> of Baku , <unk> Khatun Mausoleum , <unk> National Park , <unk> National Park , <unk> Mud Volcano , Baku Stage Mountain , Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions , Shusha National Reserve , Ordubad National Reserve and the Palace of Shaki Khans . 
 Among other architectural treasures are Quadrangular Castle in <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> , a number of bridges spanning the Aras River , and several mausoleums . In the 19th and early 20th centuries , little monumental architecture was created , but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere . Among the most recent architectural monuments , the Baku subways are noted for their lavish decor . 
 The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics , the search for an architect 's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing <unk> @-@ cultural environment . Major projects such as Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center , Flame Towers , Baku Crystal Hall , Baku White City and SOCAR Tower have transformed the country 's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity . 
 = = = Visual art = = = 
 Azerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world , which were discovered as <unk> Petroglyphs in the territory of Ordubad Rayon are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC . About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer , goats , bulls , dogs , snakes , birds , fantastic beings and also people , carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks . Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl was convinced that people from the area went to Scandinavia in about 100 AD and took their boat building skills with them , and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe . 
 Over the centuries , Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes . Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light , as exemplified in the works of Azim <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs . Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years , from the Romanesque and Ottoman periods , and through the Soviet and Baroque periods , the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan . Other notable artists who fall within these periods include Sattar <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Tahir <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Mirza <unk> <unk> , <unk> Abdullayev and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Cinema = = = 
 The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898 . In fact , Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography . Therefore , it 's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku – at the start of the 20th century , this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world 's supply of oil . Just like today , the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work . In 1919 , during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic , a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on Azerbaijan 's independence day , 28 May , and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku . After the Soviet power was established in 1920 , Nariman <unk> , Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan , signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan 's cinema . This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation . 
 In 1991 , after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union , the first Baku International Film Festival East @-@ West was held in Baku . In December 2000 , the former President of Azerbaijan , Heydar Aliyev , signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan . Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920 . Once again , both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker . 
 = = = Media and media freedom = = = 
 There are three state @-@ owned television channels : <unk> , <unk> TV and <unk> TV . One public channel and 6 private channels : İctimai Television , ANS TV , Space TV , <unk> TV , Azad Azerbaijan TV , <unk> TV and Region TV . 
 Print and broadcast media in Azerbaijan are almost wholly under control of the ruling Aliyev family , eventually through friendly intermediaries . Ownership opacity is backed by law . Azerbaijan hosts 9 national TV stations ( of which a public service broadcaster and 3 more state @-@ run channels ) , over 12 regional TV stations , 25 radio channels , over 30 daily newspapers . Opposition media manages to work on the perpetual brink of survival . 
 = = = Human rights in Azerbaijan = = = 
 The Constitution of Azerbaijan claims to guarantee freedom of speech , but this is denied in practice . After several years of decline in press and media freedom , in 2014 the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated fast under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism , even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe ( May – November 2014 ) . Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm . All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country . 
 According to the 2013 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report , Azerbaijan 's press freedom status is " not free , " and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries . 
 BBC , Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty and Voice of America are banned in Azerbaijan . 
 During the last few years , three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations . Azerbaijan has the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015 , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , and is the 5th most censored country in the world , ahead of Iran and China . 
 A report by an Amnesty International researcher in October 2015 points to ' ... the severe deterioration of human rights in Azerbaijan over the past few years . Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society ' . Amnesty 's 2015 / 16 annual report on the country stated ' ... persecution of political dissent continued . Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work . At least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year . Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad , while their family members also faced harassment and arrests . International human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country . Reports of torture and other ill @-@ treatment <unk>

 = Plaza Sésamo = 
 Plaza Sésamo ( Spanish : Sesame Square ) , is one of the first international co @-@ productions of the American children 's television program Sesame Street . Its first season premiered in Mexico in 1972 , and was immediately a ratings hit . It also aired throughout Latin America , to a potential audience of 25 million children in 34 countries . Unlike some of the earliest co @-@ productions , which consisted of dubbed versions of Sesame Street with local language voice @-@ overs , Plaza Sésamo was a true co @-@ production . Half of the show was adapted from the American show , and half was original material , created in Mexico by Mexican writers , performers , and producers . The first season consisted of 130 half @-@ hour episodes . The show 's goals , similar to the process begun in the U.S. , were developed by local experts in television , child development , and early education during curriculum seminars in Caracas , Venezuela . Plaza Sésamo 's goals emphasized problem solving and reasoning , and also included perception , symbolic representation , human diversity , and the child 's environment . Other goals included community cooperation , family life , nutrition , health , safety , self @-@ esteem , and expressing emotions . Early reading skills were taught through the whole language method . The show 's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US $ 1 @.@ 6 million . 
 The show 's set consisted of a typical neighborhood square ( or plaza ) found throughout the region . New Muppets and human characters were created . In all , four seasons of Plaza Sésamo were filmed . The first season resulted in some of the highest ratings in Mexico . The fourth season , filmed in 1995 , was broadcast in the U.S. , making it the first foreign @-@ language co @-@ production shown in the U.S. Studies conducted after the first season of Plaza Sésamo showed that it had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience . Highly significant difference were found in tests about general knowledge , letters , and numbers after children were exposed to the show . Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers , even in subjects that were not taught by the show . Characters from the show participated in campaigns promoting health and nutrition ; in 2009 , the Sesame Workshop , the organization responsible for the American show , was awarded the " Champion of Health " award by the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) for its efforts . 
 Sesame Workshop recently produced Sesame Amigos for Spanish @-@ speakers from the United States . 
 = = Background = = 
 A few months after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US , producers from several countries all around the world approached the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW , later the Sesame Workshop , or " the Workshop " ) , the organization responsible for the show 's production , to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries . Co @-@ creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted . Many years later , Cooney recalled , " To be frank , I was really surprised , because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show . We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American , and it turns out they 're the most international characters ever created " . She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann , who left commercial television to become her assistant , as a CTW vice @-@ president . One of Dann 's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries . By summer 1970 , he had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call " co @-@ productions " . 
 As of 2006 , there were 20 active co @-@ productions . In 2001 , CTW vice @-@ president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , they were seen in more than 140 countries . Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co @-@ productions accounted for US $ 96 million in 1994 . Cole stated , " Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world " . Most of the early international versions were what Cole called " fairly simple " , consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice @-@ overs and instructional cutaways . Studies conducted on the effects of several co @-@ productions found that viewers of these shows gain basic skills from watching them . 
 = = Production = = 
 Plaza Sésamo debuted in Mexico on the Televisa network in 1972 . According to Sesame Street producer Gregory J. Gettas , <unk> Sésamo was one of Sesame Street 's first true co @-@ productions , programs that were developed using a variant of a flexible model , called the CTW model , created by the producers and creators of the American show , in the countries they aired . Like the American show in the late 1960s , the producers and researchers in Mexico conducted a curriculum seminar in Caracas , Venezuela . The goals they developed , however , were significantly different than the goals developed in the U.S. For example , the Plaza Sésamo team emphasized problem solving and reasoning . Their educational goals included perception , symbolic representation , human diversity , and the child 's environment . Other goals included community cooperation , family life , nutrition , health , safety , self @-@ esteem , and expressing emotions . The show was designed to address the educational needs of the region 's 25 million children in 34 countries , including its target audience of 7 million children between the ages of 3 and 6 in Mexico alone . Despite their common language , the show 's Latin American viewers had a wide variety of customs and lifestyles . The show 's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US $ 1 @.@ 6 million . 
 The American @-@ produced and dubbed segments were analyzed for cultural appropriateness . If any segments were considered " too American " , meaning that they contained English writing on the screen , showed the American flag , or overtly referred to American history , they were removed . The board was responsible for choosing content from the CTW 's inventory , and it had to satisfy the curriculum goals chosen by the Latin American researchers . They chose to teach reading through the whole language method , which emphasizes teaching children to recognize entire words or phrases , as opposed to phonetics , the way the American show taught reading . The Mexican producers and writers designed a distinctive set that appeared different than the American set and consisted of a typical neighborhood square ( or plaza ) found throughout the region . The set included a background of mountains , a vacant lot with playground equipment , houses , a combination repair shop and store @-@ cafe , and the plaza 's central fountain and benches . New music , written and performed by Latin American artists , was recorded , and writers and performers from Mexico , Argentina , Chile , and Venezuela , were hired . 
 New Muppet characters were created and performed by puppeteers trained in Mexico City . Abelardo , a giant parrot , was modeled after the American show 's Big Bird , and like Big Bird , was a full @-@ body puppet that was controlled by the puppeteer from inside the costume . Paco , a grouchy green parrot , was based on Oscar the Grouch . Abelardo and Paco were both played by Justo Martinez . The Muppets Beto and Enrique , who were based upon Bert and Ernie of the American show , were called " national favorites " by the UPI less than three years after the show 's premiere . In 1975 , Enrique and Beto were used to promote Mexico 's nationwide free vaccination campaign . 
 130 half @-@ hour episodes of the show 's first season were shot in Mexico City entirely in Spanish , under the control of a Mexican research and production team . About half the show 's material was adapted from the American show and dubbed into Spanish , while the other half was produced in Mexico and included animation , live @-@ action films , and studio sequences with human actors and Muppets . A Mexican board of advisers , who set curriculum goals for the show , approved all content , both Mexican and American , something that followed the newly established policies of the CTW . Mexican psychologist Rogelio Diaz @-@ Guerrero was the first chair of the show 's advisory board , which was later expanded to include child @-@ development and educators from other Latin American countries , so that <unk> Sésamo could be broadcast throughout Central and South America , including the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico . 
 The third season , which was filmed in 1983 and consisted of 130 half @-@ hour episodes , had different goals than the previous seasons . One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene , " a matter of critical importance in an area of the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high " . The third season of the show included characters created to " expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models " . The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity , in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes , demonstrating different career options for both men and women , and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities . They cast performers in two different families . The first family was more traditional and consisted of a middle @-@ aged couple named Tono , a mechanic ( played by <unk> Herrara ) , and Alicia , a public health nurse ( Alicia de Bari ) , who had two children . The adults in the second family were young working professionals ; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home . Other human characters included : Jose , a shopkeeper and his young assistant , a student named Mercedes ( <unk> Vigil ) : a truck driver played by Tony Diaz ; and a pilot ( Fernando <unk> ) , who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza . As of 1990 , the third season was still airing in reruns . 
 In 1995 , a fourth season of Plaza Sésamo was produced . It featured a larger cast of children , more original music , and a new set designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo <unk> . The season focused on a more innovative curriculum , developed by a board of Latin American educators and UNICEF , and included topics such as health , hygiene , safety issues , cooperation , counting , and the alphabet . The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families , for the purpose of promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children 's first teachers . The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish @-@ speakers in the country ; it was the first time an original co @-@ production was shown in the U.S. As Gary Knell , an executive at the CTW stated , " Our mission is to educate all kids . And the fact is , in the U.S. , especially in cities like Los Angeles , there 's an enormous number of Spanish @-@ speaking households " . 
 The fourth season was test @-@ marketed for American audiences in April on PBS and Univision stations in Miami , Dallas , and Los Angeles . The test @-@ run was successful , so PBS and Univision began airing it nationally in December ; it reached 92 % of the country 's Spanish @-@ speaking households . At first , Plaza Sésamo 's producers were concerned that the show would be attacked , but The Los Angeles Times reported that " even some staunch opponents of bilingual education concede that Plaza Sésamo has its merits " . The L.A. Times also stated that its broadcast in the U.S. was an acknowledgment that Spanish was a prominent language in the U.S. and that more children were bilingual . The show 's supporters believed that exposure to an educational program like Plaza Sésamo would result in the transfer of Spanish skills to English and increase literacy in both languages . Bilingual education opponents disagreed , but were not against the show 's entertainment value . According to Knell , the CTW found that watching the Spanish version did not draw children away from the English version . 
 In 2012 , Plaza Sésamo celebrated its 40th anniversary with the creation of a new website and a traveling photo exhibit . In December 2013 , the show 's 15th season premiered with 52 episodes . Segments were shot throughout Latin America ; it was the first time the show was filmed in Colombia . Its curriculum focused on math , literacy , diversity , and health . A stakeholders meeting was convened in Bogotá in October 2012 , consisting of interested parties from government and the private sector , and included officials from UNICEF . 
 = = Influence = = 
 When Plaza Sésamo 's first season premiered , it was the highest rated TV program ever broadcast in Mexico . The UPI reported that all three seasons of the show had some of the highest ratings in Mexico ; its second season , which premiered in 1975 , " had piled on ratings that only Mexico 's popular soap operas could rival " . Gettas claimed that Plaza Sésamo was " the model for all subsequent Sesame Street co @-@ productions throughout the world " . He also stated that the first season " had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience " . In 1974 , a study was conducted by American and Mexican researchers that studied the effect of Plaza Sésamo on its viewers . Highly significant differences were found in tests about general knowledge , letters , and numbers after children were exposed to the show . Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers , even in subjects that were not taught by the show . 
 In 1995 , Parque Plaza Sésamo , a 12 @-@ acre theme park based on the show , was opened in Monterrey , Mexico , within the gates of the theme park Parque <unk> . It is the first theme park of its kind in Mexico . According to a press release announcing its opening , Parque Plaza Sésamo includes water rides , live entertainment , interactive , and educational elements . It is privately owned , with Mexican investments , and features the show 's characters , along with the American Sesame Street , via a licensing agreement with Sesame Workshop . The park 's focus audience is around northern Mexico and South Texas . 
 In 2003 , the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) and the Sesame Workshop collaborated in a program promoting vaccinations . Their promotion reached over 147 million children and adults . In 2007 , the Workshop participated in an extensive health promotion in Mexico ; they put many of the characters of Plaza Sésamo on milk containers , which were given to schools , with positive messages about nutrition and exercise . Studies showed that the promotion was effective . Children choose healthy food associated with the show 's characters , and 68 percent of families exposed to the promotion reported positive changes in their children 's nutrition and hygiene habits . In 2009 , the Workshop was awarded the " Champion of Health " award by PAHO for its efforts . In response to a flu pandemic in Mexico , various national celebrities appeared in public service announcements with the Plaza Muppets , discussing flu prevention .

It was the largest hotel built in the United States during the 1940s . The grand opening of the Shamrock is still cited as one of the biggest social events ever held in Houston . Sold to Hilton Hotels in 1955 and operated for over three decades as the Shamrock Hilton , the facility endured financial struggles throughout its history . In 1985 , Hilton Hotels donated the building to the Texas Medical Center and the structure was demolished on June 1 , 1987 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Designed by Fort Worth architect Wyatt C. Hedrick , the eighteen @-@ story building with a green tile pitched roof and 1 @,@ 100 rooms was conceived by McCarthy as a city @-@ sized hotel scaled for conventions with a resort atmosphere . The hotel was located in a suburban area three miles ( 5 km ) southwest of downtown Houston at the acute southwest corner of Main Street and Bellaire Boulevard ( West Holcombe Boulevard after 1963 ) . At the time , this was on the fringes of countryside and was meant to be the first phase of a much larger indoor shopping and entertainment complex called McCarthy Center , anchored alongside the planned Texas Medical Center . At the hotel 's north side was a five @-@ story building containing a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ car garage and 25 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 300 m2 ) exhibition hall . To the south was the hotel 's lavishly landscaped garden designed by Ralph Ellis Gunn , a terrace and an immense swimming pool measuring 165 by 142 feet ( 43 m ) described as the world 's biggest outdoor pool , which accommodated exhibition waterskiing and featured a 3 story @-@ high diving platform with an open spiral staircase . Construction was completed for about $ 21 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to over $ 200 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2007 ) . 
 Politician and entrepreneur Jesse H. Jones privately warned McCarthy that business travelers would be reluctant to stay at a hotel three miles south from downtown Houston . Hotel industry executives flatly warned McCarthy the project would not be profitable . He publicly replied , " I went into the oil business in 1933 when everybody said I was a damn fool . Now they 're saying it again about my hotel . " 
 The 5 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 460 m2 ) lobby was paneled in <unk> mahogany with added trim heavily influenced by Art Deco , a design movement which had been popular during the 1920s and 30s . McCarthy ordered furnishings and decor in 63 shades of green , a nod to his ancestral Ireland . Hedrick 's architectural firm had reportedly been the third @-@ largest in the US , however his conservative design for the building 's exterior along with its lavish interiors by Robert D. Harrell of Los Angeles drew wide criticism , notably from Frank Lloyd Wright who while being shown the completed facility before it opened , pointed at the lobby ceiling and said to Fay Jones , " That , young man , is an example of the effects of venereal disease on architecture . " Wright also called the Shamrock " an imitation Rockefeller Center " ( which had been completed ten years earlier ) . McCarthy claimed the decor represented " the best of all periods . " Time magazine described it as " eclectic . " The building 's structural design has since been characterized as " more robust and sturdy than sleek and futuristic . " 
 = = Historic grand opening = = 
 The hotel opened with fireworks displays on St. Patrick ’ s Day 1949 . Two thousand Houstonians paid $ 42 a person to have dinner at what was widely publicized as “ Houston ’ s biggest party " which cost an estimated one million dollars . The party was attended by over 150 Hollywood celebrities including Ginger Rogers , Hedda Hopper , Robert Preston and Errol Flynn along with noted Los Angeles business executives and reporters , some of whom were flown in to Houston International Airport on a customized Boeing 307 <unk> airplane which McCarthy had bought only days earlier from Howard Hughes . Many more were brought in by train on a chartered Santa Fe Super Chief . With a crowd estimated at 50 @,@ 000 gathering outside the hotel , newspaper boys dressed in black tie handed out commemorative editions of the Houston Post as guests arrived that evening . The party became very overcrowded , with three thousand people milling in the hotel 's public areas , a thousand more than had been foreseen . Houston mayor Oscar F. Holcombe and his wife sat in a hallway for two hours after his chair was stolen . " It was the worst mob scene I have ever witnessed , " Holcombe said later . The festivities became so raucous that a radio broadcast from the hotel by actress , singer and World War II pinup girl Dorothy Lamour was cut off by the network ; assuming he was off @-@ air , NBC audio engineer Raoul Murphy uttered an expletive heard live nationwide and dead air greeted the audience for a very long twenty seconds . Due to the numerous broadcast difficulties , Lamour reportedly fled the stage in tears . 
 The Houston Chronicle 's society editor wrote that the event was " bedlam in diamonds " . Life called it " ... the most dazzling exhibition of evening dresses and big names ever seen in Texas . Everyone had to concede it was quite a party and quite a hotel . " The grand opening of the Shamrock is still cited as one of the biggest social events in Houston ’ s history . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The Shamrock initially had a staff of 1 @,@ 200 managed by George Lindholm , who had been recruited from the socially prominent Waldorf @-@ Astoria hotel in New York . There were 23 different employee uniforms . Guests signed the register in " grass @-@ hued " green ink and their luggage was carried by bellhops wearing emerald green , lemon trimmed uniforms past a portrait of McCarthy in the elevator lobby to air @-@ conditioned , green @-@ hued rooms each with generously framed abstract art on the walls , push @-@ button radios ( including recorded music from an elaborate in @-@ house system through which an operator played extended @-@ length phonographic records ) and television , all somewhat rare amenities for a hotel at the time . Over a third of the rooms had kitchenettes . Celebrity singers ( including Lamour ) performed in the hotel 's nightclub , called the Emerald room . From 1949 to 1953 the Shamrock hosted a network radio program called Saturday at the Shamrock carried by the American Broadcasting Company , then the only nationally broadcast scripted radio program produced outside New York or Los Angeles . 
 However the Shamrock soon began experiencing persistent problems with occupancy rates and was seldom if ever full . McCarthy had spent lavishly , then borrowed heavily against his assets ( including the hotel ) to leverage a series of risky investments and his cash reserves quickly dwindled . Within a year Lindholm quietly resigned . In 1952 McCarthy defaulted on a loan and the hotel was acquired by Equitable Life Assurance Society . That same year author Edna Ferber described the Shamrock as the " Conquistador " in her novel Giant ( and it was later briefly featured in the 1956 film adaptation directed by George Stevens ) . Despite financial troubles the resort @-@ like Shamrock with its restaurants , bars and swank shops had become a popular gathering place for local society and was characterized as " Houston 's Riviera " during the early 1950s . The Shamrock 's private and sleek Cork Club was noted as the site of many oil deals ( and reportedly , fist fights ) , along with performances by singer Frank Sinatra . In 1953 singer Patty Andrews of the Andrews Sisters launched her brief solo career in the hotel 's still somewhat fashionable Emerald room nightclub .

 In 1954 the Hilton Hotels Corporation assumed management of the hotel and bought the property at a discount from its construction costs in 1955 but also struggled to find a profitable model for the huge facility , later shown to be isolated from both downtown Houston and its growing system of freeways . Moreover the Shamrock was overwhelmed by competition from many much smaller , cheaper and automobile @-@ friendly motels . A low two @-@ story " <unk> " wing in the form of a motel was added next to the swimming pool in 1957 . Meanwhile affluent suburban home buyers bypassed the area and the planned shopping and entertainment center was never built ( although McCarthy 's concept influenced the successful Houston Galleria which opened near an intersection of freeways on the city 's west side in 1970 ) . In about 1965 the first Trader Vic 's restaurant in Texas was launched at the Shamrock where it did business until 1980 . The hotel remained popular for Houston social events such as debutante balls , barbecues and business meetings , continuing operations as the Shamrock Hilton until 1986 , by which time even its local reputation had long since faded . 
 = = Demolition = = 
 During a severe local recession in 1985 the 36 @-@ year @-@ old hotel , still the second largest in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting , was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center . In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy and the hotel opened its last annual St Patrick 's Day party to the public . That evening , some people who had been at the opening night party in 1949 reportedly attended a semi @-@ formal event in the hotel 's Emerald room . A few employees had been with the hotel since its first year of operation . The building was demolished 1 June 1987 ( McCarthy died 18 months later ) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot . The Institute of Biosciences and Technology , a component of the Texas A & M Health Science Center has since been built on the site and ironically , along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds , the hotel 's multi @-@ story parking garage was retained .

 Drew Doughty ( born December 8 , 1989 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who currently plays for the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He was selected second overall by the Kings in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft from the Guelph Storm of the OHL , where he was twice voted the league 's top offensive defenceman . Doughty made his NHL debut in 2008 as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old and was named to the All @-@ Rookie Team . He is a two @-@ time Stanley Cup champion with the Kings from the 2011 – 12 NHL season and the 2013 – 14 NHL season , two @-@ time Olympic gold medallist with the Canadian national team at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014 , 2009 World Championship silver medallist , 2008 World Junior Championship gold medalist , and a Norris Trophy finalist from the 2009 – 10 and 2014 – 15 NHL season winning the trophy in 2016 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Doughty was born in London , Ontario , the son of Paul and Connie Doughty . He was introduced to hockey when he was given a mini stick for his first birthday , was skating by the age of two and was playing before he was four . Doughty also played soccer as a youth as a goaltender – his father had a history with the game and his sister Chelsea is named after the English team of the same name . He was considered for a provincial under @-@ 14 team , but gave up the sport at 16 to focus on hockey . Nonetheless , Doughty felt that his time playing goal in soccer helped him develop an awareness of the players and the game in hockey .

 Doughty was selected by the Guelph Storm fifth overall in the 2005 Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) Priority Selection draft . He scored five goals and 33 points for the Storm in 2005 – 06 and was named to the OHL All @-@ Rookie Team on defence . Doughty played in the 2007 OHL All @-@ Star Game and was voted the top offensive defenceman in the league by the coaches following a 74 @-@ point season in 2006 – 07 . He again won both honours in 2007 – 08 with a 50 @-@ point season , and was awarded the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the OHL 's outstanding defenceman . National Hockey League ( NHL ) Central Scouting ranked Doughty as the third best North American prospect for the 2008 NHL Entry Draft . He was selected second overall by the Los Angeles Kings , a choice that excited Doughty as he grew up a Kings fan and wanted to play in Los Angeles . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 Doughty made the Kings opening day roster to start the 2008 – 09 NHL season , one of eight 18 @-@ year @-@ olds to do so across the league . Earning a spot on the Kings roster overwhelmed Doughty , who did not expect to play in the NHL so quickly . He made his NHL debut on October 11 , 2008 against the San Jose Sharks , and scored his first goal on October 20 against the Colorado Avalanche . The Kings had the option of returning him to junior without using up one year of his rookie contract if they did so before he played his tenth NHL game . However , they chose to keep him on the roster for the season . His defensive partner , Sean O 'Donnell agreed with the decision , praising Doughty 's maturity . He played 81 games in his rookie season , finishing with six goals and 21 assists , earning a spot on the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team , while also playing in the <unk> Game as part of the 2009 All @-@ Star <unk> . 
 Doughty improved to 59 points in his sophomore season of 2009 – 10 and finished third in the league in scoring amongst defencemen . He was named to the second all @-@ star team and was named a finalist for the Norris Trophy as the league 's top defenceman . His coach , Terry Murray , praised Doughty for his improvement during the season . Doughty helped lead the Kings into the playoffs for the first time since 2002 , though they lost their first round series to the Vancouver Canucks . He played all six games of the series despite suffering a wrist injury in the first game that forced him to decline an invitation to play for Canada at the 2010 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships . 
 The Kings ' media voted Doughty the team 's outstanding defenceman for the third consecutive season in 2010 – 11 . His offensive output fell from 59 points the previous season to 40 , but he scored his 100th career point on December 21 , 2010 against the Colorado Avalanche . A restricted free agent following the season , Doughty and the Kings struggled to agree on a new contract . The Kings offered $ 6 @.@ 8 million per season over seven years , but Doughty rejected the offer . Though the Kings publicly stated they were not willing to sign him for a higher annual salary than team leader <unk> Kopitar 's $ 6 @.@ 8 million , the two sides ultimately agreed on an eight @-@ year , $ 56 million contract that made Doughty the highest paid player on the team at an average of $ 7 million per season . Doughty missed the majority of Los Angeles ' training camp as a holdout , including five pre @-@ season games , before signing the contract on September 29 , 2011 . 
 In addition to missing training camp , Doughty suffered a concussion early in the season that forced him onto injured reserve . He struggled upon his return from the injury and faced criticism that he had allowed his physical conditioning to lapse . Doughty himself admitted that he was not enjoying the game early in the season . He said that his season turned a corner when the team replaced Murray with Darryl Sutter , a coach who preached the need for preparation . Doughty was elevated into a role where he was expected to shut down the opposition 's top forwards , forcing him to focus more on his defensive play than his offensive . Consequently , Doughty 's 36 points on the season was his lowest total in three years . He was the top @-@ scoring defenceman in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs , however , recording 16 points in 20 games to help the Kings win the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . Doughty was praised as the top player for either team in the final series , a six @-@ game victory over the New Jersey Devils . 
 = = International play = = 
 In 2006 , Doughty played with Team Ontario at the World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge , finishing fifth , then won a gold medal with the national under @-@ 18 team at the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament . He participated the 2007 IIHF World U18 Championships , scoring five points in six games for the fourth place Canadians , and while he was considered for the Canadian junior team for the 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , he did not make the cut . Doughty was named to participate in the 2007 Super Series , an eight @-@ game tournament against the Russian juniors meant to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series . He played in all eight games , recording two assists , as Canada finished the series unbeaten with seven wins and a tie . He then earned a spot on the roster for the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . Doughty was named a tournament all @-@ star , and given the Directorate Award for Best Defenceman after helping lead the Canadians to their fourth consecutive gold medal at the tournament . 
 Following his rookie season in the NHL , Doughty made his debut with the senior team , playing in the 2009 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships . He scored one goal and added six assists in nine games , however the Canadians settled for silver after losing the championship game to Russia , 2 – 1 . His strong play in the World Championships earned Doughty an invitation to Canada 's summer orientation camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics . Doughty earned one of the final spots on the Canadian defence , beating out established players such as Dion Phaneuf , Jay Bouwmeester and Mike Green . Doughty became the youngest player to represent Canada in a major best @-@ on @-@ best tournament since Eric Lindros participated in the 1991 Canada Cup at the age of 18 . He emerged as one of the top defenders on the team , and won the gold medal as Canada defeated the United States in the final game . He was on the ice when Sidney Crosby scored the tournament @-@ winning goal in overtime . Doughty was a star at the 2014 Winter Olympics , where Canada defended its gold medal title . He led the team with four goals and featured prominently on a defensive core which allowed only three goals in six games en route to being undefeated , one of the best team performances in Olympic history .

 = Haunting the Chapel = 
 Haunting the Chapel is an EP released by American thrash metal band Slayer in 1984 through Metal Blade and Enigma Records . Slayer 's debut album Show No Mercy became Metal Blade 's highest selling , leading to producer Brian Slagel wanting to release an EP . Recorded in Hollywood the recording process proved difficult when recording drums in a studio without carpet , although it resulted in drummer Dave Lombardo meeting Gene Hoglan who was to become an influence in his drumming style and speed . However , Hoglan said he gave him a bunch of tips and never really gave him lessons ; he was influenced by Slayer too . 
 Although originally featuring three songs , the record evidences a marked evolution from the style of their previous album , Show No Mercy , and is considered the first demonstration of the band 's " classic " style displayed on later albums and is often described as a " stepping stone " . The songs " Captor of Sin " and " Chemical Warfare " are regularly featured on the band 's live set list . " Chemical Warfare " appears in Guitar Hero : Warriors of Rock . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Slayer 's previous album Show No Mercy had sold over 40 @,@ 000 copies worldwide and the band were performing the songs " Chemical Warfare " and " Captor of Sin " live , which made producer Brian Slagel want to release an EP . The album was recorded in Hollywood with sound engineer Bill Metoyer , in a studio with no carpet which was a problem while recording the drums . Slagel was acting as executive producer . Metoyer is Christian and the lyrics from Show No Mercy did not bother him . However , the first words Araya sang when recording Haunting the Chapel were " The holy cross , symbol of lies , intimidates the lives of Christian born " , and other anti @-@ religious lyrics ; Metoyer thought he would go to Hell for his part in recording the lyrics . These lyrical themes were inspired by the band Venom , who influenced King and was also into the Satanic image . 
 Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo set his drum kit on the concrete and the kit went " all over the place " while playing . Lombardo asked Gene Hoglan to hold his kit together , while recording " Chemical Warfare " , with Hoglan thinking , " I hope he does this in one or two takes , because this is rough . " Hoglan was coaching Lombardo how to use double @-@ bass drums to improve his drumming ability and speed ; Lombardo asserts Hoglan was " an amazing double @-@ bass player even back then " , although Hoglan played double bass since a short time then . Eddy Schreyer provided audio mastering and digital remastering , with the cover art design created by Vince Gutierrez . Haunting the Chapel was darker and more thrash @-@ oriented than Show No Mercy , and laid the groundwork for the future direction in the band 's sound . 
 = = Touring = = 
 Hoglan worked as a roadie for the band after their lighting guy did not show up one night , and performed Lombardo 's soundchecks . Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks , which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel . Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin : " He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band . He said we needed to be more evil . And then he goes , ' By the way , I 'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now . ' " 
 Hoglan was fired as he thought a roadie only did lighting , while vocalist Tom Araya 's brother Johnny Araya would do all roadie duties , such as moving equipment , working with sound and lights , and setting up the stage . The band performed a show in Seattle in front of a crowd of 1500 , the largest show they performed at the time , supporting Metal Church , and in Texas played with a band also called Slayer in San Antonio . However , it was the San Antonio Slayer 's goodbye show . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Although the EP did not enter any charts , Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic awarded the EP three out of five stars . Rivadavia said Haunting the Chapel was a " stepping stone " that " offers important clues about this transition period , which saw Slayer 's rock @-@ based song structures give way to the non @-@ linear , genre @-@ defining style thereafter regarded as thrash metal 's signature sound . " The tracks " Chemical Warfare " and " Captor of Sin " are played at Slayer 's live shows regularly . 
 Vocalist Karl Willetts of the death metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an inspiration for the band : " When Slayer 's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never heard anything like that before with that style of guitar playing . We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing . And other bands we heard like Venom , Slaughter and Metallica . So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together . " Chuck <unk> of the band Death said the record was " life changing at the time " asserting , " That was some of the early stuff that gave me that push . " 
 The black metal band <unk> covered " Chemical Warfare " on a tribute CD to Slayer titled Gateway to Hell , Vol . 2 : A Tribute to Slayer . Thrash metal band Equinox also made an appearance on the album covering " Haunting the Chapel " .

 = 2008 Humanitarian Bowl = 
 The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game between the Maryland Terrapins and the Nevada Wolf Pack on December 30 , 2008 . It was the two teams ' first meeting . The game featured two conference tie @-@ ins : the University of Maryland represented the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) and the University of Nevada represented the Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) . The game was played at Bronco Stadium in Boise , Idaho and was the 12th edition of the Humanitarian Bowl . It was sponsored by the New Plymouth , Idaho @-@ based company <unk> 's Truck Stops , which claims to be the largest chain of truck stops in the United States . 
 The featured match @-@ up was between what was called a " wildly inconsistent " Maryland team and the third @-@ best rushing defense and fifth @-@ best total offense of Nevada . The result was an offensive shoot @-@ out . The final score of 42 – 35 in favor of Maryland exceeded total @-@ points predictions by as much as 17 and tied the all @-@ time Humanitarian Bowl record . 
 Before the kickoff , seven Maryland players , including six starters , received partial @-@ game suspensions for violating the team 's curfew . Maryland took a quick lead within the first two minutes of play , but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times . In the second quarter , Nevada 's dual @-@ threat quarterback , Colin Kaepernick , was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game . Nevertheless , Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety and was able to scramble for a touchdown . Halfway through the third quarter , Maryland 's leading running back , Da 'Rel Scott , made his first appearance of the game . He had been one of the suspended players , but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 The ACC had a contractual tie @-@ in with the Humanitarian Bowl that afforded the bowl organizing committee the eighth pick of the conference 's bowl @-@ eligible teams . An ACC team participated in the game every year from 2003 to 2008 . Before the selections , the ACC announced that 2008 would be the final year of its tie @-@ in with the game due to travel and cost considerations . 
 The other conference tie @-@ in was with the WAC , which has generally fielded its champion in the game . The WAC has provided a team for the Humanitarian Bowl every year since 2001 . Initially , it was speculated that the WAC championship team , Boise State , would make its fifth appearance in the bowl played in its home stadium . 
 = = = Potential " Battle of the <unk> " = = = 
 At the end of the regular season , there were three undefeated teams from non @-@ Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) conferences , and National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) rules required only one to be given a berth in a BCS game . These three non @-@ BCS teams were Ball State , Boise State , and Utah . The Utes were considered heavy favorites for that berth . In a preemptive move , Humanitarian Bowl officials conducted negotiations with Ball State of the Mid @-@ American Conference ( MAC ) in an effort to arrange a " Battle of the <unk> " with Boise State . If Ball State accepted , presumably with the consent of the ACC , it would have forced a team from the ACC to find an at @-@ large bid . However , Ball State officials were unhappy with the home @-@ field advantage that would have been given to Boise State and the expenses associated with traveling to Idaho . Ball State , which lost the MAC Championship Game and ended its perfect record , declined the overtures and instead met Tulsa in the 2009 GMAC Bowl . 
 = = = ACC team selection = = = 
 In 2008 , the ACC experienced a season of unusual parity and fielded an NCAA @-@ record number of ten bowl @-@ eligible teams . Six of those possessed identical 4 – 4 conference records , and the remaining four had 5 – 3 conference records . Among the eligible teams , N.C. State ( 6 – 6 ) possessed the only non @-@ winning overall record and was therefore forced by NCAA rules to find an at @-@ large berth outside of the ACC tie @-@ in games . 
 For the 2008 season , the ACC possessed nine tie @-@ in games . The Orange Bowl was the conference 's BCS game and granted an automatic bid to the winner of the ACC Championship Game . The Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl in Atlanta , Georgia had the first @-@ pick of eligible ACC teams after the BCS game , followed by the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville , Florida and the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando , Florida . The Music City Bowl in Nashville , Tennessee ; the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte , North Carolina ; and the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco , California submitted their preferences together , and selected in that order if an agreement between them could not be reached . A special clause also guaranteed that , with a minimum of eight wins , the loser of the championship game would be selected no lower than by the Music City Bowl . The Humanitarian Bowl had the eighth @-@ overall choice followed by the inaugural EagleBank Bowl in Washington , D.C. 
 That season , an economic recession factored into the selections . In general , bowl officials attempted to select teams in close geographic proximity to compensate for an anticipated drop in ticket sales . Maryland , however , stated that they would not accept a berth to face in @-@ state rival Navy in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school 's final exams . The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland 's participation in it the year prior . 
 Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen made his case to bowl officials by saying that the Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4 – 4 teams and not played a game against the fifth , Miami . Three of those teams were selected ahead of Maryland : the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team ; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson , a school with a traditionally well @-@ traveling fanbase ; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami . After the higher @-@ priority bowl games made their selections , the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest , the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference . Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base , well @-@ traveled fans , and greater television marketing potential . 
 In week 12 of the 2008 season , Maryland possessed a 7 – 3 record and stood atop the ACC Atlantic Division . However , the Terps lost their final two regular season games and slid to a four @-@ way tie for third place in the division . Earlier in the season , Maryland defeated four ranked opponents , a feat surpassed only by the two teams that played in the BCS National Championship Game , Florida and Oklahoma — and those each played an extra game with their conference championships . Maryland spent three weeks ranked in the top @-@ 25 of the Associated Press Poll . 
 = = = WAC team selection = = = 
 At the end of the 2008 season , the WAC had six bowl @-@ eligible teams , five of which participated in bowl games . The WAC had three conference tie @-@ ins : the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque , New Mexico ; the Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu , Hawaii ; and the Humanitarian Bowl . Additionally , the WAC had provisions for conditional participation in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego , California ; the Independence Bowl in Shreveport , Louisiana ; and the GMAC Bowl in Mobile , Alabama . 
 In the past , the Humanitarian Bowl usually selected the WAC championship team . However , Boise State was not content to play a middle @-@ grade ACC team after negotiations with Ball State failed . The WAC commissioner said that the Broncos would look for another match @-@ up that had " the same type of sizzle " as a match @-@ up against Ball State . The Idaho Statesman added that " The Terrapins don 't ' sizzle . ' " Boise State traveled to the Poinsettia Bowl , where they faced 11th @-@ ranked TCU , which had lost only to the BCS @-@ bound Oklahoma and Utah teams . 
 In Nevada 's final regular season game , Kaepernick led the Wolf Pack in a second @-@ half comeback to defeat Louisiana Tech . The seventh win guaranteed Nevada a berth in one of the three WAC tie @-@ in bowls . The Wolf Pack finished the season in a three @-@ way tie for second place in the WAC alongside Hawaii and Louisiana Tech . Hawaii had a standing contract with the home @-@ town Hawaii Bowl where it played Notre Dame . Louisiana Tech , having lost to both Nevada and Hawaii , appeared unlikely to be selected for a bowl at all . However , the Bulldogs were able to take advantage of a provisional WAC berth in the Independence Bowl since neither the Big 12 nor the Southeastern Conference could provide eligible teams . Two other WAC teams achieved bowl eligibility with 6 – 6 records . Fresno State secured a slot in the New Mexico Bowl , but San Jose State was unable to find an at @-@ large berth . 
 With Boise State 's decision to decline the Humanitarian Bowl invitation , the organizing committee looked to Nevada . Like Maryland , Nevada ended the regular season with a 7 – 5 record . The Wolf Pack 's schedule included losses against then sixth @-@ ranked Missouri , ninth @-@ ranked Boise State , and 12th @-@ ranked Texas Tech . Nevada finished the regular season ranked second nationally in rushing offense and fifth in total offense . The Wolf Pack possessed two 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard rushers : dual @-@ threat quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Vai Taua . Kaepernick also threw for more than 2 @,@ 000 yards . 
 On December 7 , 2008 , the Humanitarian Bowl officially extended invitations to Maryland and Nevada , both of which were accepted .

 Pundits and opponents have asserted that Boise State benefits from an added advantage by wearing their blue home uniforms to match the playing field . Boise State possessed a 64 – 2 record at Bronco Stadium from 1998 to 2008 . Nevada , designated as the home team , likewise wore blue uniforms during the Humanitarian Bowl . 
 ACC teams viewed a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl as undesirable due to its location . Aside from being one of the lower priority tie @-@ ins , the destination is far outside the conference 's geographic footprint . Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans . In addition , the game is hosted at a cold @-@ weather venue , which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida , California , and Georgia . 
 The game historically relied on local ticket sales , and the participating schools struggled to sell their allotted tickets . On December 8 , a Boise @-@ area television news station reported that Maryland and Nevada had sold just sixteen and eight tickets , respectively . The story was widely circulated by sports @-@ related blogs , but the figures were discredited by a Maryland official . On December 18 , the Reno Gazette @-@ Journal reported that 100 tickets had been sold by Nevada . Maryland officials admitted that ticket sales among its fans were expected to be low , with one stating they were in the " mid @-@ hundreds " a week and a half from the game date . According to a Baltimore Sun reporter , Maryland 's final ticket figure was about 800 . By comparison , Clemson sold about 3 @,@ 500 tickets for the 2001 Humanitarian Bowl , and Georgia Tech sold about 250 tickets for the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl .

 Predictions for the game varied , but generally favored Nevada with Maryland as the underdog . Several publications , including Sports Illustrated , named Nevada as three @-@ point favorites in spread betting . ESPN 's ACC correspondent predicted Nevada to win by 21 points . Las Vegas betting firms assigned Nevada as <unk> to 3 @.@ 0 @-@ point favorites . The over @-@ under was predicted to be between 60 @.@ 0 and 62 @.@ 0 points . 
 Under head coach Ralph Friedgen , Maryland had earned a reputation for inconsistency , sometimes even being referred to as " schizophrenic " . During the regular season , the Terrapins managed to beat four of the five top @-@ 25 teams they faced : 23rd @-@ ranked California , 20th @-@ ranked Clemson , 21st @-@ ranked Wake Forest , and 16th @-@ ranked North Carolina . All of those teams subsequently participated in bowl games . However , Maryland also lost to teams they were expected to defeat . They lost by ten points to 12 @.@ 5 @-@ point underdogs Middle Tennessee State . Maryland suffered a 31 @-@ point shut @-@ out against Virginia , a team ( then 1 – 3 ) that had lost to Duke , 31 – 3 , the week prior . 
 Nevada suffered three of its five losses against then top @-@ twelve ranked teams . They lost to Big 12 Championship runner @-@ up Missouri and Texas Tech , which , in midseason , was in contention for the national championship and was led by Heisman Trophy prospect Graham Harrell . Nevada managed a close game against Boise State . The Wolf Pack lost by seven points to a team that recorded an average 21 @.@ 4 @-@ point margin of victory in a perfect 12 – 0 regular season . Boise State preserved victory when a Hail Mary pass from Kaepernick was broken up in the final seconds . Nevada , however , was also accused of inconsistent play . The Wolf Pack suffered a home loss to " perennial WAC bottom @-@ feeder " New Mexico State , 48 – 45 . 
 = = = = Maryland offense vs. Nevada defense = = = = 
 Maryland 's offense was run by first @-@ year offensive coordinator and former wide receivers coach James Franklin , who utilized a West Coast system . During the 2008 regular season , starting quarterback Chris Turner threw for 2 @,@ 318 yards , 11 touchdowns , and 10 interceptions . NFL Draft prospect Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey accumulated 561 receiving yards in ten games . Heyward @-@ Bey also recorded 208 rushing yards and was often utilized in reverses and other trick plays due to his breakaway speed . Maryland had another offensive weapon in running back Da 'Rel Scott , who ran for 959 yards during the regular season . Overall , the rushing offense gained 134 @.@ 5 yards per game and was ranked 72nd in the nation . Against Virginia Tech and Boston College , Maryland rushed for − 12 and − 6 yards , respectively . The previous year , in the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State , Maryland recorded 19 yards on the ground against the then second @-@ ranked rushing defense . 
 About Maryland , Nevada head coach Chris Ault said , " Their offense to me is very balanced . They can run the ball and do a good job . With [ quarterback Chris ] Turner , they split out and they have some nice receivers . Whereas Missouri was going to throw it as much as Texas Tech did , I think Maryland is probably one of the more balanced teams we 've played this year . " 
 The Maryland offense faced first @-@ year defensive coordinator Nigel Burton 's Nevada defense . It ranked third in the nation against the run , allowing 74 @.@ 5 rushing yards per game , but was last ( 120th ) in the nation in passing defense , allowing an average of 321 @.@ 1 passing yards per game . Nevada was ranked eighth in the number of quarterback sacks with 35 . Kevin <unk> , ranked tenth in the nation in sacks , and <unk> Moch , ranked fifteenth , accumulated more than nine each . Maryland quarterback Turner was sacked 11 times in the Terrapins ' last two games against Florida State and Boston College . Nevada was also ranked sixth nationally in tackles for loss , with an average of 8 @.@ 0 per game . 
 = = = = Nevada offense vs. Maryland defense = = = = 
 In 2008 , Nevada typically ran an offensive scheme referred to as the " pistol offense " , a system that was pioneered by head coach Chris Ault . In the pistol offense , the quarterback lines up four yards directly behind the center and with a running back directly behind the quarterback . Under the system , the offense attempts to keep the opposing defense off balance by diversifying the types of plays that can be run , with a focus on running up the middle , " quarterback keepers " in which the passer runs the ball , and play action passes where the quarterback fakes a hand @-@ off before throwing to a receiver . It aims to create man @-@ to @-@ man match @-@ ups with the receivers and compensate for an undersized offensive line . With the running back obscured from view by the quarterback , it can also create confusion for the opposing linebackers and allow more effective deception , which is critical to play @-@ action fakes . 
 The system worked well during the regular season . Nevada starting quarterback and 2008 WAC Offensive Player of the Year Colin Kaepernick ran for more than 1 @,@ 100 yards and 16 touchdowns in addition to passing for 2 @,@ 479 yards and 19 touchdowns . Alongside Kaepernick , Nevada 's rushing offense was led by running back Vai Taua , who ran for 1 @,@ 420 yards and 14 touchdowns . With two 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard rushers for the first time in school history , Nevada ran for an average of 291 @.@ 4 yards per game . Nevada was ranked fifth nationally in terms of total offense , averaging 510 @.@ 6 yards per game . 
 With regards to facing the pistol offense , Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen said , " If we can keep our assignments and tackle , we 'll be OK . One missed tackle could be a big play ... With the throwing game , there could be a lot of one @-@ on @-@ one situations . To me , it 's pick your poison . What they do best is run it . What we 'd like to do is get them off schedule . If they mix it , then we 're in trouble . " 
 Nevada coach Ault said , " I think the Maryland defense is as physical as Missouri 's was . " Kaepernick said , " You notice how disciplined and how hard they play . They 're never out of alignment . If they 're supposed to be somewhere , they 're going to be there and they 're going to be ready to make a play . When plays come their way , they make them . That 's something we have to be ready for . We have to find a weakness and exploit it . "

 After Maryland 's last regular @-@ season game , defensive coordinator Chris Cosh and tight ends coach and special teams assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations .

Danny Pearman returned to his alma mater , Clemson , to work for Dabo Swinney , who had been promoted from offensive coordinator to interim head coach and , finally , head coach for the Tigers .

 Shortly before the game , Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial @-@ game suspensions on seven players who violated the team 's pre @-@ bowl curfew . The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou , Trey Covington , <unk> Perez , and Derek Drummond , cornerback Jamari McCollough , the quarterback 's preferred third @-@ down wide receiver Danny Oquendo , and leading running back Da 'Rel Scott . All except Drummond were regular starters . Consequently , a much younger line @-@ up started for Maryland , including , according to Friedgen , some who probably would not have seen playing time otherwise . 
 Friedgen stated that the curfew violations occurred over several nights , and that different players violated the rule to separate degrees . He informed Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus . Yow dissented , and they agreed to suspend the players for part of the game . Describing the incident , Friedgen said that " Five percent of [ the ] guys thought they didn 't need to listen to me , that they could get bed checked and sneak out . " He added , " But I checked again at 1 o 'clock . " This is not my first rodeo . "

 The 77 points scored in the game tied the Humanitarian Bowl record for total points , which had been set in 1998 by Idaho and Southern Miss . 
 Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick set the Humanitarian Bowl passing yardage record with 370 yards through the air , and he scored three touchdowns in the process . Despite the loss , Kaepernick 's team outperformed Maryland in terms of passing yardage , total offense , first downs , and time of possession . 
 Maryland freshman wide receiver Torrey Smith , with his 99 @-@ yard kickoff return , broke the all @-@ time Atlantic Coast Conference single @-@ season kickoff return yards record with 1 @,@ 089 yards . Smith also broke the Humanitarian Bowl kick return record , which was previously 98 yards .

 Maryland had previously shown an ability to strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game . In the 2008 season , the team scored 18 out of 28 touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or less than two minutes of game time . This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession . In the Humanitarian Bowl , Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1 : 01 with a 59 @-@ yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon . Maryland also possessed the ball for 2 : 26 less than Nevada . 
 Maryland , which was third @-@ best in the ACC in third down attempts ( 40 @.@ 4 % ) , did comparatively poorly during the game , converting only four of 14 third downs ( 28 @.@ 6 % ) . 
 Defensively , Maryland was able to hold the nation 's third @-@ ranked rushing offense to just 114 yards on the ground . Nevada quarterback Kaepernick , who ran for 1 @,@ 115 yards , was held to just 19 rushing yards , 15 of which were gained during a touchdown run . Two players made their first career interceptions : true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen . Tate 's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score , while Allen 's interception with 4 : 54 remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland . Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall , who had recovered a third @-@ down fumble by Turner . Burley subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down . 
 Maryland 's special teams recorded one touchdown when Torrey Smith returned a kickoff for 99 yards . After the first touchdown of the game , senior placekicker Obi Egekeze missed an extra point for the first time in his career . Early in the season , Egekeze missed his first five field goal attempts , but , prior to the Humanitarian Bowl , he had made all 64 extra @-@ point attempts of his career . After the first failed kick , Egekeze made the other five extra @-@ point attempts of the game . The placekicker also erred when he attempted to kick the ball as it fell off the tee , resulting in a short 15 @-@ yard kick which was returned 36 yards by Nevada to the Maryland nine @-@ yard line .

 In the passing game , Colin Kaepernick achieved a 51 @.@ 1 % pass completion rate ( 24 out of 47 ) . He threw for 370 yards , including three touchdowns . He completed passes to Mike McCoy ( 13 ) , Marko Mitchell ( five ) , Chris Wellington ( three ) , Arthur King , Jr . ( two ) , and Vai Taua ( one ) . Mitchell , Wellington , and Taua each caught a pass for a touchdown . Due to Kaepernick 's injury , backup quarterback Nick Graziano played for one series but was unable to make a completion on two attempts . 
 On the ground , Nevada struggled against the Maryland defense , recording 114 rushing yards , far fewer than its 291 @.@ 4 per game average . Running plays were attempted by Kaepernick and Taua , who made 23 carries for 101 yards and one touchdown . Despite suffering from a sprained ankle , Kaepernick also was able to scamper 15 yards for a rushing touchdown . 
 Conversely , the Nevada defense had difficulty stopping the Maryland run . Nevada 's rush defense allowed 258 yards , compared with its regular @-@ season average of just 74 @.@ 5 yards allowed per game . This was especially true after a well @-@ rested Da 'Rel Scott entered the game in the middle of the third quarter . Head coach Chris Ault said , " He just ran through us like we weren 't there . " Defensive back Jonathan Amaya intercepted a Chris Turner pass for his fourth interception of the season . 
 Brett Jaekle handled all of Nevada 's kicking duties . He made all five extra @-@ point attempts . Jaekle punted eight times for 295 yards and kicked off five times for 270 yards . With 1 : 42 remaining , he attempted an onside kick , but the ball was recovered by Maryland 's Danny Oquendo .

 Nevada posted a final record of 7 – 6 . The game was the third consecutive postseason loss for Chris Ault and Nevada . Ault 's post @-@ season bowl record slid to 1 – 5 as a result . 
 = Battle of Ong Thanh = 
 The Battle of Ong Thanh was fought at the stream of that name on the morning of October 17 , 1967 , in <unk> Thành District , at the time part of the old Bình Dương Province , South Vietnam , today in Bình Phước Province . 
 During the first few months of 1967 , the Viet Cong absorbed heavy losses as a result of large @-@ scale search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army , and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam . In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967 , North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units , hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam . Thus , towards mid @-@ 1967 , the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again , with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone . On June 12 , the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division , which had built @-@ up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh . 
 During that operation , American soldiers initially made only limited contact with the Viet Cong , but defeated enemy troops in two separate battles . On June 17 the 1 / 16th infantry battalion , re @-@ enforced by a company of 2 / 28th infantry engaged in a six @-@ hour battle supported by airstrikes and massive artillery . The majority of the casualties suffered from that engagement alone , when the operation concluded on June 26 , the 1st Infantry Division had lost 57 soldiers dead and 197 wounded . Then in September , following a string of attacks on allied military installations by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops , Major General John H. Hay decided to temporarily stop conducting large @-@ scale operations until the true intentions of Communist forces were known . Towards October , the Viet Cong 271st Regiment marched into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone , to rest and refit for their next major operation . To disrupt the Viet Cong 's resting period , General Hay launched Operation Shenandoah II to clear a section of National Highway 13 which stretched from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh . 
 Starting from September 28 , elements of the 1st Infantry Division were air @-@ lifted into positions around Long Nguyen , but again only few contacts were made with the Viet Cong . However , on October 16 , the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 28th Infantry Regiment found a major Viet Cong bunker system located south of their night defensive position near the Ong Thanh Stream , and a short fire fight broke out . To avoid fighting a long battle , the commander of the 2nd Battalion decided to pull back , and made preparations for a frontal assault on the next day . On the morning of October 17 , two rifle companies of the 2nd Battalion returned to the bunker system they had found the previous day , but they were defeated by the Viet Cong 271st Regiment which had set up an ambush in anticipation of the American attack . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the first half of 1967 , United States military forces in Vietnam had inflicted losses on the Viet Cong , both in terms of infrastructure and manpower , through major ground operations such as Cedar Falls , Junction City and Manhattan . For North Vietnamese military leaders such as Generals Võ Nguyên Giáp and Nguyễn Chí Thanh , the operations carried out by the Americans in South Vietnam had been disastrous for Communist forces . Furthermore , the military situation in North Vietnam also prompted North Vietnamese leaders to question their war strategy . In 1967 the United States expanded their Rolling Thunder bombing campaign , which enabled American airpower to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi 's limited industrial infrastructures . Consequently , North Vietnamese leaders feared that if the Red River dikes were targeted by the Americans , Hanoi and the surrounding farmlands would be flooded . At the same time , the North Vietnamese government was afraid the Viet Cong may split in order to accommodate a resolution with the Saigon government , because the U.S.-backed government in the South was showing no sign of collapse . 
 Despite the unfavorable developments in South Vietnam , North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still win the war if they pursued a strategy of attrition . In other words , the Communists would have to fight on for as long as possible , until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam . To achieve that objective at the tactical level , Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units , and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left . Indeed , towards mid @-@ 1967 General Thanh , who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal , was out to do just that . In June , U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build @-@ up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh , Major General John H. Hay — commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division — launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D. 
 On the first day of the operation , the 1st Infantry Division was able march about 30 kilometers ( 19 mi ) into Phuoc Vinh virtually unopposed . On June 13 , the Americans claimed to have killed about 60 Viet Cong soldiers in their first major contact . On June 17 Lieutenant Colonel Rufus C. Lazzell and the soldiers of the 1st Battalion , 16th Infantry Regiment , was air @-@ assaulted into a clearing known as Landing Zone X @-@ Ray to search for the Viet Cong . At about 1 : 00 pm Lazzell 's battalion was attacked by elements of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment , and the Viet Cong quickly penetrated the 1st Battalion 's perimeters . However , with the support of artillery and helicopter gunships , Lazzell 's men repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks for the loss of 35 killed and 150 wounded . On June 26 , Operation Billings concluded and the Americans claimed to have killed 347 enemy troops and captured one , at a cost of 57 U.S. soldiers dead and 197 wounded . 
 In August , the Viet Cong was back in action again ; this time the 165th Regiment of the 7th Division targeted the Tong Le Chon Special Forces Camp , located southeast of the 1st Infantry Division 's area of operations . Just after midnight on August 7 , the 165th Regiment attacked Tong Le Chon and was able to penetrate the Special Forces Camp , but was forced to flee after an ammunition bunker exploded . That night the Viet Cong assaulted the base several times more , but on each occasion they were repelled by artillery fire and close air @-@ support . By September , the scale of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese activities in III Corps had perplexed the U.S. commanders of Military Assistance Command , Vietnam . In the meantime , however , Hay decided to put an end to large @-@ scale operations which had proven to be unproductive , until the enemy 's real intentions were known . Instead , Hay continued to commit his 2nd Brigade to pacification efforts in southern Bình Dương Province , while the 3rd Brigade provided protection for engineers clearing Highway 13 .

 Following various engagements with the U.S. 1st Infantry Division during the previous months , Colonel Vo Minh Triet , commander of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment , was ordered to move his troops into an area known as the Long Nguyen Secret Zone , which was situated between National Highway 13 and the Michelin Rubber Plantation . It was located about 56 kilometers ( 35 mi ) northwest of Saigon , in Binh Duong Province . There , Triet 's regiment was supposed to receive troop replacements and food supplies , to prepare for a major offensive against an unspecified target in War Zone D. In previous years , the Viet Cong 9th Division had often used the month of September and October to rest and prepare for their winter @-@ spring offensives , and 1967 was no different . For that reason Hay was determined to disrupt the Viet Cong 's resting period by launching Operation Shenandoah II , with the objective of clearing Highway 13 from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh . 
 On September 29 , Hay ordered Colonel George E. Newman — commander of the 1st Brigade — to place the 1st Battalion , 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion , 28th Infantry Regiment , in the northern portion of Long Nguyen . On the next day , Colonel Frank E. <unk> , commander of the 3rd Brigade , was ordered to deploy the 2nd Battalion , 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion , 28th Infantry Regiment to the southern half of the area . In the early stages of Shenandoah II , U.S. forces only made a few contacts with the Viet Cong . On October 2 , a South Vietnamese unit operating east of Highway 13 near Chon Thanh made significant contact with a large Viet Cong formation and absorbed heavy casualties . Enemy documents obtained by the South Vietnamese indicated they had clashed with a battalion @-@ sized unit from the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment , sent to attack Chon Thanh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area . Early in October , Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment had arrived in Long Nguyen but they could not obtain their much @-@ needed food supplies , as a result of allied search @-@ and @-@ destroy operations which had created significant food shortages for Viet Cong units in the region . 
 Triet then marched his starving soldiers southward toward the Ong Thanh Stream to link up with Rear Service Group 83 , but local Viet Cong units also lacked adequate food supplies of their own , so the 271st Regiment was forced to wait in the area for the arrival of rice and other essential supplies . Meanwhile , on October 4 the Lieutenant Colonel Joseph R. Stauffer 's 1st Battalion , 2nd Infantry Regiment , made contact with a company @-@ sized Viet Cong formation about 9 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) south @-@ west of Chon Thanh , and claimed to have killed 12 enemy soldiers . To pursue the retreating Viet Cong formation , Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cavazos — commander of the 1st Battalion , 18th Infantry Regiment — was instructed to conduct an air @-@ assault into a clearing located about 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) west of Stauffer ' battalion , in order to block enemy troops . Cavazos ' battalion landed unopposed , and they immediately set up their standard field position with wire entanglements to protect the base . On October 6 , the 1st Battalion 's position was subjected to Viet Cong mortar bombardment ; even though the shells had caused little damage , Cavazos believed it was part of the enemy 's final preparations for a major ground attack later that evening . 
 At around 6 : 00 pm the rain began to fall and the Viet Cong started attacking the battalion 's camp from different directions , but Cavazos ' men were able to hold their ground , with the support of artillery and mortar fire . By 12 : 00 am the fight was over , and U.S. casualties included 5 killed in action and 4 wounded . Three weeks later a captured Viet Cong soldier from the 2nd Battalion , 271st Regiment , revealed that his unit lost 59 soldiers killed and 56 wounded , in battle with Cavazos ' battalion . On October 8 , Hay pulled Stauffer 's 1st Battalion back to Phuoc Vinh to act as the division 's reaction force . Lieutenant Colonel Terry D. Allen — commander of the 2nd Battalion , 28th Infantry Regiment — was then ordered to depart from Lai Khê with three of his rifle companies ( Alpha , Bravo and Delta ) and air @-@ lifted into a site about 21 kilometers ( 13 mi ) northwest of Chon Thanh village , and 3 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) north @-@ west of Cavazos ' 1st Battalion . Charlie Company was detached from Allen 's 2nd Battalion to protect the supporting 15th Field Artillery Regiment . 
 Two days later , Stauffer 's battalion was deployed into new blocking positions , as Viet Cong units were believed to be moving toward the Michelin Rubber Plantation . On October 11 , Cavazos led two of his companies out on a northward probe , and they were immediately attacked by the Viet Cong . While under heavy fire , Cavazos ordered the lead company to pull back behind a perimeter formed by the second company . As the lead company fell back , artillery and air support were called in to pummel the Viet Cong 's attacking formation . When the battle was over , 21 Viet Cong soldiers were found dead , whereas U.S. casualties for the day were 1 killed and 4 wounded . Shortly afterwards , Cavazos ' battalion pulled back to Phuoc Vinh for rest and refitting . By mid @-@ October , Hay believed the Viet Cong 's 271st Regiment had suffered a major defeat and was ready to withdraw from the Long Nguyen Secret Zone , so he was ready to terminate Shenandoah II . However , increased Viet Cong activity near the Ong Thanh Stream , where the 1st Brigade made most of its contacts , had indicated otherwise . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On the morning of October 16 , Allen led two rifle companies ( Bravo and Delta ) of the 2nd Battalion out from their temporary night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast , which was covered by thick jungle canopy . After marching for about 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , the battalion found a fortified Viet Cong bunker , so Allen ordered his men to pull back and directed airstrikes against Viet Cong positions . When the bombing runs were over , Allen ’ s men entered the camp and a firefight broke out with Viet Cong snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas . Again , Allen ordered his men to pull back and form a perimeter to protect their wounded soldiers , as artillery strikes were called in against Viet Cong bunker positions . The 2nd Battalion re @-@ entered the camp , and they discovered the bodies of 17 dead Viet Cong soldiers . Allen 's men then moved through the western end of the camp , and another fire @-@ fight broke out with an estimated 60 Viet Cong soldiers . 
 Later that afternoon Allen decided to break contact and return to base , to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening . In the meantime , however , he called in air @-@ strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target , the 271st Regiment . That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion 's camp , where they praised Allen 's men for their efforts , and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch — commander of Delta Company — with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day . Allen then decided to launch a full @-@ frontal attack against the 271st Regiment 's base camp , to determine if the enemy unit was still there . However , due to the lack of sufficient manpower , Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation . Allen dismissed Welch 's suggestions , and responded by giving Captain James George — commander of Alpha Company — the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch . 
 Meanwhile , Triet 's 1 @,@ 200 @-@ strong regiment was joined by 200 soldiers from the C1 Company of Rear Service Group 83 — under the command of Captain Nguyen Van Lam — and they set up a three @-@ sided ambush and waited for the arrival of a reported U.S. battalion . At around 8 : 00 am on the morning of October 17 , the 2nd Battalion departed from their night defensive position with Alpha Company in the lead followed by the Battalion Command Group , and the tail of the formation was covered by Delta Company . Bravo Company stayed behind to protect the battalion 's base , along with the mortar sections of Alpha and Delta Companies . In accordance with the 1st Brigade 's policy , Allen personally led his unit out as part of the Battalion Command Group , although he preferred to supervise actions from a helicopter . For artillery support , Alpha Company was authorized to call upon the 105mm and 155mm howitzers located at Fire Support Bases Caisson V , Caisson III @-@ S and Lorraine III . 
 Allen 's men marched southward from the base , with the intention of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west . Preceded by marching artillery fire , the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front , rear and both flanks . At 9 : 56 am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast @-@ southwest trail , which appeared to have been used within the last hour . The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail . Almost immediately , the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared . George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail , but by the time they were in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet . About 10 – 15 minutes later , the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving , in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition . 
 In response , George ordered the 1st Platoon to reinforce their ambush position . While that was happening Alpha Company 's right flank , which was covered by the 2nd Platoon , began to receive sporadic enemy fire . The rest of the 1st Platoon was then pinned down when the Viet Cong , from within concealed bunker positions , fired on them using captured M60 machine @-@ guns . The Viet Cong steadily increased their fire which came in the form of various small arms , .50 caliber and <unk> machine guns . Unable to communicate with the 1st and 2nd Platoons , George moved forward with the 3rd Platoon only to find his lead platoons held in their positions by enemy fire . A M18 Claymore mine then exploded in front of Alpha Company 's command element , killing the radio operator and severely wounding both George and his Forward Artillery Observer . At around 10 : 40 am gunfire had died down , but Alpha Company was virtually destroyed during 30 minutes of fighting , with the company commander wounded and the leaders of 1st and 2nd Platoons both killed . 
 To break contact with the Viet Cong units which fired on Alpha Company from the western flank , First Sergeant Jose Valdez quickly organized an assembly area on the eastern side to round up the survivors . Shortly after the assembly area was established George , who was severely wounded from the Claymore explosion , turned his company over to Valdez . Allen then ordered Valdez to lead the survivors of Alpha Company northward to join the rest of the battalion . The survivors , mostly from the 2nd and 3rd Platoons of Alpha Company , were then ordered to withdraw through a perimeter formed by Delta Company . As the surviving elements of Alpha Company pulled back , Delta Company began to receive sporadic fire from their southern flank , so Allen ordered his command group to remain in place near a prominent anthill with the 1st and 2nd Platoons of Delta Company . The 3rd Platoon , on the other hand , was instructed to move forward to assist the wounded men from Alpha Company . 
 As Viet Cong fire increased in intensity , the soldiers of Delta Company picked up the distinctive sound of a U.S.-made M @-@ 60 machine @-@ gun firing from the southern flank . Allen assumed that Alpha Company was approaching his perimeter , so he ordered them to cease @-@ fire because he feared his rifle companies were firing on each other . However , the order was also passed down along the formation of Delta Company , which enabled the Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment to gain fire superiority . At around 11 : 35 am , Triet unleashed his 2nd Battalion which was placed in reserve during the battle , and they attacked Welch 's Delta Company from three different directions . During that time Allen tried to request artillery support , but that had become impossible due to the close proximity between U.S. and Viet Cong soldiers . In a scene that had characterized the destruction of Alpha Company earlier , both Allen and Welch were wounded in battle as Viet Cong snipers fired down from the trees . Nonetheless , just before 12 : 00 pm , Allen instructed Delta Company to begin a northward march toward the battalion 's base , and Bravo Company to move forward to cover the withdrawal . 
 The withdrawal quickly descended into a scene of chaos , as U.S. soldiers scrambled to avoid heavy enemy fire . During the last moments of the battle , Allen was struck in the head by machine @-@ gun fire which grazed his helmet , and was finally killed when another burst of machine @-@ gun fire hit him . At around 12 : 20 pm Newman flew into Ong Thanh to assume command of the 2nd Battalion , while Coleman took control of the 1st Brigade . Meanwhile , Alpha Company had linked up with Bravo Company , which had taken up positions about 450 meters ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) to the south of the battalion 's night defensive position with the task of assisting the wounded . At around 2 : 00 pm that afternoon , the 2nd Battalion 's Charlie Company was airlifted into Ong Thanh from FSB Caisson V , as Bravo Company moved into the battle area to help evacuate the wounded . Coleman , who was coordinating the evacuation of U.S. casualties from a helicopter , decided to assemble the bodies of the dead in an area and protect it with artillery fire . By that stage , however , Triet 's 271st Regiment had withdrawn from the battlefield , and medivac flights were only challenged by sporadic sniper fire . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 At around 12 : 00 pm Triet had already ordered his troops to disengage from the battle without annihilating the remaining Americans caught in his ambush . His men were tired and hungry and he was behind schedule in his movement toward his next assignment . Moreover , he feared that American air power and artillery would begin to inflict heavy casualties on his unit . 
 The battle at Ong Thanh was a costly affair for the soldiers of the 2nd Battalion , 28th Infantry Regiment . During two hours of fighting the 2nd Battalion lost 64 men killed in action , including Lieutenant Colonel Terry Allen and every member of the Battalion Command Group , as well as 75 wounded and 2 missing . For their efforts in the battle , 13 American soldiers were awarded the Silver Star , while Allen and Welch received the Distinguished Service Cross . Forward Observer Second Lieutenant Harold B. Durham , who was attached to the 2nd Battalion on the day from the 15th Field Artillery Regiment , was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions . Despite the losses that had been inflicted on the 2nd Battalion by the Viet Cong , the U.S. military told the media that the fight at Ong Thanh had resulted in a major American victory . 
 General Hay initially portrayed Ong Thanh as an American victory and cited 101 enemy dead in the battle . However , American veterans who survived the ordeals of the battle were adamant they were ambushed and defeated by the Viet Cong 's 271st Regiment . The estimate of 101 enemy dead officially provided by the U.S. military was likely much inflated to emphasize the scale of the ' American victory ' . For retired U.S. Army Brigadier General James E. Shelton , who was then a major and served as an Operations Officer with the 2nd Battalion , the lack of reliable intelligence and overconfidence on the part of Allen as the battalion commander , were some of the factors that led to the disastrous outcome in the Ong Thanh battle . Furthermore , the American soldiers under Allen 's command lacked fighting experience , whereas the Viet Cong soldiers of the 9th Division were tough and experienced light infantry . The Viet Cong 271st Regiment , after their victory at Ong Thanh , withdrew back towards their base area near the Cambodian border . 
 Meanwhile , the rest of the Viet Cong 9th Division was planning for a major attack on Loc Ninh , with the objective of capturing the district town and the Special Forces Camp . To accomplish their goals the Viet Cong deployed the 272nd and 273rd Regiments , reinforced with two battalions from the 165th Regiment and the Vietnam People 's Army 84th Artillery Regiment . During the days before the battle , U.S. military intelligence had noticed the build @-@ up of Viet Cong units around Loc Ninh . Hay , in response , planned to insert four battalions of the 1st Infantry Division and position them around Loc Ninh , thereby trapping the Viet Cong inside the town . On the evening of October 28 , the 272nd Regiment marched into position from the northeast , and the 273rd Regiment from west . At 1 : 15 am on October 29 , the 273rd Regiment began assaulting the Loc Ninh Special Forces Camp , but they were quickly repelled by U.S.-led Special Forces . At around 6 : 30 am the remaining elements of Bravo and Charlie Companies 2nd Battalion , 28th Infantry Regiment , were airlifted onto the Loc Ninh airfield , to set up a <unk> at the field 's south @-@ western end . The soldiers of Alpha and Delta Companies were sent back to their Base Camp at Lai Khe to adjust to the losses they had suffered , and to be kept away from enemy activity .

 Low Fell is a suburb situated in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in Tyne and Wear , England . Built predominantly on sandstone , grindstone and clay , it is bordered by Sheriff Hill / Deckham to the east , Saltwell / Bensham to the west , Harlow Green to the south and Shipcote to the north . The suburb lies on a major bus route 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of Gateshead , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne and 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of the historic City of Durham . The principal road in the suburb is the A167 . According to the 2001 UK census , the suburb had a population of 8 @,@ 643 , falling marginally to 8 @,@ 636 at the 2011 census . 
 For centuries little more than part of a windswept , barren and treacherous heath , the settlement at Low Fell was initially established by a moderate influx of tinkers and miners in the 18th century . Considered a village in the historic County Durham for almost as long as it has been inhabited in measurable numbers , it was formally incorporated into the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 which took effect on 1 April 1974 and is now instead a residential suburb . 
 One of the more populous of the two dozen or so villages which now comprise the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead , Low Fell has a long and rich history . In stark contrast to the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill , the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill , which in turn encouraged both private enterprise ( particularly public houses ) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19th century Newcastle upon Tyne . 
 Several of these villas remain today and contribute to the dozen Grade II listed buildings in the suburb , which has continued to develop into an affluent area with a village feel . The suburb is wholly contained within the Gateshead council ward of the same name and is represented locally by members of the Liberal Democrats party , though nationally the suburb is represented by the Labour party as part of the constituency of Gateshead . The suburb is home to several schools and churches . The principal landmark in the suburb is St Helen 's Church , although also located in the settlement is Underhill , the home of Sir Joseph Swan and the first domestic property in the world to be illuminated by electric light . England international cricketer Graham Onions is a current resident of the suburb . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Gateshead Fell = = = 
 Prior to 1809 , Low Fell was part of Gateshead Fell ; itself a constituent part of the ancient County of Durham . Once described as a " windswept , barren and treacherous heath " , it took its name from nearby Gateshead and the fact that the area was " a fell or common <unk> to it " . That portion of Gateshead Fell which would later become Low Fell was , in the 1640s , little more than boggy march and wetlands owned by the Bishop of Durham who simply divided the land into plots and rented them to the few tenants willing to pay for them . By the 18th century , the lower section of Gateshead Fell consisted broadly of sparsely populated farm and woodland , demarcated from the section of Gateshead Fell which was to become Sheriff Hill by a boundary formed by a mound of earth . 
 In 1771 , the number of settlers on Gateshead Fell increased as a result of the ' Great Flood of 1771 ' , during which the rivers Tyne , Wear and Tees all burst their banks , causing people to lose their homes . By this time , however , Gateshead Fell had become a place of considerable notoriety , both for the bleakness of the land and for the criminality undertaken upon it . When theologian John Wesley arrived in a blizzard in 1785 , he found a " pathless waste of white " inhabited predominantly by tinkers , gypsies , <unk> and quarrymen . 
 In 1809 an Act was obtained ordering the enclosure of Gateshead Fell . 
 = = = 1809 – Present Day = = = 
 The Inclosure Act separated Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton , Sheriff Hill and Low Fell . Commissioners were appointed to settle claims in land and to apportion Gateshead Fell accordingly . Plans were laid for the requisition and construction of wells ( including Carter 's Well ; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque ) , quarries , drains , roads , watering places and other essential requirements . Progress was slow , with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822 , but by the time of completion , Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history . The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled , so that the villages created by enclosure have survived , almost entirely intact , to the present day . After enclosure , " civilisation came to the Fell " . This began with the building of a new road . The only major road through Gateshead Fell was that which followed the same route of the ancient turnpike road which ran through what is now Sheriff Hill ( today this is Old Durham Road / Sheriffs Highway ) . The turnpike road was very steep and was deemed rather unsatisfactory : 
 Why should coaches have to labour up the long hill from Newcastle to the top of Gateshead Fell , and then go down the steep descent to the Coach & Horses inn just before <unk> , while those coming from the south had to climb and descend the hills in reverse ? There must be a new road with better gradients ... 
 Until 1824 there was still about a mile of farmland between Gateshead and Low Fell , though the land was far less severe than that leading to Sheriff Hill and Wrekenton , so plans were drawn to build a new road through the farmland , Low Fell and towards Durham . Work began on this new road on 6 December 1824 and took some eighteen months to complete so that the first mail coach travelled on the new road , today known as Durham Road , on 17 June 1826 . Thomas Wilson used to call this road " the road through the fields " ; a description which was said to have suited the road well until at least the turn of the 20th century . 
 The opening of the new road saw people drawn to an area which now attracted considerable trade , travel and through – fare . Robert Clements , proprietor of the Old Cannon Inn at Sheriff Hill , quickly foresaw the likely detrimental effect that the new road would have on his business and opened the New Cannon Inn on the corner of Durham Road and Buck Lane ( now Beaconsfield Road ) in 1826 – the same year that the Sheriff 's March was re – routed from Sheriff Hill to the new road through Low Fell . Despite the cessation of the Sheriff 's March in 1838 , Clements ' establishment became " the social centre of the growing village , where concerts , dinners and meetings of all kinds were held " . 
 New , adjoining roads gradually began to appear , such as <unk> Road , which later became Kells Lane , and Low Fell Road , which became Beaconsfield Road and Belle Vue Bank . In January 1841 , local poet Thomas Wilson bought land on Durham Road and opened literary rooms which were opened in November 1841 . The upper section of the literary rooms was used as a school for local children until the opening of a new school on a site at Kells Lane in 1895 . In the 1880s there was a decade of intensive building and the population of the village increased accordingly . The relative tranquility of the village , coupled with scenic views of surrounding hills and countryside , attracted rich industrialists from nearby Newcastle – upon – Tyne , seeking an alternative to the dirt and noise of industrial Newcastle and Gateshead . These individuals duly built and lived in mansion property in the area . One such property , Heathfield , was a mansion located on Durham Road which was built and owned by a wealthy chemical manufacturer who kept bears in his substantial adjoining grounds . 
 Through the early 20th century , the village continued to expand towards Gateshead , though even in the interwar – years " children could play marbles on Durham Road in perfect safety " . However , by the turn of World War II in 1945 , Gateshead itself has expanded so much that the urban sprawl had removed much of the scenic panorama which had delighted settlers in the suburb a century earlier . In spite of these developments : 
 By 1939 , Low Fell had become the select suburb of Gateshead and had substantial and independent shopping facilities . All of the houses between Shipcote and the village were private and the owners added ' Low Fell ' to their addresses , at times not even mentioning Gateshead , although , if we adhere to the original boundaries , they did not live in Low Fell at all " . 
 The village changed little in either character or structure after the end of World War II , though in 1965 plans were drawn for the further development of Durham Road which drew criticism from residents . In 1974 , Low Fell was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and had transformed from those early , village days and was by that time a bustling suburb with a considerable independent commercial hub attracting a high volume of vehicular traffic . That character is relatively unchanged today , but Low Fell remains one of the most attractive places to live in the North East of England , retaining a distinctive village feel and containing a thriving community of shops , restaurants , schools and churches .

 Low Fell is a local council ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead . This ward is approximately 2 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 77 sq mi ) in area and has a population of 8 @,@ 643 . The Low Fell ward is represented by three councillors . In April 2012 , these were Ron Beadle , Frank Hindle and Susan Craig . 
 Low Fell is now part of the Westminster parliamentary constituency of Gateshead . It had previously formed part of the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency which was abolished by boundary changes prior to the 2010 UK General Election . 
 The present incumbent MP is Ian Mearns , who lives in nearby Saltwell , Gateshead , Tyne and Wear . Mearns , a member of the Labour party , replaced former incumbent Sharon Hodgson MP , who successfully campaigned for election in the newly formed constituency of Washington and Sunderland West . In the 2010 UK General Election , Mearns was elected with a majority of 12 @,@ 549 votes over the second placed candidate , Frank Hindle . The swing from the Labour party to the Liberal Democrats was 3 @.@ 9 % . 
 Low Fell is part of one of the safest Labour parliamentary seats in the United Kingdom . Mearns ' success in 2010 followed the return of Sharon Hodgson in the 2005 UK General Election after she had polled over 60 % of the total votes cast whilst in 2001 , Joyce Quin was returned to parliament with a majority of 53 @.@ 3 % . 
 = = Geography and topography = = 
 Low Fell , at a latitude of 54 @.@ 93 ° N and a longitude of 1 @.@ 60 ° W , lies on the eastern side of the Team Valley , some 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of the centre of Gateshead town centre on " one of the main link roads " into the centre of both Gateshead and Newcastle – upon – Tyne , England . The distance from Low Fell to London is 254 miles ( 409 km ) . Low Fell occupies an elevated position which slopes down from east to west . Though the principal routes through Durham Road and Kells Lane are of gentle slope , some parts of the suburb are quite steeply sloped – notably those which border Sheriff Hill to the east ( Church Road particularly ) . The land upon which the settlement is built contains predominantly sandstone , grindstone and clay . 
 After the enclosure of Gateshead Fell , Low Fell developed firstly into a village but following the subsequent large urban expansion of Gateshead , Low Fell was enveloped so that " now it is surrounded by suburban Gateshead , which has developed in dense form around it with little visual delineation " and in 1974 the village was formerly incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 . Until the implementation of that Act , Low Fell was considered part of County Durham . It is now bordered by a number of settlements which also now form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead . These are Sheriff Hill to the east , Saltwell / Shipcote to the north , <unk> to the south and the Team Valley Trading Estate to the west . The precise boundaries of the suburb are difficult to ascertain , though the southern boundary was fixed with certainty at the junction of Kells Lane and Durham Road by the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 and the eastern border with Sheriff Hill is clearly demarcated by Sheriff 's Highway / Old Durham Road . 
 Though the urbanisation of Gateshead around it has detracted from the panoramic views of western Gateshead that were once enjoyed by residents , at elevated positions views of <unk> Hill , Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed . Although now a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead , the openness and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel , which is an unusual trait in the modern <unk> conurbation .

 Low Fell compares very favourably with the wider Gateshead area in respect of adults with educational qualifications . Only 23 % of adults in the settlement have no educational qualifications ( the lowest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead ) , compared to 38 @.@ 4 % across the whole of Gateshead and the England average of 28 @.@ 9 % . 55 % of adults have at least five or more GCSEs or equivalent at A * – C ( compared to 46 @.@ 6 % nationally ) and , of these , 28 % are qualified to degree level .

 Prior to enclosure , Low Fell was predominantly inhabited by a small number of tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road . Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry , built upon a colliery and pottery particularly , by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed . The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area and it was this influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement , as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry . The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village , fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area ; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area . These smaller industries , allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village ( Dryden Farm , Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War ) , generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside . 
 As Gateshead expanded southward to meet the village , Low Fell became a residential suburb of Gateshead but one which has , through its atypical development , has retained a rural village character . In 1897 , the first shops were built on Durham Road . These expanded substantially so that by 1939 the villagers were able to forgo travel to nearby Gateshead for commercial purposes . Today the Durham Road area is " a vibrant commercial hub with thriving shops , bars and restaurants " as well as some banks and small offices . These now act as the principle commercial centre for the area though the townscape in this area varies greatly and the unsympathetic development at the crest of Albert Drive in the 1960s is uncommon and has been said to detract from the suburb . A smaller commercial area developed at Kells Lane , again predominantly built through small enterprise , and today the area contains a butcher 's shop , a bakery , hair dressers and a <unk> . 
 The unemployment levels in the suburb are very low compared to both local and national levels at 2 @.@ 6 % . The overall level of economic activity in Low Fell in 2004 was 69 % , as compared to 61 % in Gateshead overall and 67 % in England . Manufacturing is the largest sector of employment for residents in the suburb . 15 % of all working residents of the suburb do so in a managerial capacity ; again , this is the highest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead .

 Low Fell is home to numerous buildings listed by English Heritage . 
 Underhill , at 99 Kells Lane , is a Grade II * listed building . It was the home of Sir Joseph Swan between 1869 – 1883 and was the site of many pioneering experiments in photographic processing and in electricity . Described as " a large , unlovely polychrome villa " , Underhill is triple gabled and built of roughly dressed sandstone and was the first private residence in the world to be lit by electric light . It later became a school , and is now retirement sheltered housing . 
 231 Kells Lane is the location of Home House . This fine early 19th century , symmetrical , ashlar and sandstone property was the family home of the Dodds sisters and is also a Grade II listed building . At the southern edge of Durham Road is Carter 's Well , the first of the notable buildings and items of interest on that road . <unk> Durham Road houses " a stone building with a domestic air " . This Grade II listed building was the literary room built by local subscription at the instigation of Thomas Wilson in 1841 . Designed by Thomas Oliver , the building was used as a bank but is now derelict . Immediately adjacent to the Literary Rooms is a Grade II listed South African War memorial , dated 1903 and signed ' Morrison ' . Located close to the main shopping centre on Durham Road lies <unk> House , a large villa built in 1865 by local resident Edward Joicey . It is now being converted into <unk> flats . An impressive hexagonal based , stone fountain which has grade II listed status is still in evidence . 
 Travelling further along Durham Road towards Gateshead are two more Grade II listed buildings . The first is Heathfield House , a two story villa built by John Wardle ( designer of St Helen 's Church ) in 1865 and Musgrave House , an ashlar villa with raised quoins built in 1854 – 5 which has been used as a school but is no longer so . Both buildings are now converted to private flats . 
 = = = Churches = = = 
 The most prominent church in the suburb is St Helen 's Church , a Gothic revival church built from rock – faced sandstone with ashlar details . Costing £ 13 @,@ 000 and paid for " by the laudable benevolence of Edward Joicey " , the foundation stone of St Helen 's was laid on 29 October 1873 and the church was consecrated on 29 August 1876 . The result is " a lovely church " located on Belle Vue Bank which benefits from a number of high quality , stained – glass <unk> and a Father Willis organ , built for the church and rebuilt in 1949 by H Vincent of Sunderland . St Helen 's is now a Grade II * listed building . 
 Also a Grade II listed building is the Wesley Memorial Methodist Church . Built on a steeply sloping site on Durham Road in 1882 and opened in January 1883 , this church is a " pleasing and individual adaptation of early Gothic design " , built in tooled sandstone with Welsh slate roof – tiles . There are two further churches in the suburb . These are <unk> Avenue Church and St Peter 's . The former was a presbyterian church - now United Reformed Church , located on the corner of <unk> Avenue and Dryden Road which was formed originally in 1907 when a wood and corrugated iron building was erected on a site purchased for £ 480 . This building was soon demolished and replaced with a new building which opened on Good Friday , 10 April 1914 . St Peter 's , meanwhile , is a Roman Catholic located on Kells Lane which opened in 1962 . 
 = = = Venues = = = 
 Low Fell is home to numerous public houses . The New Cannon was established on Durham Road in 1826 and soon became something of a social hub for the village , hosting travelling troupes , lessons in quadrille dancing and hosting plays from visiting theatre as early as the 1820 – 30 's . So successful was the New Cannon that in those formative years it " monopolised trade on the new major route and was , in fact , the centre of village life " . The Cannon Inn still survives today , along with other public houses such as the Black Horse on Kells Lane , the Buck ( now The Beaconsfield ) on Beaconsfield Avenue ( formerly Buck Lane ) , the Crown ( now the Tap at Carters Well ) and the Gateshead Arms on Durham Road . All of these venues were in existence prior to 1858 . 
 The suburb was also once home to a pair of cinemas ; the Classic and the Capitol ( confusingly , this cinema was also later named ' The Classic ' ) . The original Classic was located on Kells Lane and was opened in 1928 , whilst the Capitol was located on Durham Road and opened in 1936 . Both closed prior to the turn of the 21st century . 
 = = Notable residents = = 
 Arguably the most notable resident of Low Fell was Sir Joseph Swan . Swan , most famous as the inventor of the incandescent light – bulb ( though also instrumental in improvements to photographic film and rechargeable batteries ) , lived at Underhill , 99 Kells Lane in Low Fell between 1869 and 1883 . 
 Other notable former residents include J. Thomas Looney , an elementary school master whose controversial text ' Shakespeare Identified ' founded the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship and Thomas Wilson , a local poet most famous for his 1843 work The Pitman 's Pay . Ruth Dodds was a prominent Labour politician in Gateshead who , along with her sisters Hope and Sylvia Dodds , funded the building of the Little Theatre Gateshead . All three lived in Low Fell their entire lives . 
 Socialist singer / songwriter Alex Glasgow , the so – called " bard of Tyneside " , is best remembered for writing and singing the theme tune to the BBC television classic When the Boat Comes In . Glasgow lived at 59 Church Road in Low Fell until he emigrated to Australia in 1981 . A Gateshead Blue Plaque was erected on the wall of his old house in February 2006 England international cricketer Graham Onions lives in Low Fell having previously played for nearby Gateshead Fell Cricket Club . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Low Fell is on the A167 Durham Road , a former route of the Great North Road and the A1 before it was diverted first to the Tyne Tunnel and then to its present route on the ' Western Bypass ' . The journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre is approximately seven minutes , with a further five minutes ' journey taking travellers into the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne . 
 The nearest mainline railway station to the settlement is Newcastle Central Station . This is located 2 @.@ 78 miles ( 4 @.@ 47 km ) away . The nearest Metro station is Gateshead 
 The settlement lies on a busy bus route in and out of Gateshead and is served by several bus services , such as the ' Angel ' which continues into Durham the ' Orbit 52 ' and the " 69 Pulse " which travels into the western Gateshead villages of Whickham and Blaydon . It is also part of the 93 / 94 ' loop ' network . All of the buses which serve Low Fell are operated under the administration of Nexus . 
 = = Education = = 
 The education provisions in the suburb during the 19th century was rather piecemeal and relied largely upon the contribution of local residents such as Thomas Wilson , whose literary rooms on Durham Road provided education classes for residents . It wasn 't until 1895 that the School Board decided to create a permanent education provision in Low Fell , with Kells Lane the chosen location . 
 Today , Low Fell contains several educational institutions . The oldest of these is the aforementioned Kells Lane Primary School . Catering for a mix of boys and girls aged 4 – 11 , Kells Lane Primary is today a popular school which is both larger than usual and <unk> which teaches a variety of subjects across Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 . The school is a successful and progressive institution ; in 2004 an OFSTED inspection resulted in a positive report which in 2007 was superseded by an inspection which concluded that the school was an outstanding one which generated an excellent learning environment for both pupils and staff . 
 Opening in 1938 , St Peter 's RC Primary is located on Dryden Road and serves the local Catholic parishes of St Peter 's and Our Lady of the Annunciation . Although the pupil age – range and subject – range is the same as Kells Lane Primary , St Peter 's Primary has a smaller than average cohort but according to the most recent OFSTED inspection , it too is an outstanding school . On the outskirts of the suburb lies Oakfield Junior school , which was built in 1967 and is situated on <unk> Bank . This is an average sized junior school catering to pupils aged between 7 – 11 years . Though attainment of pupils meets only the minimum acceptable standard , Oakfield is still considered by OFSTED to be a good school whose pupils benefit from a high standard of internal leadership . Near by , on Saltwell Road South is the Joseph Swan Academy , catering for pupils 11 @-@ 18 . 
 The suburb is also served by two specialist schools . Cedars School is situated on Ivy Lane and caters for students demonstrating special educational needs . Though the age range of pupils was 3 – 16 in 2010 , the local authority had plans to re – designate the school as suitable only for pupils aged 11 – 16 . Cedar 's is a " good , happy , safe and effective school " . The Dryden School at Shotley Gardens , provides similar provision for pupils aged between 11 – 18 and is also , according to the latest report , a good school .

Pratchett died on 12 March 2015 , aged 66 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Pratchett was born on 28 April 1948 in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire , England , the only child of David and Eileen Pratchett , of Hay @-@ on @-@ Wye and he attended <unk> School . His family moved to Bridgwater , Somerset , briefly in 1957 , following which he passed his eleven plus exam in 1959 , earning a place in High Wycombe Technical High School ( now John Hampden Grammar School ) where he was a key member of the debating society and wrote stories for the school magazine . Pratchett described himself as a " non @-@ descript student " and , in his Who 's Who entry , credits his education to the Beaconsfield Public Library . 
 His early interests included astronomy . He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space , owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer but lacked the necessary mathematical skills . He developed an interest in reading science fiction and began attending science fiction conventions from about 1963 – 1964 , but stopped when he got his first job a few years later . His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells , Arthur Conan Doyle , and " every book you really ought to read " , which he later regarded as " getting an education " . 
 Pratchett published his first short story entitled " Business Rivals " in the High Wycombe Technical School magazine in 1962 . It is the tale of a man named Crucible who finds the Devil in his flat in a cloud of sulphurous smoke . " The Hades Business " which was published in the school magazine when he was 13 was published commercially when he was 15 . 
 Pratchett earned five O @-@ levels and started A @-@ level courses in Art , English and History . His initial career choice was journalism and he left school at 17 in 1965 to start working for the Bucks Free Press , where he wrote , amongst other things , several stories for the Children 's Circle section under the name Uncle Jim . One of these episodic stories contains named characters from The Carpet People ( 1971 ) . The stories are currently part of a project by the Bucks Free Press to make them available online . While on day release he finished his A @-@ Level in English and took a proficiency course for journalists .

 Pratchett had his writing breakthrough in 1968 when he interviewed Peter <unk> van Duren , co @-@ director of a small publishing company , Colin Smythe Ltd . During the meeting , Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript , The Carpet People . Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971 , with illustrations by Pratchett . The book received strong , if few , reviews and was followed by the science fiction novels The Dark Side of the Sun ( 1976 ) and Strata ( 1981 ) . 
 After various positions in journalism , in 1980 Pratchett became Press Officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board in an area which covered four nuclear power stations . He later joked that he had demonstrated " impeccable timing " by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania , US , and said he would " write a book about my experiences , if I thought anyone would believe it " . 
 The first Discworld novel , The Colour of Magic , was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983 . The paperback edition was published by Corgi , an imprint of Transworld , in 1985 . Pratchett 's popularity increased when the BBC 's Woman 's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts , and later Equal Rites . Subsequently , the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd , which remained Pratchett 's publisher until 1997 , and Colin Smythe became Pratchett 's agent . Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz . 
 Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living through writing in 1987 , after finishing the fourth Discworld novel , Mort . His sales increased quickly and many of his books occupied top places on the best @-@ seller list . According to The Times , Pratchett was the top @-@ selling and highest earning UK author in 1996 . Some of his books have been published by Doubleday , another Transworld imprint . In the US , Pratchett is published by HarperCollins . 
 According to the Bookseller 's Pocket Yearbook ( 2005 ) , in 2003 Pratchett 's UK sales amounted to 3 @.@ 4 % of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3 @.@ 8 % by value , putting him in second place behind J. K. Rowling ( 6 % and 5 @.@ 6 % , respectively ) , while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1 @.@ 2 % and 1 @.@ 3 % by value ( behind James Patterson ( 1 @.@ 9 % and 1 @.@ 7 % ) , Alexander McCall Smith , John Grisham , and J.

 = = Later life = = 
 Pratchett married Lyn Purves in 1968 , and they moved to Rowberrow , Somerset , in 1970 . Their daughter Rhianna Pratchett , who is also a writer , was born there in 1976 . In 1993 , the family moved to Broad Chalke , a village west of Salisbury , Wiltshire . He listed his recreations as " writing , walking , computers , life " . He described himself as a humanist and was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society . He was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library . In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library which he had visited as a child and donated the income from the event to it . On a number of occasions he also visited his former school to speak to the students and look around . 
 Pratchett was well known for his penchant for wearing large , black fedora hats , as seen on the inside back covers of most of his books . His style has been described as " more that of urban cowboy than city gent . " 
 Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five kilowatts of photovoltaic cells ( for solar energy ) at his house . Having been interested in astronomy since childhood , he had an observatory built in his garden . An asteroid ( <unk> Pratchett ) is named after him . 
 On 31 December 2008 , it was announced that Pratchett was to be knighted ( as a Knight Bachelor ) in the Queen 's 2009 New Year Honours . He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009 . Afterwards he said , " You can 't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood . You know , for two pins I 'd get myself a horse and a sword . " In late 2009 , he did make himself a sword , with the help of his friends . He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that " At the end of last year I made my own sword . I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10 miles away – I was helped by interested friends . We lugged 80 kilos of iron ore , used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln , and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow . ' Colin Smythe , his long @-@ term friend and agent , donated some pieces of meteoric iron – ' thunderbolt iron ' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt , and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver . Everything about it I touched , handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been , it seemed to me . " 
 = = = Alzheimer 's disease = = = 
 In August 2007 , Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke in 2004 or 2005 , which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain . While his motor skills were affected , the observed damage had not impaired his ability to write . On 11 December 2007 , Pratchett posted online that he had been newly diagnosed with early @-@ onset Alzheimer 's disease , which had been responsible for the " stroke " . He had a rare form of the disease , posterior cortical atrophy ( PCA ) , in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel . 
 Describing the diagnosis as an " <unk> " in a radio interview , Pratchett appealed to people to " keep things cheerful " and proclaimed that " we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism . " He stated he felt he had time for " at least a few more books yet " , and added that while he understood the impulse to ask " is there anything I can do ? " , in this case he would only entertain such offers from " very high @-@ end experts in brain chemistry . " Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008 , Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books . In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant , Rob Wilkins , or by using speech recognition software . 
 In March 2008 , Pratchett announced he would donate US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( about £ 494 @,@ 000 ) to the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , and that he was shocked " to find out that funding for Alzheimer 's research is just 3 % of that to find cancer cures . " He said : " I am , along with many others , scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the Cure comes along . " 
 In April 2008 , Pratchett worked with the BBC to make a two @-@ part documentary series about his illness , Terry Pratchett : Living With Alzheimer 's . The first part was broadcast on BBC Two on 4 February 2009 , drawing 2.6m viewers and a 10 @.@ 4 % audience share . The second , broadcast on 11 February 2009 , drew <unk> viewers and a 6 @.@ 8 % audience share . The documentary won a BAFTA award in the Factual Series category . Pratchett also made an appearance on The One Show on 15 May 2008 , talking about his condition . He was the subject and interviewee of the edition of 20 May 2008 of On the Ropes ( Radio 4 ) , discussing Alzheimer 's and how it had affected his life . 
 On 8 June 2008 , news reports indicated that Pratchett had an experience which he described as : " It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits , just beyond all that , on the other side of physics , there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows " and " I don 't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head " . He went into further detail on Front Row , in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs : " A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day . But I 'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father . An <unk> , or something in my head ... This is not about God , but somewhere around there is where gods come from . " 
 On 26 November 2008 , Pratchett met the Prime Minister Gordon Brown and asked for an increase in dementia research funding . From August 2008 , Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition . Despite some apparent improvements , the ability of the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with scepticism from Alzheimer 's researchers . 
 In an article published mid @-@ 2009 , Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide ( although he disliked that term ) before his disease progressed to a critical point . He later said he felt " it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help , rather than suffer . " Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby Lecture , entitled Shaking Hands With Death , broadcast on 1 February 2010 . Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death , but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because Pratchett 's condition made it difficult for him to read . In June 2011 Pratchett presented a one @-@ off BBC television documentary , Terry Pratchett : Choosing to Die , about assisted suicide . It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs in November 2011 . 
 In September 2012 Pratchett stated : " I have to tell you that I thought I 'd be a lot worse than this by now , and so did my specialist . " In the same interview , he stated that the cognitive part of his mind was " untouched " and his symptoms were physical ( normal for PCA ) . However , in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention , saying : " the <unk> is finally catching up with me , along with other age @-@ related ailments " .
