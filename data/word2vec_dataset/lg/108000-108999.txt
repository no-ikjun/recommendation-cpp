 <unk> have eight comb @-@ rows , originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes ; in species with ( four ) auricles , the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows . Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water , using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion , although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion . Members of the lobate genera <unk> and <unk> can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly . Unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids . This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg @-@ like . 
 An unusual species first described in 2000 , <unk> <unk> , has been classified as a lobate , although the lobes are " primitive " and the body is medusa @-@ like when floating and disk @-@ like when resting on the sea @-@ bed . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The <unk> , also known as Nuda , have no feeding appendages , but their large pharynx , just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body , bears " <unk> " at the oral end . These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to " bite " off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores . In front of the field of <unk> , on the mouth " lips " in some species of Beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that " zip " the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip . This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey . 
 = = = Other body forms = = = 
 The <unk> have a pair of small oral lobes and a pair of tentacles . The body is circular rather than oval in cross @-@ section , and the pharynx extends over the inner surfaces of the lobes . 
 The Thalassocalycida , only discovered in 1978 and known from only one species , are medusa @-@ like , with bodies that are shortened in the oral @-@ aboral direction , and short comb @-@ rows on the surface furthest from the mouth , originating from near the aboral pole . They capture prey by movements of the bell and possibly by using two short tentacles . 
 The Cestida ( " belt animals " ) are ribbon @-@ shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . There is a pair of comb @-@ rows along each aboral edge , and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge , which stream back across most of the wing @-@ like body surface . <unk> can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb @-@ rows . There are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm @-@ temperate waters : <unk> <unk> ( " Venus ' girdle " ) is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1 @.@ 5 meters ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly . <unk> <unk> , which is typically less than 20 centimeters ( 0 @.@ 66 ft ) long , can move much faster in what has been described as a " darting motion " . 
 Most <unk> have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral @-@ aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla @-@ bearing tentacles on the aboral surface . They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular " foot " . All but one of the known <unk> species lack comb @-@ rows . <unk> are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many <unk> , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current . 
 = = = Reproduction and development = = = 
 Adults of most species can regenerate tissues that are damaged or removed , although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning , splitting off from the edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals . 
 Almost all species are hermaphrodites , in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – except that in two species of the genus <unk> individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives . The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis . Fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch . Self @-@ fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self @-@ fertile . 
 Development of the fertilized eggs is direct , in other words there is no distinctive larval form , and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults . In the genus Beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths . In most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents . In some groups , such as the flat , bottom @-@ dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea @-@ floor . 
 At least in some species , juvenile ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size , and adults produce eggs and sperm for as long as they have sufficient food . If they run short of food , they first stop producing eggs and sperm , and then shrink in size . When the food supply improves , they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction . These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly . 
 = = = Colors and bioluminescence = = = 
 Most ctenophores that live near the surface are mostly colorless and almost transparent . However some deeper @-@ living species are strongly pigmented , for example the species known as " Tortugas red " ( see illustration here ) , which has not yet been formally described . <unk> generally live attached to other sea @-@ bottom organisms , and often have similar colors to these host organisms . The gut of the deep @-@ sea genus <unk> is red , which hides the bioluminescence of copepods it has swallowed . 
 The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect , which is not caused by bioluminescence but by the scattering of light as the combs move . Most species are also bioluminescent , but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness . However some significant groups , including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia , are incapable of bioluminescence . 
 When some species , including <unk> <unk> , Euplokamis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , are disturbed , they produce secretions ( ink ) that <unk> at much the same wavelengths as their bodies . Juveniles will <unk> more brightly in relation to their body size than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies . Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores ' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals ' environments , such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid @-@ ocean waters . 
 In ctenophores , bioluminescence is caused by the activation of calcium @-@ activated proteins named <unk> in cells called photocytes , which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows . In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode <unk> . These genes are co @-@ expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi , raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Ctenophores are found in most marine environments : from polar waters to the tropics ; near coasts and in mid @-@ ocean ; from the surface waters to the ocean depths . The best @-@ understood are the genera Pleurobrachia , Beroe and Mnemiopsis , as these planktonic coastal forms are among the most likely to be collected near shore . No ctenophores have been found in fresh water . 
 = = = Prey and predators = = = 
 Almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic . If food is plentiful , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day . While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores , other surface @-@ water species prey on zooplankton ( planktonic animals ) ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae , to small adult crustaceans such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill . Members of the genus <unk> prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts ( stinging cells ) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts . Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as " webs " , some are ambush predators like <unk> jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread , as bolas spiders do . This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species . The two @-@ tentacled " cydippid " <unk> feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea @-@ squirts that form large chain @-@ like floating colonies , and juveniles of <unk> attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate <unk> often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : Pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while <unk> generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae . 
 Ctenophores used to be regarded as " dead ends " in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals . It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators , although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue . Detailed investigation of chum salmon , Oncorhynchus <unk> , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around . <unk> prey mainly on other ctenophores . Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations . Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population , most fish that prey on them are generalists , and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly @-@ eaters . This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea . The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores , as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood . 
 = = = Ecological impacts = = = 
 Ctenophores may balance marine ecosystems by preventing an over @-@ abundance of copepods from eating all the phytoplankton ( planktonic plants ) , which are the dominant marine producers of organic matter from non @-@ organic ingredients . 
 On the other hand , in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish . Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories ( although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea ) , as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities . The impact was increased by chronic overfishing , and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short @-@ term boost , causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores . Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis @-@ eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism . However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre @-@ Mnemiopsis levels . 
 In the late 1990s Mnemiopsis appeared in the Caspian Sea . Beroe ovata arrived shortly after , and is expected to reduce but not eliminate the impact of Mnemiopsis there . Mnemiopsis also reached the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1990s and now appears to be thriving in the North Sea and Baltic Sea . 
 = = Classification = = 
 The number of known living ctenophore species is uncertain , since many of those named and formally described have turned out to be identical to species known under other scientific names . Claudia Mills estimates that there about 100 to 150 valid species that are not duplicates , and that at least another 25 , mostly deep @-@ sea forms , have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming . 
 The traditional classification divides ctenophores into two classes , those with tentacles ( Tentaculata ) and those without ( Nuda ) . The Nuda contains only one order ( <unk> ) and family ( <unk> ) , and two genera , Beroe ( several species ) and <unk> ( one species ) . 
 The Tentaculata are divided into the following eight orders : 
 <unk> , egg @-@ shaped animals with long tentacles 
 Lobata , with paired thick lobes 
 <unk> , flattened animals that live on or near the sea @-@ bed ; most lack combs as adults , and use their pharynges as suckers to attach themselves to surfaces 
 <unk> , with a pair of small lobes round the mouth , but an extended pharynx like that of platyctenids 
 <unk> 
 <unk> 
 Thalassocalycida , with short tentacles and a jellyfish @-@ like " umbrella " 
 Cestida , ribbon @-@ shaped and the largest ctenophores 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 Because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue . Until the mid @-@ 1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known , both members of the crown group , from the early Devonian ( <unk> ) period . Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid @-@ Cambrian period . All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species . They also appear to have had internal organ @-@ like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores . One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular . Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian , but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil 's comb @-@ rows were mounted on prominent vanes . The Ediacaran <unk> could putatively represent a comb jelly . 
 The early Cambrian sessile frond @-@ like fossil <unk> , from China 's Chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago , is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period . De @-@ Gan Shu , Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia , used for filter feeding . They suggested that <unk> was an evolutionary " aunt " of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system . 
 520 million years old Cambrian fossils also from Chengjiang in China show a now wholly extinct class of ctenophore , named " <unk> , " that had a complex internal skeleton with long spines . 
 = = = Relationship to other animal phyla = = = 
 The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity . It has been the focus of debate for many years . Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria , sister to the Cnidaria , sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria , and sister to all other animal phyla . A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways ( e.g. , <unk> , nuclear receptors , the Wnt signaling pathway , and sodium channels ) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla . Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals . This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages ( e.g. , Porifera ) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage . However , other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that Porifera ( sponges ) is the earliest @-@ diverging animal phylum instead . Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true <unk> genes . 
 = = = Relationships within Ctenophora = = = 
 Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid @-@ like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg @-@ shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles . Richard Harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid . Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids . He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid @-@ like or <unk> @-@ like . A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid @-@ like . It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata , Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain . This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event 65 @.@ 5 million years ago while other lineages perished . When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla , it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain .

 = Ianto Jones = 
 Ianto Jones is a fictional character in the BBC television series Torchwood , played by Welsh actor Gareth David @-@ Lloyd . A series regular , Ianto appears in every episode of the programme 's first three seasons , as well as two crossover episodes of Torchwood 's parent show , Doctor Who . Additionally , Ianto appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks , comic books and radio plays . Within the narrative of the series , Ianto begins as general support officer for Torchwood Three , a team of alien hunters stationed in Cardiff , and develops into an active field agent . Initially the regular character with the least screen time , Ianto 's role expanded in response to growing cult appeal . 
 Reserved and efficient , Ianto was often used by writers to add humorous asides to the episodes ' scripts . The character becomes the main romantic interest of Captain Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) , who is the lead male of the series . Established to have had heterosexual relationships prior to the series , Ianto 's story forms a part of the show 's ongoing exploration of human sexuality . Expanded Universe material develops on Ianto 's sexual orientation and the nature of the relationship with Jack , describing Ianto as bisexual and his feelings for Jack as genuine love . Additionally , writers have used these other media to explore Ianto 's characterisation ; for example , some stories elaborate on Ianto 's backstory , or provide insight into his feelings . 
 Beginning as a casual relationship , with little on @-@ screen definition given , Ianto and Jack 's relationship deepened over the first three seasons of the programme . The character 's creator Russell T Davies chose to kill off Ianto in the third television series . Professional critics by and large gave the story extremely positive reviews . A number of fans , however , were upset by the death of the character , particularly with regards to the romantic storyline 's abrupt ending . Artistically , Davies felt that the relationship 's unexplored potential maximised the viewer 's sense of grief . Subsequent to the departure , fans set up websites in the character 's honour , petitioning the writers to resurrect him in future episodes of the series , raising money for charity . Torchwood writers and actors have expressed an unwillingness to reduce the weight of the death scene by bringing the character back , though David @-@ Lloyd penned a Torchwood comic book wherein an alternative universe Ianto survives .

 The character of Ianto Jones is introduced in the first episode of Torchwood , in 2006 . Introduced as a mild @-@ mannered and quiet administrator working for Torchwood Three , the first episode to focus on him was " Cyberwoman " , which dealt with both his backstory and motivations . In the episode , Ianto is revealed as a former employee of Torchwood One in London ( first seen in parent series Doctor Who ) , whose girlfriend Lisa ( Caroline Chikezie ) has been partially converted into a Cyberman , a cyborg species seen repeatedly in Doctor Who . Ianto has been keeping her alive , concealed in the basement of the Hub , but she eventually breaks loose and kills two civilians . Ianto is forced into confrontation with team leader Captain Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) , who is later able to revive Ianto with a kiss when Lisa knocks him unconscious . Ultimately , the rest of Ianto 's team is forced to kill Lisa . Although Ianto 's thoughts continue to be concerned with Lisa , mid @-@ series he begins to develop a sexual relationship with Jack . By the penultimate episode of the series , Ianto is willing to shoot colleague Owen Harper ( Burn Gorman ) to protect Jack , and refutes claims he is merely his " part time shag " . In the series finale , an image of what appears to be Lisa 's ghost is used to bring Ianto to mutiny against Jack , but still later when Jack ( who cannot stay dead ) returns to life , he and Ianto immediately kiss one another . 
 Torchwood 's second series ( 2008 ) begins with the team working without Jack , who departed the Hub at the end of series one to reunite with the mysterious " Doctor " from his past . Ianto 's role within the team now more frequently includes field missions , to accommodate Jack 's absence . When Jack returns in the series two premiere , having seen the end of the world , he attempts to formalise his romantic relationship with Ianto , successfully asking him on a date . Jack and Ianto 's relationship becomes more overt , and Ianto 's character becomes less burdened by secrets and happier , beginning to express a newfound confidence and dour sense of humour . The penultimate episode of the series , " Fragments " explores Ianto 's backstory , specifically how he was recruited into Torchwood Three two years prior ; Ianto is persistent that Jack hire him after the destruction of Torchwood One , but only succeeds once he is able to aid Jack in capturing a stray pterodactyl . In the second series finale , Ianto and the team face Jack 's 51st @-@ century ex Captain John Hart ( James Marsters ) and younger brother Gray ( Lachlan Nieboer ) , who has <unk> sought to destroy Jack 's world . After Gray kills his teammates Toshiko ( Naoko Mori ) and Owen , the Torchwood team is left with a membership of only three . Following from this , Ianto makes his first crossover appearance in Doctor Who alongside Gwen ( Eve Myles ) and Jack in the two @-@ part finale of the 2008 series , where Torchwood is called on to help contact series protagonist the Doctor ( David Tennant ) during a Dalek invasion . 
 Torchwood 's third series ( 2009 ) is a five @-@ part miniseries broadcast over one week , called Children of Earth . In part one , Ianto starts to express insecurity to Jack about their status as couple . The audience are introduced to Ianto 's sister Rhiannon ( Katy Wix ) and brother @-@ in @-@ law Johnny Davies ( Rhodri Lewis ) , who confront Ianto about sightings of him on a date with Jack . Ianto eventually admits to being involved with Jack , but concedes that he is not sure where he stands . When aliens called the 456 return to Earth , John Frobisher ( Peter Capaldi ) puts a hit on Torchwood 's lives to cover a conspiracy . In part two , Ianto and Gwen survive a Hub explosion that obliterates Jack . Once regenerated , Jack is sealed in cement by agent Johnson ( Liz May Brice ) until Ianto rescues him with a forklift truck . In part three , the group watch helplessly as the 456 demand a tribute : 10 % of the Earth 's children ; the government appears willing to comply . In part four , Ianto and Jack storm the Thames House to confront the 456 . The pair refuse to sacrifice any lives to the alien demands . In response , the aliens release a fatal virus into the atmosphere . Thames House locks down , and Ianto dies in Jack 's arms , telling him that he loved him and begging Jack never to forget about him , to which Jack replies he never could .

 Ianto appears in the first six of the Torchwood novels , published by BBC Books . The first wave , Another Life by Peter <unk> , Border Princes by Dan Abnett , and Slow Decay by Andy Lane , were published in January 2007 . Published in March 2008 , and tying in with the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood , Ianto appears in the novels Trace Memory by David Llewellyn , The Twilight Streets by Gary Russell , and Something in the Water by Trevor Baxendale . October 2008 saw the release of three more Torchwood books by Peter <unk> , series writer Phil Ford and writer for the Doctor Who and Torchwood websites , James Goss , the latter 's cover for Almost Perfect reflecting changes to the cast after the episode 2008 finale episode " Exit Wounds " . The character next appears in Into the Silence , Bay of the Dead and The House that Jack Built in June 2009 , and Risk Assessment , The Undertaker 's Gift and the short story anthology Consequences in October of that year . 
 First published in January 2008 , the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips , in which Ianto also appears . In 2010 , Shrouded is one such two @-@ part comic , written by Gareth David @-@ Lloyd . The comic posits a " what @-@ if " scenario wherein Ianto , " who struggles with his feelings for Jack from the offset " , sees a face from the future and embarks on a mission that could change the course of his life ( from that of his eventual death in Children of Earth ) . David Lloyd comments that he " knows [ the ] character implicitly " . In the first part , Ianto ( originating from the timeframe of Season Two ) is approached by Rhys and Captain John , both post @-@ Children of Earth , who warn Ianto not to believe the offer made by a seductive , time @-@ travelling woman ; they do not tell him that their mission is to preserve the timeline in which he dies . In part two , the woman , Mairwyn , informs Ianto of the events of " Exit Wounds " and Children of Earth , and of Jack 's departure . Ianto tearfully watches the scene where Jack learns of Gwen 's engagement , and sleeps with Mairwyn . After learning of the devastating consequences of assisting Mairwyn , he defeats her and later " retcons " himself . However , in a divergent timeline Ianto appears with Mairwyn , observing his funeral , saying " I can 't believe there 's a reality where I said no . " In 2010 , " Shrouded " was republished in Titan 's dedicated Torchwood comic book . 
 During series two , the Torchwood website , <unk> also hosted an interactive online game written by series writer Phil Ford . Updated weekly with the airing of the new episodes , the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David @-@ Lloyd in character as Ianto debriefing and informing the ' player ' with regards to their mission . Throughout both series one and two , the interactive websites co @-@ written by James Goss featured electronic literature content ( such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters ) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters ' work and personal lives . The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form , along with new original material , some of which expands on what we know of Ianto . For example , it introduces his sister , Rhiannon and brother @-@ in @-@ law Johnny ; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009 's third televised series . 
 Spin @-@ off media has tried to fill in the gaps of Ianto 's character history from before he began working at Torchwood Three ; Ianto 's first week at Torchwood One is shown in a flashback in the novel Trace Memory . The segment also depicts his budding relationship with Lisa Hallett . Also expanding on Jones 's time living in London , the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One ! ( Torchwood # 1 ) shows how Ianto was taken under the wing of Rupert Howarth , a senior researcher , during his first few weeks at Torchwood One . Ianto 's characterisation is explored in The Twilight Streets , in which Ianto sheds some light on the difficulty he had " coming out " as a teenager ; Ianto 's mother tried to have a conversation with him about it , but he remarks " She didn 't work me out , Gwen . No one has . And if I ever do , I 'll let you know . " He then engages in a diatribe with Gwen about what it means to him to be bisexual after Gwen jokes to him that he has the " best of both worlds " . A scene in David @-@ Lloyd 's " Shrouded " , in which Ianto is emailing his sister , Owen is seen to wrestle control of the computer and tries to write to her that " I 've recently discovered that I 'm a Big Old Gay " ; Ianto rebukes him . In the storyline 's conclusion , an alternate timeline is created where Ianto did not die in the events of Children of Earth . 
 However , as with all Doctor Who and Torchwood spin @-@ off media , the canonicity in relation to the television series is unclear .

 Ianto also appears in Torchwood audio books , the first two being Hidden written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori , Everyone Says Hello written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman , released February 2008 , and In the Shadows by Joseph Lidster , released in September 2008 . Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama , " Lost Souls " which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd and Freema Agyeman ( Martha ) . Set after the events of the 2008 series , Ianto and the team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva , as part of Radio 4 's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on . The special radio episode 's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider 's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite , as well as the team 's mourning of Toshiko and Owen 's recent deaths . 
 Three further BBC radio dramas were produced in 2009 for the Afternoon Play slot on Radio 4 , each of which feature Ianto Jones . Chronologically , these occur between the second and third televised series but after " Lost Souls " . <unk> in July 2009 , the first drama is " Asylum " , the second is " Golden Age " , and the third is " The Dead Line " . " The Dead Line " in particular focuses on Ianto 's characterisation , particularly with respect to his relationship with Jack . AfterElton reviewers stated that the radio drama " delivers for <unk> [ a portmanteau used by the shipping fandom ] fans " ; David @-@ Lloyd delivers a monologue as Ianto , <unk> his insecurities to a comatose Jack . When Jack awakens from his coma , he promises " You will never be just a blip in time , Ianto Jones . " 
 After his character was written out of the televised series , David @-@ Lloyd still lends his voice 2011 audio drama series The Lost Files , tying into the televised fourth series , Torchwood : Miracle Day . Of these , " The House of the Dead " by James Goss focuses the most on Ianto . Ianto encounters the spirit of his father , with the claim that he , Ianto 's mother , Owen , Toshiko and Lisa will all be resurrected if Ianto betrays Jack . Exploiting its radio format , the drama reveals that Ianto too is a spirit , and that the story is a Jack solo mission set after series three . Jack and Ianto say a final goodbye and tell each other they love one another for the first time . Jack attempts to return to the land of the living alongside Ianto , but Ianto stays behind to close the Cardiff Rift forever with Jack 's device .

 Gareth David @-@ Lloyd has revealed that his character was originally named Idris Hopper . This has led to speculation that he was the same Idris Hopper played by Aled <unk> who appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode " Boom Town " as Margaret Blaine 's ( Annette Badland ) personal assistant . Writer Stephen James Walker wonders if Russell T Davies intended Idris to become a major character on Torchwood in the same way as Toshiko Sato , who originated in Doctor Who 's " Aliens of London " . Idris Hopper has since appeared in Gary Russell 's Torchwood novel The Twilight Streets . Initially , Ianto is introduced as a quiet worker and the least active character in the supporting cast . David @-@ Lloyd started the role believing Ianto would be killed off at the end of the first series , and was surprised when they " worked the character to become more popular , and it started growing from there . " 
 When Gareth David @-@ Lloyd was cast in the role , the character was renamed Ianto Jones . This was inspired by the character of <unk> Jones , also played by David @-@ Lloyd , in Russell T Davies 's 2004 comedy @-@ drama Mine All Mine . Ianto shares the surname " Jones " with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones , Torchwood character Eugene Jones ( " Random Shoes " ) , and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies 's earlier Queer as Folk ; Davies states that reusing names ( such as Tyler , Smith , Harper , Harkness and Jones ) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page . In developing the character 's attire , costume designer Ray Holman comments : " Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot . He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one , which were top @-@ end fitted ones but always very sober . Towards the end of series one , I also got him into a waistcoat , and everyone thought that looked really good . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 On how he views the character , David @-@ Lloyd says that " outwardly , he 's straight @-@ laced , but there 's a darker side to him and a very playful side too . " Initially , in series one , Ianto is a quiet and more reserved character . Throughout the first series , Ianto 's secrets are exposed to the team , particularly in " Cyberwoman " when his motives for joining Torchwood Three are exposed . David @-@ Lloyd was " bowled over " by the Ianto @-@ centric script for " Cyberwoman " and the " wide range of emotions " it allowed him to play . From this point , Ianto 's focus changes and he begins more and more to come out of his shell . 
 Appearing in series two , Ianto assists the team in field missions and is used by the writers as a vehicle for one @-@ liner jokes . Commenting on this , portrayer Gareth David @-@ Lloyd notes that " This season it 's much more relaxed and he 's not all about keeping secrets , he 's about Torchwood and Jack — he 's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he 's happier . " The developments in Ianto 's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice . " For series two , " comments Ray Holman , " we evolved the look quite a lot , and now his suits come from all over the place . It 's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth , so I 've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next . We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he 's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more . So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties . He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he 's evolving into something much sharper , which looks really good filmed in high definition . " 
 In Torchwood Magazine , actor Gareth David @-@ Lloyd comments on some original character developments intended for Ianto . Originally , his character was the one supposed to die at the end of series two episode " Reset " . Davies 's plan had originally intended for Ianto to be revived , as Owen eventually was , in episode seven . From this point on , the character was intended to be " the Living Dead — pale , but still sexy " . The night before filming , however , Davies changed his mind and seven scripts began a process of being rewritten . New lines had to be handed to the actors on the day of filming . Davies also called a discussion with the actors involved to explain the change in the storyline . In the discussion with executive producer Russell T Davies and Burn Gorman , who portrays Owen , it was decided that Owen would experience the <unk> storyline as he is a character who more overtly enjoys life , making it more interesting from a narrative perspective . 
 David @-@ Lloyd described the character 's development in the third series as " really exciting " . He felt that it was " great to be a fully @-@ fledged member of the team now rather than just the administration man . " He felt flattered to have the writer and producers put so much confidence in him . In this series , the writers also explore Jones 's background ; David @-@ Lloyd was happy with the execution of this backstory , through meeting Ianto 's sister , and commented that it was quite beautifully written . Through meeting his family , we discover that his father has died and that Ianto has grown very distant from his relatives as per the demands of his job . David @-@ Lloyd first concluded that Ianto was being killed off when his agent told him he was only needed for four out of five episodes . Although there was " a bit of disappointment " , he considers himself " lucky " for lasting so long on the series , especially since Ianto was supposed to die in series two . He believed the character 's death was justified by " the impact and the drama , and to keep the dangerous reality of Torchwood ever present " . Although it was " a tragedy that [ Ianto ] died " , David @-@ Lloyd felt that the series had " addressed everything about him that needed to be said " . 
 Creator Russell T Davies felt that killing off Ianto was necessary for Children of Earth ; it was his first decision to create a " horrible war casualty " for the story , because it would be unrealistic to have a great threat and have the main characters all come out unscathed . Ianto 's death also precedes the death of Captain Jack 's grandson Steven ( Bear McCausland ) , and for that scene to occur it necessitated making Jack " badly , badly damaged " . Ianto 's death caused " maximum damage " to Jack , and the loss of his lover ( and grandson ) makes Children of Earth a tale of retribution , as Jack had given away twelve children to the same aliens in 1965 . Davies has said that Ianto is " absolutely dead " . He explains his reasoning ; because it 's a " much more real world in Torchwood " , it wouldn 't work to " regenerate or go to a parallel universe . " Davies feels that Barrowman and David @-@ Lloyd would both be dismayed were that to happen . He stated " it would devalue the entire plot if we brought him back " . Wired magazine described Ianto 's arc , ending in the third series , as an " evolution from meek office assistant to heroic warrior " . 
 = = = Relationship with Jack = = = 
 Much of Ianto 's character development is centred on the character 's relationship with Captain Jack . On the character 's evolution from minor character to romantic interest , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd has commented that " To have a storyline where you 're involved with the leading character for any actor is awesome . " On the character 's development , David @-@ Lloyd has said that through Jack 's relationship , " he 's found his meaning and ... he 's happier . " Asked what it is that Ianto receives from Jack , David @-@ Lloyd responds " Support , meaning . I think he lost meaning . He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back . And reliability that he 'll always be there , I think . " John Barrowman and Gareth David @-@ Lloyd have also opined that Jack 's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack 's empathy , and helped to ground him , with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto " brings out the ' human ' in him , it brings out more of the empathy because he 's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody . So , it 's really great and I think that 's what makes him warm to other people . It makes him more approachable . " In the same interview , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that " I think Ianto 's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show . Ianto 's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground . I think of all the characters , he 's the one who tries to keep everyone else 's feet on the ground . He brings everyone back to reality , often with a dry , witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down . " 
 Comparing Jack 's relationship with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen , David @-@ Lloyd states " I think [ there are ] different sorts of love or lust , as it might be , and I think that 's an ongoing thing ... At the moment , I think there 's two different sorts of love going on there . " He also states that he feels that Ianto 's relationship with Jack is his first same @-@ sex relationship , and doesn 't feel that Ianto would be a " <unk> " , but were he , he would identify as bisexual , but that he " wouldn 't regard himself the same way as Jack does because they 're from different times . " Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto , perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one @-@ sided one . To him , Ianto views the relationship as " serious and committed " , as seen in " A Day in the Death " where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex . However , from dialogue in " Something Borrowed " , Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a " recreational activity " . Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack , as this is the first time that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew . The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack , saying " You do know he 's ... " , which Ianto finishes " Just a shag ? " before adding " Yes I know . I can 't help it , though . I 've never been much good at casual . " In radio play " The Dead Line " , set just prior to series three , Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack , who refutes them , confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real . When asked if the relationship will continue in series three , executive producer Julie Gardner replied , " Yes , I like seeing them as a couple " , while director Euros Lyn stated that " the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [ would continue ] to unfold " in the third series . While Gareth David @-@ Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved , which is " part of the tragedy " , the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David @-@ Lloyd to be " happy to walk away from it . " 
 Ianto makes a post @-@ death appearance in 2011 audio drama " The House of the Dead " . Encountering Ianto 's spirit at a haunted location in Wales , Jack and Ianto are permitted a final goodbye . Without Ianto in his life , Jack wishes to be swept up into the Rift as it closes in an attempt at suicide . Ianto tricks Jack into leaving the House of the Dead , however , despite the possibility of resurrection . As they are forced to part forever by the closing of the Rift , the couple declare their love for one another for the first and last time .

 Awarding the character of Ianto the status of " Cult Spy Icon " , British entertainment news website Digital Spy describes him as a " cult legend " , citing his dour demeanour , one @-@ liners and " eye candy " label . Gay men 's website AfterElton placed Ianto as their seventh best gay and bisexual character in modern science fiction ( encompassing television , film and comic books ) , with Torchwood 's Jack , Ianto 's love interest , receiving first place . Wired magazine was impressed with the way Ianto 's romantic storyline was handled in the third series , and praised Davies 's writing for the " deft , sympathetic handling " of the Harkness @-@ Jones romance , compared with the " clumsiness " of the show 's homoerotic overtones in previous series . Because Ianto 's storyline grows out of the reality of the show , " it plays with such genuine sympathy and pathos that Jones 's eventual fate is easily the miniseries ' most powerful moment . " Wired describes David @-@ Lloyd 's performance as Jones as " a key element in the success of the five @-@ episode story arc . " One AfterElton contributor disliked the death scene partially for the loss of a " beloved gay character " , and because Ianto 's death was caused by Jack 's stupidity , goading on the aliens . They compared the death scene to that of Tara ( Amber Benson ) in Joss Whedon 's Buffy the Vampire Slayer which he felt was more satisfying , although " unbearably sad " because of its pivotal role in the character arc for Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) , and as being " possibly the single most significant event in the whole seven @-@ season series . " He feels that both Joss Whedon and Russell T Davies toyed with their LGBT fans ' affections , and claim " neither Whedon nor Davies seem aware of the impact that these characters were having on viewers starved for such representations . " Later , AfterElton published an opposing view , which analysed the character 's death in view of the character 's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man , and claimed that , instead of being an expression of homophobia , the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of <unk> . In 2012 David Brown of the Radio Times described Ianto 's demise as one of televisions five most shocking death scenes and " surely [ Torchwood 's ] finest hour " . 
 The website Den of Geek praised Davies 's writing of Ianto 's death , and likened the tough story @-@ driven decision to those used in critically acclaimed shows The Sopranos , Battlestar Galactica and The Wire . Den of Geek felt the real tension of knowing any character could die , however popular , was " refreshing " in comparison to impossibly death @-@ defying characters such as 24 's Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) . In 2010 , Davies 's replacement as Doctor Who executive producer , Steven Moffat , commented saying " I thought his death scene was brilliant . " When the series screened in New Zealand , GayNZ compared the two contending perspectives , comparing those who viewed Ianto 's death from the perspective of " dramatic necessity " to those who disparaged it as the result of thoughtlessness on the part of the series creators about the relative absence of representations of enduring lesbian and gay couples within television series . Ianto 's death was compared to that of Tara as in the above critiques , but also contrasted to other television series where lesbian and gay couples were able to have enduring relationships , such as Six Feet Under 's David Fisher ( Michael C. Hall ) and Keith Charles ( Mathew St. Patrick ) and Bad Girls ' Nikki Wade ( Mandana Jones ) and Helen Stewart ( Simone <unk> ) . 
 GayNZ writer Craig Young places Ianto , like Buffy 's Tara , in a larger literary tradition , commenting " just as Iphigenia 's sacrifice at the hands of Agamemnon was necessary to set in train the events of Aeschylus 's Oresteia ... just as Ophelia 's madness , suicide and accidental death led to the climatic duel between Hamlet and Laertes ... Ianto 's death can be argued to be a dramatic necessity which adds to character and narrative development . " The article acknowledged there being some validity in criticisms of modern TV dramas which uphold that it is frequently the gay relationships which " can never be seen to have long @-@ term , fulfilled relationships " . However , GayNZ questioned whether the pattern was solely gay , noting the equally tragic outcomes of homosexual and heterosexual relationships in American shows Buffy and Nip / Tuck . The website also took note of Ianto fans ' displeasure when Jack was introduced to a new romantic partner in Alonso Frame ( Russell Tovey ) in Doctor Who episode The End of Time ( 2010 ) , mirroring Willow 's romance with Kennedy ( <unk> Limon ) in Season Seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . The article intentionally avoided making a definitive conclusion as to which " side " of the argument was correct . Young later compared Ianto 's death with the subsequent killing off of core heterosexual couples in two British shows , Misfits and Being Human . These latter deaths are described as even more heartbreaking than Ianto 's , and Young argues that these character deaths tell us more about transatlantic differences in storytelling than about portrayals of sexuality .

 Some fans expressed their displeasure following Ianto 's death in the third series . The website End of Show comments that " writer James Moran was so inundated with messages to his Twitter account that he posted a number of impassioned pleas to tone down the vitriol . " End of Show writer Kirsty Walker comments that fans on Twitter accused Moran of " deliberately egging on the ' shippers ' . " Moran noted in his blog that of the thousands of messages from viewers , the " vast majority " were extremely positive , managing to express that they were " upset , angry and shocked " without making personal attacks . Moran declared the response from other commentators to be unacceptable , describing their conduct as the spewing of insults and " passive aggressive nonsense " . He noted that fans had accused him of deliberately trying to " mislead " , " lie " and " hurt " them , said that he hated them , was " laughing at them " and " slapping [ them ] in the face " , and claimed that he had " killed the show " , had attempted to drive away existing fans to court newer and " cooler " viewers , and had deliberately hurt depressed people " with dark storylines . " In a poll conducted by Digital Spy shortly after Ianto 's death , 27 @.@ 4 % of voters claimed that they would no longer watch Torchwood . Responding to these results , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd thanked the fans for their dedication to the show and the character but urged them to have faith in the writers . On the show 's Facebook groups , fans expressed anger towards creator Russell T Davies and some claimed they would stop watching the show . Walker herself had felt that the end of Jack 's relationship with Ianto could " change the show beyond all recognition . " 
 io9 commented that fans on Moran 's blog accused him of homophobia ; one quoted fan likened it to 1950s @-@ style homophobia " where all the queer folks died ... and the straight people walk away completely unscathed . " io9 writer Charlie Jane Anders comments , however , that " as people have had a bit more time to consider the new series , more thoughtful discussions have arisen . " One such cited notes that it is unlikely that Children of Earth was intentionally homophobic since the writer ( Davies ) and lead actor ( John Barrowman ) are both openly gay . The same reviewer notes that however , " especially when viewed on its own , Children of Earth looks a lot like the same heteronormative , homophobic , <unk> and gratuitous tropes that appear in so many bad representations of queer people in popular culture . " In response to the accusations of " de @-@ gaying " Torchwood , Davies advised those people do some research into his career ( creator of Queer as Folk ) and " stop riding on a bandwagon that they actually don 't know anything about " . Asked to respond to viewers who felt " cheated " that Jack and Ianto 's relationship did not come to fruition , Davies said : 
 That 's the point actually . Both in fiction and in life . When someone dies you lose all that potential . You grieve over everything they could have been . Everything you hoped for them . Everything they might have achieved with their lives , everyone they could have loved . Every job they could have had . Every joy they could have had . It 's gone . 
 Soon after the death of Ianto Jones during Torchwood 's third series , a campaign to bring him back was started through networking sites such as LiveJournal , Twitter and Facebook . The resulting website , <unk> , has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee , along with postcards and letters of complaint , to the BBC , a reference to Ianto 's status as the " coffee boy " . Via the Save Ianto Jones website , fans are also campaigning to raise money for the BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character . The fundraising site states that " Though we , his devoted fans , still hope that he 'll come back ... we mourn him . In the series , he died saving the children of Earth ; so it seems fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need . " Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly £ 4 @,@ 000 , with individual donations ranging from £ 2 to £ 50 . John Barrowman described the charity campaign as " a fun way to mourn Ianto " and stated that it was " the kind of thing that 's really appreciated " . Gareth David @-@ Lloyd was flattered by the strong fan reaction , saying it is " satisfying in drama when you create such an emotional response , because that 's what you set out to do in the first place " . He praised the fan donations , claiming " So far , they 've raised about £ 3 @,@ 000 for Children in Need , and £ 1 @,@ 000 for <unk> Horse and Pony Trust in West Wales , which I 'm a patron of , so that 's got to be a good thing " . Coventry Telegraph records that by 21 July 2009 , £ 4 @,@ 172 had been donated in Ianto 's name . 
 In an interview with io9 on 28 July 2009 , creator Russell T Davies was asked about the controversy surrounding Ianto 's death and the fan reaction campaign . He replied " There 's a campaign , because he was a coffee boy . But do you know how many packets of coffee they 've received so far ? Nine . So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people , but they are nine . " However , those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community . When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello , Russell T Davies said " It 's not particularly a backlash . What 's actually happening is , well , nothing really to be honest . It 's a few people posting online and getting fans upset " . He also stated that the character was gone for good , and that his resurrection would devalue the " entire plot . " He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural " because those boys are beautiful " , or " look at poetry " if they " can 't handle drama " . Following these statements , the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies , and temporarily presented on its front page the message " Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt , and as disposable , which saddens us " and asked not to be " abused " . At Comic @-@ Con 2009 , a fan claimed that Davies " hurt " a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto , which she called " out of line . " Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision , adding , " I 've got to be blunt about this , there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest . There have been nine packets sent . I 'm not taking the mickey , but that 's a very small number . " Executive producer Julie Gardner stated " We want people to be engaged , discuss and not always agree with us . At the end of the day , I make drama to support each author 's vision . It 's not a democracy . Whether people like it or not , it 's storytelling . " Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character , citing that the show would " lose far more credibility " if he were brought back . Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so . He summarised : " Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions , and for that to happen , the reset switch simply isn 't an option . " 
 On 31 July 2009 , Digital Spy conducted a poll asking if it was " time to move on " from Ianto . However , a week later the website did not immediately publish the results , announcing " unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll was the subject of a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome " . Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans " suggests the answer to the question ' Have people overreacted to Ianto 's death ? ' is quite obvious " . Later , a footnote amendment noted that 31 @.@ 4 % said it was time to move on , " while the remainder demanded RTD 's head on a plate " , a reference to his own wording of the original poll , which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto , or the executive producer 's head on a plate . James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as " sickening " and quoted " crazed " fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers . Gareth David @-@ Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans , whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called " completely unacceptable " . David @-@ Lloyd added that he " would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that " . A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article , and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy . In their comments , fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the " ill @-@ conceived , knee @-@ jerk reactions " of a few individuals , and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back , which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show 's actors and writers . Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists , and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism , described as " thousands of fans who are raising money for charity , sending polite letters , and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor " . In 2010 , Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn 't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could : " Not reversing it . Stop asking . " In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay , 70 % of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one , with 19 % responding " indifferent " and only 11 % stating that it had been the wrong decision , contrasting with the initial fan response . In response to a question , Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the " scary " fan reaction , maintaining that " a universe in which fictional characters aren 't ' allowed ' to die is ridiculous and limiting " . 
 The public reaction to the death of Ianto has had a wider @-@ reaching impact than simply the Torchwood fan community . For example , comic book writer Peter David cited the reaction to Ianto Jones 's death when reflecting on where to go with the gay relationship between the Marvel Comics characters Rictor and Shatterstar in X @-@ Factor v. 3 . He opined that in " virtually any happy relationship " , one of the characters has to die to " provide angst " to the more major character . His concern was " being tagged as against gay people " , the way Russell T Davies was , even though Davies is himself gay . 
 = Hurricane Iniki = 
 Hurricane Iniki ( / <unk> / ee @-@ NEE @-@ kee ; Hawaiian : <unk> meaning " strong and piercing wind " ) was the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. state of Hawaii in recorded history . Forming on September 5 , 1992 , during the strong 1990 – 95 El Niño , Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season . It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day . After turning north , Iniki struck the island of Kauaʻi on September 11 at peak intensity ; it had winds of 145 miles per hour ( 233 km / h ) and reached Category 4 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale . It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season , and the first major hurricane since Hurricane Dot in 1959 . Iniki dissipated on September 13 about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska . 
 Iniki caused around $ 1 @.@ 8 billion ( 1992 USD ) of damage and six deaths . At the time , Iniki was among the costliest United States hurricanes , and it remains one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern Pacific . The storm struck just weeks after Hurricane Andrew , the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time , struck Florida . 
 The Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24 hours in advance . Despite the lack of early warning , only six deaths ensued . Damage was greatest on Kauaʻi , where the hurricane destroyed more than 1 @,@ 400 houses and severely damaged more than 5 @,@ 000 . Though not directly in the path of the eye , Oʻahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origin of Iniki is unclear , but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the African coast on August 18 . It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the August 28 . The wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized . Conditions slowly became more favorable , and , as the convection concentrated around a center , the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen @-@ E on September 5 . At this time , the wave was located 1700 miles ( 2700 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas or 1550 miles ( 2500 km ) east @-@ southeast of Hilo . Initially , the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength . The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the September 8 , when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm . 
 Located at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge , Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific ; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470 miles ( 760 km ) south @-@ southeast of Hilo . The subtropical ridge , which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the Hawaiian Islands , weakened due to an approaching upper level @-@ trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest . With very favorable upper @-@ level outflow and warm water temperatures , Iniki steadily intensified , and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south @-@ southwest of the island chain . 
 As Iniki turned to the north , it continued to strengthen , reaching a peak of 145 mph ( 235 km / h ) winds on September 11 while 170 miles ( 270 km ) south @-@ southwest of <unk> on the island of Kauaʻi . It continued rapidly to the north @-@ northeast , and made landfall on south @-@ central Kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145 mph ( 235 km / h ) , making Iniki a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of up to 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . The highest recorded wind speed from Hurricane Iniki was a 227 mph ( 365 km / h ) reading from the Navy 's <unk> Ridge radar station . According to the Honolulu Advertiser , that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose wind gauging equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm . After crossing the island , Iniki rapidly accelerated north @-@ northeastward , weakened rapidly , and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became extratropical on September 13 about halfway between Alaska and Hawaiʻi . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance . For several days prior to the disaster , the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain , with the only effect being some high surf conditions . Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands , but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters . As late as early September 11 , the CPHC suggested that Iniki would remain well to the south of the island group . It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC less than 24 hours before landfall — that any warning was given to the public . 
 A hurricane watch was issued for Kauaʻi early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day . Prior to Iniki 's arrival in Kauaʻi , 8 @,@ 000 people were housed in shelters , many of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10 years prior . Because schools were canceled , traffic was light during the evacuation , and streets were clear by mid @-@ morning . Rather than sending tourists to public shelters , two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm 's passage . 
 The CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Oʻahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day . Though not hit by the hurricane , Iniki 's large wind field caused nearly 30 @,@ 000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oʻahu . Public school buildings acted as shelters , and were for refuge only , meaning they did not provide food , cots , blankets , medications or other comfort items . Roughly one @-@ third of Oʻahu 's population participated in the evacuation , though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter . The execution of the evacuations went well , beginning with the vulnerable coastal area . For those in need , vans and buses gave emergency transportation , while police manned certain overused intersections . The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaiʻi , causing $ 1 @.@ 8 billion in damage . Most damage was on the island of Kauaʻi , where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power , although Oʻahu also suffered significant damage . Iniki also was responsible for six deaths . 
 The hurricane nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu . Had it hit there , Iniki , along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar , would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two @-@ month period . 
 = = = Kauaʻi = = = 
 Hurricane Iniki made landfall on the south @-@ central portion of Kauaʻi island , bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island . Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4 @.@ 5 – 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 m ) , with some portions of the coastlines having high @-@ water marks of up to 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) . In addition , strong waves of up to 35 feet ( 10 @.@ 5 m ) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours , causing a debris line of more than 800 feet ( 250 m ) inland . Because it moved quickly through the island , there were no reports of significant rainfall . 
 Hurricane Iniki 's making landfall during daylight hours , combined with the popularity of camcorders , led many Kauaʻi residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring . The footage was later used to create an hour @-@ long video documentary . Airline service was down . 
 Hurricane Iniki 's high winds caused extensive damage in Kauaʻi . 1 @,@ 421 houses were destroyed , and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action . A total of 5 @,@ 152 homes were severely damaged , while 7 @,@ 178 received minor damage . On the south coast , hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well . A few were restored quickly , though some took several years to be rebuilt . One hotel — the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley 's Blue Hawaii — never reopened after the hurricane . Destroyed housing across the island left more than 7 @,@ 000 people homeless after the storm 's passage . 
 Iniki 's high winds also downed 26 @.@ 5 % of the island 's transmission poles , 37 % of its distribution poles , and 35 % of its 800 mile ( 1300 km ) distribution wire system . The entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time . Electric companies restored only 20 % of the island 's power service within four weeks of Iniki , while other areas were without power for up to three months . Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector . Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested , what was left was severely damaged . The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees . 
 Most of Iniki 's damage occurred in Kauaʻi . On the island , one person died when struck by debris , while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her . Offshore , two Japanese nationals died when their boat capsized . The reduced death toll was likely due to well @-@ executed warnings and preparation . More than 100 injuries can be attributed to Iniki , though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane . 
 Among those on Kauaʻi was filmmaker Steven Spielberg , who was preparing for the final day of on @-@ location shooting of the film Jurassic Park . He and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki 's passage . According to Spielberg , " every single structure was in shambles ; roofs and walls were torn away ; telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see . " Members of the film 's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads . 
 The U.S. Coast Guard station at <unk> Harbor was hard hit by the storm , which fatally damaged the service 's 82 @-@ foot ( 25 m ) cutter stationed there . The Coast Guard promptly established a humanitarian response detachment , commanded by Lt. Kenneth Armstrong , which helped to provide medical supplies , food , ice , water , and cash grants to island residents , as well as making temporary repairs to public buildings . Under Armstrong 's command , the port was recertified to receive gasoline and diesel fuel , which helped to relieve a major fuel shortage caused by the widespread use of personal electrical generators . A larger DoD contingent , nicknamed " Operation Garden Sweep , " provided large scale relief in the form of tent cities , utility repairs , road clearings , and major medical operations . 
 = = = Oʻahu = = = 
 Upon passing by Oʻahu , Iniki produced tides of 1 @.@ 7 – 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 9 m ) above normal . Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oʻahu , with the areas most affected being Barbers Point through <unk> . The <unk> coastline experienced the most damage , with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments . In all , Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage , and two deaths on Oʻahu .

 Damage on the big island was minor . Seas of 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) were reported , along with 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds . In Kona Harbor , three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk . The <unk> Beach , in the Kealakekua Bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after the storm , many were relieved to have survived the worst of the Category 4 hurricane ; their complacency turned to <unk> due to lack of information , as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days . Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island , communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers . Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed , many Kauaʻi citizens insisted on paying . In addition , entertainers from all of Hawaiʻi , including Graham Nash ( who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi ) and the Honolulu Symphony , provided free concerts to the victims . 
 Looting occurred in the aftermath of Iniki , though it was very minor . A group of Army Corps of Engineers , who experienced the looting of Hurricane Andrew just weeks before , were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island . Although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane , students returned to Kauaʻi public schools two weeks after the disaster . Kauaʻi citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies , though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help . The military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs , though , and help arrived before local officials requested aid . 
 Amateur radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm , with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery . There was support of local government communications in Lihue in the first week of recovery as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the American Red Cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across Kauaʻi . 
 In the months after the storm , many insurance companies left Hawaiʻi . To combat this , State Governor John D. <unk> III enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaiʻi residents . The fund was never needed for another Hawaiʻi hurricane , and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island . 
 It is thought that Hurricane Iniki blew apart many chicken coops , some possibly used to house fighting chickens ; this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild chickens roaming Kauaʻi . 
 The name Iniki was retired due to this storm , and was replaced with <unk> within the Central North Pacific tropical storm list . Less than three days after Iniki struck , Hurricane Orlene struck the Big Island as a depression . 
 = Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band = 
 The Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band ( also known as the Noble Men of Kyle or just the Aggie Band ) is the official marching band of Texas A & M University . Composed of over 400 men and women from the school 's Corps of Cadets , it is the largest military marching band in the world . The band 's complex straight @-@ line marching maneuvers are performed exclusively to traditional marches . 
 Since its inception in 1894 , its members eat together , sleep in the same dormitories , and practice up to forty hours per week on top of a full academic schedule . The Aggie Band performs at all home football games , some away games , and university and Corps functions throughout the year . The band has also participated in inauguration parades for many United States Presidents and Texas Governors , major annual parades across the country , and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 The Aggie Band owes its existence to Joseph Holick . In 1885 , Holick and his brother Louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for Orange , Texas so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill . En route , the two stopped in Bryan , Texas , near the campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas . The 22 @-@ year @-@ old Holick began to doubt his choice , stating , " I was a small boy and couldn 't do lumbering work " , and chose to remain in Bryan working under Raymond <unk> , owner of a prominent boot shop . Lawrence Sullivan Ross , the president of the nearby college and a former Governor of Texas , stopped into <unk> 's boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots . Ross requested Holick be stationed at the new military college to perform cobbler duties . 
 Holick accepted the proposal and moved to work at Texas A & M. Shortly after his arrival , the Commandant 's staff discovered his musical talents . They requested him to play the bugle for Corps functions and for US $ 65 a month , he was assigned to play Reveille and Taps . Because the new job paid much more than his previous one , Holick wanted to give the school " more than just two tunes for its money and he asked the commandant for permission to start a cadet band " . The commandant agreed and named Holick its first bandmaster . Under his tutelage and the leadership of subsequent bandmasters , the band grew from 13 members at its inception in 1894 to 75 bandsmen in 1924 . 
 Early drum majors are credited with inspiring the band 's name . The first student drum major , H.A. " California " Morse , was asked to leave the college due to fighting . In addition , the early drum majors were chosen in physical combat ; insomuch that the candidates were placed in a locked room , with the best fighter / the one emerging victorious , being named to the coveted position . This tradition of aggressiveness and physical combat was noted by band members , who then took to calling themselves the Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band . 
 = = = Dunn years = = = 
 In 1924 , Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Dunn was appointed as bandmaster . As a former member of John Philip Sousa 's Marine Band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience , Dunn quickly instituted changes within the band . The first was to the position of bugler , whose duties had fallen to the bandmaster since 1894 . When informed that he was expected to fill the role , Dunn told college officials , " I have blown enough bugles . I am the Bandmaster . Someone else can blow the bugle calls . " From then on , the Corps Bugler was chosen from the ranks of the Aggie Band . 
 Dunn also instituted uniform changes which added white canvas to the band uniform , resulting in a " flash effect " every other step . Dunn tried , to no avail , to rid the band of the Senior Boots , but this tradition was too well @-@ established . Other additions included crossed white belts , later discarded in favor of a white Sam Browne belt , silver buckles , and the addition of a bugle rank to lead the band in its maneuvers . Changes in the drills included the " Block T " , the band 's signature , and such intricate designs which led to talk amongst fans about the band " always winning halftime " . 
 Under Dunn 's experience , the band instituted some traditions that the university uses to the present . In 1925 , Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school . Dunn , who found the Aggie War Hymn " inappropriate " for social functions and solemn occasions , wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland . In 1926 , the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus . All the seniors in one single file was " quite a site to behold " , and one junior commented that they looked like a bunch of old elephants wandering around trying to find some place to die . The name stuck and the tradition continues to the present . 
 Beginning in 1939 , the U.S. Army required all cadets to be in either infantry or field artillery units . Therefore , the band was split into two separate units at opposite ends of the campus dormitories and named Infantry and Artillery Bands . When the two units performed together , they formed the Combined Band . 1942 saw the band expand to 250 members , but the need for manpower for the war effort caused membership to plummet . By the end of the 1942 – 1943 school year , it dropped it to only 90 bandsmen . As " a crusty old army man " , Dunn understood the nation 's urgent need for troops , and he accepted the fact that the Aggie Band could only return after the war was over . 
 Along with conducting the Aggie Band , Dunn started his own orchestra with the newly built A & M Consolidated High School on the Texas A & M Campus , called the " Little Symphony Orchestra " . Dunn was also the founder of the famous A & M Consolidated High School Tiger Band in 1947 . 
 = = = Adams era = = = 
 Dunn once told then @-@ cadet Edward Vergne Adams , " One day I want you to direct this band . " Adams thought the Colonel was joking , but " went to music school after graduation just in case he wasn 't " . After music school , he joined the Army and put his musical skills to rest for the duration of the war , with one exception : while on regimental staff during the retreat ceremony at the end of the day , the assigned bugler had no experience and couldn 't play a single note , so Adams stepped out of formation , took the bugle from the bugler 's hands , blew the appropriate calls , handed the bugle back , and marched back into his spot in the formation . 
 This intolerance for incompetence served him well when he accepted the invitation of Dunn to be his replacement as director of the Aggie Band . Adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid of experience and ravaged by years of war , but in his first year of leadership , the ranks of the band quickly swelled to 225 members . Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units ' names to the Maroon and White Bands . 
 Adams began to make the drills far more intricate and precise than they had been in the past by adding a countermarch , maneuvers from the Army Drill Manual , and established a 30 inch ( 76 cm ) step , or six steps for every five yards ( <unk> ) , as the band standard . Adams also added the criss @-@ cross maneuver . First performed November 27 , 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas , the criss @-@ cross maneuver and its later variations became the band 's most anticipated maneuver . Other band directors said it was impossible to do because it required two people to be in the same place at the same time ( indeed , to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed ) . To accomplish this , band members step between each other 's feet . In later years , people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer . Adams explained , " It 's all a matter of mathematics . One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed . " 
 The band 's reputation spread and other bands had begun to have some apprehension about performing in the same halftime as the Aggie Band . One Southwest Conference band director stated , " I dread going against the Aggie Band .... What is so humiliating is to see the Aggie Band do things band directors talk about as being impossible , and do them perfectly . It takes two weeks to recover from the trauma . " In 1960 , " one band gave up without a fight " : the Trinity Tiger Band opted to sit instead of perform and gave the Aggie Band the entire halftime to perform . 
 During Adams ' tenure , the college acquired a new mascot , the first since the original Reveille died in 1944 . Reveille II , like the original Reveille , was cared for and attended to by band members . During halftime performances , the young dog was allowed to be on the field with the band without her leash . During these breaks where she could get out and run , she had a tendency to " do her business " on Kyle Field 's playing surface . This didn 't bother the band members much , as Reveille stayed away from the band , but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yardline the dog would defecate . He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E @-@ 2 , which has since been called the Mascot Company . 
 On October 7 , 1967 , the first meeting of the Aggie Band Association took place to support the band . The organization , composed of former members and supporters , continue to assist the band through fundraising , scholarships , instrument repair , and general welfare of the cadets in the band . In 1970 , Adams acquired funds and built a new band hall which was named in his honor . 
 = = = Modernization and expansion = = = 
 Colonel Joe T. Haney took over the band in 1973 . He felt his obligation was , " not to build up the band ... [ but ] to keep it at its already exceptional level " . During Haney 's years , the band expanded to include a concert band , a symphonic band , the Aggieland Orchestra , and a Drum and Bugle Corps , and the names of the two subunits reverted to their earlier designations of Infantry and Artillery Bands . 
 This simple philosophy was tested as Texas A & M transitioned from an all @-@ male military college to a coeducational research university . The addition of women to the Corps presented some challenges , including one high @-@ profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members . When women were finally admitted to the band under court order ( Fall Semester , 1985 ) ; the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms . Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies . The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies ( members of their freshman class in their unit ) were included in the photos . With a band dropout rate of 33 % the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding , only Andrea <unk> remained in the band through her senior year . Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms , grouping females at one end of the dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use . 
 Amidst these drastic changes , large proportions of the freshmen classes ( some as high as 30 % ) contained all @-@ state high school band members . As the band 's experience and musical talents grew , the quality of the music improved dramatically . Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience . This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band 's repertoire . In 1975 , at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas , the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game . By the fourth quarter , the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney , trying his best to be fair , told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too . The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied , " The director doesn 't want to hear the Arkansas band , he wants to hear the Aggie Band . " 
 The drills became even more complicated as Haney added formations and maneuvers never before seen . The excellence shown on the field belied its heavy dependence on precision . On October 24 , 1981 the band suffered a serious misstep during the halftime show at Rice University when four members of a lead element turned early and , before anyone could make a correction , colliding band members ground the drill to a halt . With so many members doing exactly what the person in front of them does with mere inches of clearance , the cascade effect was unrecoverable and the band simply stopped and left the field . Although it was first rumored that the collision was intended to mock the Rice Marching Owl Band , and later that Rice students were using whistles to throw off the band 's response to drum major whistle commands , all of the rumors proved to be unsubstantiated . Thereafter the band performed all drills in Houston without whistle commands . 
 The following weekend the band attempted their most complicated drill and performed flawlessly . Each subsequent week , the drills became more complicated . The Bryan @-@ College Station Eagle 's editor opined , " A & M is probably the only school anywhere that throws in a free football game with its performance . One of these days , I fully expect the band to be invited to a bowl game — and to be told it can bring along its football team if it wants to . " 
 = = = Into a new millennium = = = 
 Lieutenant Colonel Ray E. Toler , a Texas Christian University graduate , replaced Haney when he stepped down in 1989 . As a veteran of many Air Force Bands and with a Grammy Award nomination under his belt , Toler was quick to realize the potential and traditions of the Aggie Band and quickly set about publicizing it . Under his direction , the Aggie Band began a weekly television show ( the " Texas Aggie Band Show " ) that showcased the band , the Corps of Cadets , and the daily life of a band member . As of 2007 , the Aggie Band is the only university or college band with its own weekly television show . The Aggie Band was recognized nationally as the 2001 recipient of the Louis Sudler Trophy for collegiate marching bands , administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation . During Toler 's leadership of the Aggie Band , its presence was personally requested by President @-@ elect George W. Bush for his inauguration parade . 
 During Toler 's tenure , many of the Aggie drills and music were written by Dr. Timothy Rhea , who succeeded Toler as Director of Bands in 2002 . Rhea actively arranges and composes music , which has been published by <unk> Music Publisher , RBC Music Publisher , and Arranger 's Publishing Company . 
 = = Cadet life = = 
 The members of the band are called BQs and , since the band 's inception , are part of the Corps of Cadets . All BQs are assigned to one of six units : A @-@ Battery , B @-@ Battery , C @-@ Battery , A @-@ Company , B @-@ Company or C @-@ Company . C @-@ Company and C @-@ Battery were reactivated on August 23 , 2013 . The band is a major unit within the Corps , comparable in size to a Brigade or a Wing . Due to its status as a Senior Military College all cadets are required to take ROTC classes at least their first two years , though follow @-@ on military service is not required . 
 The Aggie Band is unique among college bands ; no other band eats and lives together as a military unit , even at the Service Academies and military colleges . <unk> wear their cadet uniforms to class , drill , meetings , and other functions on campus . As a requested component of football away games , they perform at more football games than any other band . As of 1993 , the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games , including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984 . Demand is extremely high for the band and one person , upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A & M , returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets . 
 The Aggie Band performs a new show each week during the football season and does not generally repeat drills from week to week . During the fall semester , the Aggie Band practices one to three hours every weekday morning and on Saturdays every week with a football game . In addition , some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester . During weeks with complicated drills , extra practice and planning time is sometimes also done on weekday afternoons . All told , drills can take up to 40 hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps / ROTC activities . 
 All seniors in the Corps of Cadets wear distinctive cavalry riding boots with their uniforms . These boots usually cost more than US $ 1 @,@ 000 and are generally made at Victor 's or Holick 's , formerly owned by the family of Joseph Holick , the first Band Director . 
 = = = Leadership = = = 
 Unlike many bands , the drum majors are not in charge of the band as a whole . Since the band is part of the Corps , it has its own unit commander , a Cadet Colonel . Due to necessity for military functions , the Band Commander is accorded the privilege of the first file in bugle rank ( the lead rank of the band ) . During formal military ceremonies , the commander carries a sabre instead of a bugle , as do all other commanders . Subordinate to the Band Commander are the commanders of the Artillery and Infantry bands , each a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel ; and the unit commanders of A @-@ Battery , B @-@ Battery , C @-@ Battery , A @-@ Company , B @-@ Company , and C @-@ Company . The Batteries are called the Artillery Band and the Companies the Infantry Band . The two bands perform together for halftime shows , but are often split for minor performances such as local parades and functions where the entire band is not needed . Furthermore , the band is composed of three different ROTC programs and appoints commanders to manage and train the cadets within their respective ROTC affiliations . 
 On the field , the band is led by three drum majors and the twelve members of bugle rank . Each drum major carries a mace and directs the band based on its movements and whistle commands during a drill . The head drum major is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel , while the two side drum majors , the Infantry Band Drum Major and the Artillery Band Drum Major , are Cadet Majors . 
 Bugle rank consists of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well respected in the band and have impeccable marching abilities . Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner , but are never played during a performance . Together , the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field . In addition to their primary functions within the band , the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers , much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The band has approximately 420 members with more than 90 trumpets and cornets , 70 trombones , 30 <unk> , 30 baritones , 45 bass horns , 50 drummers , and 80 assorted woodwinds , though the actual composition varies annually . There are no flutes in the Aggie Band , as their position while being played would hinder the intricate marching maneuvers . <unk> are used instead . All members of the band must have high school marching experience , an audition during the spring semester leading into the first fall semester of attendance to include major scales and sight reading , and an individual interview with the band director . Prospective members are also encouraged to participate in the Spend the Night with the Corps program to better understand the rigors of life in the Corps of Cadets . 
 = = Marching = = 
 = = = Complex maneuvers = = = 
 The repertoire of the Aggie Band 's maneuvers is designed by the directors and drum majors and can include <unk> , flanks , countermarches , and other Army marching maneuvers . The Band is generally led by the bugle rank with each person following the person in front of them , also known as follow @-@ the @-@ leader . Space between band members during countermarches is less than six inches ( 15 cm ) and during other maneuvers even less . This space is insufficient for the bass horns and some members must turn their horns to complete the maneuver . According to an article in The Battalion , " some of the Aggie band 's maneuvers are so complex that some drill @-@ charting software says that the drills are impossible because they require multiple people to be in the same place at the same time . " This is also discussed in a video by The Association of Former Students of Texas A & M University . 
 The Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band has performed at inauguration parades for many Presidents of the United States in Washington , D.C. , including at the personal request of President @-@ elect George H. W. Bush . Other events in which the band has participated include inauguration parades for Governors of Texas , major annual parades across the country , and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library . 
 = = = Typical halftime drill = = = 
 The halftime drill always begins with the band running into place at the command of the drum major 's whistle . The announcer ( Lieutenant Colonel Jay Brewer ) then states , usually in unison with the crowd , " Now forming at the north end of Kyle Field , the nationally famous Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band . " A whoop and cheers come from the audience . The drum majors then march out in front of the band and the head drum major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band , referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn , by shouting , " Recall ! Step off on Hullabaloo ! " ( Recall is a traditional Army bugle call – the first 34 notes , and intro of the Aggie War Hymn . " Hullabaloo " is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn . ) These directions are not amplified in any way , but can be heard across the entire stadium . After another whoop , the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish . 
 The drill then begins with the band playing the opening notes of the War Hymn and stepping off into the initial formation . At some point in the drill , the band converts from Spread formation to Block formation . With no cessation of the music until the band leaves the field , the drill continues and often stops with the band playing the last stanza in place in the center of the field before moving into the signature " Block T " or " Block ATM " . When done playing , the band runs off the field . Specific maneuvers in the drill can include : 
 The Criss Cross : the band files split into two halves and march through each other at 90 ° angles 
 The Four @-@ way Cross : The band splits into four groups of three files and march through each other from each of the corners of the field ( this maneuver is one of the more popular among fans , due to its difficulty ) 
 Minstrel Turns : band members pass through each other by stepping between each other 's feet . 
 Spread @-@ to @-@ Block : the band moves from being 30 files wide ( i.e. , across the width of the football field ) by 12 ranks deep ( i.e. , along the length of the football field ) to 12 files wide by 30 ranks deep 
 Block @-@ to @-@ Spread : the opposite of Spread @-@ to @-@ Block 
 Continuous <unk> : the bugle rank leads two successive countermarches following the back of the band through the maneuver 
 Wheel Turns ( also known as a Gate Turn ) : A turn of a block of the band where the people on the inside of the turn reduce their step size . This is only done during parades when going around corners .

 As a military marching band , the Aggie Band exclusively plays traditional marches . Among many other marches , its primary repertoire includes : 
 Fightin ' Texas Aggie War Hymn 
 Spirit of Aggieland : The school 's alma mater 
 The Noble Men of Kyle : The group 's signature march ; also a nickname for the band 
 Ballad of the Green Berets 
 The main theme from the movie Patton

 Strategic Air Command March 
 The Aggie Band frequently performs a number of standard military and circus marches : 
 The Trombone King 
 Stars and Stripes Forever

 = Crucifixion darkness = 
 The Crucifixion darkness is an episode in three of the Canonical Gospels in which the sky becomes dark in daytime during the crucifixion of Jesus . 
 Ancient and medieval Christian writers treated this as a miracle , and believed it to be one of the few episodes from the New Testament which were confirmed by non @-@ Christian sources . Pagan commentators of the Roman era explained it as an eclipse , although Christian writers pointed out that an eclipse during Passover , when the crucifixion took place , would have been impossible ; a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon . 
 Modern scholarship , noting the way in which similar accounts were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures , sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death , or a sign of God 's displeasure with the Jewish people . Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Book of Amos and the Book of Exodus . 
 = = Biblical account = = 
 The oldest biblical reference to the crucifixion darkness is found in the Gospel of Mark , written around the year 70 . In its account of the crucifixion , on the eve of Passover , it says that after Jesus was crucified at nine in the morning , darkness fell over all the land , or all the world ( Greek : <unk> <unk> can mean either ) from around noon ( " the sixth hour " ) until 3 o 'clock ( " the ninth hour " ) . It adds , immediately after the death of Jesus , that " the curtain of the temple was torn in two , from top to bottom " . 
 The Gospel of Matthew , written around the year 85 or 90 , and using Mark as a source , has an almost identical wording : " From noon on , darkness came over the whole land [ or , earth ] until three in the afternoon . " The author adds dramatic details , including an earthquake and the raising of the dead , which were stock motifs from Jewish apocalyptic literature : " The earth shook , and the rocks were split . The tombs also were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised . " 
 The Gospel of Luke , written around the year 90 and also using Mark as a source , has none of the details added in the Matthew version , moves the tearing of the temple veil to before the death of Jesus , and explains the darkness as a darkening of the sun : 
 It was now about noon , and darkness came over the whole land [ or , earth ] until three in the afternoon , while the sun 's light failed [ or , the sun was eclipsed ] ; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two . 
 It appears that the Luke Gospel originally explained the event as an eclipse . The majority of manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have the Greek phrase " <unk> ho helios " ( " the sun was darkened " ) , but the earliest manuscripts say " tou <unk> <unk> " ( " the sun 's light failed " or " the sun was in eclipse " ) . This earlier version is likely to have been the original one , amended by later scribes to correct what they assumed was an error , since they knew that an eclipse was impossible during Passover . One early Christian commentator even suggested that the text had been deliberately corrupted by opponents of the Church to make it easier to attack . 
 The account of the crucifixion given in the Gospel of John is very different . It takes place on the day of Passover , the crucifixion does not take place until after noon , and there is no mention of darkness , the tearing of the veil , or the raising of the dead . 
 = = Later versions = = 
 = = = Apocryphal writers = = = 
 A number of accounts in apocryphal literature built on the accounts of the crucifixion darkness . The Gospel of Peter , probably from the second century , expanded on the canonical gospel accounts in creative ways . As one writer puts it , " accompanying miracles become more fabulous and the apocalyptic portents are more vivid " . In this version , the darkness which covers the whole of Judaea leads people to go about with lamps believing it to be night . The fourth century Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Pilate and his wife are disturbed by a report of what had happened , and the Judeans he has summoned tell him it was an ordinary solar eclipse . Another text from the fourth century , the purported Report of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius , claimed the darkness had started at the sixth hour , covered the whole world , and during the subsequent evening the full moon resembled blood for the entire night . In a fifth- or sixth @-@ century text by Pseudo @-@ Dionysius the Areopagite , the author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from Heliopolis at the time of the crucifixion . 
 = = = Ancient historians = = = 
 No contemporary references to this darkness have been found outside of the New Testament . Later commentators speculated about a reference in a work by the chronicler <unk> . In the ninth century , the Byzantine historian George Syncellus quoted from the third @-@ century Christian historian Sextus Julius Africanus , who remarked that " <unk> dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse " . It is not known when <unk> lived , and it is unclear whether he himself made any reference to the crucifixion . Tertullian , in his <unk> , told the story of the crucifixion darkness and suggested that the evidence must still be held in the Roman archives . 
 Until the Enlightenment era , the crucifixion darkness story was often used by Christian apologists because they believed it was a rare example of the biblical account being supported by non @-@ Christian sources . When the pagan critic Celsus claimed that Jesus could hardly be a God because he had performed no great deeds , the third @-@ century Christian commentator Origen responded , in Against Celsus , by recounting the darkness , earthquake and opening of tombs . As proof that the incident had happened , he referred to a description by <unk> of Tralles of an eclipse , accompanied by earthquakes felt in other parts of the Empire during the reign of Tiberius ( probably that of 29 CE ) . 
 In his Commentary on Matthew , however , Origen offered a different approach . Answering criticisms that there was no mention of this incident in any of the many non @-@ Christian sources , he insisted that it was local to Palestine , and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside . To suggestions it was merely an eclipse , Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations , such as heavy clouds , drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark , which make no mention of the sun . 
 = = Explanations = = 
 = = = Miracle = = = 
 Because it was known in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during Passover ( solar eclipses require a new moon while Passover only takes place during a full moon ) it was considered a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event . The astronomer Johannes de Sacrobosco wrote , in his The Sphere of the World , " the eclipse was not natural , but , rather , miraculous and contrary to nature " . Modern writers who regard this as a miraculous event tend either to see it as operating through a natural phenomenon — such as volcanic dust or heavy cloud cover — or avoid explanation completely . The Reformation Study Bible , for instance , simply states " This was a supernatural darkness . " 
 = = = Naturalistic explanations = = = 
 The Gospel of Luke account appears to describe the event as an eclipse , and some non @-@ Christian writers dismissed it in these terms . However , the biblical details do not accord with an eclipse : a solar eclipse could not have occurred on or near the Passover , when Jesus was crucified , and would have been too brief to account for three hours of darkness . The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31 @.@ 1 seconds . The only total eclipse visible in Jerusalem in this era fell later in the year , on 24 November 29 CE at 11 : 05 AM . Around the Sea of Galilee , it would have been visible for just one minute and forty @-@ nine seconds , and would have been apparent only to those indoors . 
 In 1983 , Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington argued that the darkness could be accounted for by a partial lunar eclipse that had taken place on that day : lunar eclipses can last much longer than solar ones . Astronomer Bradley E. Schaefer , on the other hand , pointed out that the eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours . Humphreys and Waddington speculated that the reference in the Luke Gospel to a solar eclipse must have been the result of a scribe wrongly amending the text , a claim historian David <unk> describes as " indefensible " . 
 Some writers have explained the crucifixion darkness in terms of <unk> , heavy cloud cover , the aftermath of a volcanic eruption , or a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from March to May . A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an ' oppressive gloom ' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes . 
 = = = Literary creation = = = 
 A common view in modern scholarship is that the account in the synoptic gospels is a literary creation of the gospel writers , intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event . Burton Mack describes it as a fabrication by the author of the Gospel of Mark , while G. B. Caird and Joseph <unk> conclude that the author did not intend the description to be taken literally . W. D. Davies and Dale Allison similarly conclude " It is probable that , without any factual basis , darkness was added in order to wrap the cross in a rich symbol and / or assimilate Jesus to other worthies " . 
 The image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers as a cosmic sign , a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as Philo , Dio Cassius , Virgil , Plutarch and Josephus . Géza Vermes describes the darkness account as " part of the Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord . It is to be treated as a literary rather than historical phenomenon notwithstanding naive scientists and over @-@ eager television documentary makers , tempted to interpret the account as a datable eclipse of the sun . They would be barking up the wrong tree " . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 This sequence plays an important part in the gospel 's literary narrative . The author of Mark 's gospel has been described as operating here " at the peak of his rhetorical and theological powers " . One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the transfiguration ; alternately , Jesus 's earlier discourse about a future tribulation mentions the sun being darkened , and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene . Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation of the crucifixion ; one professor of biblical theology concluded , " it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance . His death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power . " 
 When considering the theological meaning of the event , some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus . Others have seen it as a sign of God 's judgement on the Jewish people , sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70 ; or as symbolising shame , fear , or the mental suffering of Jesus . <unk> compares the event to a contemporary description recorded in Josephus ' Antiquities of the Jews , which recounts " unlawful acts against the gods , from which we believe the very sun turned away , as if it too were loath to look upon the foul deed " . 
 Many writers have adopted an intertextual approach , looking at earlier texts from which the author of the Mark Gospel may have drawn . In particular , parallels have often been noted between the darkness and the prediction in the Book of Amos of an earthquake in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah : " On that day , says the Lord God , I will make the sun go down at noon , and darken the earth in broad daylight " . Particularly in connection with this reference , read as a prophecy of the future , the darkness can be seen as portending the end times . 
 Another likely literary source is the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus , in which Egypt is covered by darkness for three days . It has been suggested that the author of the Matthew Gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source . Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative , with a prophecy regarding mid @-@ day darkness by Jeremiah , and with an end @-@ times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah . 
 Roman literary sources have also been postulated , namely those on the apotheosis of the mythical king Romulus , and about the death of Julius Caesar .

 In traditional artistic representations of the crucifixion , the sun and moon sometimes appear above and to either side of the cross , in allusion to the darkening of the skies .

 Sleight of hand ( also known as prestidigitation or legerdemain ) refers to fine motor skills when used by performing artists in different art forms to entertain or manipulate . It is closely associated with close @-@ up magic , card cheating , card flourishing and stealing . 
 Because of its heavy use and practice by magicians , sleight of hand is often confused as a branch of magic , but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment , as many artists practice sleight of hand without the slightest interest in magic . 
 Sleight of hand pioneers with worldwide acclaim include Dan and Dave , Ricky Jay , David Blaine , David Copperfield , Yann Frisch , Dai Vernon and Tony <unk> . 
 = = Etymology and history = = 
 The word sleight , meaning " the use of dexterity or cunning , especially so as to deceive " , comes from the Old Norse . The phrase sleight of hand means " quick fingers " or " trickster fingers " . Common synonyms from the Latin language include prestidigitation and legerdemain . Seneca the Younger , philosopher of the Silver Age of Latin literature , famously compared rhetoric techniques and illusionist techniques . 
 = = Association with close @-@ up magic = = 
 Sleight of hand is often used in close @-@ up magic , where the sleights are performed with the audience close to the magician , usually in physical contact or within 3 to 4 m ( 9 @.@ 8 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) . This close contact eliminate theories of fake audience members and the use of gimmicks . It makes use of everyday items as props , such as cards , coins , rubber bands , paper , phones and even <unk> . A well @-@ performed sleight looks like an ordinary , natural and completely innocent gesture , change in hand @-@ position or body posture . In addition to manual dexterity , sleight of hand in close @-@ up magic depends on the use of psychology , timing , misdirection , and natural choreography in accomplishing a magical effect . 
 = = Association with stage magic = = 
 Sleight of hand during stage magic performances is not common , as most magic events and stunts are performed with objects visible to a much larger audience , but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers . The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks , with the first typically being done with a member of the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live @-@ recording , allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen . Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows . 
 = = Association with card cheating = = 
 Although being mostly used for entertainment and comedy purposes , sleight of hand is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world . Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming , switching , ditching , and stealing cards from the table . Such techniques include extreme misdirection and years of practice . For these reasons , the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls , and many magicians known around the world are publicly banned from casinos , such as British mentalist and close @-@ up magician Derren Brown , who is banned from every casino in Britain . 
 = = Association with cardistry = = 
 Unlike card tricks done on the streets or on stage and card cheating , cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions , deceit , misdirection and other elements commonly used in card tricks and card cheating . Cardistry , or card flourishes , are always intended to be visually impressive and appear extremely difficult to perform . Card flourishing is often associated with card tricks , but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks . 
 = = Association with card throwing = = 
 The art of card throwing generally consist of throwing standard playing cards with excessively high speed and accuracy , powerful enough to slice fruits like carrots and even melons . Like flourishing , throwing cards are meant to be visibly impressive and does not include magic elements . Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the sleight of hand industry with the release of his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons , which was met with large sales and critical acclaim . Some magic tricks , both close @-@ up and on stage , are heavily connected to throwing cards .

 = Southern Rhodesia in World War I = 
 When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of World War I in August 1914 , settler society in Southern Rhodesia , then administered by the British South Africa Company , received the news with great patriotic enthusiasm . The Company administrator , Sir William Milton , wired the UK government , " All Rhodesia ... ready to do its duty " . Although it supported Britain , the Company was concerned about the possible financial implications for its chartered territory should it make direct commitments to the war effort , particularly at first , so most of the colony 's contribution to the war was made by Southern Rhodesians individually — not only those who volunteered to fight abroad , but also those who remained at home and raised funds to donate food , equipment and other supplies . 
 Starting immediately after the outbreak of war , parties of white Southern Rhodesians paid their own way to England to join the British Army . Most Southern Rhodesians who served in the war enlisted in this way and fought on the Western Front , taking part in many of the major battles with an assortment of British , South African and other colonial units , most commonly the King 's Royal Rifle Corps , which recruited hundreds of men from the colony , and created homogenous Rhodesian platoons . Troopers from Southern Rhodesia became renowned on the Western Front for their marksmanship , a result of their frontier lifestyle . Some of the colony 's men served in the Royal Flying Corps , one of the two predecessors of the Royal Air Force . The Rhodesia Regiment , the Rhodesia Native Regiment and the British South Africa Police served in the African theatre of the conflict , contributing to the South @-@ West African and East African campaigns . 
 Though it was one of the few combatant territories not to raise fighting men through conscription , proportional to white population , Southern Rhodesia contributed more manpower to the British war effort than any other dominion or colony , and more than Britain itself . White troops numbered 5 @,@ 716 , about 40 % of white men in the colony , with 1 @,@ 720 of these serving as commissioned officers . The Rhodesia Native Regiment enlisted 2 @,@ 507 black soldiers , about 30 black recruits scouted for the Rhodesia Regiment , and around 350 served in British and South African units . Over 800 Southern Rhodesians of all races lost their lives on operational service during the war , with many more seriously wounded . 
 The territory 's contributions during the First World War became a major entry in many histories of the colony , and a great source of pride for the white community , as well as for some black Rhodesians . It played a part in the UK government 's decision to grant self @-@ government in 1923 , and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades . When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 , it deliberately did so on Armistice Day , 11 November , and signed the proclamation at 11 : 00 local time . Since the territory 's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980 , the modern government has removed many references to the war , such as memorial monuments and plaques , from public view , regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism . The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War ; the country 's war dead today have no official commemoration , either there or overseas . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the time of World War I ( also known as the First World War or the Great War ) , Southern Rhodesia was administered by the British South Africa Company , which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s . The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23 @,@ 606 in 1911 ( a minority of 3 % ) , while Northern Rhodesia had about 3 @,@ 000 white settlers ( less than half of 1 % ) . With the Company 's charter due to expire in late 1914 , most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war . The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government , which would make Southern Rhodesia a self @-@ governing colony within the British Empire . Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa , which had been formed in 1910 . Following the intervention of the war , the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915 . 
 Before 1914 , Southern Rhodesia 's police force was the British South Africa Police ( BSAP ) , first raised in 1889 and reconstituted into a more permanent form in 1896 . This paramilitary , mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country 's standing army . Organised along military lines , it served in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s , operated on Britain 's side in the Anglo @-@ Boer War of 1899 – 1902 ( alongside the specially @-@ raised Rhodesia Regiment ) , and by 1914 comprised about 1 @,@ 150 men ( including officers ) . Reserves existed in the form of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers , an all @-@ white amateur force with a paper strength of 2 @,@ 000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings . Few doubted the Volunteers ' enthusiasm , but they were not extensively trained or equipped ; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish , most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war . In any case , the Volunteers ' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only .

 = = = Announcement and reception = = = 
 When Britain declared war on Germany at 23 : 00 Greenwich Mean Time on 4 August 1914 , the British Empire 's dominions and colonies automatically became involved as well . Word of this reached the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury during the night . Early on 5 August , the Company administrator Sir William Milton wired Whitehall : " All Rhodesia united in devoted loyalty to King and Empire and ready to do its duty . " A few hours later he officially announced to the populace that Southern Rhodesia was at war . The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers published special editions the same day to spread the news ; it took about half a week for word to reach the whole country , but jingoistic demonstrations began in the major towns almost immediately . 
 In the words of the historian Peter McLaughlin , the Southern Rhodesian settlers " seemed to out @-@ British the British " in their patriotic zeal , so it was to the frustration of many of them that the Company did not immediately commit to any martial action . While it sent supportive messages to Whitehall , the Company felt it could not raise any kind of expeditionary force without first considering the implications for its administrative operations ; as a commercial concern , it was possible for the Company to go bankrupt . Who would foot the bill for war expenditure , its hierarchy pondered : the Company itself , the Rhodesian taxpayers or the British government ? 
 As the local newspapers filled with letters from readers clamouring for Rhodesian troops to be mustered and despatched to Europe post @-@ haste , the administration limited its initial contribution to posting a section of BSAP troopers to the Victoria Falls Bridge to guard against possible German attack from South @-@ West Africa though the Caprivi Strip . In early September , an indignant letter to the Rhodesia Herald from Colonel Raleigh Grey , a major figure in local business , politics and military matters , accused the Company of bringing " a slur on a British country " by doing so little . 
 = = = Rhodesian Reserves = = = 
 A few days after the war began , the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves , an amorphous entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform , as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force . Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons , each bringing 24 volunteers ; three or four of these 25 @-@ man troops made a company . Units representing the Caledonian Society , the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society , the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain . Volunteers could opt to serve overseas , within Rhodesia or only locally ; around 1 @,@ 000 had volunteered in all by 13 August . 
 The Company suggested to the UK government that it might despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe to act as an all @-@ Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front ( in Belgium and France ) , but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa , within the South African forces . When the Company relayed this idea south , the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians , but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments . The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted . Unwilling to wait , some Southern Rhodesian would @-@ be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly , as individuals or in groups . By the end of October 1914 , about 300 were on their way . 
 = = Europe = = 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 In terms of fighting manpower , Southern Rhodesia 's main contribution to World War I was in the trenches of the Western Front . As the white Southern Rhodesians in this theatre joined the British Army separately , at different times and under their own steam ( or were already connected to specific units as reservists ) , they were spread across dozens of regiments , including the Black Watch , the Coldstream Guards , the Grenadier Guards , the Royal Engineers and the Royal Marines , as well as many South African units and others . During the war 's opening months , Southern Rhodesian volunteers who could not afford to travel to England were assisted by a private fund set up by Ernest Lucas Guest , a Salisbury lawyer and Anglo @-@ Boer War veteran who also organised an accompanying recruitment campaign for European service . Guest stopped recruiting at the Company 's request after it created the 1st Rhodesia Regiment , an expeditionary force to South and South @-@ West Africa , in October 1914 . 
 A link developed during the war with the King 's Royal Rifle Corps ( KRRC ) , whose Southern Rhodesian contingent — numbering a few hundred , chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions — was the largest on the Western Front . The connection with this particular corps began as the result of a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914 . The 16th Marquess of Winchester , who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s , was also aboard the ship , returning from a visit to the colony . Encountering Captain John Banks Brady , the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers , the Marquess asked where his party was headed . Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France . The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process , it might be a good idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC , where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the Winchester @-@ based regiment . The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC . A designated Rhodesian platoon , widely referred to thereafter as " the Rhodesian Platoon " , was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at Sheerness , on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent . 
 As a rule , the white Rhodesians overseas combined stridently pro @-@ British attitudes with an even stronger pride in Rhodesia . Many of them saw participation in the war , particularly in distinct " Rhodesian " formations , as a step towards forging a distinctive national identity , like those of Australia and the other more mature British dominions , and building a case for Southern Rhodesian self @-@ government . The existence of an explicitly Rhodesian Platoon in the KRRC endeared the regiment to the Southern Rhodesian public , and attracted many of the colony 's volunteers who arrived in England later in the war ; in time , the KRRC formed further Rhodesian platoons from additional personnel . While the average Rhodesian colonial , living on the frontier of the Empire , was at least casually acquainted with rifles , most Englishmen had never held one . At Sheerness , Brady 's Rhodesian Platoon won a reputation for fine sharpshooting , and set a regimental record score at the shooting range . 
 Once posted to France in December 1914 , the Rhodesian Platoon almost immediately began suffering regular heavy casualties . Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict , so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches , but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often took a few months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength . A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action . When the KRRC 's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives , they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top . Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench ; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele ( two African languages ) instead of English . 
 Trench warfare was a dreadful ordeal for soldiers , and the Southern Rhodesians , coming from the open veld of southern Africa , had a particularly difficult time getting used to the cold and the mud . Brady reported that some of his men had contracted frostbite within 48 hours of reaching the trenches . Despite this , the KRRC 's Rhodesians acquitted themselves well in the eyes of their superiors ; Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Sir Edward Hutton , who wrote a history of the KRRC , commented that the Southern Rhodesian contingent " earned for itself great reputation for valour and good shooting " . Southern Rhodesians became especially valuable to the KRRC as designated snipers , grenadiers , Lewis Gunners and other specialists . While discussing a KRRC sniper section , Hutton singles its Southern Rhodesian members out for their fine marksmanship , commenting that " accustomed to big game shooting , [ they ] particularly excelled in this system of ' snipers ' , and inflicted continual losses upon the enemy " . In their 2008 history of sniping , Pat <unk> and Mark Spicer highlight the prowess of South African and Rhodesian sharpshooters on the Western Front , and claim that one group of 24 southern African colonials collectively accounted for over 3 @,@ 000 German casualties and fatalities . 
 So many Southern Rhodesians were withdrawn from the trenches for officer training that in mid @-@ 1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace those who had been commissioned . A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion , KRRC took part in the " big push " of 1 July 1916 , the first day of the Battle of the Somme , charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning . There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards . On the Somme battlefield itself , Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood , which began on 14 July . This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade 's first engagement , and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances . Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions — about 80 % of the brigade 's personnel were killed , wounded or captured — they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July . By the time of its withdrawal , the South African Brigade , originally numbering 3 @,@ 155 ( 123 officers and 3 @,@ 032 other ranks ) , had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men . Delville Wood was later described by Sir B H Liddell Hart as " the bloodiest battle hell of 1916 " . " God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again , " a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home ; " at times I wished it would come fast , anything to get out of that terrible death @-@ trap and murderous place . " 
 German gas attacks were among the most traumatic experiences for the Southern Rhodesians in Europe . One Rhodesian survivor of a gas attack described the sensation as like " suffocation , [ or ] slow drowning " . The Germans used both disabling agents , such as tear gas and the more severe mustard gas , and lethal chemicals like chlorine and phosgene . Though generally not fatal , gas attacks caused extreme physical discomfort and pain , often to the point where soldiers lost consciousness . Mustard gas in particular caused blistering of the skin , vomiting and internal and external bleeding . The British Army issued gas masks , but according to Brady these did little to help the men . Injuries sustained to the eyes , lungs and nasal passages in gas attacks were often extremely debilitating and lasting , remaining with the men for years after the war . 
 In July 1917 , a KRRC Rhodesian platoon received lofty praise from a senior British officer , who described the colonials as " absolutely first @-@ class soldiers and great gentlemen , every bit as good as soldiers ... as our old Expeditionary Force " . Around the same time , a platoon of Southern Rhodesians in the KRRC took part in an engagement near Nieuwpoort in Flanders , where it and the Northamptonshire Regiment manned positions on the eastern banks of the river Yser . After a heavy artillery bombardment , German infantry and marines charged the British positions and surrounded the Rhodesian platoon . Brutal hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting ensued in which most of the Southern Rhodesians were killed and some were taken prisoner . The Bulawayo Chronicle ran a eulogy for them soon after , comparing their last stand to that of Allan Wilson 's Shangani Patrol in 1893 . Later in 1917 , a Rhodesian platoon in the KRRC fought in the Battle of Passchendaele , near Ypres in western Flanders . 
 The Western Front continued to receive Southern Rhodesian troops right up to the end of the war , including veterans of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment 's campaign in East Africa . During the conflict 's latter stages , the British Army sent some of its Southern Rhodesian officers to the Western Front to promote the colony 's benefits , hoping to encourage emigration there by British servicemen after the war . 
 = = = Salonika = = = 
 The KRRC 's 3rd Battalion , including a platoon of 70 Rhodesians , was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915 . On this comparatively quiet front , they were slowly whittled down over the course of the war : 26 of them remained in January 1917 , and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed . Most of the men had been killed in action , while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians . 
 = = = Aviators = = = 
 Some Southern Rhodesians mustered into the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) , which merged with the Royal Naval Air Service in April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force . Towards the end of the war , the service of airmen from the dominions and colonies was observed by the issuing of shoulder patches denoting the wearer 's country of origin : from October 1918 , Southern Rhodesians received labels marked " <unk> " . One of the territory 's first military aviators was Lieutenant Arthur R H Browne , a fighter pilot from <unk> in the Southern Rhodesian Midlands , who was attached to No. 13 Squadron , RFC . He was killed in action in a dogfight on 5 December 1915 ; his aircraft , donated by the people of Gatooma in western Mashonaland , was Gatooma No. 2 , one of five aeroplanes purchased by Southern Rhodesian public donations . From Dryden Farm , near the south @-@ western border town of Plumtree , came Lieutenant Frank W H Thomas , an RFC combat pilot who won the Military Cross , as well as the French Croix de Guerre ( with palms ) , before he died on 5 January 1918 from wounds attained on operational service . 
 Lieutenant Daniel S " Pat " Judson , born in Bulawayo in 1898 , became the first Rhodesia @-@ born airman in history when he joined the RFC in April 1916 . He was severely wounded while bombing enemy positions in March 1918 , but recovered and remained in the unit until April 1919 . The first flying ace born in Rhodesia was Major George Lloyd , nicknamed " Zulu " , who joined No. 60 Squadron in April 1917 , and won four aerial victories before transferring to No. 40 Squadron in July 1917 , where he won four more . He received the Military Cross in March 1918 for " conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty " , and also won the Air Force Cross later that year . Second Lieutenant David " Tommy " <unk> @-@ Lewis , a born and bred <unk> , was the 80th and final pilot defeated by Manfred von Richthofen , the German ace widely known as the Red Baron . Richthofen downed Lewis just north @-@ east of Villers @-@ Bretonneux on 20 April 1918 ; the Rhodesian 's aircraft caught fire in mid @-@ air , and when it crashed he was thrown from the wreckage . The Baron 's bullets had hit Lewis ' compass , goggles , coat and trouser leg , but he was practically unhurt , having suffered only minor burns . He spent the rest of the war a German prisoner . 
 The Great War airman associated with Southern Rhodesia who ultimately earned the most distinction was Arthur Harris , originally from England , who joined the Royal Flying Corps in late 1915 after serving as a bugler with the 1st Rhodesia Regiment in South @-@ West Africa . Harris alternated between Britain and France during the latter part of the war . He led No. 45 Squadron over the Western Front in 1917 , destroying five German aircraft and winning the Air Force Cross , and afterwards commanded No. 44 Squadron in Britain . Intending to return to Southern Rhodesia after the war , he wore a " <unk> " flash on his uniform during the hostilities , but ended up staying with the RAF as a career officer . He finished the war a major , rose through the ranks during the interwar period and became famous during World War II as " Bomber Harris " , the head of RAF Bomber Command .

 Apart from the capture of <unk> in the Caprivi Strip by a combined force of BSAP and Northern Rhodesia Police on 21 September 1914 , the British South Africa Company 's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month . The South African Prime Minister , the former Boer general Louis Botha , had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South @-@ West Africa without help , so the Imperial garrison had been sent to the Western Front . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Manie Maritz — an ex @-@ Boer commander who now headed a column of Afrikaans @-@ speaking Union troops — defected to the Germans in mid @-@ September , hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old Boer Republics . Botha requested the 500 @-@ man column that the Chartered Company had raised , hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro @-@ British Rhodesians . The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury , and named the 1st Rhodesia Regiment after the unit of Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo @-@ Boer War . Apart from a small contingent of Matabele ( or Ndebele ) scouts , the unit was all white . 
 After six weeks ' training in the capital , the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914 . During its stopover in Bulawayo , it paraded in front of about 90 % of the town 's population ; Plumtree , the last stop before crossing the border , provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet . Notwithstanding these grand farewells , the Maritz Rebellion was all but over by the time the Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at Bloemfontein . The vast majority of South African troops , including most of Boer origin , had remained loyal to the Union government , and the uprising had been quashed . The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein for about a month , then redeployed to Cape Town , where they underwent further training for the South @-@ West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa 's Northern Force , which Botha personally commanded . 
 = = = 1st Rhodesia Regiment in South @-@ West Africa = = = 
 During late December 1914 , Northern Force travelled to the South African exclave of Walvis Bay , about halfway up the coast of German South @-@ West Africa . The 1st Rhodesia Regiment disembarked on 26 December 1914 . 
 Northern Force made up the northern prong of a pincer movement designed by Botha to encircle the German forces in South @-@ West Africa . Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State ( the latter coming over the deserts of Bechuanaland ) . The principal target was Windhoek , the capital of South @-@ West Africa . The field of operations was arid and barren in the extreme ; water was a precious commodity , so the South Africans and Southern Rhodesians brought thousands of tons of it with them . In the 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of desert between Walvis Bay and Windhoek , temperatures could rise to above 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) in the daytime , then drop below freezing at night , all while desert winds blew sand and dust into every bodily and mechanical orifice . Germany based much of its defensive strategy in South @-@ West Africa around the assumption that no enemy commander could feasibly attempt to advance across the desert from Walvis Bay to Windhoek , but Botha resolved to do exactly that . 
 The South African offensive from Walvis Bay began in February 1915 , when Northern Force took Swakopmund — the nearest German coastal settlement , about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north — without facing major resistance . The Germans almost immediately retreated , leaving behind explosive booby traps and other improvised weapons . The 1st Rhodesia Regiment first engaged the Germans while Northern Force moved east across the desert , taking part in a number of minor skirmishes and suffering its first two fatalities in a German ambush . To overcome the natural difficulties of the desert terrain , Botha used fast @-@ moving mounted or mechanised troops rather than regular infantry , so the Southern Rhodesian contingent played little part in the main advance on Windhoek . The Rhodesians guarded the construction of a railway inland for much of the campaign , but participated in Northern Force 's victory over the Germans at <unk> , losing Lieutenant Hollingsworth ( killed in action ) and five enlisted men ( wounded ) . Windhoek surrendered to Botha in July 1915 , effectively ending the South @-@ West African front of the war . The local German population did not embark on a guerrilla campaign after Windhoek 's fall . 
 The 1st Rhodesia Regiment was soon posted back to Cape Town , where many of the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of fighting in South @-@ West Africa , and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe . Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed , but failed to convince most of them ; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded due to a lack of personnel . The majority of the South @-@ West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army , while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service . 
 = = East Africa = = 
 German East Africa , acquired by Germany during the 1880s , covered roughly 900 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 350 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , and by 1914 was home to about 5 @,@ 000 white settlers , most of whom were of German origin . German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men , and 2 @,@ 450 askaris ( native soldiers ) ; police numbered 45 whites and 2 @,@ 154 askaris . Because of the British Royal Navy 's domination of the Indian Ocean , German East Africa was largely isolated from outside help . It therefore fought a war of improvisation , judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy . During the conflict , its military strength grew to a peak of 3 @,@ 300 whites and anywhere between 15 @,@ 000 and 30 @,@ 000 askaris , all commanded by Generalmajor Paul von Lettow @-@ Vorbeck . 
 = = = 2nd Rhodesia Regiment = = = 
 Based around the overflow of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment , a core of personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914 . This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ( 2RR ) during December 1914 and January 1915 . The 1st Rhodesia Regiment 's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist ; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines , and some resolved that they might have to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so . Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony 's manpower , recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat , in Africa , if they signed up for the new unit . The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men , the same as the 1st . Thirty black scouts , recruited in Southern Rhodesia , were also attached to the regiment . 
 Because it was raised with less urgency , the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment received better training than the 1st . The course lasted eight weeks , a fortnight longer than the original regiment 's training period , and focused heavily on route marching , parade drill , and , in particular , marksmanship — recruits were trained to shoot accurately at ranges of up to 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) . The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment left Salisbury on 8 March 1915 , moving east to the port of Beira in Portuguese Mozambique , from where they sailed to Mombasa in British Kenya , on German East Africa 's north @-@ eastern flank . Travelling aboard the SS <unk> , the battalion disembarked in Kenya less than a week after leaving Salisbury . It was immediately sent inland to the operational area around Mount Kilimanjaro , within sight of which it set up camp . On 20 March , the regiment was inspected by General J M Stewart of the Indian Army . " I had expected to see a regiment that would require some training , " Stewart said ; " I will pay you the highest compliment by sending you to the front today . " So began the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment 's contribution to the East African Campaign . 
 The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment operated with some success during its first year on the front . It usually defeated German units that it encountered , but the Germans , using proto @-@ guerrilla tactics , tended to retreat before they could be overrun . Though generally outnumbered and outgunned throughout the campaign , the Germans had the advantage early on of longer @-@ range artillery than the British ; from July to August 1916 , 2RR was prevented from moving out of the Kenyan town of <unk> for nearly a month by German bombardment . The huge marching distances , difficult terrain and uncertainty of surroundings meant that the regiment 's men were forced to develop enormous stamina and resilience if they were not to be invalided home . 
 Tropical disease killed or rendered ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did ; at times the regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments , including trench fever , blackwater fever , dysentery , pneumonia , sleeping sickness and many others . The 1 @,@ 038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2 @,@ 272 times , and there were 10 @,@ 626 incidences of illness — in other words , the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times . In January 1917 , only 91 of the regiment 's men were considered fit for duty ; it was no longer an effective fighting force , and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it . It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month . Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917 , receiving a tumultuous welcome , but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards . 
 The Company briefly considered sending a revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front , but the British Army promptly rejected this idea , saying that the unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of its small size . The battalion was thereupon dissolved , but most of its remaining men went to war in Europe anyway , generally with South African units . 
 = = = Rhodesia Native Regiment = = = 
 By late 1915 , British forces in the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , on German East Africa 's south @-@ western flank , were severely stretched . Disease was a constant curse , decimating the ranks . Francis Drummond Chaplin , the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia , offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1 @,@ 000 askaris , and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916 ; however , there was then disagreement regarding who would foot the bill for the organisation of this enterprise . After this was resolved in April 1916 — the Company agreed to pay , conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office — recruitment began in May . 
 Initial recruitment efforts principally targeted the Matabele , who made up about 20 % of the colony 's black population , because they enjoyed a popular reputation among whites for being great warriors ; the unit was therefore originally called the " Matabele Regiment " . This was changed to the more inclusive " Rhodesia Native Regiment " ( RNR ) on 15 May 1916 , as the ranks proved to be more diverse than expected , and included large numbers of Mashonas and other ethnicities . In particular , a disproportionately high number of volunteers came from the Kalanga tribe , a numerically diminutive community in the colony 's south @-@ west . The RNR was organised largely along linguistic and cultural lines , with companies and platoons of Matabele , Mashona , <unk> and others . White officers attached to the unit were often recruited because they knew an African language , or could give orders in <unk> , a pidgin of English and several African tongues often referred to by whites of the time as " kitchen <unk> " . The ranks ' diversity sometimes led to confusion when messages or directives were not properly understood . It became common for black troopers accused of disobeying or ignoring commands to claim ignorance of the language in which they had been ordered . 
 Commanded by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel A J Tomlinson , the RNR , comprising 426 askaris and about 30 white officers , left Salisbury in July 1916 for Beira . They continued on to Zomba , in Nyasaland , where they were to receive further training closer to the field of operations . When they arrived , the local situation had shifted significantly , so the RNR instead went to New <unk> , in German East Africa , just north of Lake Nyasa . At New <unk> the regiment went through a short training course , and was issued with six machine guns . When the unit 's training period ended in October 1916 it was divided ; one company of RNR men went to <unk> , about 250 kilometres ( 160 mi ) north @-@ east , while the rest went 250 kilometres ( 160 mi ) south to <unk> , on the north banks of Lake Nyasa , from where they moved 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) east to Songea , which they were ordered to " hold ... until reinforced " . Apart from a company of men sent to patrol the road back to <unk> , the RNR proceeded to garrison Songea . 
 The Germans , who had left Songea only a few weeks before , sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916 — 250 askaris marched from Likuyu , and 180 more ( with two machine guns ) set off from Kitanda . The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road , and at <unk> attacked the advance guard , which was commanded by Sergeant ( later Lieutenant ) Frederick Charles Booth . The Rhodesians were caught by surprise , and many panicked , running about and firing randomly . Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived . The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea . During this contact , Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in the open , and brought him back alive ; for this and subsequent actions , Booth received the Victoria Cross in June 1917 . 
 The German column from Kitanda reached Songea early in the morning on 12 November 1916 , and unsuccessfully attempted a frontal assault on the well @-@ entrenched Rhodesian positions . After the German column from Likuyu arrived in the afternoon , the Germans laid siege to Songea for 12 days before retreating towards Likuyu on the 24th . The Rhodesians were relieved the following day by a South African unit . The RNR then moved back to <unk> , on the other side of Lake Nyasa , from where they sailed to the German East African town of <unk> , where they were reunited with the RNR contingent that had gone to <unk> . This second column had ambushed a group of Germans , who were moving towards Northern Rhodesia with a naval gun salvaged from SMS Königsberg ( which had been sunk at Rufiji Delta about a year before ) ; after pocketing the Germans , the Rhodesians captured both them and the naval gun . 
 In Southern Rhodesia , Company officials judged the RNR to have been a success so far , and so decided in January 1917 to raise a second battalion . The unit already in the field was at this time designated 1st Battalion , abbreviated to " 1RNR " , while the new formation was called 2nd Battalion , or " 2RNR " . Recruitment was soon under way . Conscious of the difficulty that had been found in persuading rural Mashonas and Matabele to join the 1st Battalion in 1916 , organisers for 2RNR principally targeted black men from other countries , in particular migrant workers from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia ; <unk> eventually made up nearly half of the regiment . By the start of March , about 1 @,@ 000 recruits were training in Salisbury . Meanwhile , 1RNR was instructed to guard the <unk> Pass , near the border with Northern Rhodesia , to prevent a column of Germans from threatening the settlements of Abercorn and Fife . When the Germans slipped through , the Rhodesians were pulled back to a position between the two towns and instructed to defend either one as circumstances dictated . The Germans did not launch an attack , however , instead setting up camp in their own territory at <unk> . 
 The Southern Rhodesian commanders planned to destroy the German column by taking advantage of the regional geography ; the Germans had Lake <unk> to their back , and the rivers Songwe and <unk> on their respective left ( eastern ) and right flanks , effectively hemming them in if they were attacked . The plan was that elements of 1RNR would hold the <unk> while a battalion of the King 's African Rifles ( KAR ) manned the Songwe ; the rest of 1RNR would then push the Germans back towards the lake . But Tomlinson interpreted his orders as requiring immediate action , and attacked before the two flanking lines were in place on the rivers . The offensive had some successes at first , even though Tomlinson was outnumbered , but the 450 Germans , armed with three Königsberg field guns and 14 machine guns , soon withdrew to the higher ground at St Moritz Mission . The Germans counterattacked over the following week . Colonel R E Murray , who commanded a column of BSAP men about 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) away , did not assist Tomlinson , and 1RNR took great losses while repulsing the attack : 58 RNR men were killed , and the Germans captured three Rhodesian machine guns . Tomlinson was blamed by most for the debacle , but he insisted for years afterwards that he had only been following orders from Murray to hold his ground . He expressed incredulity at Murray 's failure to reinforce him . An enquiry into the matter was avoided when Tomlinson was wounded and invalided home soon after the battle . 
 On 5 April 1917 , 1RNR crossed the Songwe River into German East Africa and advanced south @-@ east towards Kitanda . It moved up the winding Lupa River , crossing it at each turn , for 53 days , and by mid @-@ June was 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north of its target . When it was then ordered to backtrack north to <unk> , it covered the 420 kilometres ( 260 mi ) in 16 days . Several scholars highlight the distances marched by the RNR , and comment that their physical endurance must have been remarkable , particularly given the speed at which they moved . " One can only marvel at the hardiness and fortitude of these men who matter @-@ of @-@ factly marched distances unthinkable to modern Western soldiers , " the historian Alexandre Binda writes . McLaughlin contrasts the RNR 's black troopers with the white soldiers of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment , commenting that the former proved far more resilient to tropical diseases ( though not immune ) , and amazed white observers by not just adapting to the difficult East African conditions , but often marching 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) in a day . In June 1917 , Sergeant Rita ( or Lita ) , a black non @-@ commissioned officer later described by Tomlinson as " a splendid soldier " , received the highest award ever given to an RNR askari , the Distinguished Conduct Medal , " for conspicuous gallantry in action on many occasions . His example and influence with his men is incalculable " . 
 The 1st Battalion harassed the constantly moving German flying column during August and September 1917 . Two Military Medals were won by RNR soldiers during this time : Sergeant Northcote rescued a wounded askari under German fire in late August , and a few days later Corporal Suga , himself lightly injured , dragged his wounded commanding officer Lieutenant Booth out of the open and into cover . The 2nd Battalion , comprising Major Jackson at the head of 585 askaris and 75 whites , left Salisbury on 16 September 1917 , and joined the front on 16 October , when it arrived at <unk> on the north @-@ eastern shore of Lake Nyasa , intending to ultimately merge with 1RNR . After 1RNR spent two months garrisoning <unk> and 2RNR underwent further training , the two forces joined on 28 January 1918 ( becoming known as the 2nd Rhodesia Native Regiment ) , and immediately made their way south in pursuit of Lettow @-@ Vorbeck 's Germans , who were by now down to an effective strength of less than 2 @,@ 000 , and moving through Portuguese Mozambique . 
 In late May 1918 , the two @-@ year service contracts signed by the original 500 RNR volunteers expired , and the majority of those who had not already been discharged — just under 400 men — went home . While passing through Umtali on their way to Salisbury , the soldiers encountered the RNR 's original commanding officer , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Tomlinson , whom they promptly mobbed , excitedly chanting <unk> , <unk> ( which roughly means " chief " in Sindebele ) . In the capital , the RNR men were met at the railway station by thousands of people , including a number of prominent government , military and religious figures . Chaplin , the territorial administrator , gave a speech in which he applauded the troops for " upholding the good name of Rhodesia " and for having played " no insignificant part in depriving the Germans of their power in Africa " . 
 In Mozambique , the RNR encountered Lettow @-@ Vorbeck 's supply column near <unk> on 22 May 1918 . It wiped it out ( capturing two German officers , two German askaris , 34 Portuguese askaris and 252 carriers ) , but as the supply column had been marching between the main German column and its rearguard , Lettow @-@ Vorbeck was then able to attack the RNR from both sides . The contact lasted until darkness fell , and the RNR held its position . Lettow @-@ Vorbeck then moved further south , with the RNR following . This pursuit continued for the rest of the war , with Lettow @-@ Vorbeck avoiding contacts so far as was possible and constantly resupplying his men by briefly occupying isolated towns . The RNR chased the German column for over 3 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 200 mi ) around Mozambique and the eastern districts of Northern Rhodesia , but never caught up with him . After Lettow @-@ Vorbeck formally surrendered at Abercorn on 25 November 1918 , the RNR returned to Salisbury , where the men were discharged during 1919 . The regiment existed on paper for two more years before it was formally disbanded in February 1921 .

 = = = Home service and conscription debate = = = 
 Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I were all volunteers . Particularly during the war 's early stages , not all male settlers of fighting age were expected to abandon their civilian lives for service abroad . Many of them were in vital industries like mining , and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers , so at least at first , only bachelors in non @-@ essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up . The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment , raised in early 1915 , explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone . Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves ; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty , and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up . 
 The idea of conscription ran contrary to British political tradition , but the sheer scale of the Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916 . The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers broadcast the news in special editions . While some settlers supported the extension of the same system to white Southern Rhodesians , it was also opposed in many quarters . The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations , crucial to the colonial economy , while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons . Some , mindful of John Chilembwe 's <unk> uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915 , felt that it was necessary to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s . 
 By late 1916 , most settlers in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so . To free up white manpower , some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas . In 1917 , the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both during the war and thereafter ; its report , released in February 1918 , described reliance on volunteers as inefficient , and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites , even after the war ( no mention was made of using black troops in the future ) . The Company published proposals the following month to register all white males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription , but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent , particularly from farmers . In the face of this opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice . 
 = = = Economic impact = = = 
 The British South Africa Company had reservations about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia 's resources to the war effort , in part because of its desire to keep the colonial economy operating . There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war , but not on the same scale as in Britain . The retail sector suffered , prices for many basic day @-@ to @-@ day items rose sharply , and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war , but mining , the industry on which Rhodesia 's economic viability hinged , continued to operate successfully , despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower . The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916 , and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal <unk> . A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal , tungsten , near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917 . 
 Southern Rhodesia 's other main economic arm , farming , performed less strongly during the war , partly because the Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines at the behest of British officials . Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war , surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops . While these conclusions were on the whole accurate , logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported , and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour . There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain , but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact . One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter , which first reached England in February 1917 . 
 The war began to adversely affect the economy in late 1917 . The Company threatened petrol rationing in November 1917 , and in early 1918 it raised the colonial income tax to help balance the books . By the end of the hostilities the Company had spent £ 2 million on the war effort , most of which was covered by the Rhodesian taxpayers ; the Company covered some of the expenditure itself , and also received a small amount of financial aid from the UK government . 
 = = = Propaganda and public opinion = = = 
 Mass media on both sides in the conflict tried to motivate their respective populations and justify the war 's continuation by creating an image of the enemy so grotesque and savage that surrender became unthinkable . Like the major newspapers in Britain , the Rhodesia Herald and the Bulawayo Chronicle became key propaganda tools , regularly printing stories of German atrocities , massacres and other war crimes alongside articles simply entitled " War Stories " that told of British Army soldiers carrying out deeds of Herculean bravery . Anti @-@ German sentiment abounded in the territory throughout the conflict , and periodically intensified , often concurrently with the reporting of particularly unsavoury incidents . 
 During the initial peak of <unk> , which lasted the first few months of the conflict , many German and Austrian men of military age who lived in Rhodesia were arrested ( officially as " prisoners of war " ) and sent to internment camps in South Africa . Gertrude Page , one of the colony 's most famous novelists , wrote an open letter in response , vouching for the loyalty of a young German in her employ , and received a number of replies accusing her of being unpatriotic . The second period of intensification began following the sinking of the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania by a German U @-@ boat on 7 May 1915 . The Rhodesia Herald ran an editorial soon after calling on the Company administration to intern all remaining German and Austrian residents and to close their businesses . A town assembly in Umtali sent the administrator a resolution asking him to confiscate all property in the colony owned by subjects of Germany and Austria within 48 hours " in view of German barbarity " . Most of Southern Rhodesia 's remaining German and Austrian residents were soon sent to the camps in South Africa . 
 Further periods of intensified anti @-@ German feeling in the Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse Edith Cavell in Belgium in October 1915 ( " the Crowning Crime " , the Bulawayo Chronicle called it ) , the escalation of bombing raids by German Zeppelins on British cities during 1917 , and the British reportage the same year of the <unk> atrocity story — that the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses from both sides to make products such as nitroglycerine and lubricants . 
 A small elite of black urbanites , mostly raised and educated at Christian missions , existed in Southern Rhodesia by the time of the war , and these generally identified themselves strongly with settler society and , by extension , the war effort . But the vast majority of black people in the colony retained their traditional tribal lifestyles of rural subsistence farming , and for most of them , as McLaughlin comments , the war " could have been fought between aliens from different planets for all their connection with events in Europe " . Some felt obliged to " fight for their country " , seeing the travails of Rhodesia and the Empire as their own also , but the great bulk of tribal public opinion was detached , seeing the conflict as a " white man 's war " that did not concern them . Those who favoured the latter line of thinking cared not so much about the conflict itself but more about how its course might affect them specifically . For example , widespread interest was aroused soon after the outbreak of war when rumours began to fly between the rural black communities that the Company planned to conscript them . News of the Maritz Rebellion prompted a fresh rumour among the Matabele that Company officials might confiscate tribal livestock to feed the white troops going south . None of this actually occurred . 
 The Chartered Company 's native commissioners began to fear a possible tribal rebellion during early 1915 . Herbert Taylor , the chief native commissioner , believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people to emulate the Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland , and telling them ( falsely ) that the British were exterminating the natives there . There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia , but the Company still took precautions . Aware that Mashona <unk> ( spirit mediums ) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s , the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any <unk> who gained significant popularity . 
 The only real threat of a black rebellion in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916 , immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment . Company officials attempted to make clear that the RNR comprised volunteers only , and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea — some , including Chief <unk> , attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war — but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit . Chief <unk> , in <unk> district , briefly threatened insurrection , issuing rifles to 100 men , but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self @-@ evident that conscription was not happening . Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up , including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £ 4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps ' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans . Matthew <unk> , founder of the <unk> Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland , received six months ' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR on the grounds that the British had , he said , committed crimes against God in 1913 . 
 The colony 's small Afrikaner community was split on the issue of war . Some supported the United Kingdom out of loyalty to Rhodesia , but others were still bitter about the Anglo @-@ Boer War and showed little interest in fighting the Germans . In the rural areas , where Afrikaner nationalism was strongest , the Germans were perceived by some Boer farmers as potential liberators from British domination . Southern Rhodesian Afrikaners were often accused of undermining the British war effort . While some leaders of the community publicly came out in support of the war and offered to provide troops , others put pressure on Afrikaans @-@ speakers not to volunteer . When recruitment for the Rhodesia Native Regiment began in 1916 , there were reports of potential black recruits being urged not to join up by their Afrikaans @-@ speaking employers . 
 = = = Women = = = 
 As is common in frontier societies , the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male : at the time of the First World War , white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one . Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties , most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family . The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war , in marked contrast to her British counterpart , who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war . In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred : there were no munitions factories , and the idea of women working down the country 's mines was not considered practical . Some white farmers ' wives took over management of the land in their husbands ' absence , but this was quite unusual . 
 The contribution to the war made by Southern Rhodesia 's white female population generally comprised organising and running donation drives , comforts committees and other similar enterprises . They sent the troops " comforts parcels " , which contained balaclavas , mittens and scarves that they had knitted , as well as newspapers , soap , food ( including cakes and sweets ) , and minor luxuries . These packages did much to raise the morale of the men , particularly those who were in German captivity . Women were also largely responsible for handling mail between Rhodesian soldiers and their relatives and friends back home . After the armistice , they organised financial assistance for those discharged Southern Rhodesian men in England who could not afford to come home , and arranged visits for those convalescing in English hospitals . 
 As in Britain , some Southern Rhodesian women during the war presented men not wearing military uniform with white feathers ( symbolising cowardice ) . This campaign often went awry , as many of the men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service . In 1916 , hoping to save them further harassment , the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors . 
 Black women played a minor role in units such as the Rhodesia Native Regiment , accompanying the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking . Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers . Officers tolerated the presence of these women in the interest of morale , aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead to mutiny . 
 = = = Donations and funds = = = 
 Southern Rhodesian settlers set up a number of wartime funds , including funds to aid war victims , funds to provide the troops with tobacco and other supplies , funds to assist orphans and widows , funds to buy aeroplanes , and others . These raised about £ 200 @,@ 000 in all . Much of this went to the Prince of Wales National Relief Fund in Britain , which was founded when the war started ; Southern Rhodesian branches of the fund were promptly organised in several towns and ultimately consolidated into the Rhodesian War Relief Fund . This body donated 25 % of its receipts to the Prince of Wales Fund and 75 % to local concerns . 
 The Tobacco Fund , set up in September 1914 , was particularly successful . Public donors bought Southern Rhodesian tobacco , cigarettes and pipe tobacco to send to the British forces . This was intended not only to comfort the troops , but also to advertise the prospect of post @-@ war emigration to Rhodesia . The labels on the tobacco tins depicted a map of Africa with the sun shining on Rhodesia , accompanied by the slogan " The World 's Great Sunspot " . In a similar vein , " Sunspot " was the name given to the Rhodesian cigarettes that British soldiers received . During the war , British and colonial soldiery collectively chewed and smoked 59 @,@ 955 two @-@ ounce ( 57 g ) tins of donated Southern Rhodesian tobacco , 80 @,@ 584 two @-@ ounce tins of equivalent pipe tobacco , and 4 @,@ 004 @,@ 000 Sunspot cigarettes ( in packs of 10 ) . Another similar undertaking saw six tons ( roughly 6 @,@ 100 kg ) of local citrus fruits sent to wounded British Army personnel in South Africa and England . 
 Starting in July 1915 , Southern Rhodesians raised funds to buy aeroplanes for the Royal Flying Corps . The colony ultimately bought three aircraft , each of which cost £ 1 @,@ 500 — they were named Rhodesia Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 . Residents of the town of Gatooma also set up their own drive , which funded the purchase of two more planes , Gatooma Nos. 1 and 2 . 
 The black elite in the towns donated to the settlers ' patriotic funds and organisations , and also set up their own . A war fundraising tea organised by black <unk> in early March 1915 boasted entertainment in the form of a black choir , as well as the presence of Taylor and a junior native commissioner , each of whom gave speeches in English , Sindebele and Shona . Rural black people , by contrast , did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds , and misinterpreted encouragement to do so as being threatened with a new tax . When the Matabele chief <unk> began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915 , also urging other chiefs to do the same , he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund 's purpose and the voluntary nature of contributing , but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money . The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter . 
 The Kalanga , a small community in the south @-@ west that provided a disproportionately large number of volunteers for the Rhodesia Native Regiment , also proved conspicuous for their extremely generous financial donations ; in June 1915 , they collectively donated £ 183 , " a staggering sum " , the historian Timothy Stapleton comments , to the Prince of Wales Fund . 
 = = = Flu pandemic = = = 
 The 1918 flu pandemic , often referred to at the time as " Spanish flu " , spread quickly into Southern Rhodesia from South Africa in October 1918 . A week after the first case was reported in Salisbury , over 1 @,@ 000 people were infected . Public buildings in the towns were converted into makeshift hospital wards , appeals were put out for trained nurses to attend the sick , and soup kitchens were set up to feed children whose parents were too ill to look after them . Newspapers in the colony published basic instructions on how to deal with the disease . The mine compounds , where hundreds of black labourers lived and worked together in close proximity , were worst affected . The whole country was ultimately infected , with even the most remote villages reporting deaths . Many members of the Rhodesia Native Regiment were infected , and 76 of them died from the disease having survived the war . By the time the pandemic had ended in Southern Rhodesia around mid @-@ November 1918 , thousands had been killed . 
 = = End of the war , aftermath and statistics = = 
 News of the armistice on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia the same day , and was announced to the town of Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the Castle Brewery . Hysterical street parties started almost immediately , and in the evening the people let off fireworks and lit a huge bonfire on Salisbury kopje . Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued uninterrupted for over 48 hours . Smaller towns marked the armistice with their own celebratory functions and events . 
 Once the frivolities had ended , minds turned to post @-@ war policy , and particularly how soldiers returning from Europe would be reintegrated into society . The Company had already , in 1916 , set aside 250 @,@ 000 acres ( 100 @,@ 000 ha ) of farmland to be given free of charge to white war veterans . In early 1919 it set up a government department to help returning men find work . Many former soldiers failed to find jobs , and some remained unemployed for years after they returned home . Some of the more seriously wounded from the European theatre never came back at all , instead remaining in England because of the better medical facilities and public benefits . Demobilised Western Front veterans began to arrive back in Rhodesia in January 1919 , and continued to do so for nearly a year afterwards . On 30 May 1919 , the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council passed a resolution thanking the territory 's veterans . 
 The Southern Rhodesian tribal chiefs collectively sent their own statement to King George V. 
 Proportional to white population , Southern Rhodesia had contributed more personnel to the British armed forces in World War I than any of the Empire 's dominions or colonies , and more than Britain itself . About 40 % of white males in the colony , 5 @,@ 716 men , put on uniform , with 1 @,@ 720 doing so as commissioned officers . Black Southern Rhodesians were represented by the 2 @,@ 507 soldiers who made up the Rhodesia Native Regiment , the roughly 350 who joined the British East Africa Transport Corps , British South Africa Police Mobile Column and South African Native Labour Corps , and the few dozen black scouts who served with the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments in South @-@ West and East Africa . Southern Rhodesians killed in action or on operational duty numbered over 800 , counting all races together — more than 700 of the colony 's white servicemen died , while the Rhodesia Native Regiment 's black soldiers suffered 146 fatalities . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Accounts of white Southern Rhodesian soldiers ' wartime experiences started to be published in the 1920s . The conflict became a key entry in many national histories , though the role played by black troops was often minimised in these accounts . The colony 's wartime contributions became a source of great pride for much of the Southern Rhodesian white community , as well as for some black Africans ; whites were particularly proud that they had had the highest enlistment rate in the British Empire during the war . A national war memorial , a stone obelisk , 50 feet ( 15 m ) high , was funded by public donations and built in Salisbury in 1919 . Soldiers , one black and one white , were depicted in relief on plaques on each side ; the inscriptions below read " 1914 – 1918 — We fought and died for our King . " Five years later , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel J A Methuen organised the erection on a kopje near Umtali of a stone cross , 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) tall , to memorialise the country 's fallen black soldiers . This monument remains to this day , as does the bronze plaque at its foot , which reads " To the Glory of God and in Memory of Africans Who Fell . 1914 – 1918 . " 
 Southern Rhodesia 's contributions to the Imperial war effort helped it to become regarded by Britain as more mature and deserving of responsible government , which Whitehall granted in 1923 . The territory was made a self @-@ governing colony , just short of full dominion status . Charged with its own defence , Salisbury introduced the selective conscription of white males in 1926 , and reformed the Rhodesia Regiment the following year . The territory 's association with the King 's Royal Rifle Corps endured in the form of affiliation between the KRRC and the Rhodesia Regiment 's new incarnation , which adopted aspects of the KRRC uniform and a similar regimental insignia . The new Rhodesia Regiment was granted the original 's World War I battle honours and colours by George V in 1929 . 
 In World War II , Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically stood behind the UK , symbolically declaring war on Germany in support of Britain before any other colony or dominion . Over 26 @,@ 000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War , making the colony once more the largest contributor of manpower , proportional to white population , in all of the British Empire and Commonwealth . As in World War I , Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army , Royal Navy and Royal Air Force . Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC , and the Rhodesian African Rifles , raised in 1940 , were in many ways a resurrection of the Rhodesia Native Regiment . Military aviation , already associated with the colony following the First World War , became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second , with the colony providing No. 44 , No. 237 and No. 266 Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force , as well as training in Southern Rhodesia for 8 @,@ 235 Allied airmen . 
 By the 1960s , Southern Rhodesians ' service on Britain 's behalf in the World Wars , particularly the Second , was an integral part of the colony 's national psyche . The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter @-@ insurgency operations in Malaya , Aden and Cyprus , as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait . The colonial government 's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November , Armistice Day , in an attempt to emphasise the territory 's prior war record on Britain 's behalf . The proclamation was signed at 11 : 00 local time , during the customary two @-@ minute silence to remember the fallen . 
 Since the country 's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980 , Robert Mugabe 's administration has pulled down many monuments and plaques making reference to the fallen of the First and Second World Wars , perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for . This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company 's dead of the Matabele Wars , as well as those memorialising members of the Rhodesian Security Forces killed during the Bush War of the 1970s . Many Zimbabweans today see their nation 's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that had more to do with the white community than the indigenous black majority , and most have little interest in its contributions to those conflicts . 
 The country 's fallen of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration , either in Zimbabwe or overseas . The national war memorial obelisk still stands , but the relief sculptures and inscriptions have been removed . The stone cross monument near Mutare ( as Umtali is now called ) is one of the few memorials that remains intact and in its place , atop what is now called Cross Kopje ; its meaning has been largely forgotten .

 Stewie is entranced by a British television program entitled Jolly Farm Revue , a colorful children 's show featuring several imaginary characters . Lamenting his future in Quahog , Stewie decides to travel to " Jolly Farm " and live there forever . Desperate , he goes to the local airport and sneaks aboard a transatlantic flight , intending to travel to London , and to find the BBC studios where Jolly Farm Revue is filmed . Brian tries to stop Stewie from leaving Rhode Island , and follows him on board the plane . When he finally finds Stewie , the flight takes off and lands in the Middle East .

 The episode was written by Daniel Palladino , his first official episode for the series , an executive producer for the show . In addition , the episode was directed by series regular Dan Povenmire , in his fourth episode directing for the season ; the first three being " One If by Clam , Two If by Sea " , " To Love and Die in Dixie " , and " Brian Wallows and Peter 's Swallows " . 
 " Road to Europe " is the second episode of the " Road to ... " hallmarks of the series , which have aired throughout various seasons of the show , and is the second " Road to ... " episode to be directed by Povenmire . The episodes are a parody of the seven Road to ... comedy films starring Bing Crosby , Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour . The episode was inspired by the 1941 film Road to Morocco , including its musical number " ( We 're off on the ) Road to Morocco " , which was previously parodied by the two characters , then with alternate lyrics , in the Family Guy episode " Road to Rhode Island " . Fans originally believed that the original title of this episode was " Road to Baghdad " , but in an interview with IGN MacFarlane stated that it was not the case . 
 In addition to the regular cast , the episode featured guest appearances by comedian Andy Dick , actor and director Jon Favreau , actor Sean Flynn , actress and singer Lauren Graham , actress Michelle Horn and voice actor Wally Wingert . It also guest starred Kiss members Gene Simmons , Paul Stanley , Ace Frehley , and Peter Criss as themselves . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Every member in the rock band Kiss guest starred in the episode as themselves . " Road to Europe " features several cultural references . Brian compares Stewie 's look with Charlie Brown ; Stewie responds by comparing him with Charlie Brown 's dog Snoopy ; both these characters are from the comic strip Peanuts . At the Kiss concert , the song that the band plays , and the one that Lois does not know the lyrics to , is the single " Rock and Roll All Nite " . In the song Stewie and Brian sing , the Marquis de Sade , singer Ricky Martin and actress Phylicia Rashad are mentioned . Brian also uses Triumph , the Insult Comic Dog 's catch phrase , " For me to poop on " to insult Stewie . 
 While riding a tour bus in Germany , Brian looks at a history book that has no information regarding German history from 1939 – 1945 ; the years on which World War II started and ended . Brian questions the tour guide about the dates when Germany invaded Poland , but the guide denies that it happened . Brian keeps insisting until the guide yells " Sie werden sich <unk> ! Sie werden <unk> sein ! Sie werden nicht <unk> Deutschland ! " , literally meaning " You will sit down ! You will be quiet ! You will not insult Germany ! " while making the Nazi salute with his left hand . The last sentence is grammatically incorrect , as the proper German statement would be , " Sie werden Deutschland nicht <unk> ! " At the beginning of the episode , the credits are presented with title cards containing images of Brian and Stewie passing by various iconic places in Europe . These include France 's Eiffel Tower , Italy 's Leaning Tower of Pisa and a venetian gondola , the United Kingdom 's Stonehenge and Greece 's Parthenon . Other iconic items shown include the Union Flag and the Pope .

 Reviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive . Critic Ahsan Haque of IGN placed " Road to Europe " in the top ten of Stewie and Brian 's Greatest Adventures , ranking it fifth . Haque noted that the episode is not as entertaining as many of the other Stewie and Brian adventures , but the song included in the episode , " You and I Are So Awfully Different " made it worthy of an appearance on the list . " Road to Europe " is the lowest ranked Road to ... episode on the list with " Road to Germany " at number four , " Road to Rupert " at number three , " Road to the Multiverse " at number two and " Road to Rhode Island " ranked as the best . Television critic Ramsey Isler , also of IGN , commented positively about the episode in his review of the eighth season episode " Go Stewie , Go " , which contained an American version of " Jolly Farm Revue " . Isler went on to note , " for the most part the Jolly Farm concept is much less interesting than it was in the much more amusing and classic Family Guy episode , " Road to Europe " . " 
 = Three Horses Beer = 
 Three Horses Beer ( better known locally as THB ) is a pale lager that has been brewed by Star Breweries of Madagascar since 1958 . It is the highest selling beer in Madagascar and has been described as emblematic of the country . THB is sold nationwide and since 2005 has been exported to such markets as France , Reunion Island , Comoros and Mayotte . The Malagasy beer is produced at two breweries in Madagascar , the first centrally located in Antsirabe and the other in the northern city of Antsiranana . THB Pilsener , the most common variant of THB , has a light taste and is produced from mostly local barley , corn and hops . Star Breweries also produces THB Fresh ( a shandy with less than 1 % alcohol ) , THB Special ( 6 @.@ 2 % alcohol ) , and THB Lite ( 1 % alcohol ) . Recent investments in Star Brewery infrastructure have allowed a 20 % increase in production since 2011 . 
 After advertising alcohol in the media was banned under President Marc Ravalomanana , Star Breweries has increasingly promoted THB through unconventional means . These have included sponsoring the THB Champions League , Madagascar 's national football championship , and holding annual beer festivals . In addition , THB is a regular sponsor of local musicians through major annual festivals and tours . Star Breweries has also hired musicians to perform in music videos specifically created to promote the beer . In 2014 the THB label was significantly redesigned , and in 2015 a new slogan , " THB eo <unk> e ! " ( " THB always ! " ) was promoted alongside the beer 's longstanding trademark <unk> Ny <unk> ( " The Pleasure of Being Together " ) . The beer is regularly promoted by Malagasy musical stars and other public figures . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1953 the French company <unk> launched Société <unk> d ’ Articles <unk> ( STAR ) ( Antananarivo Company of Refrigerated Products ) and its associated factory in Antananarivo , Madagascar , for the exclusive production and distribution of Coca @-@ Cola in Madagascar . In 1957 , a brewer was recruited to develop a local beer . After developing 17 different recipes , he travelled throughout the island to test each one using primarily local ingredient ; the best of these was a pilsener chosen as the recipe to be produced at a Star brewery to be established in Antsirabe . The company first began producing Three Horses Beer ( THB ) in 1958 . 
 In 1968 Star Breweries opened a factory in Antsiranana for the production and distribution of THB as well as Coca @-@ Cola and other carbonated beverages throughout the island 's northern region . In 1980 , Star Breweries became partly state owned ; in 1989 <unk> sold Star Breweries to Groupe <unk> , and the company obtained fully privatized status one year later . In 2005 , the production of THB in cans began at the Star brewery in Antsirabe . In 2011 Groupe <unk> sold Star Breweries to French brewer Castel .

 THB Pilsener , the oldest and most popular THB beer , is a 5 @.@ 4 % abv pale lager light in color with a medium body , thin head and balanced , mildly bitter flavor . THB Pilsener is sold in two sizes of returnable brown bottles : 33 centilitres ( 12 imp fl oz ; 11 US fl oz ) and 65 centilitres ( 23 imp fl oz ; 22 US fl oz ) . The pilsener is also sold in 33 centilitres ( 12 imp fl oz ; 11 US fl oz ) and 50 centilitres ( 18 imp fl oz ; 17 US fl oz ) aluminum cans , and has been available on tap at commercial establishments in Madagascar since 2006 . Star Breweries also produces THB Fresh , a shandy ( locally called <unk> ) , with less than 1 % alcohol . It is only sold in 65 centilitres ( 23 imp fl oz ; 22 US fl oz ) glass bottles . The original Fresh shandy , which has a lemon taste , has also temporarily been offered in several other flavors , including mint , raspberry and apple . Other variants include THB Special , with 6 @.@ 2 % alcohol , and THB Lite , a low alcohol beer ( 1 % ) . 
 THB is produced in two breweries in Madagascar : the original brewery , located in Antsirabe , and a second in Antsiranana . Since its inception , THB has been sold in glass bottles tinted brown to protect the contents from the ultraviolet rays of the sun . The Antsirabe factory produces 100 million bottles and 100 @,@ 000 cans of THB per year . Antsirabe was selected for the original brewery because the water there is low in calcium and other minerals , lending itself well to beer production . Ingredients for the production of THB are sourced throughout the island . Barley grown in nearby Betafo and Fianarantsoa is blended with corn and hops from Toliara to produce the beer . Over 2 @,@ 500 tonnes of malt and 3 @,@ 500 tonnes of corn are grown annually in the surrounding <unk> region for the production of THB . The <unk> collective of 7 @,@ 000 farmers was formed around 1980 in Antsirabe to grow barley and transform it into malt for Star Breweries beer production . Certain special malts are used to produce variants on the original THB recipe , such as THB Special . 
 Fermentation of THB beer requires approximately eight hours for each mash of 130 hectoliters . The mash is a blend of malt ( sprouted barley ) and corn in an 80 / 20 ratio to which water and hops are added . The mash is heated in a vat for around two hours to support fermentation . The product is filtered and then heated to 100 degrees Celsius to concentrate and sterilize it . The beer is then decanted and cooled for an hour at 10 degrees Celsius . Finally , a type of mushroom is added as a leavening and fermenting agent ; the beer is allowed to ferment for a full week , and excess carbon dioxide produced by the process is collected for the production of soft drinks and other carbonated beverages at the factory . The beer is allowed to rest in vats for several more days before being filtered once more and then bottled and pasteurized at 62 degrees Celsius for three minutes . The automated bottling process yields crates of THB that are ready for shipment to regional wholesale distribution points . 
 Star Breweries invested over four million euros into improving its factories in the 2009 @-@ 11 period , resulting in a 20 % increase in production capacity . These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment , including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system . The Coca @-@ Cola Company issued international <unk> certification to Star Breweries in 2010 , confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production . In 2011 , Coca @-@ Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company 's standards of quality and environmental protection in the production of its beer and other beverages . Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Star Breweries distributes THB through a network of regional wholesalers , who provide the product to local vendors . Orders are typically sent to the factories on a weekly basis and are filled within two weeks . In 2005 Star Breweries shifted manufacturing of THB in aluminum cans from Mauritius to Antsirabe in order to export the beer to international markets with high Malagasy expatriate populations , including France , Reunion Island , Comoros and Mayotte . All exported THB beer was packaged in aluminum cans manufactured at the Antsirabe brewery ; canned THB was also made available alongside the traditional glass bottles in markets in Madagascar that same year . In 2006 the Star Brewery , which employs 1 @,@ 500 staff , was producing 700 @,@ 000 hectoliters of beer annually out of the total market share of 800 @,@ 000 ; 550 @,@ 000 hectoliters were produced at the Antsirabe Star Brewery alone . The Antsiranana factory employs 140 staff and produced 180 @,@ 000 hectoliters of beer ( 24 million bottles ) in 2010 .

 To create the original label for THB , Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer , which featured the image of three horses . This was done in part because of the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding ; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design . The label also features the brand 's slogan , <unk> Ny <unk> ( " The Pleasure of Being Together " ) . The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market ; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe . The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time . In 2005 , the label was enlarged and the colors brightened . The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal , in honor of the beer 's first international award in 2004 . A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB . The new logo features three stylized , outlined white horses , now facing right to represent a focus on the future . Red remains the predominant color . 
 Advertising alcohol on television and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana . In order to maximize brand recognition of THB , the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy , which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content , to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener 's red . The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non @-@ traditional ways , such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship . THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity , particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la <unk> ( beer festival ) . Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League , the national football championship . Many popular musical artists have advertised THB , including superstars Jerry <unk> , <unk> , Samoëla , <unk> , <unk> Mena and Jaojoby . 
 THB launched its first website in 2008 . In 2015 , in honor of the 55th anniversary of national independence , Star Breweries launched a new campaign to promote the beer . The company announced a new slogan , " THB eo <unk> e ! " ( THB always ! ) to be promoted alongside its historic slogan . A song by the same name , written and performed by BIG MJ and the group Tambour Gasy , and an accompanying music video , will promote the beer and the new slogan .

 In the Malagasy market , THB Pilsener remains the most popular Malagasy brand of beer , and the most popular of any brand of beer sold in Madagascar . It is estimated that four liters per person are sold each year in Madagascar . THB has been described as an " emblem " of the country and a " national symbol " . One Malagasy journalist described THB as symbolic of <unk> Malagasy , a cultural value that emphasizes the importance of brotherhood and friendship . 
 THB won its first ever international award in 2004 at the Monde Sélection de Bruxelles international beverage competition in Brussels , Belgium . In 2010 , THB Pilsener was again recognized at this event , receiving the silver medal . THB Pilsener won a gold medal at the same competition in 2012 , and the silver medal in 2015 . THB Fresh also won a gold medal at the Monde Sélection de Bruxelles in 2012 . 
 = George Headley = 
 George Alphonso Headley OD ( 30 May 1909 – 30 November 1983 ) was a West Indian cricketer who played 22 Test matches , mostly before the Second World War . Considered one of the best batsmen to play for West Indies and one of the greatest cricketers of all time , Headley also represented Jamaica and played professional club cricket in England . West Indies had a weak cricket team through most of Headley 's playing career ; as their one world @-@ class player , he carried a heavy responsibility and the side depended on his batting . He batted at number three , scoring 2 @,@ 190 runs in Tests at an average of 60 @.@ 83 , and 9 @,@ 921 runs in all first @-@ class matches at an average of 69 @.@ 86 . He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1934 . 
 Headley was born in Panama but raised in Jamaica where he quickly established a cricketing reputation as a batsman . He soon gained his place in the Jamaican cricket team , and narrowly missed selection for the West Indies tour of England in 1928 . He made his Test debut in 1930 , against England in Barbados , and was instantly successful . Further successes followed in series against Australia and in three more against England , as Headley dominated the West Indian batting of the period . Following his tour of England in 1933 , Headley signed as a professional at Haslingden in the Lancashire League , where he played until the outbreak of war in 1939 . 
 The war interrupted Headley 's career ; although he returned to Tests in 1948 he was hampered by injuries and did not achieve his previous levels of success . Even so , he was chosen as West Indies captain in 1948 against England , the first black player to be appointed to the position , although a combination of injuries and politics meant he only led his team for one Test match . He did not play Tests between 1949 and 1953 , but resumed his career in English league cricket , first in Lancashire and later in the Birmingham League . His playing career ended in 1954 on his return to Jamaica , after a public subscription paid his fare from England . After retiring as a player , Headley was employed as a cricket coach by the Jamaican government until 1962 . He lived until 1983 ; his son Ron and his grandson Dean each played Test match cricket , for West Indies and England respectively . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Headley was born in Colón , Panama on 30 May 1909 , the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts . Neither of Headley 's parents was from Panama ; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica , but they had moved to Panama while <unk> worked on the construction of the Panama Canal . By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete , and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment . In 1919 , concerned by the amount of Spanish being spoken by her son , Headley 's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English @-@ speaking school . 
 Headley moved in with his mother 's sister @-@ in @-@ law Mrs Clarence Smith , in Rae Town , Kingston , and remained with her until her death in 1933 . His mother returned to Cuba , but regularly exchanged letters with her son . He attended Calabar Elementary School , where he played for the school cricket team as a wicket @-@ keeper , although a meagre sporting budget meant he had to do so without gloves . Later , he continued his education at Kingston High School . Taking part in all @-@ day cricket matches at the local <unk> Park , Headley began to attract local attention , and aged 16 , he joined <unk> Cricket Club . In 1925 he scored his first century , batting at number three in the batting order in a match for <unk> against Clovelly . 
 On leaving school , Headley was appointed as a temporary clerk in a magistrate 's court ; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew 's Police side in 1926 , in a cup competition . Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team . However , his job made it impossible to attend , and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson 's English touring side in 1927 . That year , Headley began working for Keeling – Lindo Estates , in St Catherine . The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons , allowing employees time off to play in matches , so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis . He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club , captained by his immediate superior in Keeling – Lindo . To generate more income , Headley took a second job , working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company , but he wanted a secure profession . To this end , he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry . However , he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his first @-@ class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Headley made his Jamaica debut against Lord Tennyson 's XI at Sabina Park on 9 February 1928 , in a match won easily by the home team . Batting at number three , his first innings yielded 16 runs , but in the second innings , he scored 71 , reaching fifty runs in as many minutes . In the second game against Lord Tennyson 's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February , Headley scored his maiden first @-@ class century . Having scored 22 not out after the first day 's play , he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played more adventurous shots . He hit the bowling of Alan <unk> for four consecutive fours and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a row . At one point , thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four . He was finally out for 211 , the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team . After the innings , Tennyson compared Headley to Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney , batsmen considered among the best who ever played . Headley concluded the series against Tennyson 's team with innings of 40 and 71 , to give him an aggregate of 409 runs at an average of 81 @.@ 80 . He also took his maiden first class wicket . 
 Following his success , Headley abandoned his prospective career in dentistry . Although some critics expected his selection for the West Indies tour of England in 1928 , Headley was not chosen . While West Indies played their inaugural Test series during that tour , Headley continued to play for St Catherine 's . He had another opportunity against English opposition in 1929 , when a team led by Julien Cahn arrived to play two first @-@ class games . Jamaica 's distance from other Caribbean islands made it difficult for their cricketers to gain good @-@ quality playing experience , so the frequent visits by English sides were important to the development of Jamaican cricket . These tours also served to build Headley 's reputation . In the first match , Headley played a slow , defensive innings of 57 , but he did not reach fifty in his other three innings . Even so , he was chosen by the Jamaican selectors for a West Indies XI , which included players from other islands , to play Cahn 's team in their final tour match . The home side lost the toss and had to bat in very difficult conditions following rain . Headley found the fast bowlers difficult , but survived the period when the pitch was most difficult to bat on before he was out for 44 . In the second innings , he attacked from the start and used a wide range of shots to reach 143 before he was run out . In three matches against the tourists , Headley scored 326 runs , averaging 54 @.@ 33 . 
 A change in the location of his job meant that Headley moved to the Lucas Cricket Club in 1929 . He visited America and played some exhibition matches for the Jamaican Athletic Club in New York , scoring a century against a touring team from Bermuda ; his parents had moved to America by then , which enabled Headley to combine the cricket with his first visit to his parents in ten years . 
 = = Test match career = = 
 = = = Debut and first Test series = = = 
 In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) undertook a tour of the West Indies which included four Test matches — the first Tests to be played in the West Indies . The MCC side was not at full international strength ; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers , and several star English bowlers were missing . The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected , making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930 — to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should have gone to a local player . Batting at number three , he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21 . However , in the second innings he scored 176 , becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall . He shared century partnerships with both Clifford Roach and Frank de Caires , but these were insufficient to force victory , and the match was drawn . Headley remained in the Test side for the rest of the series , the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests . In Trinidad , during the second Test , Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult — Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass . Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match . The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series , played in British Guiana . In this match Headley became the first West Indian , and only the fifth cricketer of any nation , to score two separate hundreds in a Test match . His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach , who scored a double century . In the second innings , Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead , attacking defensive English bowling . 
 While en route to the final Test in Jamaica , the West Indies team stopped in Panama and Costa Rica where official functions were held in Headley 's honour . In Jamaica , where there was widespread jubilation , Headley attended several receptions and celebrations . When the cricket resumed , Headley scored 64 , 72 and 55 in three innings against MCC for Jamaica . With the Test series level , it was agreed that the final match of the series would be played until one team won , regardless of how long it took — the other Tests had been limited to four days each . On the first three days , England scored 849 . In reply West Indies could only manage 286 , with Headley out for ten runs . England batted again , to set West Indies an eventual victory target of 836 . This time , Headley batted for 390 minutes , faced 385 balls and hit 28 fours while scoring 223 . He and Karl Nunes added 227 for the second wicket . Headley played the hook very effectively and hit many short deliveries for runs . When Headley was stumped , he had made what was at the time the fourth highest individual score in all Test cricket and the highest in a second innings . When West Indies still needed 428 runs , rain fell for two days and the match had to be abandoned after its ninth scheduled day . Headley ended the series with 703 runs at an average of 87 @.@ 87 . 
 = = = Australian tour = = = 
 Headley was selected for the West Indian tour of Australia in the 1930 – 31 season , under the captaincy of Jackie Grant . After a brief visit to New Zealand where they played a non @-@ first @-@ class match against Wellington , the tourists arrived in Sydney . Headley made a good start to the tour and attracted praise from the press in Australia and West Indies . The first match of the Australian leg was against New South Wales , where the West Indians were bowled out for 188 and Headley was stumped for 25 . However , his runs came in less than two overs and Learie Constantine later rated this as one of Headley 's best innings . In the second innings , Headley made 82 , the top score , but could not prevent the tourists losing . The next match was also lost , as Bert Ironmonger took thirteen wickets in the match for Victoria . In the first innings , Headley scored 131 out of 212 , regarded by one critic as one of the best centuries scored on the ground , and top @-@ scored again with 34 in the second innings . By this stage the Australian bowlers had realised that Headley excelled when hitting the ball through the off side , and they began to alter their tactics accordingly . In the final match before the Test series began , against South Australia , Headley had problems playing the Australian bowlers , particularly the leg spin of Clarrie Grimmett . The Australians bowled at Headley 's leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side , making it difficult for him to score runs . Headley scored 27 and 16 as his team were heavily defeated . These bowling tactics were used in subsequent matches , and Headley found difficulty in countering them . 
 At the beginning of the first Test , West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets , including Headley first ball . In the second innings , with West Indies 80 behind , Grimmett again attacked Headley 's leg stump . After having his scoring restricted , Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped , trying to hit Grimmett . <unk> out for 249 , West Indies lost by ten wickets . After scoring only three in the following tour match against Tasmania , Headley contributed 14 and two in an innings defeat in the second Test . After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists , some critics believed that the series was too one @-@ sided and that some of the five Tests should be cancelled . Headley 's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over Queensland and , having put on weight , he was also struggling with his fitness . In an effort to overcome Australia 's leg stump attack Headley had altered his batting stance ; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler , he turned his body more front @-@ on , to enable him to improve his placement of the ball on the leg side . His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side . He also eliminated from his strokes a risky cover drive he had developed on Caribbean pitches . During the third Test at Brisbane , Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series , after Australia scored 558 batting first . Facing Grimmett 's leg side tactics , Headley managed to score freely , and forced Grimmett to alter to an off stump attack . With ten fours in total , Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia , and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193 . Forced to follow @-@ on , West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28 , the highest score of the innings . Ironmonger tricked him into playing the leg glance and he was caught by the wicket @-@ keeper who had moved across in anticipation of the shot . 
 Headley maintained his good form in matches against Victoria and South Australia after the third Test , scoring 77 and 113 in the first match and 75 and 39 in the second . Although neither match was won , the West Indians needed to take only one more wicket to win the first match when it ended drawn , and lost the second by a single wicket . However , the fourth Test was lost by an innings as Ironmonger again caused difficulties for the West Indies batsmen . Headley top @-@ scored with 33 out of the first innings total of 99 but made only 11 on his second attempt , being dismissed both times by Ironmonger . By now the tour was making a financial loss , forcing the tourists to take economy measures such as travelling by tram . In conversation with a member of the Australian Board of Control , Headley , Constantine and fellow tourist Tommy Scott suggested the authorities should produce faster pitches to enable the public to see more attacking cricket . It seems this advice may have been heeded ; the pitch was faster in a match against New South Wales , won by the West Indians , in which Headley scored 70 and two . In the fifth Test , West Indies won the toss and batted first , which proved an advantage in a match plagued by uncertain weather . Headley and fellow Jamaican Frank Martin scored centuries on the first day despite bowling from the Australians which the Jamaican newspaper Daily Gleaner described as good . Headley , playing Grimmett comfortably by now , batted for 146 minutes , and hit 13 fours . In the course of the innings he achieved the rare feat in Australia of reaching 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs on the tour . Grant , the West Indies captain , declared the innings closed after rain had fallen to make the pitch more difficult for batting . Australia were then bowled out for 224 , 126 runs behind West Indies . The tourists scored 124 more runs in their second innings , of which Headley made 30 , before more rain fell and Grant declared for the second time in the match . Subsequently , the bowlers dismissed Australia for 220 to give West Indies their first win over Australia , although the series ended 4 – 1 to the home side . Headley scored 336 runs in the Test matches at an average of 37 @.@ 33 , and 1 @,@ 066 runs at 44 @.@ 41 in all first @-@ class games . 
 On their return home , the West Indian players were well received by the public and officials ; Headley received praise and once again attended functions arranged in his honour . In Australia Donald Bradman , the star Australian batsman , praised Headley , particularly for the way in which he had overcome his problems against Grimmett . C. L. R. James , the writer and historian , later wrote that Headley 's success demonstrated his mastery of batting . Headley arrived in Australia as a primarily off @-@ side player which accounted for his difficulty against the Australian bowlers ' tactics . However , James notes : " What he did , under fire , so to speak , was to reorganise his batting to meet the new attack . " So successful was Headley that he was described by Grimmett as the best on @-@ side batsman against whom the bowler had played . 
 = = = Tour by Lord Tennyson 's team = = = 
 Headley resumed playing for Lucas on his return to Jamaica , attracting great crowds and high expectations . Once the cricket season ended , he embarked on another trip to America to play exhibition matches , visiting his parents on the journey . On his return for the 1931 – 32 season , he was appointed captain of Lucas and began preparing for the forthcoming tour of Jamaica by another team led by Lord Tennyson . In addition to his regular practice , Headley began a programme of running and swimming to improve his overall fitness . After performing well in the trial matches for Jamaica , he was selected in the first match against the tourists . Jamaica made an uncertain start , losing five wickets by the time their score reached 215 but Headley had scored 130 . He then shared a partnership of 487 for the sixth wicket with Clarence <unk> ; 236 not out after the first day 's play , Headley went on to score an unbeaten 344 , after batting for 407 minutes and hitting 39 fours . Jamaica totalled 702 , and won the match by an innings . During his innings , Headley passed the previous highest score by any West Indian batsman , 304 not out by Percy <unk> in 1920 , and the highest score in the West Indies by any batsman , Andy Sandham 's 325 in 1930 . His partnership with <unk> took 248 minutes , and as of 2015 remains a world record for the highest sixth wicket partnership in a first @-@ class match . The success of two home batsmen led to celebrations in Jamaica and praise from the English bowlers for Headley 's batting . Headley continued his success in the second game , opening the batting and top @-@ scoring with 84 in the first innings . In the second innings , opening again , he made 155 not out to guide West Indies to their victory target of 363 . In the final match , Headley scored his third century of the series after returning to number three , accumulating 140 of Jamaica 's total of 561 . Jamaica won the match to win the series 3 – 0 ; Headley scored 723 runs at an average of 361 @.@ 50 . In the remainder of the season , Headley led Lucas to victory in the Senior Cup , scoring a century in the final . 
 = = = 1933 tour of England = = = 
 After playing in two trial matches , Headley was selected to tour England in 1933 under the continuing captaincy of Jackie Grant . The English press speculated on Headley 's ability to cope with English conditions , while expecting him to perform to a high standard . In the event , Wisden believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation . In the first match of the tour he scored 52 out of a total of 129 against Northamptonshire , in difficult batting conditions on a wet pitch . He scored fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at Lord 's Cricket Ground . In the second innings of this match , a short ball from Bill Bowes struck Headley on the chest , and as a result of this injury he missed three games , but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against Glamorgan and 224 not out against Somerset . A quieter match followed against Middlesex , but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against Derbyshire , which took him past 1 @,@ 000 runs for the season . Despite Headley 's contributions , the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings . Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings , and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies followed @-@ on . Critics were impressed by Headley 's second innings performance , in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting . Between the first and second Tests , in matches where conditions were difficult for batting and ideal for spin bowlers , Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side 's highest score in each of four innings . 
 West Indies drew the second Test , avoiding defeat for the first time in a Test in England . Headley scored 169 in 375 minutes with 18 fours , sharing a partnership of 200 in 205 minutes with Ivan Barrow — who became the first West Indian to score a Test century in England , minutes before Headley became the second . When the innings ended , Headley was still not out and the crowd gave him an excellent reception . Wisden described Headley 's batting as magnificent , displaying " a ready adaptability and perfection of timing . " The West Indies bowlers used Bodyline tactics in the England innings ; England 's Nobby Clark used the tactic in the West Indian second innings , in which Headley scored 24 runs . He was one of the few of his side 's batsmen able to resist the bowling tactics . 
 After scoring an unbeaten 257 in a minor match against Norfolk , Headley scored 89 in his team 's victory over Glamorgan and 182 against Warwickshire . However , he failed in the third and final Test , scoring nine and 12 as West Indies were defeated by an innings . The tourists thus lost the series 2 – 0 ; in the three Tests Headley 's aggregate was 277 runs at an average of 55 @.@ 40 , the best figures for the team . After the Test matches were over , Headley had an operation to remove a sebaceous cyst from his forehead and missed several games , before returning for an end @-@ of @-@ season festival match in which he scored 167 against an England XI . When the tour concluded , Headley had scored 2 @,@ 320 runs with seven hundreds , at an average of 66 @.@ 28 . This was over 1 @,@ 000 runs more than any other tourist and placed him third in the English first @-@ class batting averages for the season . Ivan Barrow believed Headley reached his batting peak during the tour . He recalled how many bowlers tried to hit his pads with the ball but Headley simply flicked the ball away . Headley 's performances earned him selection as one of Wisden 's Cricketers of the Year . The accompanying article called his tour " almost a triumphant march " and described him as " the best batsman the West Indies have ever produced . " Wisden editor Sydney Southerton also described him as a giant in the team and wrote : " From what we had been told by English players who had been to the West Indies , we were fully prepared for Headley 's success , but even so , he astonished most of us . " Headley bowled more than he had previously : prior to the tour , he had taken three first class wickets , but took 21 wickets in England at an average of 34 @.@ 33 , bowling off spin . 
 During the tour , Headley received news that his aunt had been killed by floods in Kingston which had also destroyed his home . Headley was greatly affected by the news , particularly the nature of her death . Although not able to attend the funeral , he wanted to leave England on an earlier ship than the rest of the team , but this could not be arranged in time . 
 = = = Lancashire League = = = 
 Following his success in England in 1933 , Headley was offered a two @-@ year contract to play professional cricket for Haslingden in the Lancashire League for £ 500 per season , the highest of several offers . The money was far more than he was earning from working as a fruit picker in Jamaica , and after consulting the Jamaican Cricket Board , who advised him to accept , he signed with the club on 8 September 1933 . There was a special provision which allowed Headley to be released to play for West Indies . Living in Haslingden where there were few , if any , other black people , Headley faced some prejudice from residents . However , he was generally welcomed and accepted . His first season was in 1934 and his first match was against Nelson , for whom Headley 's West Indian Test colleague Learie Constantine played . Headley had a difficult match . As the professional , he was expected to open the bowling although , as a spinner , he would normally have bowled later in an innings . When he batted he was run out for a duck by Constantine after facing one delivery , and Haslingden lost the match . After this poor start , Headley scored 1 @,@ 063 runs in the season at an average of 50 @.@ 62 , with three centuries . He changed his bowling style to medium pace and took 59 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 59 . In 1935 he scored over 900 runs at an average of 61 @.@ 13 , and took 34 wickets ; his contract was renewed for another two years . In 1936 he again scored over 900 runs , and took 54 wickets . In 1937 he broke the record for most runs scored by any player in a Lancashire League season , accumulating 1 @,@ 360 at an average of 97 @.@ 15 , with five centuries ; he also took 41 wickets . Headley 's final two @-@ year contract with the club covered the seasons 1938 and 1940 , since he was expected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1939 . The war prevented him playing in 1940 , so his last season with Haslingden was 1938 . Although in that year his overall batting performance declined , to 677 runs at an average of 37 @.@ 61 , he took 76 wickets at 9 @.@ 70 and had success in the Worsley Cup competition , including one innings of 189 not out in a match played over five evenings .

The visiting team , under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt , was stronger than English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean ; despite some shortcomings , Wisden and other critics considered it strong enough for the task in hand . 
 The first Test in Barbados was badly affected by rain which made the pitch almost impossible to bat on . West Indies batted first and were bowled out for 102 ; Headley 's 44 was the highest score of the match . In reply , England had scored 81 for seven when Wyatt declared in an attempt to make West Indies bat while the pitch was difficult . In the second innings , Headley was out for a duck and Jackie Grant declared when West Indies had scored 51 for six , so that England required 73 to win ; they did so after losing six wickets . In the second Test , Headley scored 25 in his first innings ; in the second , he adopted a cautious approach as his team led by 44 , hitting 93 in 225 minutes . West Indies subsequently bowled out England to win the match and level the series . The rain @-@ affected third Test was drawn , with Headley 's 53 his side 's top score . 
 The MCC went to Jamaica for the final leg of their tour . Headley played two matches for Jamaica against the tourists ; he failed in the first game but scored 127 in the second . The teams went into the fourth and final Test with the series still level at one win apiece . West Indies batted first , facing accurate bowling . The local press criticised the West Indies batsmen for slow batting on the first day , but Headley scored 132 . The Daily Gleaner noted that Headley maintained the controlled approach he had established in the season . On the second day , he took his score to 270 not out , and the Gleaner described him as " the genius we all know , scoring with all his old freedom and audacity . " In total , he batted for 495 minutes and hit 30 fours , recording the highest score by a West Indian batsman . It remained a West Indian record until Garfield Sobers scored 365 not out in 1958 , and was the team 's highest against England until Lawrence Rowe scored 302 in 1974 . West Indies scored 535 for seven and bowled out England twice to record their first victory in a Test series . Headley contributed 485 runs at an average of 97 @.@ 00 . 
 Headley returned to England to play for Haslingden in the 1935 English season , and played a single first @-@ class game , scoring a century for Sir L Parkinson 's XI against Leicestershire . In the 1935 – 36 season , the Yorkshire team toured Jamaica , playing three first @-@ class matches , winning one and drawing the others . The touring county considered Headley the key batsman , and targeted him by bowling defensively in an attempt to frustrate him . Headley lost his wicket through impatience in the first match , although he scored a pair of fifties , but scored a century in the third game . In total , he scored 266 runs at an average of 53 @.@ 20 , but Yorkshire won the series after winning the first game , Jamaica 's first defeat at home in a first @-@ class game for ten years . The matches were played in a very competitive atmosphere , but scoring was slow and Yorkshire played attritional cricket . During the series , Headley demanded expenses , which were not normally granted to the players . The Jamaican Board were reluctant to pay but Headley pointed out that , as a professional cricketer , he was entitled to the same treatment as the Yorkshire players , whose expenses were provided . The Board eventually relented before the series ended . 
 = = = Second tour of England = = = 
 In 1936 Headley returned to England , and played no more first @-@ class cricket until the two trial matches for the 1939 tour of England . These matches were played in Trinidad where it was believed the matting pitches would most closely replicate English conditions ; Jamaica played Trinidad and a combination team . When Jamaica 's captain , Crab Nethersole , withdrew from the tour due to political commitments , Headley led Jamaica in both matches and scored 160 and 103 . Subsequently , he was chosen for his second tour of England , under the captaincy of Rolph Grant . Headley opened his tour with fifties in his first two matches and by the time the Test series started , although the tourists had lost three matches , he had scored three centuries — 103 against Cambridge University , 116 not out in a victory over Essex and 227 as the tourists defeated Middlesex . 
 In the first Test , West Indies suffered their only defeat of the series . However , Norman Preston , the editor of Wisden , wrote : " the match provided a personal triumph for Headley " , as he became only the second cricketer after Herbert Sutcliffe to make two hundreds in the same Test match on two separate occasions , having previously done so against England in 1930 . He became the first player to score two hundreds in a Lord 's Test , a feat not repeated until 1990 . In the first innings , Headley scored 106 with 13 fours . After sharing a big partnership with Jeff Stollmeyer , he received little help from the other batsmen . He played cautiously during his 250 @-@ minute innings , as he was aware that his team were relying on his success . By the time West Indies batted again , England had established a lead of 127 . Headley again batted defensively to score 107 , taking two hours to reach 50 , as West Indies needed to bat for a long time to secure a draw . However , he scored runs from any loose bowling and batted in all for 230 minutes , hitting eight fours . Preston , writing in Wisden , believed the West Indians relied too much on Headley 's batting . He also noted that Headley had to play cautiously for his team and although he hit powerful shots , " he was not the same dashing batsmen that England knew in 1933 . " Headley had scored three centuries in consecutive Test innings , but he could not prevent England winning this first Test by eight wickets . He continued to score heavily in the tour matches , making an unbeaten 234 in an innings win over Nottinghamshire , followed by 61 against Yorkshire on a sticky wicket , one of the best innings Neville Cardus had seen . 
 The second Test was drawn , after being badly affected by rain . Headley , although troubled by the English bowling on a difficult pitch , top @-@ scored with 51 in West Indies ' first innings but the other batsmen contributed little . Headley scored just five in West Indies ' brief second innings , bringing to an end a sequence of six fifties in successive Test innings . After the Test , Headley scored 93 against Surrey but failed to reach fifty in his next three games , which included three single figure scores . West Indies needed to win the final Test to level the series and the team established a first @-@ innings lead of 146 . Headley played cautiously for 140 minutes , attempting to tire out the bowlers , but was run out for 65 in a misunderstanding with Vic Stollmeyer . The remaining batsmen played well , attacking the English bowling . Preston believed this match demonstrated West Indies ' ability to compete at the highest level . However , England were able to bat long enough to secure a draw . In the Test series , Headley scored 334 runs at an average of 66 @.@ 80 , but did not play again on the tour after the final Test , as the team were advised to abandon the last seven matches because of the deteriorating political situation in Europe . They arrived in Canada on the day that Britain declared war on Germany . In all first @-@ class matches during the tour , Headley scored 1 @,@ 745 runs at 72 @.@ 70 , placing him at the top of the season 's first @-@ class averages . 
 Wisden judged Headley to be the best batsman of the 1939 season , while other critics rated him among the best batsmen in the world , with favourable comparisons to Bradman . C. B. Fry , a former England captain turned journalist , wrote that Headley 's " middle name should be Atlas " , suggesting that he carried the team on his shoulders .

 Following the outbreak of war , the Lancashire League clubs cancelled professionals ' contracts , meaning Headley did not complete his final year with Haslingden . Having returned to Jamaica , he worked in the Labour Department for the government and played cricket for Lucas , enjoying batting success and captaining his team to victory in the Senior Cup on three occasions . Headley continued to play for the team until 1947 , when he left to play for the Kensington Club . Unlike other Caribbean teams , Jamaica did not take part in inter @-@ island competition , and although Headley played some exhibition matches in America in 1945 , it was not until June 1946 that he took part in his next first @-@ class match . Trinidad played three matches in Jamaica and Headley scored 52 in the second game but only reached his best form when he scored 99 in the third . However , he was successful as a bowler , taking five for 33 in the first game , the only five wicket return of his career . This included a spell of three wickets without conceding a run in 14 deliveries , prompting a pitch invasion by the crowd . Headley also captained Jamaica in the final two matches of the series against Trinidad after the official captain was injured during the home team 's win in the first match — the other two were drawn . 
 Prior to a visit by Barbados in March 1947 , Headley was officially appointed as Jamaican captain . Previous captains of island teams had been almost exclusively white . Around this time , Headley requested the Jamaican board provide support for low income players with their kit and transport costs . In the first game against Barbados , Headley scored 203 not out and 57 not out , took four for 40 in the tourists ' first innings and another wicket in the second . Although the game was drawn , he had recorded Jamaica 's highest score in a match between the Caribbean islands . The second match was also drawn ; Headley made 79 before he had to retire when he fell and injured his knee . Another American tour followed , in which Headley was accompanied by promising young players , before he led the Jamaican team to British Guiana in October 1947 . He played only two innings in the two matches , scoring 36 and 4 not out . A thumb injury in the first match meant he could not bat , although he bowled 44 overs in the game . Headley was verbally abused by a section of the crowd , who disapproved of a black captain ; he was also dissatisfied with the impartiality of the umpires . Crab Nethersole , the Jamaican manager for the tour , reported that injuries to key players and the poor attitude of the crowd made the tour difficult , although Headley 's captaincy was universally praised . 
 = = = Resumption of Test career = = = 
 For reasons related to class and race , it had been unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain , but the postwar world saw social and political changes in the Caribbean . Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain , Headley was appointed as one of the West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948 . Crab Nethersole , the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket , argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached . Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches , played in Barbados and Jamaica , and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches . In the event , Headley only played in the first Test . In the first innings , he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding . Batting towards the end of West Indies ' second innings , he scored seven not out . Rain helped England to draw the match . Headley 's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests , but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test . After the first island game , in which he scored 65 , Headley 's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board . He scored 36 not out , but aggravated his back pains and he withdrew from the final Test . West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard , who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test . He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948 – 49 , despite Headley 's availability and apparently superior claims to the position . 
 Selected for the Indian tour after a specific request by the Indian cricket authorities , Headley did not have much success in the early matches and in the drawn first Test he scored only two in a total of 631 . West Indies then moved to Pakistan ; in a non first @-@ class game Headley took six wickets as a bowler , but then in a match against a representative Pakistan XI he fell and injured his side while attempting to take a catch . He batted in discomfort , scoring 57 not out . This injury meant that he played no further part in the five @-@ match Test series against India . Although he continued to travel with the team , he was unable to play in any further matches until the final game of the tour , when he scored 100 against Ceylon Schools as the tourists travelled home via Ceylon . 
 Headley played for the Kensington Club until 1950 , when he resumed league cricket in England ; he returned for a final season with Kensington in 1955 before retiring from Senior Cup cricket . Meanwhile , he took a new job as an insurance agent . This affected his availability for cricket as he was no longer able to take leave when playing for a team ; if he did not work , he received no wages . Consequently , he did not accept the captaincy of Jamaica during the Test trials for the 1950 tour of England and did not travel with the team . Press reaction was unfavourable towards Headley but the West Indies Board still wanted to select him for the tour . However , Headley accepted a contract with Bacup in the Lancashire League , to replace Everton Weekes who was in the touring party . 
 For Bacup Headley scored 909 runs and took 20 wickets in 1950 , before signing to play for Dudley in the Birmingham League in 1951 . He and his family moved to Birmingham , and in each the next four seasons Headley averaged over 65 with the bat and under 17 with the ball . In his second season , the club topped the league . In total , he scored 2 @,@ 878 runs for Dudley and , resuming off spin bowling , took 102 wickets . While in England during this time , he played several first @-@ class matches for a Commonwealth XI against an England XI ; he scored 20 in 1951 and accumulated 98 and 61 in 1952 . 
 = = = End of Test career = = = 
 Headley 's success for Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and commentators began to discuss his availability for the 1954 series against England . A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica , opened by the Daily Gleaner , raised over £ 1 @,@ 000 , and despite his reservations , Headley returned to Jamaica . Playing in a fund @-@ raising match , he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC , a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley 's arm . The latter injury kept him out of the first @-@ class match between Jamaica and the MCC , but he played in the second where , although hampered by his injury , he scored 53 not out . The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test . Reaction among critics was mixed , and Headley , nearing his 45th birthday , remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies . Headley batted at number six , and it appeared that England , under the captaincy of Len Hutton , let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings , which Hutton later confirmed to be the case . However , Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting at the beginning of the next over , so that England could try to get him out before he settled down . 
 Headley scored 16 and 1 in the match , his final Test appearance . He used his experience to influence the captain , Jeff Stollmeyer , advising him not to enforce the follow on and to use leg theory bowling to slow down the tourists ' scoring . These tactics helped West Indies to a 140 @-@ run win in a match they might have lost ; Stollmeyer followed a similar approach in the following match . In 22 Tests , Headley scored 2 @,@ 190 runs at an average of 60 @.@ 83 . 
 Headley finished his career at Dudley at the end of 1954 ; his son Ron played for the club from 1957 , having already played for its second team in 1952 as a 13 @-@ year @-@ old . After his final Test match appearance , Headley 's only other first @-@ class match was in the Commonwealth XI fixture in 1954 , when he scored 64 in his final first @-@ class innings . In a career total of 103 first @-@ class games he aggregated 9 @,@ 921 runs at 69 @.@ 86 , with 33 centuries , and took 51 wickets at 36 @.@ 11 . 
 = = Style , technique and legacy = = 
 Headley is regarded by critics as one of the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the greatest batsmen of all time . In his history of West Indies cricket , Michael Manley described Headley as " the yardstick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are measured " . In 1988 , The Cricketer magazine placed him in an all @-@ time West Indian team , as did a panel of judges for another such team in July 2010 , while in 2004 , another panel of experts named him among the top five West Indian players . He was given the nicknames " the Black Bradman " and " Atlas " by commentators , and was the first world @-@ class batsman from the West Indies who was black . According to historian Gideon Haigh , his role was made harder by the weakness of his colleagues , as few outstanding players find it easy to play in teams which lose frequently . Although he was a naturally attacking player , Headley felt the need to play cautiously owing to the way his team depended on him . C. L. R. James believed that no other great batsman had to carry such a burden for so long . In the years before the war , Headley scored 25 @.@ 61 % of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies , more than twice as many as the next best batsman , and two @-@ thirds of the team 's centuries , scoring ten of the team 's first fourteen centuries in Test cricket . Headley usually batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were often dismissed quickly , he frequently began his innings early . 
 As of 2014 , Headley 's average in Test matches of 60 @.@ 83 is third highest among those with 2 @,@ 000 runs , behind Bradman and Graeme Pollock , and but for the Tests he played after the war , he would have been above Pollock . In all first @-@ class matches , he has the third highest average with 69 @.@ 86 , behind Bradman and Vijay Merchant among those who played 50 innings . He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted , second again to Bradman , and did not suffer a poor series in his career before the war . 
 Manley describes Headley as just under medium height with sloping shoulders . His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field ; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned down to the wrist . Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect . Exceptionally quick on his feet , he watched the ball onto the bat more than any other batsman . According to Wisden , all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot . He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out . He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often , but R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow believed his square cut , late cut , and hook were exceptionally good . Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets . C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39 @.@ 85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets . According to James 's reckoning , Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once , and averaged 16 @.@ 66 in fifteen innings . Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game . He stated : " On a bad wicket , it was you and the bowler ... no nonsense . " 
 Beyond cricket , Headley 's success was regarded as important . Of Headley 's meeting with the king of England in 1939 , the West Indian writer Frank <unk> said : " That one of us — a black man — could shake the hand of a king introduced possibilities formerly <unk> of in our colonial backwater of racial inferiority , psychological subordination and political powerlessness . " Manley notes that Headley rose to success at a time of political awakening in Jamaica , when the black majority of the population were increasingly determined to end the minority rule of landowners and challenge the racism of the time . According to Manley , the middle classes saw in Headley " the reassurance which they needed . He demonstrated black capacity . " The white upper classes were proud of his achievements as a West Indian , but Manley writes " it was to the black masses that Headley had the deepest significance ... [ He ] became the focus for longing of an entire people for proof : proof of their own self @-@ worth , their own capacity . Furthermore , they wanted this proof to be laid at the door of the white man who owned the world which defined their circumstances . " Manley sees the title of " Atlas " not just in sporting terms , but in his carrying " the hopes of the black , English @-@ speaking Caribbean man ... He was black excellence personified in a white world and in a white sport . "

 Following the 1955 cricket season , Headley was invited to become a national coach , a post created by the Jamaican government , which involved working mainly with young people . Headley and his second son travelled back to Jamaica , while the rest of the family remained in England . Headley had a heavy workload , particularly in rural areas ; together with his assistant Dickie Fuller his role involved encouraging school children to watch and play cricket , and trying to improve standards and facilities throughout the country . Headley became involved in the selection of teams , taking some of them overseas . At this time , he discovered the future West Indian Test player Roy Gilchrist and future Jamaican cricketer Henry Sewell . However , critics in the 1960s complained that there were not enough Jamaicans in the Test side and blamed Headley and Fuller , although the government remained supportive of their performance . In 1961 , Headley coached for six months in Nigeria and earned praise from the Nigerian Cricket Association . His official coaching role in Jamaica ended after a new government withdrew funding for coaching in 1962 . 
 = = = Family and retirement = = = 
 Headley married Rena Saunders in 1939 . He had nine children in total , including Ron Headley who was born two days after the end of the Lord 's Test of 1939 . Ron Headley went on to play professional cricket for the English counties Worcestershire and Derbyshire , and represented Jamaica before playing two Tests for West Indies in 1973 . Another son , <unk> , reached the semi @-@ finals of the 100 metres and came fourth in the 100 metres relay at the 1964 Olympics ; he also won a gold medal with Jamaican sprint relay teams in the Central American and Caribbean Games of 1966 and silver with the relay team at the Commonwealth Games of the same year . Ron 's son Dean , Headley 's grandson , played Test cricket for England ; the family thus became the first to have three generations play Test cricket . 
 After his retirement from coaching , Headley remained associated with cricket , presenting awards and playing in friendly matches . He was the official representative of the Jamaican Cricket Board at Constantine 's funeral in 1971 . Official recognition came Headley 's way when he was awarded the <unk> in 1956 and was made an honorary life member of the MCC in 1958 . In 1969 , a bronze sculpture of his head was unveiled in Jamaica 's National Stadium , and in 1973 the Norman Manley Foundation gave him the Award for Excellence in Sports . In the latter year , he also received the Order of Distinction . He died in Kingston on 30 November 1983 . 
 = Interstate 81 in West Virginia = 
 In the U.S. state of West Virginia , Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) crosses the Eastern Panhandle region , linking Virginia to Maryland . The Interstate Highway , completed in 1966 , spans 26 @.@ 00 miles ( 41 @.@ 84 km ) through Berkeley County , paralleling U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) for its entire length . I @-@ 81 enters the state near Ridgeway and travels northeast , bypassing the city of Martinsburg , and leaves the state at the Potomac River , which serves as the state line . The first solicitations for the construction of I @-@ 81 were published in 1959 , with the first 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of freeway being opened in 1963 , and the full length was completed by 1966 . On average between 45 and 60 thousand vehicles use the freeway though the panhandle per day . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 81 enters the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia just west of Ridgeway , paralleling US 11 ( also known as the Valley Pike ) . The highway passes through some light farmland before entering a wooded area , north of Ridgeway . A welcome center for northbound travelers is passed before the woodlands give way to a light urban setting . As the highway approaches the community of Inwood , a diamond interchange with West Virginia Route 51 ( WV 51 ) provides access to the community , as well as <unk> to the west of the freeway , and Charles Town to the east . A small business park is passed by before I @-@ 81 intersects County Route 32 , providing access to Arden , the Eastern WV Regional Airport and Tablers Station . The freeway turns more towards the north as it approaches Martinsburg , intersecting WV 45 , County Route 15 and Dry Run Road while in the city limits . I @-@ 81 bypasses downtown , running along the western border of town while US 11 continues through the town . 
 Just northeast of Martinsburg the freeway passes over a CSX Transportation rail line while a cloverleaf interchange with WV 9 provides access back to Martinsburg and to <unk> . As the freeway curves back east , it intersects WV 901 between Hainesville and Falling Waters . WV 901 is a short connector route back to US 11 . North of Falling Waters and south of Marlowe , US 11 intersects the freeway and continues north while I @-@ 81 turns east towards the Maryland state line at the Potomac River . Just south of the river is a welcome center intended for southbound travelers from Maryland . 
 Out of the six states that I @-@ 81 passes through , the segment in West Virginia is the second shortest , only longer than the Maryland segment . Every year the West Virginia Department of Transportation ( WVDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2009 , WVDOT calculated that as few as 45 @,@ 000 vehicles traveled along the highway at the Virginia state line , and as many as 62 @,@ 500 vehicles used the freeway between County Routes 15 and 13 in Martinsburg . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire route is listed on the National Highway System , a system of roads that are important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 I @-@ 81 roughly parallels the Great Indian Warpath , an old Indian trail which connected New York to the Carolina Piedmont via Virginia and West Virginia . A series of roads linking Virginia to Maryland through Martinsburg were present on maps as early as 1873 . 
 Bids for construction of I @-@ 81 by WVDOT were published in 1959 , with a budget of about $ 10 @.@ 6 million to complete the highway . Completion of I @-@ 81 in Virginia up to the West Virginia state line was completed by the Virginia Department of Transportation in November 1965 . The first 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of the highway through West Virginia were completed between 1959 and 1963 . The construction of the remaining 20 miles ( 32 km ) of Interstate Highway through the Eastern Panhandle was completed by 1966 .

 = Literature in early modern Scotland = 
 Literature in early modern Scotland is literature written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid @-@ eighteenth century . By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language , confined to the Highlands and Islands , but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived . Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population . The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity . 
 James IV 's creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets , or makars , who were mainly clerics . These included Gavin Douglas , whose Eneados ( 1513 ) was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language . James V was also a major patron of poets . George Buchanan founded a tradition of neo @-@ Latin poetry . In the reign of Mary , Queen of Scots and the minority of her son James VI , cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil . The Kirk discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature but secular poetry survived . In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted literature in Scots . He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish court poets and musicians , later called the Castalian Band . David Lyndsay 's The Thrie Estaitis ( 1540 ) is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation . Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre , but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium . There were isolated Scottish plays , but the system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland . 
 The accession of James VI to the English throne in 1603 meant a loss of the court as a centre of patronage and he increasingly favoured the language of southern England . A number of Scottish poets accompanied the king to London , where they began to anglicise their written language . As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined , a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge , often undertaken by women . The tradition of neo @-@ Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the <unk> Poetarum Scotorum ( 1637 ) . This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets , such as Elizabeth Melville , whose Ane Godlie Dream ( 1603 ) was the first book published by a woman in Scotland . This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland . From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors . 
 After the Union in 1707 , the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education . Allan Ramsay led a " vernacular revival " that laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature . He also led the trend for pastoral poetry and his pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era . Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English . Tobias Smollett was a poet , essayist , satirist and playwright , but is best known for his picaresque novels , for which he is often seen as Scotland 's first novelist . The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry that mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands . Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London . In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors , but there were clashes with the Kirk . Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Edinburgh , but it closed soon after the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act . A new theatre was opened at <unk> in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s . 
 = = Sixteenth century = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language , confined to the Highlands and Islands . The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland , with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty , who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the <unk> of Clanranald , still working in the early eighteenth century . Nevertheless , interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders . Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots , which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population . Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English , with Gaelic and French influences . It was usually called Inglyshe and was very close to the language spoken in northern England , but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England . From the mid sixteenth century , written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England . With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England , most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion . 
 The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity . The first Scottish press was established in <unk> in Edinburgh by the merchant Walter <unk> ( c . 1473 – c . 1528 ) and the bookseller Andrew <unk> ( fl . 1505 – 08 ) . Although the first press was relatively short lived , beside law codes and religious works , the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish makars before its demise , probably about 1510 . The next recorded press was that of Thomas Davidson ( f . 1532 – 42 ) , the first in a long line of " king 's printers " , who also produced editions of works of the makars .

 James IV 's ( r . 1488 – 1513 ) creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets . These court poets , or makars , who were mainly clerics included Robert Henryson ( c . 1450 @-@ c . 1505 ) , who re @-@ worked Medieval and Classical sources , such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The <unk> <unk> . William Dunbar ( 1460 – 1513 ) produced satires , lyrics , invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind . Gavin Douglas ( 1475 – 1522 ) , who became Bishop of Dunkeld , injected humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry . The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas 's version of Virgil 's Aeneid , the Eneados . It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language , finished in 1513 , but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden that brought the reign to an end . 
 As a patron of poets and authors James V ( r . 1513 – 42 ) supported William Stewart and John Bellenden , who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece , into verse and prose . David Lyndsay ( c . 1486 – 1555 ) , diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court , was a prolific poet . He wrote elegiac narratives , romances and satires . George Buchanan ( 1506 – 82 ) had a major influence as a Latin poet , founding a tradition of neo @-@ Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century . Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland ( 1537 – 95 ) , reformer Andrew Melville ( 1545 – 1622 ) , John Johnston ( 1570 ? – 1611 ) and David Hume of <unk> ( 1558 – 1629 ) . 
 From the 1550s , in the reign of Mary , Queen of Scots ( r . 1542 – 67 ) and the minority of her son James VI ( r . 1567 – 1625 ) , cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil . The Kirk , heavily influenced by Calvinism , also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature . Nevertheless , poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington ( 1496 – 1586 ) , who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar ; John Rolland ( fl . 1530 – 75 ) , who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume ( c . 1556 – 1609 ) , whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse . Alexander Scott 's ( ? 1520 – 82 / 3 ) use of short verse designed to be sung to music , opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI 's adult reign . 
 Unlike many of his predecessors , James VI actively despised Gaelic culture . However , in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots . His treatise , Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody , published in 1584 when he was aged 18 , was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue , to which he applied Renaissance principles . He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians , later called the Castalian Band , which included William Fowler ( c . 1560 – 1612 ) , John Stewart of <unk> ( c . 1545 – c . 1605 ) , and Alexander Montgomerie ( c . 1550 – 98 ) . They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms , including sonnets and short sonnets , for narrative , nature description , satire and meditations on love . Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander ( c . 1567 – 1640 ) , Alexander Craig ( c . 1567 – 1627 ) and Robert Ayton ( 1570 – 1627 ) . By the late 1590s the king 's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne . 
 = = = Dramatists = = = 
 Lyndsay produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540 , which satirised the corruption of church and state , and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation . Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as <unk> and <unk> , which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo @-@ classical tradition in French drama , but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium . The anonymous The Maner of the <unk> of ane Play ( before 1568 ) and <unk> ( published in London in 1603 ) , are isolated examples of surviving plays . The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors , probably designed for court performance for Mary , Queen of Scots or James VI . The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland , but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599 . 
 = = Seventeenth century = = 
 = = = Poetry = = = 
 Having extolled the virtues of Scots " poesie " , after his accession to the English throne , James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England . In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English Authorised King James Version of the Bible . In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now " not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther " . Jenny Wormald described James as creating a " three @-@ tier system , with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top " . The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature . A number of Scottish poets , including William Alexander , John Murray and Robert Aytoun , accompanied the king to London , where they continued to write , but they soon began to anglicise their written language . James 's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama , which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign , but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined . The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king 's departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden ( 1585 – 1649 ) . 
 As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined , a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge . While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century , the vernacular continued to develop . In contrast to the Classical tradition , which used syllabic metre , vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre . However , they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role , as the verse was still often panegyric . A number of these vernacular poets were women , such as Mary MacLeod of Harris ( c . 1615 – 1707 ) . 
 The tradition of neo @-@ Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the <unk> Poetarum Scotorum ( 1637 ) , published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston ( <unk> – 1641 ) and Sir John Scott of <unk> ( 1585 – 1670 ) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan . This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets . Elizabeth Melville 's ( f . 1585 – 1630 ) Ane Godlie Dream ( 1603 ) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland . Anna Hume , daughter of David Hume of <unk> , adapted Petrarch as Triumphs of Love : <unk> : Death ( 1644 ) . 
 This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland . Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century , including " Sir Patrick Spens " and " Thomas the Rhymer " , but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century . They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed , often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks , later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott . From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill ( c . 1595 @-@ c . 1665 ) , Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw ( 1627 – 1727 ) and Lady Grizel Baillie ( 1645 – 1746 ) . 
 = = = Theatre = = = 
 The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk 's dislike of theatre , which struggled to survive in Scotland . However , it was not entirely extinguished . The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas . Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander 's <unk> Tragedies , written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603 . They were closet dramas , designed to be read rather than performed , and already indicate Alexander 's preference for southern English over the Scots language . There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama . In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote Marciano or the Discovery , a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war . It was performed at the Tennis @-@ Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie , Earl of Rothes . Thomas <unk> 's <unk> 's Wiles or the Coffee House , was first performed in London in 1667 and then in Edinburgh the year after and drew on Spanish comedy . A relative of <unk> , physician Archibald <unk> ( 1652 – 1713 ) wrote The Assembly or Scotch Reformation ( 1692 ) , a ribald satire on the morals of the Presbyterian Kirk , circulating in manuscript , but not published until 1722 , helping to secure the association between Jacobitism and professional drama that discouraged the creation of professional theatre .

 After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England , the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education . Nevertheless , Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working @-@ class Scots . Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation . Allan Ramsay ( 1686 – 1758 ) was considered the most important literary figure of the era , often described as leading a " vernacular revival " . He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature , publishing The Ever Green ( 1724 ) , a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period . He led the trend for pastoral poetry , helping to develop the Habbie stanza , which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a poetic form . His Tea @-@ Table Miscellany ( 1724 – 37 ) contained poems old Scots folk material , his own poems in the folk style and " <unk> " of Scots poems in the English neo @-@ classical style . His pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era . He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital . 
 = = = Verse and prose = = = 
 Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English . These included William Hamilton of <unk> ( c . 1665 – 1751 ) , Robert Crawford ( 1695 – 1733 ) , Alexander Ross ( 1699 – 1784 ) , the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour ( 1704 – 54 ) , socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn ( 1712 – 94 ) , and poet and playwright James Thompson 's ( 1700 – 48 ) , most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons . Tobias Smollett ( 1721 – 71 ) was a poet , essayist , satirist and playwright , but is best known for his picaresque novels , such as The Adventures of Roderick Random ( 1748 ) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle ( 1751 ) for which he is often seen as Scotland 's first novelist . His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens . 
 The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry . Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay ( 1714 – 78 ) and Donnchadh <unk> Mac an t @-@ Saoir ( Duncan Ban MacIntyre ) ( 1724 – 1812 ) . The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac <unk> Alasdair ( Alasdair MacDonald ) ( c . 1698 – 1770 ) . His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem Clanranald 's Gallery . He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands , including Thompson 's Seasons , which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic , which was not focused on their relations to human concerns . 
 = = = Drama = = = 
 Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as Catherine Trotter ( 1679 – 1749 ) , born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen . Her plays and included the verse @-@ tragedy Fatal Friendship ( 1698 ) , the comedy Love at a Loss ( 1700 ) and the history The Revolution in Sweden ( 1706 ) . David Crawford 's ( 1665 – 1726 ) plays included the Restoration comedies Courtship A @-@ la @-@ Mode ( 1700 ) and Love at First Sight ( 1704 ) . These developed the character of the stage Scot , often a clown , but cunning and loyal . Newburgh Hamilton ( 1691 – 1761 ) , born in Ireland of Scottish descent , produced the comedies The Petticoat @-@ <unk> ( 1712 ) and The <unk> Lovers or The Libertine ( 1715 ) . He later wrote the libretto for Handel 's Samson ( 1743 ) , closely based on John Milton 's Samson Agonistes . James Thompson 's plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings , included Sophonisba ( 1730 ) , Agamemnon ( 1738 ) and <unk> and <unk> ( 1745 ) , the last of which was an international success . David Mallet 's ( c . 1705 – 65 ) Eurydice ( 1731 ) was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the Walpole administration . The opera Masque of Alfred ( 1740 ) was a collaboration between Thompson , Mallet and composer Thomas Arne , with Thompson supplying the lyrics for the his most famous work , the patriotic song Rule , Britannia ! 
 In Scotland a troop of English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they performed Macbeth and a series of Restoration comedies , but they soon left , perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries . By 1725 English actor Anthony Aston , a friend of Ramsay , was performing in Edinburgh , but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish Master of the Revels , who licensed plays , companies and playhouses , and soon left . In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the Admonition and Exhortation . The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee , Montrose , Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor 's Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent . Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in <unk> 's Close in Edinburgh , but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed . A new theatre was opened at <unk> in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s . 
 = Ridge Racer Revolution = 
 Ridge Racer Revolution is an arcade racing game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation in 1995 . It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge Racer ( the arcade sequel is Ridge Racer 2 ) . Like the original Ridge Racer , the player races computer @-@ controlled cars with the objective of winning a series of races , and supports Namco 's NeGcon controller . Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars , and two @-@ player support via the PlayStation Link cable , and took roughly the same time to develop as the first . The intention was to increase the depth and add features . 
 The game borrows most of its soundtrack from Ridge Racer 2 . Ridge Racer Revolution was re @-@ released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best range in June 1997 , and for the Platinum Range in PAL regions the following year . The game received generally positive reviews , although some criticised its similarity to the original . Ridge Racer Revolution was followed by a sequel , Rage Racer , in 1996 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay system remains unchanged from Ridge Racer , with its checkpoint and time @-@ limit system remaining the same ; running out of time ends the game and passing through checkpoints grants additional time , although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2 . The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission . Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco 's NeGcon controller , and adds a rear @-@ view mirror when using the in @-@ car view . The game consists of three courses : ' Novice ' , ' Intermediate ' ( also called ' Advanced ' ) , and ' Expert ' , each having different sections opened , and incorporates modes from the original game ; Race , against eleven opponents , and Time Trial , against one . Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode : Free Run , in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving . There is no lap limit . How fast the cars run depends on which of the four speed grades is used . The grade is selectable in Free Run , and can be unlocked for Race . It is not available in Time Trial . A new feature of the game is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place . This is not available at the start of the game . Ridge Racer Revolution features a two @-@ player link @-@ up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racer 's courses known as ' Special 1 ' and ' Special 2 ' . There are two modes in two @-@ player link @-@ up : Race , which is identical to its single @-@ player counterpart , and Versus , where only the players race against each other . Versus features a handicap option , which increases the speed of the trailing car . 
 Like the first Ridge Racer , the player normally starts with four cars . The remaining eight are selectable upon winning the mini game before the title screen ( the mini game is Galaga ' 88 instead of the original game 's Galaxian ) . They are mostly unchanged ; their names ( certain cars are named after other Namco titles ) and specifications are similar to the first game . After the player wins the first three circuits , reversed versions are unlocked , and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car . There are three secret cars ; the ' 13th Racing ' ( from the first Ridge Racer ) of the Novice course , and the new ' 13th Racing Kid ' ( of the Intermediate course ) and ' White Angel ' ( of the Expert course ) . These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course 's Time Trial race . 
 Ridge Racer Revolution features two hidden modes ; ' Drift Contest ' , where the player earns points according to how well spins are performed on certain corners , and ' Pretty Racer ' ( also known as ' Buggy mode ' ) , in which the cars become buggies . Pocket Racer was inspired by this . Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original are accessible . As with the first game , the player can insert a music CD which can be listened to instead of the soundtrack . Unlike the first game , only the last course played is loaded into the PlayStation 's memory ; to switch , the player would need to reinsert the game disc before loading . 
 = = Development = = 
 Ridge Racer Revolution was developed over eight months by a team of more than twenty people , most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution . The biggest difficulties were the link @-@ up mode , rear @-@ view mirror , and running the game at high speeds . Each member had worked on other console games , and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique . The team wanted players to enjoy a more in @-@ depth game than the original , so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2 , as many features as possible were added . The early designs for the new courses were made in a ' free run ' programme , and used to see how fast the cars went . The rear @-@ view mirror was added primarily with the two player link @-@ up mode in mind . The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2 , and as a result , the sound was finished more quickly than the game . Soundtrack composition involved four musicians , who composed for Ridge Racer , Ridge Racer 2 , and Rave Racer . The team kept exploring the PlayStation 's capabilities to solve the high speed problem , although were confident it was possible . The designer , Hiroyuki <unk> , commented that designing an original course was a challenge , and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split @-@ screen multiplayer mode , so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation 's link @-@ up instead .

 The game was a bestseller in the UK . The additional features and improvements over the original in particular were given high praise . Coming Soon Magazine praised its multiplayer mode , saying it " will furnish many hours of competitive fun ! " , and in their conclusion remarked that the game " is an excellent racing game that will yield much excitement and challenges " . Absolute PlayStation praised its playability , its ' greatly ' improved artificial Intelligence , and the two @-@ player link @-@ up feature . Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that it is even better than the original due to the cleaner graphics and improved handling on the cars , which makes them easier to control . Maximum acknowledged the similarity to the original Ridge Racer but gave it a strong recommendation , arguing that removal of the slowdown and track updating of the original , the unlockables , and the two @-@ player mode make it worth buying . They concluded by remarking that the game is " an instantly playable arcade racer that oozes options and playability " . 
 The Electric Playground complimented the additions and improvements , including the " much improved " graphics and the scene changes , about which it was commented that it was a " serious improvement " . They commented that the colours are " sharp and pretty " , and the link @-@ up multiplayer mode , remarking that " Linked RR Revolution is worth the buy alone " , although the remixed music tracks were criticised because they " pale greatly in comparison to the original tracks " . <unk> commented that the new tracks are " always challenging and fun to race " and praised Free Run , saying it 's a " great way to learn the tracks " . GamePro praised the game , saying " Ridge Racer Revolution certainly upholds the Ridge Racer tradition by doing exactly what it should : It surpasses the original " , and Computer and Video Games Magazine commented that the game is " Everything Ridge Racer maniacs could have wanted from a sequel " . 
 Hugh <unk> of GameSpot was more critical . He called it " a clone of the original " , and criticised the lack of split @-@ screen multiplayer .

 " Soul Sound " was written by the Scottish musician Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya . Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa , a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child . According to Cumming , " In Africa I feel extremely alive , but also very small . The song was the essence of how I felt : seeing the beauty and horror of a place , and going into a heightened state . " She elaborated , " My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling , which is why they can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa " . 
 Cumming had spent a year with the Sugababes while they recorded their debut studio album One Touch ( 2000 ) ; according to the Daily Record , the trio 's management were desperate for them to sing " Soul Sound " . The song was produced by Ron Tom , who mixed and programmed it in collaboration with Mark Frank . Individuals who provide backing vocals on the song include Xavier Barnet and the Kenyan @-@ born British singer <unk> . " Soul Sound " was recorded at the Matrix Recording Studios in London , England . 
 " Soul Sound " is a pop record that experiments with pop @-@ rock balladry . The song features guitar and bass instrumentation , and according to the Daily Mail , evokes the music of harmony groups from the 1960s . John Mulvey of NME <unk> the song as having " tasteful slippery beats , tasteful acoustic guitars , [ and ] the usual indolent harmonies " .

If we manage to incorporate even a hint of that in our own music , we should appeal to quite an adult audience . We were all very nervous at all the gigs , but that was just because we were so worried about it going well . 
 According to Kitty Empire of NME , during the performance , " ' Soul Sound ' [ grew ] lovelier with every croon of its chorus " . Later that month , the trio performed the song at London 's Notre Dame Hall as part of a set list . The Guardian 's John Aizlewood commented that during its performance , the group " [ created ] a tidal wave of melody " .

 The group 's members were dissatisfied with the release of " Soul Sound " as a single , because they wanted to venture into an R & B sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction . Soon after the song 's release , Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range , making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals . Further , the sales of One Touch and its last three singles , " New Year " , " Run for Cover " and " Soul Sound " , failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped . Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song 's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because , saying : " Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out " . " Soul Sound " was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch , which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze , Jr. and Jessica Biel .

 = Miguel Treviño Morales = 
 Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales ( born 18 November 1970 ) , commonly referred to by his alias Z @-@ 40 , is a former Mexican drug lord and leader of the criminal organization known as Los Zetas . Considered a violent and dangerous criminal , he was one of Mexico 's most @-@ wanted drug lords until his arrest in July 2013 . 
 Born into a family with six brothers and six sisters , Treviño Morales began his criminal career as a teenager , working for Los Tejas — a local gang from his hometown of Nuevo Laredo , Tamaulipas . His fluent English and experience of moving contraband along the U.S. – Mexico border enabled him to be recruited in the late 1990s by the drug lord Osiel Cárdenas Guillén , who headed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas . Around 2005 , he was appointed as the regional boss of Los Zetas in Nuevo Laredo and was given the task to fight off the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel , which was attempting to take over the lucrative drug trafficking routes to the United States . After successfully securing these routes in Nuevo Laredo in 2006 , Treviño Morales was moved to Veracruz and appointed as the Zetas leader in the state after the death of the drug lord Efraín Teodoro Torres . Two years later , his boss Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano sent him to Guatemala to wipe out his competitors ; after completing the task successfully , he appointed Treviño Morales as the national commander of Los Zetas in 2008 . In 2010 , Los Zetas gained their independence from the Gulf Cartel , their former allies , and both organizations went to war with each other . 
 As the national commander of Los Zetas , Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials and citizens throughout Mexico . The Mexican authorities believe that he is responsible for a significant part of the violence in Mexico , including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011 . A common torture method of his was known as guiso ( stew ) , in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels , doused with gasoline and burned alive . Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012 , Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal power struggle within the organization . 
 Mexican Marines arrested Treviño Morales on 15 July 2013 in the state of Nuevo León without a single bullet being fired . At the time of his capture , the Mexican government was offering up to a 30 million pesos ( US $ 2 @.@ 3 million ) reward for information leading to his arrest . The United States Department of <unk> offering up to US $ 5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction . Authorities on both sides of the border believe that he was succeeded by his younger brother Omar Treviño Morales , a man who was also on the most @-@ wanted list . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales was born on 18 November 1970 in Nuevo Laredo , Tamaulipas , Mexico . His parents , Rodolfo Treviño and María <unk> Morales , created a large family with six daughters and seven sons , including Miguel . Like many families along the U.S.-Mexico border , the Treviño family travelled from Mexico to the United States and vice versa , where they bought properties and opened several businesses . His father abandoned his family at a very young age , forcing Treviño Morales to single @-@ handedly raise the whole family . Treviño Morales grew up in a lower @-@ class neighborhood in Nuevo Laredo , but as a teenager , he worked for the wealthy by fixing their yards and washing their cars . He also did chores for the local drug lord Héctor Manuel <unk> Gamboa ( alias El Karis ) , who later became his mentor ; Treviño Morales eventually replaced him as a Zetas leader in Nuevo Laredo . Treviño Morales grew up disliking Mexico 's class disparity and developed so much resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult . Treviño Morales frequented Dallas , Texas with his family . In 1993 , he was apprehended in Dallas County and charged with avoiding police arrest , after he had tried to lose the cops in a police car chase that ended in a street dead end . He paid a $ 672 @-@ dollar fine and was subsequently released from the county prison . Few details are known of Treviño Morales 's life in Dallas ; the U.S. authorities believe he learned about " power , money , weapons and the vast consumer market for illegal drugs " while living in Texas . They also believe that he perceived an anti @-@ Mexican bias among Americans , and especially towards Mexican immigrants like him . However , Treviño Morales considered Dallas his home because of his large family network that lives in the surrounding areas . According to U.S. investigators , he was last seen in the Dallas area in 2005 after entering the United States illegally , where visited his family and was said to have been at a strip club . 
 = = Criminal origins and ascension = = 
 As a teenager , he began to work for Los Tejas , a gang that ran the criminal activities in his hometown of Nuevo Laredo . From washing cars , running errands , and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo , Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade , starting with small @-@ scale drug retail sales and smuggling . Unlike the first members of Los Zetas , he was never in the military . He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border . His fluent English and his criminal contacts on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then @-@ leader of the Gulf Cartel , Osiel Cárdenas Guillén . When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas , Los Tejas , the local gang he once worked for , was absorbed by the former groups . Around 2005 , Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo ; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel , which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area . The Laredo – Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway , which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio , Austin , and Dallas for future drug distribution . While in power , he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom he put on his payroll . Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the potential to become professional assassins for Los Zetas . These recruits , sometimes called <unk> ( " Little Zetas " ) , usually joined organized crime as young as twelve @-@ years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins . 
 By 2006 , the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas managed to defeat the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo . The latter cartel concentrated its efforts in northeastern Mexico , becoming dominant there . Los Zetas started to expand into other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking . Under Treviño Morales , the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States , carried out extortions and kidnappings , sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs , and intimidated and / or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them . Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras , Coahuila , until March 2007 . He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz , shortly after high @-@ ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres ( alias Z @-@ 14 ) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race . Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003 , he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars ; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007 , Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas ' independence from the Gulf Cartel . 
 In November 2007 , the city of Laredo , Texas , issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in connection with a 2006 double homicide in Texas . In 2008 , Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano , the two leaders of Los Zetas , forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel . It had just gone to war with the Sinaloa Cartel , believing that El Chapo Guzmán , their leader , had betrayed them . Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel . Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación ( The Federation ) , an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada , two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel . 
 In February 2008 , Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival drug traffickers and take control of the drug trafficking routes in Guatemala . Reportedly , he carried out a military @-@ like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León <unk> ( alias <unk> ) in March . An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin . Having succeeded outside of Mexico , Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas , a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background . In this position , Treviño Morales had a say in nearly all the decisions Los Zetas made at a national level , creating some resentment among the old @-@ generation commanders of Los Zetas who , unlike him , had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade . 
 = = Leadership position = = 
 Treviño Morales acted as a cartel ' gate @-@ keeper , ' and his people collected a <unk> ( tariff ) at all drug territories controlled by Los Zetas . He controlled the highly lucrative Nuevo Laredo plaza ( turf ) , across the border from Laredo , Texas . He bribed and intimidated officials to help maintain control , and responded to any challenges to his authority or control with brutal violence . Treviño was feared and very few local journalists dared to write about him . He was alleged to favored a torture method known as the guiso ( stew ) , in which people are stuffed into an oil barrel , doused with gasoline , and set on fire to burn alive . His violent behavior gained him " the notoriety of a cult figure . " He reportedly survived gun battles unharmed , avoided making alliances with anyone , dismembered dozens of victims while they were still alive and dumped them , and " seemed unafraid to die . " Organization members claimed that Treviño Morales enjoyed driving around the city in a car , pointing at people randomly and saying , " kill this one and kill that one . " A former hitman who worked for him told the press in 2013 that Treviño Morales could not sleep at night if he did not kill someone . He also said that the drug lord would ask his victims how they wanted to be killed . Journalist Alfredo <unk> , head of The Dallas Morning News in Mexico , wrote in one of his books that Treviño Morales enjoyed eating out the hearts of his victims — even when they were still alive — because he believed that doing that would make him invincible among his enemies and authorities . 
 Treviño Morales reportedly coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico , including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando , Tamaulipas . He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down the plane of the former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas . Although it was not the first time Calderón received death threats from organized crime , the authorities deemed the drug lord 's threat as credible , and urged the President to cancel his trip ( though he ultimately went anyway ) . Under Treviño Morales ' leadership , Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) to be highly sophisticated , advanced , and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere . He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico . 
 Treviño Morales reportedly moved around through Mexico and Central America , and often met with Colombian drug lords in Mexico City , the nation 's capital , to do business . To escape law enforcement notice , he used " caravans " of purported businessmen and religious persons . In the northern part of the country , he reportedly maintained a close tie with a number of politicians . His brother Omar Treviño Morales ( Z @-@ 42 ) leads Los Zetas in the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = Split between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel = = 
 Cárdenas Guillén was arrested in Matamoros , Tamaulipas , in 2003 and extradited to the United States in 2007 . While in prison in Mexico , he reportedly coordinated the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas from his prison cell . But with his extradition , Treviño Morales 's organization experienced a leadership crisis . La Compañía ( The Company ) , a name used to describe the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as a conglomerate , remained in a loose cooperation until early 2010 , when violence erupted between both groups . On 18 January 2010 , several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza ( alias Concord 3 ) , a leader of Los Zetas and close associate and friend of Treviño Morales . When he was held captive , Peña Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf Cartel , but he refused , earning a beating followed by execution , presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego . 
 Treviño Morales heard about the incident and issued an ultimatum to Flores Borrego and Gulf Cartel leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez : 
 Hand over the assassin of my friend , you son of a bitch ... You have until the 25th , if you don 't comply , there will be war . 
 Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders ignored the command , and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge the death of his former comrade . On 30 January 2010 , Treviño Morales kidnapped and slaughtered 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa , Tamaulipas , marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas , Nuevo León , and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths . Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand , forging a reputation as Mexico 's most violent drug trafficking organization . It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization . With Treviño Morales as the second @-@ in @-@ command of the criminal organization , Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories . 
 = = Infighting in Los Zetas = = 
 In 2011 , however , Treviño Morales 's criminal organization entered a new internal strife after Jesús Enrique <unk> Aguilar ( alias El <unk> ) , one of their highest @-@ ranking leaders , was arrested in July . Though he did not call out any names , he stated that someone within Los Zetas had betrayed him . Shortly thereafter , alleged organized crime members uploaded a <unk> music video on YouTube portraying Treviño Morales " as the New Judas " and accusing him of setting up the arrests and deaths of other commanders within the criminal organization and being disloyal to Lazcano Lazcano , his boss . In several articles published in August 2012 , a U.S. law enforcement official told the press that Treviño Morales had successfully taken the leadership of the cartel and displaced Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , the long @-@ time leader . Treviño Morales began to take over the assets of Los Zetas and was working to remove Lazcano Lazcano as the head since early 2010 . Amidst the Zetas civil war , many high @-@ ranking members in Los Zetas began to fall . High @-@ ranking Zetas leader Iván Velázquez Caballero ( alias El <unk> ) was arrested in September 2012 , presumably set up either by rival gang members or gangsters aligned with a group related to Treviño Morales . On 6 October 2012 , drug lord Salvador Alfonso Martínez Escobedo ( alias La <unk> ) was arrested in Nuevo Laredo by the Mexican Navy . After Velázquez 's fall , a split off group known as Los <unk> ( The Legionaries ) was born in Nuevo Laredo and vowed to bring down Treviño Morales for allegedly betraying him . A second faction from Los Zetas , known as Sangre Zeta ( Zetas Blood ) , also broke up from the organization to join forces against him . 
 The active role of Treviño Morales got him the loyalty and respect of many in Los Zetas , and eventually many stopped paying to Lazcano Lazcano . In order to avoid his arrest or death from betrayal , Lazcano Lazcano reportedly fled the country and lived in Germany and Costa Rica for an unknown time with surrounding rumors that he had terminal cancer . Back in Mexico , Treviño Morales had become the stronger of the two in Los Zetas . Lazcano Lazcano was then killed by the Mexican Navy in the state of Coahuila on 7 October 2012 , and Treviño Morales succeeded him as the top leader of Los Zetas .

 In 2009 in New York and in 2010 in Washington , the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment against Treviño Morales for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine into the United States from Mexico and Guatemala . There was a bounty for him in Mexico set at $ 30 million MXN ( US $ 2 @.@ 3 million ) and another one in the U.S. at US $ 5 million ( $ 62 @.@ 4 million MXN ) .

 A month before his capture , U.S. authorities had been passing down information to their counterparts in Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby . They traded this intelligence information from wiretaps conversations and informants ' tips . Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac , Nuevo León , near the border of Tamaulipas state , at around 3 : 45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired . The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy ; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him , the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught . He was in possession of US $ 2 million ( $ 25 @,@ 316 @,@ 100 MXN ) in cash , eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition ; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody . Rumors of Treviño Morales 's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day , but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest , nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later . 
 At the time of his arrest , Treviño Morales had pending charges for organized crime involvement , drug trafficking , torture , money laundering , and the illegal use of firearms under Mexican law , among other charges . However , he only declared the money and firearms that were confiscated during his arrest . Following his arrest , the drug lord was flown to Mexico City and kept at the <unk> installations , Mexico 's organized crime investigatory agency . On 19 July 2013 , he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez , State of Mexico , via helicopter . On January 2014 , a New York federal district court issued other criminal charges against the drug lord . The investigation alleged that Treviño Morales conspired to order killings against rival gangsters of Los Zetas , members of his own criminal organization , and Mexican policemen and personnel of the Mexican Army from September 2004 to July 2013 . The court , which sought his extradition , also stated that the drug lord conspired to traffic drugs to the U.S.
