 The oil quickly spread along 7 miles ( 11 km ) of the coastline from Arroyo Hondo Creek to the west to El Capitán State Beach on the east . The slick reached four marine protected areas that have significant for their ecological or cultural significance : Naples , <unk> , Campus Point and Goleta Slough . Culturally significant land and artifacts to the Chumash people are also found in this area . 
 An immediate concern of environmentalists was the potential use of chemical dispersants . To keep big slicks from washing ashore , dispersants can be used to break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column . There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life . Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out .

 Plains All American Pipeline stated on May 20 , 2015 that at the time of the spill the pipeline was operating at maximum capacity of 84 @,@ 000 US gallons per hour ( 2 @,@ 000 bbl / h ) . They reported on August 14 , 2015 that a total of 142 @,@ 800 U.S. gallons ( 3 @,@ 400 barrels ) crude oil had leaked from the pipeline . 
 Preliminary reports estimated that 20 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 480 barrels ) to 21 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 500 barrels ) of oil was spilled into the ocean through a highway drainage culvert adjacent to the broken pipeline . The amount of oil reaching the ocean was later revised to over 105 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 2 @,@ 500 barrels ) . A Unified Command ( ICS ) was established consisting of local , state and federal agencies . This included the United States Coast Guard , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , California Department of Fish and Wildlife including the Office of Spill Prevention and Response , and the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Management together with the responsible party , Plains All American Pipeline . The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ordered the pipeline operator to provide them with the ruptured pipe for metallurgical testing in order to establish the condition of the pipe when it failed . All the oil in the pipeline had to be cleaned out before the section could be removed to determine if corrosion , pressure or a series of failures led to the rupture in the pipeline . 
 Scientists from multiple disciplines at the University of California , Santa Barbara and elsewhere began collaborating immediately after the spill . Based on lessons learned from studies of earlier spills , and using refined computer models , they predicted the spill spread and dispersion , including impacts on Los Angeles area beaches . They used his information to provide guidance to cleanup agencies and to monitor the effects on the ecosystem . 
 Some 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) of floating containment boom had been deployed to contain the oil by the next day . Boats and helicopters identified patches of slick in the ocean so cleanup vessels could mop up the oil . More than a dozen vessels corralling and skimming the oil from the water were working in the days immediately following the spill . Three days after the spill more than 650 workers and 17 boats were cleaning the shoreline , gathering up an oily water mixture from the ocean , and hauling away more than 5 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 800 m3 ) of oil @-@ contaminated soil , sand and vegetation from the coastal bluff . A month after the spill , efforts continued to clean the 8 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 13 km ) portion of shoreline that was most heavily damaged . The sandstone cliff face along with large boulders that were splashed by the oil coming out of the culvert were difficult to clean . While sandy beaches farther south were inundated with tar balls , the beaches and rocky shoreline south of the spill had been drenched with a slick of fresh crude oil that had not been in the ocean long enough to be altered into tar balls by the wind and waves . 
 = = = Tar balls = = = 
 Days after the spill , tar balls began washing ashore on beaches down the coast in nearby Summerland and then farther down the coast in Ventura county . Although the source of these tar balls could not be immediately confirmed , the pipeline company sent workers to clean them up . Crews cleaned up coin @-@ sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria , the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach , and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain . 
 Many officials and scientists said at first the tar balls appearance might be a coincidence unrelated to the spill . Coal Oil Point is very close and well known for the offshore seepage of oil at about 4 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 95 barrels ) a day . Tar balls continued to show up on beaches farther down the coast in Los Angeles County including Malibu and the South Bay beaches on Santa Monica Bay . When tested , a tar ball recovered in the South Bay at Manhattan Beach matched the chemical signature of the spilled oil . Cleanup crews responded even farther south to beaches in Orange County . 
 By a month after the spill , 93 % of the approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) of beaches damaged after the spill had been cleaned . The remaining 8 miles ( 13 km ) was the area at the spill site near Refugio State Beach and the rest of the Refugio coastline south of the spill .

 The spill was much smaller than the nearby 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill on January 28 , 1969 in which an oil rig blow @-@ out spilled an estimated 3 @.@ 4 to 4 @.@ 2 million US gallons ( 81 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 bbl ) of crude oil over a ten @-@ day period . 
 The thick crude oil damaged the coats , skin , beaks , and appendages of hundreds of animals . Workers eventually collected 202 dead birds and 99 dead mammals which included at least 46 sea lions and 12 dolphins . The full impact will never be known since animals may travel a distance before succumbing to their injuries . Sixty @-@ five live birds and sixty @-@ three live mammals were rescued . 
 Of the 69 animals freed after being cleaned and nursed back to health , 10 were adult Brown pelicans that were released at Goleta Beach after spending three weeks in San Pedro with a team of scientists from the <unk> Wildlife Care Network that is administered by the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine . In September 2015 , SeaWorld San Diego released the last three sea lions affected by the oil spill at Border Field State Park . Scientists will monitor the movements of some of the sea lions and at least five of the pelicans with satellite transmitters . 
 The spill cleanup occurred during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls . The birds are often found on the beaches along the coast of the Oxnard plain . Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast @-@ moving predators such as sea gulls . Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts . 
 Marine researchers note that mammals and birds get the most attention but smaller creatures at the base of the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil . Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels , barnacles , and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way . When exposed to oil , these organisms suffer 90 % -plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades . 
 Researchers from the University of California , Santa Barbara began collecting samples within hours of the spill to monitor the impact on the marine environment . Researchers and volunteers returned to the area many times to collect additional samples . Since students and researchers had previously used this area for study purposes , baseline data was available . David Valentine , a professor in the university ’ s Department of Earth Science said , “ The discharge of heavy oil at Refugio presents a unique opportunity to discover novel metabolic , genomic and ecological feedbacks among marine microbial communities , heavy oil and ecosystem response . We have the opportunity to study ecosystem changes and microbial reactions from the very early stages through an entire year . It ’ s really rare for scientists to get day zero access to any sort of event like this . ” 
 = = = Economic impact = = = 
 Plains All American Pipeline estimated that the cleanup had cost $ 96 million during a joint oversight hearing of the State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26 , 2015 . Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $ 257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time . This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements . The CEO stated in the report that all but $ 65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shutdown . 
 The economic consequences for the county were more difficult to quantify . The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at at $ 74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region ’ s oil and gas industry to move product through this line . Workers income , property taxes , and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service . The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels . 
 Although lightly populated , recreation brings outdoor enthusiasts to the Gaviota Coast . The spill affected visitors to both public and private facilities in the area . The state closed heavily used El Capitán State Beach for a month , which was finally reopened on June 26 for camping and day use . Refugio State Beach was more heavily damaged and did not reopen until July 17 , 2015 . These two popular parks quickly filled up with summer crowds when they reopened . Eric <unk> , California State Parks sector superintendent said , “ We were booked full the day we opened . Half of the people didn ’ t know we had been closed , which is a good testament to how clean the park was . ” 
 In response to the spill , 138 square miles ( 360 km2 ) of fisheries were closed . The order was lifted after six weeks when the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment determined that the area ’ s seafood was safe to eat and posed “ no significant health threat . ” The closure impacted commercial fishermen and fishing charters . Local commercial fishermen reported that it was tough to sell the fish caught outside of the closed area because of the impression that all of the region ’ s seafood was tainted from the oil spill . There is also a long term concern that the oil may have wiped out the main food source for some sea life in the area . The predominant products from the Santa Barbara region are red sea urchin and red rock crab with an average of $ 11 million in sales revenue per year 
 The estimate of $ 74 million financial impact over three years to the county includes approximately $ 37 million in lost property taxes , $ 32 million in lessened worker income and $ 5 million in reduced federal royalties . This is the result of the region ’ s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903 . Prior to the spill , Exxon , which was the region ’ s biggest oil operator at the time , was on pace to generate approximately $ 636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5 , 2015 had only generated an estimated $ 216 @.@ 6 million . The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled . As of December 2015 , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs . Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies . Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing <unk> in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period . The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly . 
 = = = Legislation = = = 
 Three bills were signed into law in response to the spill . Under a new law , the California Fire Marshall will be required to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years . Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective . Finally , a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best @-@ known technology such as automatic shut @-@ off valves . 
 = = = Litigation = = = 
 Almost a year after the spill , the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury handing down 46 criminal indictments against Plains . The Santa Barbara County District Attorney also announced a misdemeanor count against one of the company ’ s employees . California state Attorney General Kamala Harris , who had also opened a criminal investigation right after spill , said this prosecution will send a message to Plains and to the oil and gas industry in California . 
 The profound economic impacts on local fishermen , who couldn ’ t fish during the fishery closures , led to the filing of several lawsuits . These suits , along with those by homeowners who are alleging losses in property value , were consolidated into a class @-@ action lawsuit against Plains . An additional class @-@ action suit was filed by stockholders claiming Plains provided “ false and misleading statements ” regarding pipeline maintenance and monitoring . 
 Plains All American Pipeline was ordered in March 2016 to stop misleading claimants who sought interim damages . A U.S. District Court issued an order that stated that Plains was misleading " victims towards unwittingly waiving their rights to full recovery " through the class @-@ action lawsuit where they could obtain further compensation . 
 The city of Santa Barbara filed a lawsuit in May 2016 seeking $ 2 @.@ 1 million in compensation from Plains . The media coverage of the spill had created the perception that the oil spill in the city of Santa Barbara rather than 20 miles ( 32 km ) away in Santa Barbara County according to the city officials . This discouraged visitors during the peak tourism season , losing the city millions of dollars in tax revenue . 
 The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was requested to provide all records regarding the internal inspection of Line 901 conducted in 2012 and details of all other inspections since 2013 such as maintenance data , monitoring information , incident reports and repair logs . The Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara ( EDC ) , who had requested the release of the records along with the Santa Barbara <unk> , filed a lawsuit against the agency in December 2015 since it had been over six months and they had not received any of the requested documents . 
 = = = Regulations = = = 
 The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) is responsible for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation . In the months following the spill , they found that the in @-@ line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 has miscalculated the degree of corrosion . The company also withheld in @-@ line inspection data so “ it could enhance its interpretation of the data , ” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA . In October , PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies . 
 = Battle of Vijithapura = 
 The Battle of Vijithapura was a decisive and major battle in the campaign carried out by Sri Lankan king Dutthagamani against the invading South Indian king Elara . The battle is documented in detail in the ancient chronicles of the country . However , they only provide the viewpoint of Dutthagamani and his army , and details are scarce on Elara 's side . 
 After launching a campaign to regain the country from Elara , Dutthagamani captured a number of his strongholds before coming to the fortified city of Vijithapura . A four @-@ month siege ensued , followed by a large assault where Dutthagamani 's champions and royal elephant played a major part . The chronicles focus a lot on these ten champions , and vividly describe some unusual " tests " that Dutthagamani carried out to find out their skills . 
 The battle ended in victory for Dutthagamani 's forces and considerably weakened Elara 's army , ultimately leading to his defeat and death . The exact location of Vijithapura is unknown , though historians have made some speculations on this . The battle is still regarded by Sri Lankans as a legendary event in the country 's history , and has even been compared with victories of the Sri Lanka Army during the country 's civil war . 
 = = Records = = 
 Dutthagamani 's campaign against Elara is given in detail in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka ; Mahavamsa , Dipavamsa , Rajavaliya and <unk> . All of them describe the battle in detail , and apply a high importance to it . Dutthagamani is a hero in these chronicles , and his campaign is depicted as a " holy war " aimed at restoring Buddhism in the country . Therefore , these accounts are favourably biased to him , and the description of the Battle of Vijithapura , along with the rest of the campaign , is a mix of fact and legend . However , historians agree that the basic facts from these chronicles are accurate . The one sided accounts given in the chronicles mean that there is very little information to be obtained on Elara and his armies . According to Orientalist Wilhelm Geiger , who translated the Mahavamsa , the problem is " not what is said but what is left unsaid " . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the time of the battle , Elara was the king of Anuradhapura . He was a Chola prince from South India , who had defeated the Sinhalese ruler <unk> in an invasion . Although an invader , Elara is described as a just ruler who had even patronized Buddhism . Most of the country came under this Tamil king 's rule , while his rival Kavan Tissa , a Sinhala king from <unk> in the south of the country , organized a resistance against him . Kavan Tissa 's son , Dutthagamani , ascended to the throne after the death of his father . 
 Soon after he became the king in Ruhuna , Dutthagamani launched a campaign against Elara with the intention of " restoring and glorifying Buddhism " in the country . After setting out from <unk> and crossing the Mahaweli river , Dutthagamani captured a number of forts and cities that were under Elara , and killed several of his generals . The ancient chronicles refer to all of the chieftains or generals defeated by Dutthagamani as <unk> ( Tamils ) . However , it is unlikely that all of them were indeed Tamils , and it is possible that one of them — whose name is given as <unk> — may even have been a stepbrother of Dutthagamani himself who had later joined Elara . 
 = = = Vijithapura = = = 
 After these victories , Dutthagamani 's army marched on to the " great fortress of Vijithapura " . Dutthagamani followed a road between Sigiriya and Minneriya to take his army there ; a road that had been used by Pandukabhaya , a previous ruler , in his military campaigns as well . 
 The city of Vijithapura , which the Mahavamsa refers to as <unk> Nagara , had been founded nearly three hundred years ago by the brother in law of king <unk> . By the time of the battle , it had become a well @-@ fortified stronghold of Elara . It is said to have been surrounded by three moats and a wall with a height of 18 cubits . The wall had four wrought iron gates on the north , south , east and west . The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to Anuradhapura . 
 The control of Vijithapura was essential to both sides . The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara 's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist <unk> 's advance . For Dutthagamani 's forces , the capture of the city would mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura . 
 = = Siege = = 
 Surviving troops of Elara 's forces from previous battles retreated to Vijithapura , further strengthening its defenses . Dutthagamani 's army also arrived and pitched camp close to the fortress . The open stretch of land where they camped later came to be known as <unk> <unk> or <unk> . They carried out regular assaults against the fortress while the defenders also made occasional sorties , but none of them were able to sway the battle in favour of either side . After laying siege on the city for four months , plans were laid to launch an assault using the entire army . Dutthagamani 's army was led by his ten champions or generals , known as the " Ten Giant Warriors " , who were to play a significant part in the battle to come . 
 = = = Testing the warriors = = = 
 The ancient chronicles mention two tests that Dutthagamani planned to find out these warriors ' skill before the battle . For the first test , Dutthagamani asked the warriors to drink a large cauldron of toddy , intending to test their strength . When all others refused , <unk> stepped forward and drank the entire cauldron without any effort . The second test was to test Nandimithra , the commander of the army . Dutthagamani had his royal elephant , Kandula , infuriated and set on Nandimithra . However , the warrior stood his ground and taking the elephant by its tusks , pushed it to the ground . Thus clearing all doubts as to the abilities and skill of his warriors , Dutthagamani sounded the war drums and raising his flags , started the assault to take Vijithapura . 
 = = Final assault = = 
 Dutthagamani 's army attacked all four gates of the city simultaneously . He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra , <unk> and the elephant Kandula , while the attacks on the northern and western gates were led by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The eastern gate was attacked by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The defenders of the eastern gates were routed by <unk> after a cavalry attack , and Elara 's forces withdrew into the city . 
 Elara 's archers , shooting from the walls , inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers , while soldiers on top of the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by <unk> down molten metal on them . The elephant Kandula , attempting to break the southern gate , was injured in such an attack . After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides , Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall . The wall was breached and Dutthagamani 's army entered the city . The ten champions , unwilling to enter through an opening made by another , destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city . Led by them , Dutthagamani 's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura . The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The capture of Vijithapura paved the way for Dutthagamani 's army to advance on to Anuradhapura , and they proceeded immediately afterwards , capturing two more of Elara 's strongholds on the way . In the battle for Anuradhapura , Dutthagamani killed Elara in single combat and became the king of Anuradhapura , bringing the entire country under his rule . 
 = = Modern culture and studies = = 
 The battle of Vijithapura is a legendary battle in Sri Lankan history and a significant milestone in Dutthagamani 's campaign to restore Buddhism in the country . It is often referred to as Vijithapura maha <unk> ( the great battle of Vijithapura ) . After the ending of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 , General Sarath <unk> , the then commander of the Sri Lanka Army , compared several battles they fought to that of Vijithapura . 
 The exact location of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain . A village with the same name near the ancient <unk> reservoir may have been the place where the battle took place . There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani 's soldiers to sharpen their swords However , other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to <unk> near Polonnaruwa , where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found . 
 = Splendid fairywren = 
 The splendid fairywren ( Malurus splendens ) , also known simply as the splendid wren or more colloquially in Western Australia as the blue wren , is a passerine bird of the Maluridae family . It is found across much of the Australian continent from central @-@ western New South Wales and southwestern Queensland over to coastal Western Australia . It inhabits predominantly arid and semi @-@ arid regions . Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism , the male in breeding plumage is a small , long @-@ tailed bird of predominantly bright blue and black colouration . Non @-@ breeding males , females and juveniles are predominantly grey @-@ brown in colour ; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull @-@ coloured birds were taken for females . It comprises several similar all @-@ blue and black subspecies that were originally considered separate species . 
 Like other fairywrens , the splendid fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics ; birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous , meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female , each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such trysts . Male wrens pluck pink or purple petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display . 
 The habitat of the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub , generally with ample vegetation for shelter . Unlike the eastern superb fairywren , it has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas . The splendid fairywren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The splendid fairywren is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus , commonly known as fairywrens , found in Australia and lowland New Guinea . Within the genus it is most closely related to the superb fairywren . These two " blue wrens " are closely related to the purple @-@ crowned fairywren of north @-@ western Australia . 
 Specimens were initially collected at King George Sound , and the splendid fairywren then described as Saxicola splendens by the French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830 , three years before John Gould gave it the scientific name of Malurus pectoralis and vernacular name of banded superb @-@ warbler . Though he correctly placed it in the genus Malurus , the specific name of the former authors took priority . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin splendens , which means " shining " . Like other fairywrens , the splendid fairywren is unrelated to the true wren . It was first classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae by Richard Bowdler Sharpe , though it was later placed in the warbler family Sylviidae by the same author , before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975 . More recently , DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae ( honeyeaters ) , and the Pardalotidae in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Current taxonomy recognises four subspecies : M. s. splendens in Western Australia , M. s. musgravei in central Australia ( subspecies previously recognised as M. s. callainus ) , M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. <unk> in southwestern Queensland . Initially , the three were considered separate species as they were described far from their borders with other subspecies . However , as the interior of Australia was explored , it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped . Thus in 1975 , the first three forms below were reclassified as subspecies of Malurus splendens . 
 M. s. splendens , known as the <unk> or banded fairywren , is found in much of central and southern Western Australia . This was the original form named by Quoy and Gaimard in 1830 . 
 M. s. melanotus , known as the black @-@ backed fairywren , was described by John Gould in 1841 as a separate species . It is found in the mallee country of South Australia ( Sedan area north @-@ east of Adelaide ) through western Victoria , western New South Wales and into south western Queensland . It differs from the nominate subspecies in having a black back and whitish lower belly . 
 M. s. musgravei was described in 1922 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews as a separate species from the Lake Eyre Basin in central Australia . It is found in mulga and mallee country across much of South Australia and the southern Northern Territory . It has lighter blue or turquoise upperparts than the splendid fairywren , as well as a black rump . This is largely synonymous with what was known as M. callainus or the turquoise fairywren which had been collected by ornithologist Samuel White and named by John Gould in 1867 . The original collection bearing the name callainus was deemed a hybrid between what is now called musgravei and melanotus , and hence musgravei was resurrected as the name for the turquoise fairywren . 
 M. s. <unk> was described from southwestern Queensland and given subspecific status in the 1999 review by Schodde and Mason . It was named after Angus Emmott , a farmer and amateur biologist in western Queensland . 
 = = = Evolutionary history = = = 
 In his 1982 monograph , ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens . At some time in the past it was split into southwestern ( splendid ) and southeastern ( superb ) enclaves . As the southwest was dryer than the southeast , once conditions were more favourable , the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas . These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap . This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to <unk> . Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified . 
 = = Description = = 
 The splendid fairywren is a small , long @-@ tailed bird 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long . Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism , the breeding male is distinctive with a bright blue forehead and ear coverts , a violet throat and deeper rich blue back wings , chest and tail with a black bill , eye band and chest band . The blue breeding plumage of the male is often referred to as nuptial plumage . The non @-@ breeding male is brown with blue in the wings and a bluish tail . The female resembles the non @-@ breeding male but has a chestnut bill and eye @-@ patch . Immature males will moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching , though this may be incomplete with residual brownish plumage and may take another year or two to perfect . Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding , with males assuming an eclipse non @-@ breeding plumage . They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring . Some older males have remained blue all year , moulting directly from one year 's nuptial plumage to the next . Breeding males ' blue plumage , particularly the ear @-@ coverts , is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules . The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly , and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens , whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum . The call is described as a gushing reel ; this is harsher and louder than other fairywrens and varies from individual to individual . A soft single trrt serves as a contact call within a foraging group , while the alarm call is a tsit . Cuckoos and other intruders may be greeted with a threat posture and churring threat . Females emit a purr while brooding . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The splendid fairywren is widely distributed in the arid and semi @-@ arid zones of Australia . Habitat is typically dry and shrubby ; mulga and mallee in drier parts of the country and forested areas in the southwest . The western subspecies splendens and eastern black @-@ backed fairywren ( subspecies melanotus ) are largely sedentary , although the turquoise fairywren ( subspecies musgravei ) is thought to be partially nomadic . Unlike the eastern superb fairywren , the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas . Forestry plantations of pine ( Pinus spp . ) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Like all fairywrens , the splendid fairywren is an active and restless feeder , particularly on open ground near shelter , but also through the lower foliage . Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces , with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail , which is usually held upright and rarely still . The short , rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights , though not for extended jaunts . However , splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens . During spring and summer , birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song . Insects are numerous and easy to catch , which allows the birds to rest between forays . The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day . Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously . 
 Groups of two to eight splendid fairywrens remain in their territory and defend it year @-@ round . Territories average 4 @.@ 4 ha ( 11 acres ) in woodland @-@ heath areas ; size decreases with increasing density of vegetation and increases with the number of males in the group . The group consists of a socially monogamous pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory , though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair . Splendid fairywrens are sexually promiscuous , each partner mating with other individuals and even assisting in raising the young from such trysts . Over a third of offspring are the result of an ' extramarital ' mating . Helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young . Birds in a group roost side @-@ by @-@ side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening . 
 Major nest predators include Australian magpies ( Gymnorhina tibicen ) , butcherbirds ( Cracticus spp . ) , laughing kookaburra ( Dacelo novaeguineae ) , currawongs ( Strepera spp . ) , crows and ravens ( Corvus spp . ) , shrike @-@ thrushes ( Colluricincla spp . ) as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) , cat ( Felis catus ) and black rat ( Rattus rattus ) . Like other species of fairy wrens , splendid fairywrens may use a ' rodent @-@ run ' display to distract predators from nests with young birds . While doing this , the head , neck and tail of the bird are lowered , the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The splendid fairywren is predominantly insectivorous ; its diet includes a wide range of small creatures , mostly arthropods such as ants , grasshoppers , crickets , spiders and bugs . This is supplemented by small quantities of seeds , flowers , and fruit . They mostly forage on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres above the ground ; this has been termed ' hop @-@ searching ' . Unusually for fairywrens , they may also occasionally forage in the canopy of flowering gums . Birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups as this foraging practice does render them vulnerable to a range of predators . Food can be scarce in winter and ants are an important ' last resort ' option , constituting a much higher proportion of the diet . Adult fairywrens feed their young a different diet , conveying larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers to nestlings . 
 = = = Courtship = = = 
 Several courtship displays by splendid fairywren males have been recorded ; the ' sea horse flight , ' so named for the similarity of movements to those by a seahorse , is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male , with his neck extended and his head feathers erect , flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground . The ' face fan ' display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours ; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers . 
 Another interesting habit of males of this and other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals ( in this species , predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage ) and show them to female fairywrens . Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren 's own or another territory . Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories , presumably to promote themselves . It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous : pairs will bond for life , but regularly mate with other individuals ; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group . Young are often raised not by the pair alone , but with other males who also mated with the pair 's female assisting . Thus , petal @-@ carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair @-@ bond . Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female . In either case , the data does not strongly link petal @-@ carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter . 
 Researchers at Department of Ecology and Evolution , University of Chicago published a paper in Behavioral Ecology in 2010 showing that male splendid fairywrens sing display @-@ like vocalizations ( Type II song ) in response to predator calls . The trills " hitchhike " on the predator 's vocalization and the female splendid fairywrens , which have become more alert due to the predator calls , also respond more strongly to this type II song than when it 's given without a predator call preceding it . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Breeding occurs from late August through to January , though heavy rain in August may delay this . The nest is built by the female ; it is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs , with an entrance in one side close to the ground and well @-@ concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation , such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea . One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season . A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish @-@ brown splotches and spots , measuring 12 × 16 mm ( ½ × ⅝ in ) , are laid . Incubation takes about two weeks . The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15 days ; after hatching , nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10 – 13 days , by which time they are fledged . Young birds remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group , usually an adjacent one , or assuming a dominant position in the original group . In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods . 
 Splendid fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite Horsfield 's bronze cuckoo ( Chalcites basalis ) , with the shining bronze cuckoo ( Chalcites lucidus ) also recorded .

 Vazgen Sargsyan ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 5 March 1959 – 27 October 1999 ) was an Armenian military commander and politician . He was the first Defence Minister of Armenia from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 1999 . He served as Armenia 's Prime Minister from 11 June 1999 until his assassination on 27 October of that year . He rose to prominence during the mass movement for the unification of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with Armenia in the late 1980s and led Armenian volunteer groups during the early clashes with Azerbaijani forces . Appointed Defence Minister by President Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan soon after Armenia 's independence from the Soviet Union in late 1991 , Sargsyan became the most prominent commander of Armenian forces during the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War . In different positions , he regulated the military operations in the war area until 1994 , when a ceasefire was reached ending the war with the de facto unification of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic with Armenia . 
 In the post @-@ war years , Sargsyan tightened his grip on the Armed Forces , establishing himself as a virtual strongman . After strongly supporting Ter @-@ Petrosyan to retain power , he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh settlement negotiations , and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president . With their relations deteriorated , Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia 's ex @-@ communist leader Karen Demirchyan . In the May 1999 elections , their reform @-@ minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly . Sargsyan became Prime Minister , emerging as the de facto decision @-@ maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature . 
 Sargsyan , along with Demirchyan and several others , was assassinated in the Armenian parliament shooting of 27 October 1999 . The perpetrators were sentenced to life in prison . However , the distrust toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories . Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan . Others have suspected the possible involvement of foreign powers in the shooting . 
 Despite his mixed legacy , Sargsyan is now widely recognized as a national hero across the political spectrum and by the public . Given the honorific Sparapet , he made significant contributions to the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army . He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic , especially for his role in elections . Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh — National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Vazgen Sargsyan was born in Ararat village , Soviet Armenia , near the Turkish border , on 5 March 1959 , to Greta and <unk> Sargsyan . After finishing secondary school in his village , he attended the Yerevan Institute of Physical Culture from 1976 @-@ 79 . He worked as a physical education teacher at the secondary school in Ararat from 1979 to 1983 . Therefore , he was exempt from conscription in the Soviet army . From 1983 to 1986 , he was the Young Communist League ( Komsomol ) leader at the Ararat Cement Factory . 
 An amateur writer , Sargsyan developed a literary and active social life . He wrote his first novel in 1980 , and became a member of the Writers Union of Armenia in 1985 . From 1986 to 1989 , he headed the publicity department of the <unk> ( « <unk> » , " Spring " ) literary monthly in Yerevan . In 1986 , his first book , Bread Temptation ( « <unk> <unk> » ) , was published , for which he was awarded by the Armenian Komsomol . A number of his works were published in journals , however , his literary career did not last long and ended in the late 1980s .

 = = = Early stages and independence of Armenia = = = 
 The relative democratization of the Soviet regime under Mikhail Gorbachev 's glasnost and perestroika policies since the mid @-@ 1980s gave rise to nationalism in the republics of the Soviet Union . In Armenia , the Karabakh movement gained widespread public support . Armenians demanded the Soviet authorities unify the mostly Armenian @-@ populated Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) of Azerbaijan with Armenia . In February 1988 , the NKAO regional legislature requested the transfer of the region from the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan SSR to Armenian SSR , but it was rejected by the Politburo . Tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis further escalated with the pogrom in Sumgait . With both groups arming themselves , clashes became frequent , especially in the disputed Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and the border areas of the two Soviet republics . In 1989 and 1990 , Sargsyan took the command of Armenian volunteer groups fighting near <unk> , on the Armenian @-@ Azerbaijani ( Nakhchivan ) border , not far from his hometown . 
 By January 1990 , he became part of the leadership of the Pan @-@ Armenian National Movement . Sargsyan was elected to the Armenian parliament ( the Supreme Council ) in the May 1990 election . He served as the head of the Supreme Council Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs until December 1991 . With his initiative , the Special Regiment was established in September 1990 . Composed of 26 platoons and a total of 2 @,@ 300 men , it was the first formal Armenian military unit independent from Moscow . It became the main base of the Armenian army in the following years . 
 By 1991 , most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia were forced to move to their respective countries , as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible . Although Armenia had proclaimed its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990 , it was not until on 21 September 1991 , a month after the failed August Coup in Moscow , when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum . Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan , the leader of the Karabakh Committee and the head of the Supreme Council since 1990 , was elected president of Armenia in October . 
 = = = Active military involvement = = = 
 Due to the fact that Sargsyan was popular among Armenian volunteer units and army officers , he was appointed the first Defense Minister of independent Armenia by President Ter @-@ Petrosyan in December 1991 . On 28 January 1992 , the Armenian government passed the historical decree " On the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Armenia , " which formally created the Armed Forces of Armenia . With the rise of hostilities in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , in March 1992 , Sargsyan announced that Armenia needed a 30 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army for maintaining security . On 9 May 1992 , the Armenian forces recorded their first major military success in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with the capture of Shusha . Another significant victory for the Armenian forces was recorded weeks later with the capture of Lachin , which connects Armenia proper with Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . 
 In summer 1992 , the situation turned critical for the Armenian forces following the launch of Operation Goranboy , during which Azerbaijan took control of northern half of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . On 15 August 1992 , Sargsyan called on Armenian men to gather and form a volunteer unit to fight against the advancing Azerbaijani forces in the northern parts of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . In a televised speech he stated : 
 If 10 – 15 men from every district of Armenia come together , we can form a battalion of 500 . This battalion must fight in the most dangerous areas , where the chance of survival is 50 – 50 . Together we will go fight in the most difficult parts and we will win . Because , in reality , nothing has changed , the enemy is the same enemy , which was escaping and we are the same . It 's just that we have lost the faith in our power . Now we need another attack and we must do it with the old guys to stimulate others in the army . If the day after tomorrow we will be able to establish a battalion of 500 volunteers , then we will fight and we will win . " 
 The battalion Sargsyan called for , named " <unk> <unk> " ( « <unk> <unk> » , " Eagles Sentenced to Death " ) , was formed on 30 August 1992 . Under the command of Major @-@ General <unk> Petrosyan , it defeated the Azerbaijani forces near the Gandzasar monastery and <unk> village in Martakert Province , on 31 August and 1 September 1992 , respectively . According to the Armenian Defense Ministry , the battalion 's activity stopped the advancement of the Azerbaijani forces and turned the course of the war in favor of the Armenian side in the part of the region .

 Between October 1992 and March 1993 , Sargsyan served as the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia . Subsequently , he was appointed the State Minister on Defence , Security and Internal Affairs . In these positions , Sargsyan had a major role in the advance of the Armenian army . With other key commanders , he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . He was particularly active in unifying the various semi @-@ independent detachments active in the war zone . Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet @-@ drawn borders of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . In 1993 , Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah , a union of 5 @,@ 000 war veterans , that had a great influence in Armenia 's domestic politics in the post @-@ war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power . 
 In early April 1993 , the Armenian forces captured Kelbajar , a city outside the originally contested areas , causing international attention to the conflict . Turkey closed its border with Armenia , while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act . In the summer of 1993 , Armenian forces gained more territories and , by August controlled Fizuli , <unk> , and <unk> . By early 1994 , both countries were devastated by the war . On 5 May , the Bishkek Protocol was signed by the heads of the parliaments of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , Armenia and Azerbaijan . The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic , backed by Armenia , established de facto control of these lands . Nagorno @-@ Karabakh ( also known as Artsakh to Armenians ) remains internationally unrecognized and a de jure part of Azerbaijan . However , it is in de facto unified with Armenia . 
 = = Minister of Defence and president change = = 
 Sargsyan was appointed Minister of Defence by Ter @-@ Petrosyan on 26 July 1995 , during the restructuring of government ministries . He remained in that position for almost four years . The Armenian army was highly regarded by experts with Armenia being described as the only former Soviet state that " managed to build a combat @-@ capable army from scratch " and was " comparable in efficiency to the Soviet Army . " According to Thomas de Waal , the army was " the most powerful institution " in Armenia under him . Sargsyan is credited with substantially <unk> the Armenian army . 
 Sargsyan showed strong confidence in the army and stated in 1997 that its strength has doubled in the past two years . In the same year , in response to Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev 's statements that Azerbaijan was " ready to solve the Karabakh problem by force , " Sargsyan replied , " Let him do it . We are ready . " Sargsyan 's term as Minister of Defence was marked by cooperation with Russia and Greece . Sargsyan had " close connections " with the Russian military elite , especially Defense Minister Pavel Grachev . According to the Jamestown Foundation , he pursued a military diplomacy with Greece , Cyprus , Syria , Iran and Bulgaria for a pro @-@ Russian alliance .

 Sargsyan became a key figure in post @-@ war Armenia due to the fact that he was indisputably supported by the army , the only well @-@ established institution in Armenia . He was described as an <unk> grise of the Armenian politics , deciding many personnel appointments and dismissals . In the aftermath of the war , which was accompanied by a harsh economic crisis in Armenia , President Ter @-@ Petrosyan became unpopular . His authoritarian rule , the banning of the major opposition party Armenian Revolutionary Federation in 1994 and the arrest of its leaders , made him highly dependent on the " power structures , " which included the Ministries of Defence ( headed by Sargsyan ) , Interior ( <unk> <unk> ) and National Security ( Serzh Sargsyan ) . In July 1995 , Vazgen Sargsyan helped Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's Pan @-@ Armenian National Movement ( <unk> ) win the parliamentary election and pass the constitutional referendum that gave the president more powers in appointing and dismissing key judicial and legislative officials . They were marred with major electoral violations . 
 Sargsyan 's impact on Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's presidency became more evident during the 1996 presidential election and the subsequent developments . A few days before the election , Sargsyan stated his support for Ter @-@ Petrosyan , stating that Armenia " will enter the 21st century victoriously and stable with Ter @-@ Petrosyan [ as president ] . " According to the Caucasian Regional Studies , Sargsyan " turned off the voters " from Ter @-@ Petrosyan and caused " irritation and antipathy " in 28 @.@ 6 % of the people according to a poll . The election , held on 22 September , was largely criticized by observation and monitoring organizations , that found " serious violations of the election law . " Official results , which recorded Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's victory in the first round with just above 50 % of the total vote in his favor , were denounced by opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan who had officially received 41 % of the vote . Manukyan began demonstrations claiming electoral fraud by Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's supporters . The protests culminated n 25 September , when Manukyan led thousands of his supporters to the parliament building on Baghramyan Avenue , where the Electoral Commission was located at the time . Later during the day , the protesters broke the fence surrounding the parliament and entered the building . They beat up the parliament speaker Babken <unk> and vice @-@ speaker Ara <unk> . In response , Vazgen Sargsyan stated that " even if they [ the opposition ] win 100 percent of the votes , neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders . " He was later criticized by human rights organizations for this statement . State security forces , tanks and troops were deployed in Yerevan to restore order and to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on 26 September . Sargsyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan announced that their respective agencies had prevented an attempted coup d 'état . 
 = = = Leadership split : Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation = = = 
 In 1997 , the OSCE Minsk Group , co @-@ chaired by Russia , the United States and France , pressured Armenia and Azerbaijan to agree on the final status of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . In September , Ter @-@ Petrosyan stated his support of the " step @-@ by @-@ step " proposal , which included the return of the territories outside the NKAO borders . Ter @-@ Petrosyan argued the normalization of relations with Azerbaijan and , therefore , the opening of the border with Turkey was the only way to significantly improve Armenia 's economy . After the plan was publicized , he came up against strong opposition . The issue was " important to the Armenians because of historical and psychological factors . After having been losing territories for centuries , the Armenians are reluctant to ' lose ' Karabakh now that they have won a war against Azerbaijan . " According to political scientist <unk> <unk> , " By calling for major concessions on Karabakh , Ter @-@ Petrosyan was antagonizing the last forces that supported his rule , the army and the Karabakh elite , at a time when his popularity within the Armenian society was at its lowest . " 
 The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic leadership , the Armenian intelligentsia and the diaspora , the opposition also expressed their opposition to the president ’ ' s support for the proposed settlement plan . Vazgen Sargsyan , who quickly denounced the proposal , became the de facto leader of the opposing group within the government . He was joined by the two Karabakh Armenians in the government : Prime Minister Kocharyan and Interior and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan . These three politicians were referred to as " hardliners " in the Western media for their perceived nationalistic stance . They argued that " Armenia should try to improve its economic performance , " while Ter @-@ Petrosyan insisted that Armenia " could only achieve marginal improvements insufficient to address the fear of relative decline and economic exclusion . " The Kocharyan cabinet , where Vazgen Sargsyan was a leading figure , called for a " package " deal , " involving a single framework accord on all contentious issues . " On 21 October 1997 , ten members of the Republic bloc in the parliament left the faction and shifted their support to Vazgen Sargsyan . Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's bloc in the parliament was left with a majority of two seats . Despite the great public and political opposition , the Pan @-@ Armenian National Movement voted in favor of Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's foreign policy . 
 During the National Security Council meeting on 7 – 8 January 1998 it became clear that Ter @-@ Petrosyan did not have enough support to continue his reign as president . On 23 January 1998 , during the peak of the crisis , Vazgen Sargsyan declared his unconditional support to Robert Kocharyan , and blamed the Pan @-@ Armenian National Movement for trying to destabilize Armenia . Sargsyan also guaranteed that the Armenian army " will not intervene in the political struggle . " 
 Ter @-@ Petrosyan announced his resignation on 3 February 1998 . According to Michael P. Croissant , it was Vazgen Sargsyan who " played ultimately the principal role in inducting the president 's resignation . " In his resignation statement , Ter @-@ Petrosyan referred to Vazgen Sargsyan , Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan as " the well known body of power . " He cited the threat of destabilization of the country as the reason of his resignation . Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation was followed by the resignation of National Assembly speaker Babken <unk> , his two deputies , Mayor of Yerevan <unk> <unk> , Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander <unk> and others . A significant change occurred in the National Assembly . Dozens of members of the parliamentary faction called the Republican Bloc ( mostly made up of Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's Pan @-@ Armenian National Movement ) joined Vazgen Sargsyan 's Yerkrapah bloc , making it the largest parliamentary bloc , with 69 members compared to only 56 for the Republic . 
 After Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation , Prime Minister Kocharyan became acting president . On 5 February 1998 , Sargsyan denied the claims of a coup d 'état and said that Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation was " rather sad but natural . " Sargsyan claimed that the president 's move surprised him and that he had " been seeking common grounds with the president for the past three months . " He added , " the only step I achieved on the Karabakh issue was the suggestion that the situation be frozen . " Almost a year after Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation , Vazgen Sargsyan stated at the Republican Party convention that he " respects and appreciates " Ter @-@ Petrosyan and described him as a " wise and a moral man and politician . " Sargsyan insisted that the question of " political responsibility " was the main reason behind his resignation . 
 = = = 1998 election : Kocharyan as president = = = 
 Sargsyan ( along with Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan ) openly supported Kocharyan and used his influence for his election in March . He called Kocharyan a " man of unity of word and action " and stated that his experience in Karabakh and Armenia " shows that he is capable of solving economic problems also . " Kocharyan 's main opponent was Karen Demirchyan , the leader of Soviet Armenia from 1974 to 1988 . Sargsyan praised Kocharyan for being part of the " struggle of the Armenian people " and criticized Demirchyan for not being part of it . 
 No candidate gained more than half of the votes in the first round , while in the second round of the election , held on 30 March , Kocharyan won 58 @.@ 9 % of the vote . The British Helsinki Human Rights Group suggests that " ordinary Armenians turned to Robert Kocharian as someone untainted by mafia connections and the intrigues of Yerevan politics . " The OSCE observation mission described the first round as " deeply flawed , " while their final report stated that the mission found " serious flaws " and that the election did not meet the OSCE standards . Although Demirchyan didn 't officially dispute the election results , he never accepted them and did not congratulate Kocharyan . After the election , however , Sargsyan suggested Kocharyan appoint Demirchyan Prime Minister to decrease the tensions in the political scene . 
 Even after becoming president , Kocharyan did not have any significant institutional support ( e.g. a party , control of the army , a source of money ) and remained " in a fundamental sense an outsider in Yerevan . " Kocharyan had a more tough position on the Karabakh settlement issue than Ter @-@ Petrosyan . He also urged the international community to recognize the Armenian Genocide , something on which his predecessor did not place importance . In response , Turkey and Azerbaijan tightened their cooperation in isolating Armenia from regional projects . Kocharyan did not put pressure on the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh leadership to concede territory to Azerbaijan . He was supported by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation , which was allowed to actively operate after Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation a month before the election .

 By 1998 Vazgen Sargsyan became " the power behind the throne " as the Yerkrapah faction — made up of war veterans loyal to him — was the single largest faction in the Armenian parliament following Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's resignation in February 1998 . Yerkrapah was merged with the Republican Party of Armenia — a minor party with ideology similar to that of Yerkrapah — in summer 1998 , taking the party 's name and its legal status . Though Sargsyan was not the chairman of the Republican Party , he was considered its unofficial leader . 
 The relations between Sargsyan and Kocharyan deteriorated after the presidential election with Sargsyan " casting around for partners unconnected with or downright opposed to the president . " Within several months three assassinations of top officials took place that spread rumors in Armenia that relations between Sargsyan and Kocharyan were " not normal . " In August 1998 Armenia 's Prosecutor @-@ General <unk> Khachatryan , a close friend of Kocharyan , was murdered in his office " in murky circumstances . " In December 1998 Deputy Minister of Defence <unk> <unk> murdered " for equally mysterious motives . " While in February 1999 Deputy Minister of Interior <unk> Margaryan was murdered . Vazgen Sargsyan and National Security and Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan , Kocharyan 's close ally , were " also perceived to be at odds . "

 It was initially announced that the Republican Party would go to the parliamentary election alone and would seek " qualitative majority " in the parliament , and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process . Surprisingly for many , on 30 March 1999 , Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner @-@ up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia 's ex @-@ communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People 's Party of Armenia and the Republican Party . It came to be known as the Unity bloc ( « <unk> » <unk> ) , often referred to as <unk> . Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a " genuine " alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia " from a turning point to progress . " When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan , Sargsyan said that , " there is no other way out . " According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission , Sargsyan " obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent , " and that " in forming Unity bloc , Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had , and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country ’ ' s political life . " In analyst Richard <unk> 's words , the bloc was " an odd mix , " however he admitted that it " effectively marginalized the electoral threat " of other parties . Sociologist Levon <unk> described it as " unification of the new and old <unk> . " The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it " aimed to appeal to the electorate by being all things to all men . " The ODIHR suggested that the " alliance was not only created for electoral purposes , but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences . "

 During the campaign , Sargsyan pledged that he would spare no effort to make sure the elections were free and fair . Sargsyan and Demirchyan put the emphasis of their campaign on the economy and the improvement of the life of ordinary Armenians . Talking about Yerkrapah — now politically transformed into the Republican Party — Sargsyan said he was confident " that the people that gained victory on the battlefield will also gain victory in economy . " He expressed his optimism saying that they were sure that they " will jointly change something and find the right course . " The Unity bloc " called broadly for a democratic society , rule of law , economic reforms and a market economy , with the state also creating conditions for the normal functioning of state enterprises and ensuring decent living standards for all . " Throughout the campaign , the Unity bloc was widely considered the favorite of the election . Opposition newspaper Hayots <unk> suggested that most other political parties in Armenia were gravitating towards the opposite pole , around Kocharyan , National Security & Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan , and the leadership of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic . 
 The parliamentary election took place on 30 May 1999 , just two months after Sargsyan 's and Demirchyan 's announcement about their decision to form an alliance . The Unity bloc won over 41 @.@ 5 % of the popular vote , and took 62 of the 131 seats in the National Assembly . The alliance established an effective majority with cooperating with a group of 25 independent and officially non @-@ affiliated members of the parliament , sympathetic to the Sargsyan @-@ Demirchyan coalition . The electoral process " generally showed an improvement over the [ previous ] flawed elections , but ODIHR said they were " not an adequate basis for comparison . " ODIHR 's final report described the election as " a step towards compliance with OSCE Commitments " and claimed that , along with improvements to the electoral framework and the political environment , serious issues remained . The Council of Europe also suggested " considerable improvement " from the past elections . The National Democratic Institute report was more critical , saying it " failed to meet international standards " and that it proved to be the continuation of the flawed 1995 parliamentary elections , differing only in " the methods and types of manipulation .

 At the Republican Party convention in January 1999 . Sargsyan stated his desire in remaining in the position of Minister of Defence . After the election speculations arouse about Sargsyan wanting to combine the positions of Defence Minister and Prime Minister , however , this was impossible according to the Armenian constitution . On 11 June 1999 he became Prime Minister of Armenia , while Unity bloc co @-@ chairman Karen Demirchyan was elected speaker of the National Assembly . 
 Many experts suggest that Sargsyan as Prime Minister was the most powerful politician in Armenia , while others suggest that he had become Armenia 's strongest politician long before that . According to Mark <unk> , his " activities had began to overshadow " Kocharyan . Despite Kocharyan 's formal welcome of their alliance , the president was " effectively weakened " and " was being sidelined " . Some political analysts suggested that the Sargsyan @-@ Demirchyan alliance " ultimately would bring about the resignation of Kocharyan . " Vazgen Manukyan stated that Kocharyan " would end up like the " Queen of England . " Despite no longer being the Minister of Defence , Vazgen Sargsyan remained the de facto leader of the army , as a close ally , Vagharshak Harutiunyan , replaced him . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , an analyst and former member of the Armenian parliament , despite his mixed legacy , under Vazgen Sargsyan Armenia became increasingly independent . 
 = = = Economic policy = = = 
 At the time of Sargsyan 's Prime Ministry , Armenia had not yet recovered from the economic effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War . One of the major issues Sargsyan faces was the emigration from Armenian that started at the period of the decline of the Soviet regime . The World Socialist Web Site held international creditors responsible for Armenia 's economic hardships as they did not " leave much room for manoeuvres for the Armenian government to shape its policies more strongly according to the economic and social needs of the majority of the population . " The 1998 Russian financial crisis worsened the situation , and showed a decline in human development . 
 In his first address to the parliament as Prime Minister on 18 June , <unk> described Armenia 's economic situation as " “ grave . " The budget revenues were almost 20 % lower than the government had planned , because of the low level of tax collection and the high level of corruption in the Armenian economy . Although Sargsyan criticized the post @-@ Soviet privatization by the Ter @-@ Petrosyan government , he admitted Armenia had no alternative , and that his government had an enormous amount of work to do . In his speech on 28 July , Sargsyan described the economic situation in Armenia as " extremely difficult , but not hopeless . " According to him , the first half of 1999 saw $ 61 million less in the budged revenues than planned by the <unk> government . He said that tax evasion played a role in the budget deficit . 
 Despite being criticized by the opposition , especially the National Democratic Union , the Unity bloc voted in favor ( 96 of the 131 MPs ) of the austerity measures of the Sargsyan cabinet on 28 August , allowing Armenia to take loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . The World Bank alone had loaned almost $ 0 @.@ 5 billion to Armenia since 1992 to finance the budget deficits . The Sargsyan cabinet wanted to diversify $ 32 million in the budget funds in order to be able to repay the internal debts . For this purpose , the excise tax was raised on cigarettes by 200 % and on gasoline by 45 % , seriously hitting the middle class . Sargsyan described these as " painful but right steps " for getting the necessary amount of money from the foreign lenders . He pledged a " tougher crackdown on the shadow economy and more efficient governance . " National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan called for a greater role of the state in the economy to ensure stability , while President Kocharyan was mostly uninvolved in these developments . 
 = = = Notable events = = = 
 During his Prime Ministry , Sargsyan helped to organize three major events . On 28 August 1999 , the first Pan @-@ Armenian Games began in Yerevan . Over 1 @,@ 400 Armenian athletes from 23 countries participated in the games . The closing ceremony took place in the Yerevan Sports and Concerts Complex on September 5 , with President Robert Kocharyan and Vazgen Sargsyan in attendance . Just after the Games , which involved thousands of diaspora Armenian youth , the preparations for the eighth anniversary of Armenia 's independence began . 
 On 21 September , the anniversary of the day in 1991 when Armenians voted in favor of leaving the Soviet Union in a referendum , a military parade was held in Yerevan 's Republic Square . Vazgen Sargsyan " was visibly the most excited of the government leaders standing on a specially built pedestal . " In a short briefing after the parade , Sargsyan enthusiastically stated that he had " touched almost every piece of hardware you 've just seen " and continued that he " just wanted to show it " to the Armenian people . 
 During the next two days , on 22 and 23 September 1999 , the first Armenia @-@ Diaspora Conference was held in Yerevan . The conference brought together the Armenian political elite and many diaspora organizations , political parties , religious leaders , writers and over 1 @,@ 200 representatives of Armenian communities from 53 countries , an unprecedented number . Vazgen Sargsyan opened the second day of the conference with his speech @-@ report about the economic and social situation in Armenia . The conference was closed by Sargsyan .

 On 27 October 1999 , at around 5 : 15 p.m. , five men — Nairi Hunanyan , his brother Karen , their uncle Vram and two others — armed with Kalashnikov rifles hidden under long coats , broke into the National Assembly building in Yerevan , while the government was holding a question @-@ and @-@ answer session . They shot dead Vazgen Sargsyan , National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan , Deputy National Assembly Speakers Yuri Bakhshyan and Ruben <unk> , Minister of Urgent Affairs Leonard Petrosyan , and Parliament Members Henrik Abrahamyan , Armenak <unk> and <unk> <unk> . The gunmen injured at least 30 people in the parliament . The group claimed they were carrying out a coup d 'état . They described their act as " patriotic " and " needed for the nation to regain its senses . " They said they wanted to " punish the authorities for what they do to the nation " and described the government as profiteers " drinking the blood of the people . " They claimed Armenia was in a " catastrophic situation " and that " corrupt officials " were not doing anything to provide the way out . Vazgen Sargsyan was the main target of the group and the other deaths were said to be unintended . According to reporters who witnessed the shooting , the men went up to Sargsyan and said , " Enough of drinking our blood , " to which Sargsyan calmly responded , " Everything is being done for you and the future of your children . " Vazgen Sargsyan was hit several times . Anna <unk> , an eyewitness journalist , stated that " the first shots were fired directly at Vazgen Sargsyan at a distance of one to two meters " and , in her words , " it was impossible that he would have survived . " Sargsyan 's body was taken out of the parliament building on the evening of October 27 . 
 With policemen , army troops , armed with APCs surrounding the building . President Kocharyan gave a speech on TV , announcing that the situation was under control . The gunmen released the hostages after overnight negotiations with President Kocharyan and gave themselves up on the morning of October 28 , after a standoff that lasted 17 – 18 hours . 
 On 28 October , President Kocharyan declared a three @-@ day mourning period . The state funeral ceremony for the victims of the parliament shooting took place from 30 October to 31 October 1999 . The bodies of the victims , including Vazgen Sargsyan , were placed inside the Yerevan Opera Theater . A number of high @-@ ranking officials from some 30 countries , including Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze , attended the funeral . Karekin II , the Catholicos of All Armenians and Aram I , the Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia gave prayers . 
 = = = Investigation and conspiracy theories = = = 
 The five men were charged with terrorism aimed at undermining authority on 29 October . The investigation was led by Gagik Jhangiryan , the Chief Military Prosecutor of Armenia , who claimed his team was looking for the masterminds of the shooting even after the trial had begun . According to Jhangiryan , the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories . By January 2000 , Jhangiryan 's investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting . Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested , including <unk> Harutiunyan , the Deputy Presidential Adviser , and Harutiun Harutiunyan , the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but , by the summer of that year , they were released . Eventually , Jhangiryan failed to find evidence linking Kocharyan to the shooting . The trial began in February 2001 and eventually , the five main perpetrators of the shooting ( Nairi Hunanyan , his younger brother Karen Hunanyan , their uncle Vram <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Eduard Grigoryan ) were sentenced to life in prison on December 2 , 2003 . 
 Possible motives behind the attack gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories . Stepan Demirchyan , Karen Demirchyan 's son , stated in 2009 that " nothing was done by the authorities to prevent that crime and , conversely , everything was done to cover up the crime . " In March 2013 , Vazgen Sargsyan 's younger brother Aram stated he had many questions for both governments of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan . He claimed the judicial process of 27 October had " deepened the public distrust in the authorities ... [ as ] many questions remain unanswered today " . According to him , the full disclosure of the shooting is " vital " for Armenia . Sargsyan , at the conclusion , insisted that he " never accused this or the former authorities of being responsible for 27 October . I have accused them in not fully disclosing the 27 October event . " In an April 2013 interview , Karen Demirchyan 's widow , Rita , suggested the shooting was ordered from outside Armenia and was not an attempt at a coup , but rather an assassination . 
 Although the investigation did not find any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group , many Armenian politicians and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians . Albert Bazeyan stated in 2002 that " We have come to the conclusion that the crime was aimed at making Robert Kocharian 's power unlimited and uncontrolled . By physically eliminating Karen Demirchyan and Vazgen Sargsyan , its organizers wanted to create prerequisites for Kocharyan 's victory in the future presidential elections . " Ter @-@ Petrosyan accused Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan and their " criminal @-@ oligarchic " system of being the real perpetrators of the parliament shooting . Nairi Hunanyan , the leader of the armed group , was a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF , Dashnaktsutyun ) . According to the ARF , Hunanyan was expelled from the party in 1992 for misconduct and had not been in any association with the ARF since then . Some speculations have been made about the involvement of the ARF in the shootings . In 2000 , Ashot Manucharyan stated he was worried that " a number of Dashnaktsutyun party leaders are acting in the interest of the American foreign policy . " 
 = = = = Allegations of foreign involvement = = = = 
 Some analysts have suggested that foreign powers , including Russia , may have been behind the shooting . They pointed out the fact that Armenia and Azerbaijan were close in signing some kind of an agreement at the OSCE 1999 Istanbul summit over Karabakh , something not in Russia 's interest . 
 Russian secret service defector Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting , ostensibly to derail the peace process , which would have resolved the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict , but he offered no evidence to support the accusation . Russian and Armenian officials denied this claims . 
 The French @-@ based Armenian political refugee and former Apostolic priest Artsruni Avetisysan ( also known by his religious name Ter <unk> ) gave an interview to Armenian media network <unk> , in which he claimed the Russian secret services were behind the October 27 , 1999 , shooting . He also claimed the shooting was perpetrated by Lieutenant General Vahan <unk> , the Deputy Minister of Defense from 1992 to 1999 , and the National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan . He insisted the shooting was assisted by the Russian secret services in order to bring the " Neo @-@ Bolshevik criminal clan " of Serzh Sargsyan and Robert Kocharyan into power . 
 Others suggested that it was in the best interest of the West to remove Sargsyan and Demirchyan from the political scene , as they had close ties to Russia . Ashot Manucharyan , one of the leading members of the Karabakh Committee , the former Minister of Internal Affairs and Ter @-@ Petrosyan 's National Security Adviser and his close ally until 1993 , stated in October 2000 that Armenian officials were warned by a foreign country about the shootings . He also declared that " Western special services " were involved in the 27 October events . In Manucharyan 's words , " the special services of the U.S. and France are acting to destroy Armenia and , in this context , they are much likely to be involved in the realization of the terrorist acts in Armenia . " Manucharyan claimed the shooting was planned by Kocharyan in order to get rid of his two major rivals ( Sargsyan and Demirchyan ) , who were against the Goble plan , involving territorial concessions to Azerbaijan . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Just after the shooting , the Interior and National Security Ministers Suren Abrahamyan and Serzh Sargsyan resigned as a result of pressure from the Defence Ministry , led by Sargsyan 's ally , Vagharshak Harutiunyan at the time . From early June to late October 1999 , the political system in Armenia was based on the Demirchyan @-@ Sargsyan tandem , which controlled the military , the legislative and the executive branches . The assassinations disrupted the political balance in the country and the political arena of Armenia was left in disarray for months . The " de facto dual command " of Sargsyan and Demirchyan transferred to President Robert Kocharyan . James R. Hughes claims that the so @-@ called " Karabakh clan " ( i.e. Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan ) was " kept in check " by Vazgen Sargsyan and his " military @-@ security apparatus , " while after the parliament shooting it came out to be the sole influential group able to successfully take over the political scene in Armenia . Since the leaders of the Unity bloc were assassinated , the two parties in the alliance ( the Republican Party of Armenia and the People 's Party of Armenia ) gradually lost edges of collaboration and , by late 2000 , the Unity bloc collapsed . Yerkrapah , the Republican Party , and the People 's Party effectively lost their influence by 2001 . 
 = = Personal life and brothers = = 
 Sargsyan never married . According to <unk> <unk> , a friend and the Minister of Social Security from 1999 to 2003 , Sargsyan promised in December 1987 that he would marry sometime before March 8 of the next year . The Karabakh movement started in February 1988 and <unk> claimed that the popular movement " did what it did . " In a 1997 interview , Sargsyan revealed that his favorite historical military figure was Charles de Gaulle . When asked about what kind of Armenia he would like to see in five years , he said " an independent , self @-@ sufficient country with strong culture , school and army . " 
 Sargsyan had two younger brothers , Aram and Armen . Aram was appointed Prime Minister by President Kocharyan on 3 November 1999 , a week after Vazgen Sargsyan 's death , largely as a " political gesture . " He admitted that Armenia has " no concept of state security " and that fact led to the assassination of his brother . Aram Sargsyan served in the position of the Prime Minister for only six months . He was dismissed by Kocharyan on 2 May 2000 , due to " inability to work " with Sargsyan 's cabinet . In his television statement , Kocharyan claimed that he relieved Aram Sargsyan to end the " disarray " in the Armenian leadership . Kocharyan blamed him for being involved in " political games . " 
 Aram Sargsyan founded the Republic ( <unk> ) party in April 2001 , along with several influential Yerkrapah members , such as the former Mayor of Yerevan Albert Bazeyan and former Defence Minister Vagharshak Harutyunyan . Its co @-@ founder Bazeyan stated that the party is the " bearer of the political heritage of Vazgen <unk> and will try to realize the programs aborted by the October 27 crime and its consequences . " The party backed up Stepan Demirchyan against Kocharyan in 2003 and Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan against Serzh Sargsyan in the 2008 presidential elections . In a 2013 interview , Aram Sargsyan talked about the past 14 years after his brother 's death : 
 Vazgen Sargsyan 's other brother , Armen , supported Serzh Sargsyan in the 2013 presidential election . On 5 March 2013 , Aram Sargsyan was asked about his brother 's political stance , to which he responded , " I would very much like to ask Vazgen that question . I don 't know what he would have answered . I don 't know Vazgen 's answers to very few questions . Unfortunately , our friends and relatives are not always the way we want them to be . I am not the first one , neither am I the last one ; the history of the world is full of such examples starting from the Bible . " 
 = = Legacy and tribute = = 
 Vazgen Sargsyan was awarded the Hero of Artsakh title , the highest award of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic , in 1998 . On 27 December 1999 , two months after the parliament shooting , Sargsyan was posthumously given the National Hero of Armenia title . He widely is recognized as the founder of the Armenian army . 
 A presidential decree issued on 28 December 1999 , named the Yerevan military academy Vazgen Sargsyan Military Institute in his honor . The Republican Stadium in Yerevan was named after Vazgen Sargsyan by the same decree . Numerous streets in Armenia and Karabakh , including one in Yerevan 's <unk> ( Central ) district and in Stepanakert , and a park in <unk> are named after Sargsyan . Statues were erected in his honor in Yerevan ( 2007 ) , Ararat ( 2009 ) , <unk> Shusha and other locations . In 2000 , 27 October was declared a day of remembrance by the Armenian government . In 2002 , the Armenian Defence Ministry created the Medal of Vazgen Sargsyan , which is awarded for " meritorious services towards military education and improvements in service life . " 
 Every year , on 5 March ( his birthday ) and 27 October ( the day of his assassination ) , Sargsyan is commemorated in Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . His comrades from the Yerkrapah Volunteer Union , high state officials and many others visit the Yerablur cemetery , where Sargsyan is buried next to many Armenian military figures . 
 Vazgen Sargsyan 's museum was opened in his hometown of Ararat on 5 March 2001 by the decision made by the Armenian government . Notable attendees of the opening ceremony of the museum included Premier Minister Andranik Margaryan , National Assembly Speaker Armen Khachatryan , Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan , and other high @-@ ranking military and diplomatic representatives , such as the former Russian Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev , who revealed in his speech at the ceremony that Sargsyan was once his student . 
 Sargsyan is often referred to as Sparapet , a military rank that has existed since the ancient Kingdom of Armenia . The phrase " <unk> <unk> " Sparapet Hayots ( literally meaning " Commander of the Armenians " ) is engraved on Sargsyan 's memorial in Yerablur cemetery . The song " Sparapet " by Alla <unk> is dedicated to his memory . 
 = = = Public image and recognition = = = 
 In Armenia , Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and , to a lesser extent , in the Armenian diaspora , Vazgen Sargsyan is recognized as a national hero . Several survey conducted by Gallup , Inc . , International Republican Institute , and the Armenian Sociological Association from 2006 to 2008 , revealed that Vazgen Sargsyan topped the list of national heroes in public perception , with 15 % -20 % of the respondents giving his name . He left behind the two prominent early 20th century military commanders Andranik and Garegin Nzhdeh . Sargsyan is widely considered a charismatic leader . He was generally perceived as a man of " tremendous power and charisma , " known for his " brutality , temper , and nonchalant attitude toward the law . " 
 His contributions have been acknowledged by his colleagues and comrades . In 1997 , President Ter @-@ Petrosyan stated that Sargsyan is someone who deserves the title of National Hero of Armenia . He added that " if all members of our government worked as conscientiously and selflessly as Vazgen Sargsyan , we would live in a perfect state . " Armenia 's second president Robert Kocharyan said in his speech during Sargsyan 's funeral , " history will provide its assessment of Vazgen Sargsyan as a politician who stood at the birth of the Armenian state . His role in the creation of the national army is beyond appraisal . By his life and commitment , Vazgen Sargsyan has made an immense contribution to the establishment of a powerful country . " In 2007 , giving a speech on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Armenian Armed Forces , the Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan ( and the incumbent president ) noted that he " was a valiant soldier dedicated to the cause of our statehood , and who revered the strength of Armenia and the strength of the Armenian soldier , and who had a staunch belief in our future success . " 
 Manvel Grigoryan , leader of the Yerkrapah Volunteer Union , recognized Sargsyan 's contributions , stating that Sargsyan " was a strong individual and his greatness was felt not only during the war , but during the nation @-@ building years after the war . " According to Grigoryan " his presence was enough for the foreign leaders to become vigilant . " Dr. Ara <unk> , the director of the Armenian Studies at the <unk> University , wrote shortly after Sargsyan 's assassination : 
 In the West , Sargsyan was generally described as a strong nationalist . The British journalist Jonathan Steele wrote of Sargsyan as " a fierce nationalist who always preferred action and force to words and diplomacy . " Encyclopædia Britannica describes Sargsyan as an " Armenian nationalist who devoted much of his life to the Armenian fight with Azerbaijan for control of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh enclave . " Political scientist <unk> <unk> expressed the opinion that he was " the last significant nationalist politician whose commitment to Karabakh and Armenia was not doubted by anyone . " 
 Sargsyan was criticized for being undemocratic , particularly for using his influence in pre @-@ determining the election results . The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe suggested in 1999 that his " record does not inspire confidence in his commitment to democracy . " The 2008 book Religious Freedom in the World described him as " thuggish " and held him responsible for the 1995 assaults on religious minorities in Armenia ( especially those that discourage military service ) , carried out , allegedly , by Yerkrapah . Thomas de Waal describes Sargsyan as a " feudal baron , " and claims that Yerkrapah controlled " large areas of the economy . " 
 = Kingstonian F.C. = 
 Kingstonian Football Club is an English semi @-@ professional football club based in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames which currently plays in the Isthmian League Premier Division . The club play at Kingsmeadow in Kingston @-@ upon @-@ Thames , which has been their home since 1989 , when they left their original Richmond Road ground . They share the ground with AFC Wimbledon , who purchased the lease of Kingsmeadow in 2003 . 
 Kingstonian Football Club was founded in 1885 by the Young Man 's Christian Association , named Kingston & Surbiton YMCA , and began competing properly in 1893 in the Surrey Junior Cup . There was a split before the start of the 1908 @-@ 1909 season which damaged the club , the two clubs were named Old Kingstonians and Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames A.F.C. After period of quiet during World War I , the two clubs re @-@ united and joined the Athenian League in 1919 , named Kingstonian . In 1929 , their application to join the Isthmian League was accepted , and they have competed there to the present day . The club , nicknamed " The K 's " or " The Ks " , spent three seasons at the highest level of non @-@ league football , 1998 – 99 , 1999 – 2000 and 2000 – 01 , and have won the FA Trophy twice , in consecutive seasons , in 1999 and 2000 .

 Kingstonian was formed in autumn 1885 , under the name Kingston & Surbiton YMCA . In the period , rugby was the dominant sport in the town , but the Young Men 's Christian Association ( YMCA ) was unable to support a rugby club . This influenced their decision to create a club to play " Football under Association rules " . The new club played their first fixture on 28 November 1885 losing 3 – 1 to Surbiton Hill with home games played at Bushey Park before moving to the Spring grove the following season . Over the two years the club played only friendly matches against other football teams in the region . 
 = = = Saxons F.C. = = = 
 In 1887 the club changed its name to Saxons FC and opened up its membership to players who were not also members of the YMCA . The club however maintained its links to the YMCA and only allowed YMCA members to serve on the decision making committee . In the Summer of 1888 William Carn , the founder of the club , resigned from the YMCA after tensions developed where the YMCA were concerned that the organization was becoming more like a sporting club than a religious organization . As non YMCA members were not allowed to serve on the committee this would have meant Carn also resigning his duties with the club . The members decided however to sever links with the YMCA which allowed Carn to continue . At the same time the club also moved to a ground in Oil Mill Lane ( modern day Villiers Road ) . 
 = = = Kingston Wanderers F.C. = = = 
 At the club 's annual general meeting in 1890 , the secretary at the time , William G. Carn , proposed that the name became " one more identified with the town " . His proposal was successful , and the club became Kingston Wanderers F.C. in the 1890 – 91 season . The club 's first season as Kingston Wanderers also heralded a change of home ground to the Fairfield Recreation Ground . 
 = = = Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames A.F.C. = = = 
 In the Summer of 1893 , the association clubs of Kingston considered a proposal to amalgamate and produce one larger club that would represent the whole town . Because many of the clubs had already arranged fixtures for the coming season it was only Kingston Wanderers who moved forward with the plan , although several other clubs were to amalgamate with them in future seasons . On 13 September 1893 , the club changed its name to Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames A.F.C. They entered the Surrey Junior Cup affiliated to the Surrey Football Association . The first competitive match in Kingston 's history was in November 1893 and resulted in a loss , after a replayed game , to Hampton Court & East Molesey F.C. When Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames ventured into the Surrey Senior Cup in 1894 , the heaviest loss of the club to date was recorded , a 13 – 0 loss to Weybridge F.C. The club re @-@ entered the Surrey Junior Cup and in 1896 joined the Kingston and District League as founder members . In their first season , they won the league but lost the Surrey Junior Cup 2 – 1 in the final , to Chertsey F.C. after a replay . They spent two years in the Kingston and District league , coming runners up to Brentford ' A ' Team in their second season before moving into the East and West Surrey League at the start of the 1898 @-@ 1899 season . The club also underwent several ground changes during this period and from 1898 @-@ 1899 season spent 3 years at <unk> Road before one season playing at Lower Marsh Lane in 1901 @-@ 1902 season . In 1902 @-@ 1903 they made a final move to Thorpe Road which was virtually on the site of the Richmond Road ground that was to become their home for much of the Twentieth Century . The club continued to compete in the East and West Surrey League and also had a one @-@ season foray into the London League in 1903 alongside the East and West Surrey League but the " experiment " backfired with fixture congestion and selection difficulties caused by having too many games and Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames withdrew from the London League after one season . In 1905 @-@ 1906 season , the club won the newly renamed West Surrey League , a feat which was replicated in 1906 @-@ 1907 season . In addition the 1906 @-@ 1907 season saw them finish runners up in the Surrey Senior Cup which was lost to Clapham F.C. 3 – 1 . 
 = = = Old Kingstonians = = = 
 The newfound success in Surrey amateur football was soon lost when the club split before the start of the 1908 – 09 season after increasing tensions between the First Team members and the " A " Team members . This reached a head after elections for representation on the committee that ran the club . This resulted in treasurer David Judd forming Old Kingstonians F.C. and taking much of the first team with him to a new ground at Norbiton . Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames continued to compete on the old ground at Thorpe Road , and were made up of the former members of the " A " team as well as two members of the first team who chose to stay . Judd 's team became known as the " OK 's " or the " <unk> " while the Kingston @-@ On @-@ Thames team was known as " The Boys " or simply " The Town club " . Initially Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames had the upper hand both in league and cup success and in matches between the two clubs . To some extent this justified the belief of the former " A " Team members that they were the better team despite effectively representing the club at a lower Junior level than the first team . It also somewhat justified their opinion that the first team had been holding back progress at the club . Gradually however Old Kingstonians improved , winning the West Surrey League in 1910 , followed by the Surrey Senior Cup in both 1911 and 1914 and the Southern Suburban League in the two seasons before the war . By the start of World War One , Old Kingstonians held a definite supremacy of the two clubs , and in 1913 @-@ 1914 won three trophies including the Southern Suburban League and Surrey Senior Cup . The rivalry between these two clubs was intense and to some extent the competition helped both clubs with their standard of football and improvements to facilities . However there were occasions in which this rivalry spilled over into more serious incidents . Over the period of the split several appeals had been made by both clubs concerning eligibility of players in matches between the two sides , and in two cases the result of the game was overturned . In 1913 @-@ 1914 season the Surrey Charity Shield match between the two clubs saw a number of incidents involving players and spectators and this led to the Surrey FA taking responsibility for the running of the replay with warning notices posted at the ground and a large police presence . An FA enquiry into incidents at the first game led to one of the witnesses being attacked on their return to Kingston after giving evidence . Both teams competed in the West Surrey League in 1908 @-@ 1909 but in 1909 @-@ 1910 season Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames FC moved into the Southern Suburban League with Old Kingstonians remaining in the West Surrey League . Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames did however again try a failed " experiment " by re @-@ entering two first teams in both the Southern Suburban League and West Surrey League for the 1910 @-@ 1911 season but again this resulted in selection problems and was dropped at the end of the season . At the start of the 1911 @-@ 1912 season Old Kingstonians also moved to the Southern Suburban League where both teams stayed until the outbreak of World War One . 
 = = = World War One = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War One , Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames FC immediately cancelled all football . However Old Kingstonians did attempt to continue playing despite heavy political pressure to stop . The club had joined the Athenian League and played two games before the league was cancelled . They also played three rounds in the FA Cup Qualifying stages before losing to Redhill . They then joined the Metropolitan League which had been set up for wartime football and also played in the London Senior Cup ( losing to Walthamstow Grange ) and were entered for the F.A. Amateur Cup . <unk> despite resisting political pressure , attendances dropped and in December 1914 the club announced that it was ceasing activities .

 In 1919 football was rejuvenated in Kingston . The war had dimmed the rivalry between the teams , and they re @-@ united as Kingstonian F.C. Their first match after unification was on 6 September 1919 competing in the Athenian League against Southall F.C. However , the season was plagued with issues regarding their home ground at Richmond Road and a finish in the bottom half of the league meant the team were forced to apply to re @-@ enter the league . Their application was successful , and heralded a change of fortunes for Kingstonian . Before the 1920 @-@ 1921 season it seemed they had lost their ground after confusion over their desire to renew the rent . This meant that Leyland Motors had been given exclusive use but an agreement was reached to allow for a groundshare with Leyland Motors and Leyland Motors took over the fixtures of the Kingstonian Reserve team who had signed up for the Southern Suburban League . The following season Kingstonian were successful in purchasing the Richmond Road ground , although the groundshare arrangement with Leyland Motors continued . They had a more successful spell from 1923 up to the outbreak of World War II , winning the league in 1924 , and in 1926 with a record amount of points . The club progressed to several finals of the London and Surrey Senior Cups . 
 In 1929 , Kingstonian applied to enter the Isthmian League after the withdrawal of Civil Service F.C. In 1933 , Kingstonian won the FA Amateur Cup , they won the League in 1934 and 1937 , and the club won the Surrey Senior Cup in 1935 and 1939 . " Competitive Amateur Football " was called off in September 1939 for World War II , but the K 's , depleted of the majority of their pre @-@ war players , came last in the first league after the war , and had to resort to fundraising to gather money to renovate both the stadium and the changing rooms . In 1949 , the all @-@ time top goalscorer Johnny Whing arrived at the club , and was top scorer in nine different seasons for the club . In 1955 , Kingstonian 's heaviest ever home defeat , 12 – 3 , was recorded at the hands of Bishop Auckland FC in front of the club 's record attendance of 8 @,@ 960 . 
 In the 1959 – 60 season , the K 's had their first Wembley Stadium appearance in the FA Amateur Cup final , which was lost to Hendon F.C. 2 – 1 . In 1963 , Kingstonian won the double ; the Surrey and London Senior Cup . The 1970s were a period of decline for the club , and despite becoming professional in 1975 , they were relegated to Division One in 1979 . In 1985 Kingstonian were once again promoted to the Isthmian League , finishing second . In 1987 , 20 years without silverware was ended by the K 's winning the London Senior Cup . 
 Kingstonian won the Isthmian League in 1998 and the FA Trophy in 1999 and 2000 at Wembley Stadium under manager Geoff Chapple , and then managed to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2001 . Entering the competition at the Fourth Qualifying Round , they beat Devizes Town before beating two Football League clubs – Brentford and Southend United , either side of a win over fellow Conference team Southport – on their way to the FA Cup fourth round , where they were drawn with Bristol City before succumbing to a late winner in the replay , losing 1 – 0 . 
 Relegation and financial problems saw a sharp downturn in the club 's fortunes between 2001 and 2005 , and in 2003 the then manager Kim Harris said that the owner Rajesh Khosla was " raping us " , after Khosla sold the Kingstonian ground for £ 2 million in personal profit . However , in February 2005 Khosla stepped down as chairman , selling the club to Jimmy Cochrane , whilst making a profit . While this did not save Kingstonian from relegation that year , the 2005 – 06 season saw Kingstonian Football Club revitalised . They only narrowly missed out on the promotion playoffs and finished their season by beating AFC Wimbledon in the final of the Surrey Senior Cup at Woking 's ground by one goal to nil . 
 Changes continued during mid @-@ 2006 with Mark Anderson and Malcolm <unk> taking charge of the club , installing Stuart McIntyre as successor to Ian McDonald in the role of head coach . However , McIntyre 's stay in the role was brief and " unsuccessful " , with he himself being replaced by Alan Dowson at the start of 2007 . Under Dowson the club was promoted back to the Isthmian Premier in 2009 . However , after the 2013 – 14 Isthmian League in which Kingstonian finished second but missed out on promotion , on 11 May 2014 Dowson resigned , being replaced by Tommy Williams .

 The early precursors to Kingstonian F.C. played home matches at various locations around the town including Oil Mill Lane ( now Villiers Road ) and the Fairfield , near Kingston town centre . In 1891 they participated in a tournament at the rugby club ground in Richmond Road , later to become their home . 
 In 1898 the club moved to their first private enclosed ground at <unk> Road , next to Kingston Barracks , moving again at the turn of the century to Lower Marsh Lane in 1902 , specifically to part of the rugby ground in Richmond Road . The split in 1908 – 09 between Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames A.F.C. and Old Kingstonians led to the breakaway group Old Kingstonians playing at Norbiton Sports Ground , Kingston @-@ on @-@ Thames A.F.C. remaining at Richmond Road . Reunited after World War I , the club continued to play at Richmond Road but , in 1920 , the site 's owners , the <unk> , leased the site to Leyland Motors , then establishing a factory base at nearby Ham . The club managed to negotiate a ground @-@ sharing arrangement and were eventually able to buy the land , but the issue impacted their performance . 
 Kingstonian F.C. remained at Richmond Road for most of the 20th Century , it thus being referred to as the club 's ' traditional home ' . The club 's record home attendance of 8 @,@ 960 was attained there in 1955 in a match against Bishop Auckland F.C. The maintenance of the site increasingly became more than the club 's income could support and parts of the site were sold off for redevelopment ; the ' Kingstonian petrol station ' occupying much of the Richmond Road frontage since 1956 , and the former running track and reserve pitch redeveloped for housing in the 1970s . The club eventually sold the site and moved out of Richmond Road in 1988 . The stadium was demolished after 1989 and the remainder of the site redeveloped for housing . 
 After a season and a half ground @-@ sharing at Hampton F.C. ' s <unk> ground , Kingstonian opened their brand new Kingsmeadow Stadium ( on the site of the old Norbiton Sports Ground owned by Kingston Council ) in August 1989 . The lease of the site was subsequently purchased by AFC Wimbledon in 2003 and the clubs have operated a ground @-@ sharing arrangement since then .

 Fred Dyer born Frederick William O 'Dwyer ( 29 April 1888 – date of death unknown ) , was a Welsh boxing champion , boxing manager and baritone singer . Trained by vocal teacher Clara Novello Davies , Dyer was famed for singing to audiences after he had fought in a contest and was nicknamed ' The Singing Boxer ' . 
 In 1913 Dyer was briefly Wales welterweight champion when he beat Jack Delaney , who won the belt back just six weeks later . During his professional career Dyer took two overseas tours , to Australia from 1914 to 1915 and the United States from 1916 to 1919 . Due to the time spent in Australia , he became eligible to contest for national titles , unsuccessfully challenging Les Darcy for the welterweight belt in 1915 . The highpoint of his time in America , then during the ' no decision ' era , was a win over Panama Joe Gans . Due to a knee injury , Dyer was refused active service during the First World War ; instead he was recruited into the United States Army as a boxing instructor . 
 After retiring from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London , successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby . Dyer then became a physical culture coach and was at the forefront of a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks . Little is known of his life after the Second World War and he faded into anonymity . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Dyer was born in 1888 in Cardiff , Wales to a Welsh mother and Irish father . Dyer 's mother came from a musical background and was a member of the Royal Welsh Glee , while his father was a bare knuckle boxer . Dyer showed promise as a baritone singer and was trained by Clara Novello Davies , mother of Ivor Novello . He was also an impressive sportsman , as a swimmer and , like his father , a boxer ; but his family 's poverty decreed that he took up boxing over his singing to provide an income . Dyer fought in the travelling show booths for quick money , but when this was discovered by the amateur boxing association , it led to him being stripped of his amateur status , which in turn saw his hopes of competing at the 1908 Summer Olympics in boxing and in swimming dashed . 
 = = = Professional career = = = 
 = = = = Welsh title = = = = 
 Dyer turned professional in either 1909 or 1910 . <unk> record his first fight in July 1909 against Jack Delaney , a boxer who Dyer would challenge in 1913 for the Wales welterweight title . Boxing magazine reported in January 1910 that his fight against future British and European welterweight champion Johnny Basham was Dyer 's debut fight . Both fights are recorded as victories for Dyer , but the fight against Basham , held in Newport on New Year 's Day 1910 , was reportedly held back to late at night to allow Dyer to fulfill matinee and evening singer engagements in Stoll 's Panopticon in St. Mary 's Street , Cardiff . 
 Dyer was a popular choice with boxing promoters , helped by the fact that after each bout he would sing Thora , a popular hit of the day to the audience . His careers as a pugilist and baritone earned him the nickname , ' The Singing Boxer ' . His first few bouts were all held in south Wales , but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight , and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden , London . On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars , London . To date , Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career . Dyer was easily ahead in the bout , when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony . Emden , who taunted the fallen Dyer , was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months . The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career , and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War . After the injury , Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee , and was forced to change his fighting style . He would always stand on the toes of his right foot , as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again . His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring , but this was again followed by a long absence . Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912 . 
 On 7 July 1913 Dyer faced Jack Delaney for the vacant Wales Area Welterweight title , despite Delaney being English . The fight was staged at the Skating Rink on Westgate Street in Cardiff and was scheduled for 20 rounds . The fight went the distance and Dyer was awarded the bout on points decision , making him the Welsh welterweight champion . He held the title for just over a month when a rematch for the title ended in victory for Delaney . Despite the loss , a win over Gus Platts — who would later become British and European middleweight champion — in October resulted in Dyer being touted as one of the preferred challengers to the British welterweight champion Johnny Summers . Summers though had travelled to Australia to extend his boxing campaign , and in the spring of 1914 Dyer decided to follow him abroad to challenge for his title . Dyer stopped off en route in South Africa to play music halls in a bid to help pay his fares . Dyer entertained with a mixture of songs and shadow boxing , and challenged all @-@ comers to fight with him at the end of the show . Unfortunately for Dyer , by the time he reached Australia , Summers had already returned to Britain . 
 = = = = Australia = = = = 
 Despite missing Summers , Dyer decided that the trip to Australia should not be wasted and began his own campaign . As in Britain , his note as a singer preceded him , and at several venues he would sing as well as box . His first fight , in May 1914 , was at the Athletic Pavilion in Melbourne against <unk> Pearce . The six round fight went the distance in Dyer 's favour . On 17 October 1914 he easily beat Sol Jones in a 20 round fight that went the distance , which was followed by a contest with American fighter Fritz Holland . Holland had arrived in Australia in 1914 , and had already beaten English fighter Tom McCormick and local <unk> Les Darcy . The fight with Holland took place at Baker 's Stadium , where Dyer had beaten Jones just the month before . The 20 round contest went the full distance , but when the referee declared the fight a draw there was uproar from the spectators who considered Dyer the winner . This was backed up by press representatives who had scored 16 of the rounds in favour of Dyer . Dyer 's display against Holland brought about a contest with Les Darcy , the " Maitland Wonder " . After their first contest was delayed when Darcy was detained in quarantine in Sydney , a contest was arranged for Boxing Day at Baker 's Stadium . At the start of the fight , Darcy weighed in at 11 st 1 lb , while Dyer 's weight was not announced beforehand , but in the after @-@ fight weighing , it was recorded as 10 st 2 lbs . Before the bout Dyer was sporting a black @-@ eye sustained in sparring and his knee strapped , which he always did after his dislocating the knee in 1911 . Darcy started the fight in a flurry in an attempt to finish the contest quickly , but after little gain both fighters settled into a more evenly paced bout . The contest went the distance and the referee gave the victory to Darcy , which was seen as a fair result . 
 While in Australia , as in South Africa , Dyer attempted to supplement his boxing income by arranging singing contracts at music halls and theatres , though his attempts to find work at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney were unsuccessful . During his time in Australia Dyer was involved in exhibition work and was one of the boxers present at the opening of a new stadium at the Broadmeadows Training Camp for soldiers in Melbourne . Dyer 's attempts to continue his boxing career stumbled during this period . A match was arranged with local butcher Jimmy McNabb , but McNabb then switched his fight to face Holland instead , though Holland 's team promised to give Dyer a fight with fellow American Jimmy Fitton , but that too fell through . A further fight was arranged with Belgian fighter Henri <unk> , but an injury to <unk> ending the encounter . In March 1915 Dyer put his boxing on temporary hold and spent some time in New Zealand , performing on the Brennan @-@ Fuller vaudeville circuit . Eventually a bout was secured with Victoria middleweight champion Ed Williams , and the two met at the newly built West Melbourne Stadium on 29 May 1915 . Despite being the lighter boxer , Dyer outpointed Williams from the fourth round of the fight and won by knockout in the ninth . 
 Just a week after defeating Williams , a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland . The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters turned out for a training exhibition in the build @-@ up to the contest . The contest , held on 5 June 1915 , was watched by a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 spectators . The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland , realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout , attacked Dyer ferociously , staggering the Welshman in the 19th . Despite the late assault , Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee . 
 After the Holland fight , Dyer made several attempts at a rematch with Darcy , reportedly to the exclusion of other fights , in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse . The postponed fight with <unk> was again mooted , but this too never occurred . In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work , setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney , and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales . Dyer 's persistence eventually paid off , and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium , with the Middleweight Championship title at stake . The fight was a one @-@ sided affair , with Dyer outclassed throughout . Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round , Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round . 
 Dyer 's final fight in Australia was a challenge for the Australian Welterweight title , held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay . Due to the fact that Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts . The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds . Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably , out @-@ scoring the champion for most of the early rounds . Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay 's nose at the start of the eighth , putting Kay down for a count of eight . When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence , but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor . In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count . Dyer 's corner called a foul blow , but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt .

 By the end of 1915 Dyer was through with Australia , the New Zealand Truth reporting that he had left by 4 December , and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States . In January , Dyer was in San Francisco , where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister , losing on points in a four round contest . He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York , and on 6 May 1916 he was back in the ring , in a ten round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney . The fight went the distance ending in a draw , though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney . After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song . 
 Dyer continued to box regularly in New York State losing to Frankie <unk> in June and then recording a draw with George Ashe in July . Dyer appears to have forgone fighting for over a year , but then returned to the ring in July 1917 , both contests held at the Rochester <unk> . He was given his first win since arriving in America in his encounter with Willie Langford but this was followed by another loss , this time to Bryan Downey . On 28 September 1917 , Dyer fought in Boston , Massachusetts , facing local fighter Tommy Robson , in which the referee declared a draw . His next fight , against Frankie Maguire in Pennsylvania , was given to Dyer by the Philadelphia Record after the fight went the distance . Dyer 's next fight was against Lew Williams , which was given to Williams by the New York Evening Telegram , though The New York Sun believed Dyer shaded the match with more precise punching . 
 On 3 November 1917 , A fight with Panama Joe Gans was arranged . The fight was held at the Clermont Avenue Rink in Brooklyn , location of his last two contests , the loss to Williams and then a win over Young Battling Nelson . Dyer easily outpointed Gans and was awarded the decision by several New York papers . The win over Gans caused some members of the press to talk of Dyer as a challenger for welterweight title holder Ted " Kid " Lewis , the London boxer who was then based in America . A match was made but Lewis injured a finger and the match was called off . By the time Lewis was fit he had lost his title to Jack Britton , and Britton was not interested in fighting Dyer . Dyer fought twice more in New York in 1917 , avoiding the newspaper decisions with a knockout win over Kid Queens and then a technical knockout of Kid Carter . 
 In late 1917 Dyer faced Tommy Robson again in two encounters in Massachusetts . The first , fought in Boston , was a disputed result after the bout went the distance , though it is recorded as a win for Robson . The second match , at Cuddy 's Arena in Lawrence , was intended to be between Robson and Ted Lewis , but when Lewis could not fight , Dyer stepped in . This second bout also ended in a newspaper decision for Robson . Despite fighting for twelve rounds against Robson , Dyer entertained the crowd after the fight by playing his ukulele and singing popular songs . As in Australia , Dyer continued to appear at charity events in aid of the war effort . In January 1918 he appeared as part of a fundraiser for the basketball team The Newark Elks , who had several players fighting in Europe . Headlining the bill was world boxing champion Benny Leonard . 
 On 1 February 1918 Dyer was awarded a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston , which he followed up with another win this time over Terry Brooks . At the start of the Brooks fight , as Dyer was getting into the ring , he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army . Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee . Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois , but fought one more bout , a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission . Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces during the rest of the war , but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments . Dyer also continued his charity work , singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces . 
 With the end of the war , Dyer returned to civilian life . His first fight outside the army was against local boxer Tommy Ferguson at the Town Hall in Scranton , Pennsylvania . The Scranton Times gave the decision to Ferguson , though the Evening Public Ledger gave every round to Dyer . Just a day later this was followed by a decisive loss to Eddie <unk> in Jersey City . Dyer then finished with his third fight within the week by facing Joe Egan on 18 February , a late substitute for Paul Doyle . Dyer lost by points decision . 
 After defeating Young Battling Nelson again , in a rematch set in Binghamton , Dyer lost on points a week later to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed . He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919 , mainly for the Boxers ' Loyalty League , sparring with the likes of Tim Healy and Silas Green . By now Dyer 's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and in the latter half of 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches . These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve <unk> in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July . Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus , fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers . Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America , a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray , but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe . 
 = = = = Career end = = = = 
 When Dyer returned to Europe he initially travelled to France , where he sang and played to theatres in Paris . Only one boxing match is recorded during his time there , against middleweight Jean Audouy . Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg , but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner . Just a week before his encounter with Audouy , Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer 's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters . 
 By July Dyer was back in Britain and was fit enough to re @-@ enter the ring , stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout in a contest in Wallsend . He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks ' disqualification in a contest held in Cardiff . In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face ' Bermondsey ' Billy Wells . During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight . The referee let the match go the full fifteen rounds and then , instead of declaring a winner , he called the fight a ' no contest ' , with the fighters ' purse being given to charity . After the National Sporting Club debacle , Dyer turned more and more to his singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920 . A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 is believed to be his last bout . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 After retiring from boxing , a decision forced on him by his ailing knee , Dyer focused on his theatre appearances . His voice , though , was not as it once was , and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up . Dyer then <unk> on boxing , but this time as a manager . In the 1920s he moved to London , where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters . The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham . Kirby went on to become the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930 . Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand , which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American <unk> McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army . The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location . 
 Dyer took his role as a physical culture expert very seriously and insisted on managing the diet of his boxers . He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid @-@ 1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks , a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses . Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade and was still working out of London in that capacity in 1939 . 
 Dyer slowly slipped into obscurity , and his dealings after London , including his place and date of death , are unknown . 
 = = Boxing record = = 
 As there is no definitive date of when Dyer turned professional and many fights in the early 20th century were poorly recorded , the boxing record associated with Dyer is incomplete . His total bouts and results presently stand , as listed by <unk> , as 72 fights , of which 44 were wins ( 14 by knockout ) , 20 loses ( 4 by knockout ) , 6 draws and 2 ' no contests ' . It is accepted that this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future , or changed . 
 One commonly held misconception connected to Dyer is that he holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history , after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde . This information was published in Nat Fleischer 's The Ring : Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia , in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912 . Although it could be argued that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years , and may have turned professional in 1908 , it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss . This therefore challenges Fleischer 's claim . 
 = Hero ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Hero " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was released on October 19 , 1993 via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey 's third studio album , Music Box ( 1993 ) . Originally intended for Gloria Estefan , the song was written by Mariah and produced by her and Walter Afanasieff . While writing the song , Carey did not connect to its style or sound , therefore forfeiting it over to the soundtrack of the film of the same name . However , after being convinced to keep it , she personalized it , giving it a more pop and R & B melody , as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality . Lyrically , the song is regarded as one of Carey 's most inspirational and personal ballads , with its protagonist declaring that even though we may feel discouraged or down at times , in reality we are " heroes " if we look inside ourselves and see our own inner strength ; in time , it will help us " find the way . " 
 The song received mixed reviews by contemporary music critics for its lyrical content , while Carey 's vocal performance was praised . Aside from its lyrics , " Hero " derived its hook and sound from several musical instruments such as the guitar , piano and organ . The song experienced strong success in several international markets , and also became Carey 's eighth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100 . Additionally , it was ranked number 53 on the Decade @-@ End Chart . Outside the United States , " Hero " enjoyed strong charting , reaching the top five in Canada , France , Ireland , New Zealand and Norway and the top ten in Australia and the United Kingdom . 
 Due to fan requests and letters , as well as their connection to its personal meaning and content , the song remains one of Carey 's most performed songs . Deemed by many as her signature song , the song was originally performed on The Arsenio Hall Show , The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , and Hey Hey It 's Saturday during its original chart run . Additionally , Carey performed it on several live telethons and specials , such as Pavarotti and Friends and Michael Jackson & Friends in 1999 , America : A Tribute to Heroes in 2001 , Live 8 in 2005 , and the inaugural ball for Barack Obama in 2009 . Additionally , the song was featured on the set @-@ lists of all of Carey 's tours , usually serving as the encore or closing number , and making its debut during the album 's accompanying set of concerts , the Music Box Tour . The song was included on several of Carey 's compilation albums , # 1 's ( 1998 ) , Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) , The Ballads ( 2008 ) , and # 1 to Infinity ( 2015 ) . 
 Throughout the course of her career , Carey has re @-@ recorded the song twice , and filmed other music videos aside from the original . The first music video for the song was filmed by Larry Jordan in July 1993 during a private concert at Proctor 's Theatre , later released on the home video Here Is Mariah Carey . In 2001 , following the September 11 attacks , Carey re @-@ recorded the song as a mash @-@ up single titled " Never Too Far / Hero Medley , " a medley with her single at the time , " Never Too Far . " Additionally , prior to the release of her compilation album The Ballads , Carey re @-@ recorded " Hero " and filmed a new video featuring behind the scenes footage of the studio . " Hero " won two ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards , one ASCAP Pop Music Award and one BMI Pop Award for the Songwriter Award . The song has been covered many times during both studio and live recordings , such as on global singing competitions . 
 = = Background = = 
 Mariah Carey 's second studio album , Emotions ( 1991 ) , contained influences from mostly 1950 's , 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel , as well as her continued work of R & B and soul . The album , while praised by some as more mature and raw , failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort , and could not introduce Carey to a different market . Following these events , Columbia decided to market the singer in a similar fashion to her debut , only have her produce a more commercial and radio @-@ friendly album . Their plans were to tone down Carey 's vocals , and soften the album 's production , leaving a more contemporary pop record . Agreeing to the change , Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort , Music Box ( 1993 ) . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Aside from her work as a vocalist and record artist , Carey was becoming known as a songwriter , having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career . During the production of Music Box , she was approached by Epic Records to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff , and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Hero , featuring Dustin Hoffman and Geena Davis . While Carey was interested in the project , Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film , fearing it would hurt her career . Additionally , Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest @-@ selling recording artist to contribute to another label , even a branch of the same parent company , Sony . So they wanted to try the next best thing , which was to have us write something . " Still interested in working for the film , Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film , intended for fellow female singer , Gloria Estefan . Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York , and over the course of two hours , composed the song 's melody , lyric and concept . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song : 
 I went to New York and we were in the studio and came to a break . I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie . Within two hours , we had this incredible seed for this song , ' Hero ' . It was never meant for Mariah to sing . In her mind , we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie . And we went into an area that Mariah didn 't really go into @-@ in her words , it was a little bit too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old @-@ fashioned as far as melody and lyrics . 
 As they completed the song 's demo , Tommy Mottola , CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Carey 's fiancé , walked into the studio . After hearing the rough version of the song , on which they were still working on , he became interested in it , asking what project the song belonged to . Carey explained to him the concept and how the song would be used for the film Hero . Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song , responding , " Are you kidding me ? You can 't give this song to this movie . This is too good . Mariah , you have to take this song . You have to do it . " Initially , Carey was guided by the subject of the film , but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it , altering some of the lyrics , key and instrumentation . After their decision to keep " Hero , " Afanasieff went back to the staff at Epic and told them that they had failed to come up with a song for the soundtrack . Estefan never heard the tune was originally meant for her , and the song that ended up in the soundtrack was " Heart of a Hero , " written , produced and recorded by Luther Vandross . In the following weeks , after completing the song , Afanasieff spoke with Bronson about its recording , and how Carey created several versions of the track : 
 There was a simpler performance on tape and a more difficult one , with Mariah singing out more , with more licks . But we chose a happy medium . The song really calls for not anything really fancy . But she 's always fighting the forces inside of her because she 's her own devil 's advocate . She wants to do something that 's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has . But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for . 
 = = Composition and lyrical content = = 
 " Hero " is a mid @-@ tempo ballad . It was written and produced by Carey and Afanasieff , and was released as the second single from her third studio album , Music Box . It incorporates music from several musical instruments , including the piano , guitar and organ . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing , the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of E major with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of G ♯ 3 to the high @-@ note of E5 . The song 's chorus has a basic chord progression of Gsus2 – G – G / F ♯ – Em7 – G / D – C @-@ G / B – Am7 . Originally , Carey felt the song was " too schmaltzy " and over the top for her , and not in line with her other work . However , after being convinced by Mottola to keep the song , Carey changed the song and personalized it , during which time she grew to feel a connection to the song and its lyrics . According to author Chris Nickson , " Hero " is one of Carey 's most personal and inspirational ballads . Carey has described how the song was never her favorite , however , after all the fan letters and messages she received about the song , she felt the need to perform it as often as possible . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Carey described the song 's meaning to her and to fans : 
 One person could say that ' hero ' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage , but another person can write to me a letter and say , ' I 've considered committing suicide everyday of my life for the last ten years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero . ' And that , that 's an unexplainable feeling , like I 've done something with my life , y 'know ? ... It meant something to someone . 
 The song 's lyrics describe of the individual power that lies inside every person , their ability to be their own hero . According to author Carol K. <unk> , the song inspires anyone to be a hero . <unk> continued how due to a hero 's power to transform and inspire those around them , so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world . Similarly , author Darlene Wade connects the song 's lyrical content to the power within the soul , however also with the inclusion of God . 
 According to <unk> Moffitt , author of " See It , Be It , Write It " , " Hero " is about looking into oneself and discovering the inner courage inside each individual , and being strong and believing in oneself through times of trouble and adversity . <unk> claims the song personally helped him get through difficult moments when " the answers seemed so far away . " Following her taped performance of " One Sweet Day " at the Honda Center in Anaheim , California during The Adventures of Mimi Tour , Carey described the song 's importance to her and her fans : 
 I wrote a song a while back even before " One Sweet Day " and it was not my favorite song in the world , but I wrote it . Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story , and you know it was kind of a moving concept or whatever . And I did it , and I was like you know it ’ s not necessarily what I like per se , but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying , thank you for writing ‘ Hero ’ because it saved my life or it saved my father ’ s life or my brothers or sisters life , or something of that nature , I said I always have to sing that song when I ’ m performing because if I don ’ t , you never know who I ’ m leaving out and you know what , in times of my life I ’ ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself . So its from the ‘ Music Box ’ album , and it ’ s called ‘ Hero ' , this is for you . 
 = = Copyright lawsuits = = 
 " Hero " was the subject of two copyright plagiarism cases ; one by Christopher Selletti and the other by Rhonda Dimmer , filed in 1993 and 1996 . Selletti claimed he had written the song 's lyrics in the form of a poem . One day , as he drove Sly Stone in a limousine to Long Island , he claimed to have shown him the poem . Selletti claimed Stone complimented the poem , taking it and promising to patent it and earn him royalties . After many months , the pair fell out of contact , leading Selletti to mail himself the envelope and poem , performing a " poor man 's copyright . " Three years later in 1996 , he claimed to have listened to Carey 's album Music Box and was shocked when he noted the song 's similar lyrics . He filed a lawsuit against Carey , Stone , Sony and Stone 's manager Jerry Goldstein . Selletti claimed that Stone must have sold or contributed the lyrics to Carey during the recording of the album in late 1992 . However , since Stone did not receive songwriting credits on " Hero " , Selletti then dropped the suit against Stone , leaving him against Carey and Sony . Prior to their court room meeting , Carey told New York Daily News " I feel totally victimized . ' Hero ' is my creation and it holds a very special meaning to me . I have every intention of fighting this all the way . " In court , Carey provided evidence to her innocence , in the form of a dated lyrical and music notebook , with conceptual info on the song dated back to November 20 , 1992 , prior to Selletti 's meeting with Stone . Additionally , Carey stated the fact that she had originally written it for the film Hero alongside Afanasieff , making their connection or the involvement of his material impossible . Judge Denny Chin found Carey innocent , and ordered Selletti to pay her a fine . 
 Years later , after consulting with another lawyer , Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony . His lawyer , Jeffrey Levitt , had uncovered the fact that the film was released in October 1992 , a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey 's notebook . Additionally , " Heart of a Hero " , which was written by Luther Vandross for the film , was submitted in January 1992 , making it impossible for " Hero " to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack . After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992 , recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song completed well before the film 's October release . Following the evidence from both parties , the judge dismissed the case , ruling in Carey 's favor for the second time . Following the dismissal of the case , Rhonda <unk> , another songwriter and an independent singer , filed a lawsuit against Carey , this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song " Be Your Own Hero " . During the short deposition made by Carey , Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992 , " within a matter of hours . " Soon after , the case was dismissed , with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on <unk> 's behalf . Following the lawsuits , in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit , as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident . Following the suits , Cindy Berger , Carey 's publicist released the following statement : " This case has been thrown out of court three times . The federal judge after hearing Selletti 's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a ' complete fabrication ' and that it was filed ' to extort a settlement from deep @-@ pocket defendants .

" Additionally , she called its chorus " uplifting " and " soaring , " following praise towards Carey 's vocal performance . The song received a mixed review from The Washington Post editor Mike Joyce , who while impressed , claimed it was not as good as competing ballads of the time . Paul <unk> of the Orlando Sentinel criticized the song , calling it a " rip @-@ off " of Whitney Houston 's " Greatest Love of All " . Stephen Holden , another editor from Rolling Stone also noted an inspiration and similarity to " Greatest Love of All " and calling its lyrics " made up entirely of pop and soul clichés . "

 = Termite = 
 Termites are eusocial insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of infraorder Isoptera , or as epifamily Termitoidae within the cockroach order Blattodea . Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches , but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from close ancestors of cockroaches during the Jurassic or Triassic . However , the first termites possibly emerged during the Permian or even the Carboniferous . About 3 @,@ 106 species are currently described , with a few hundred more left to be described . Although these insects are often called white ants , they are not ants . 
 Like ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order Hymenoptera , termites divide labour among castes consisting of sterile male and female " workers " and " soldiers " . All colonies have fertile males called " kings " and one or more fertile females called " queens " . Termites mostly feed on dead plant material and cellulose , generally in the form of wood , leaf litter , soil , or animal dung . Termites are major detritivores , particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions , and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance . 
 Termites are among the most successful groups of insects on Earth , colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica . Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals . Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world , with some queens living up to 50 years . Unlike ants , which undergo a complete metamorphosis , each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg , nymph , and adult stages . Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self @-@ regulating entity : the colony itself . 
 Termites are a delicacy in the diet of some human cultures and are used in many traditional medicines . Several hundred species are economically significant as pests that can cause serious damage to buildings , crops , or plantation forests . Some species , such as the West Indian drywood termite ( Cryptotermes brevis ) , are regarded as invasive species . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The infraorder name Isoptera is derived from the Greek words iso ( equal ) and ptera ( winged ) , which refers to the nearly equal size of the fore and hind wings . " Termite " derives from the Latin and Late Latin word <unk> ( " woodworm , white ant " ) , altered by the influence of Latin <unk> ( " to rub , wear , erode " ) from the earlier word <unk> . Termite nests were commonly known as <unk> or <unk> . In early English , termites were known as " wood ants " or " white ants " . The modern term was first used in 1781 . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 DNA analysis from 16S rRNA sequences has supported a hypothesis , originally suggested by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934 , that these insects are most closely related to wood @-@ eating cockroaches ( genus Cryptocercus , the <unk> ) . This earlier conclusion had been based on the similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in the wood @-@ eating cockroaches to those in certain species of termites regarded as living fossils . In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F. A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and Cryptocercus nymphs . These similarities have led some authors to propose that termites be reclassified as a single family , the Termitidae , within the order Blattodea , which contains cockroaches . Other researchers advocate the more conservative measure of retaining the termites as the Termitoidae , an epifamily within the cockroach order , which preserves the classification of termites at family level and below . 
 The oldest unambiguous termite fossils date to the early Cretaceous , but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects , they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic . Further evidence of a Jurassic origin is the assumption that the extinct <unk> consumed termites , judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite @-@ eating mammals . The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas , where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered . 
 Claims that termites emerged earlier have faced controversy . For example , F. M. <unk> indicated that the Mastotermitidae termites may go back to the Late Permian , 251 million years ago , and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae , the most primitive living termite , have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas . It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous . Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus . The folded wings of the fossil wood roach <unk> , arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a , resemble those seen in Mastotermes , the only living insect with the same pattern . Krishna et al . , though , consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera . Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system , evolving more than 100 million years ago . 
 Termites have long been accepted to be closely related to cockroaches and mantids , and they are classified in the same superorder ( Dictyoptera ) . Strong evidence suggests termites are highly specialised wood @-@ eating cockroaches . The cockroach genus Cryptocercus shares the strongest <unk> similarity with termites and is considered to be a sister @-@ group to termites . Termites and Cryptocercus share similar morphological and social features : for example , most cockroaches do not exhibit social characteristics , but Cryptocercus takes care of its young and exhibits other social behaviour such as trophallaxis and allogrooming . The primitive giant northern termite ( Mastotermes <unk> ) exhibits numerous cockroach @-@ like characteristics that are not shared with other termites , such as laying its eggs in rafts and having anal lobes on the wings . <unk> and Isoptera are united in the clade <unk> . Although termites are sometimes called " white ants " , they are actually not ants . Ants belong to the family Formicidae within the order Hymenoptera . The similarity of their social structure to that of termites is attributed to convergent evolution . 
 As of 2013 , about 3 @,@ 106 living and fossil termite species are recognised , classified in 12 families . The infraorder Isoptera is divided into the following clade and family groups , showing the subfamilies in their respective classification : 
 = = Distribution and diversity = = 
 Termites are found on all continents except Antarctica . The diversity of termite species is low in North America and Europe ( 10 species known in Europe and 50 in North America ) , but is high in South America , where over 400 species are known . Of the 3 @,@ 000 termite species currently classified , 1 @,@ 000 are found in Africa , where mounds are extremely abundant in certain regions . Approximately 1 @.@ 1 million active termite mounds can be found in the northern Kruger National Park alone . In Asia , there are 435 species of termites , which are mainly distributed in China . Within China , termite species are restricted to mild tropical and subtropical habitats south of the Yangtze River . In Australia , all ecological groups of termites ( <unk> , drywood , subterranean ) are endemic to the country , with over 360 classified species . 
 Due to their soft cuticles , termites do not inhabit cool or cold habitats . There are three ecological groups of termites : <unk> , drywood and subterranean . <unk> termites are found only in coniferous forests , and drywood termites are found in hardwood forests ; subterranean termites live in widely diverse areas . One species in the drywood group is the West Indian drywood termite ( Cryptotermes brevis ) , which is an invasive species in Australia . 
 = = Description = = 
 Termites are usually small , measuring between 4 to 15 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 to 0 @.@ 59 in ) in length . The largest of all extant termites are the queens of the species Macrotermes bellicosus , measuring up to over 10 centimetres ( 4 in ) in length . Another giant termite , the extinct <unk> <unk> , flourished in Austria during the Miocene and had a wingspan of 76 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) and a body length of 25 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) . 
 Most worker and soldier termites are completely blind as they do not have a pair of eyes . However , some species , such as <unk> mossambicus , have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight . The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli . Lateral ocelli , however , are not found in all termites . Like other insects , termites have a small tongue @-@ shaped labrum and a clypeus ; the clypeus is divided into a <unk> and <unk> . Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch , taste , odours ( including pheromones ) , heat and vibration . The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape , a pedicel ( typically shorter than the scape ) , and the flagellum ( all segments beyond the scape and pedicel ) . The mouth parts contain a maxillae , a labium , and a set of mandibles . The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling . 
 Consistent with all insects , the anatomy of the termite thorax consists of three segments : the prothorax , the mesothorax and the metathorax . Each segment contains a pair of two legs . On alates , the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax . The mesothorax and metathorax have well @-@ developed exoskeletal plates ; the prothorax has smaller plates . 
 Termites have a ten @-@ segmented abdomen with two plates , the tergites and the sternites . There are ten tergites , of which nine are wide and one is elongated . The reproductive organs are similar to those in cockroaches but are more simplified . For example , the intromittent organ is not present in male alates , and the sperm is either <unk> or <unk> . However , Mastotermitidae termites have <unk> sperm with limited motility . The genitals in females are also simplified . Unlike in other termites , Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor , a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches . 
 The non @-@ reproductive castes of termites are wingless and rely exclusively on their six legs for locomotion . The alates fly only for a brief amount of time , so they also rely on their legs . The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste , but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs . The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects : the parts of a leg include a coxa , trochanter , femur , tibia and the tarsus . The number of tibial spurs on an individual 's leg varies . Some species of termite have an <unk> , located between the claws , which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites . 
 Unlike in ants , the hind @-@ wings and fore @-@ wings are of equal length . Most of the time , the alates are poor flyers ; their technique is to launch themselves in the air and fly in a random direction . Studies show that in comparison to larger termites , smaller termites cannot fly long distances . When a termite is in flight , its wings remain at a right angle , and when the termite is at rest , its wings remain parallel to the body . 
 = = = Caste system = = = 
 Worker termites undertake the most labour within the colony , being responsible for foraging , food storage , and brood and nest maintenance . Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste to be found in infested wood . The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis . <unk> is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components . It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring , allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another . Some termite species do not have a true worker caste , instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste . 
 The soldier caste has anatomical and behavioural specialisations , and their sole purpose is to defend the colony . Many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged they cannot feed themselves . Instead , like juveniles , they are fed by workers . <unk> , simple holes in the forehead that exude defensive secretions , are a feature of the family <unk> . Many species are readily identified using the characteristics of the soldiers ' larger and darker head and large mandibles . Among certain termites , soldiers may use their globular ( <unk> ) heads to block their narrow tunnels . Different sorts of soldiers include minor and major soldiers , and nasutes , which have a horn @-@ like nozzle frontal projection ( a nasus ) . These unique soldiers are able to spray noxious , sticky secretions containing <unk> at their enemies . Nitrogen fixation plays an important role in <unk> nutrition . 
 The reproductive caste of a mature colony includes a fertile female and male , known as the queen and king . The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony . Unlike in ants , the king mates with her for life . In some species , the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity , a characteristic known as <unk> . Depending on the species , the queen will start producing reproductive winged alates at a certain time of the year , and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins . These swarms attract a wide variety of predators . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Termites are often compared with the social Hymenoptera ( ants and various species of bees and wasps ) , but their differing evolutionary origins result in major differences in life cycle . In the eusocial Hymenoptera , the workers are exclusively female : males ( drones ) are haploid and develop from unfertilised eggs , while females ( both workers and the queen ) are diploid and develop from fertilised eggs . In contrast , worker termites , which constitute the majority in a colony , are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs . Depending on species , male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony . 
 The life cycle of a termite begins with an egg , but is different from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis , with egg , nymph and adult stages . After eggs hatch into nymphs , the nymphs will go through a series of moults until they become adults . In some species , eggs go through four moulting stages while nymphs go through three . Nymphs first moult into workers , and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates ; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs . 
 The development of nymphs into adults can take months ; the time period depends on food availability , temperature , and the general population of the colony . Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves , workers must feed them , but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging , building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen . Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies , preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Termite alates only leave the colony when a nuptial flight takes place . <unk> males and females will pair up together and then land in search of a suitable place for a colony . A termite king and queen will not mate until they find such a spot . When they do , they excavate a chamber big enough for both , close up the entrance and proceed to mate . After mating , the pair will never go outside and will spend the rest of their lives in the nest . Nuptial flight time varies in each species . For example , alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter . The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk , when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights . The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions , the time of day , moisture , wind speed and precipitation . The number of termites in a colony also varies , with the larger species typically having 100 – 1 @,@ 000 individuals . However , some termite colonies , including those with large individuals , can number in the millions . 
 The queen will only lay 10 – 20 eggs in the very early stages of the colony , but will lay as many as 1 @,@ 000 a day when the colony is several years old . At maturity , a primary queen has a great capacity to lay eggs . In some species , the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40 @,@ 000 eggs a day . The two mature ovaries may have some 2 @,@ 000 ovarioles each . The abdomen increases the queen 's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely ; attendant workers provide assistance . 
 The king grows only slightly larger after initial mating and continues to mate with the queen for life ( a termite queen can live up to 50 years ) . This is very different from ant colonies , in which a queen mates once with the male ( s ) and stores the gametes for life , as the male ants die shortly after mating . If a queen is absent , a termite king will produce pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens . As the queen and king are monogamous , sperm competition does not occur . 
 Termites going through incomplete metamorphosis on the path to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite , functioning as potential supplementary reproductives . These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen , or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony . <unk> have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive , and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony . Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction . Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers , the queens reproduce their replacements ( neotenic queens ) parthenogenetically . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Termites are detritivores , consuming dead plants at any level of decomposition . They also play a vital role in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood , faeces and plants . Many species eat cellulose , having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre . Termites are considered to be a major source ( 11 % ) of atmospheric methane , one of the prime greenhouse gases , produced from the breakdown of cellulose . Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa ( <unk> ) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them , allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use . Gut protozoa , such as <unk> , in turn , rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes . Most higher termites , especially in the family Termitidae , can produce their own cellulase enzymes , but they rely primarily upon the bacteria . The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae . Scientists ' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary ; what is true in all termite species , however , is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material , either from the mouth or anus . Judging from closely related bacterial species , it is strongly presumed that the termites ' and cockroach 's gut microbiota derives from their <unk> ancestors . 
 Certain species such as <unk> <unk> have seasonal food habits . For example , they may preferentially consume Red three @-@ awn ( Aristida <unk> ) during the summer , <unk> ( <unk> dactyloides ) from May to August , and blue grama Bouteloua gracilis during spring , summer and autumn . Colonies of G. <unk> consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high . 
 Various woods differ in their susceptibility to termite attack ; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content , hardness , and resin and lignin content . In one study , the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony . These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour . 
 Some species of termite practice <unk> . They maintain a " garden " of specialised fungi of genus <unk> , which are nourished by the excrement of the insects . When the fungi are eaten , their spores pass undamaged through the intestines of the termites to complete the cycle by germinating in the fresh faecal pellets . 
 Depending on their feeding habits , termites are placed into two groups : the lower termites and higher termites . The lower termites predominately feed on wood . As wood is difficult to digest , termites prefer to consume fungus @-@ infected wood because it is easier to digest and the fungi are high in protein . Meanwhile , the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials , including faeces , humus , grass , leaves and roots . The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa , while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Termites are consumed by a wide variety of predators . One species alone , <unk> mossambicus , was found in the stomach contents of 65 birds and 19 mammals . Arthropods and reptiles such as bees , centipedes , cockroaches , crickets , dragonflies , frogs , lizards , scorpions , spiders , and toads consume these insects , while two spiders in the family <unk> are specialist termite predators . Other predators include aardvarks , <unk> , anteaters , bats , bears , <unk> , many birds , echidnas , foxes , galagos , numbats , mice and pangolins . The aardwolf is an insectivorous mammal that primarily feeds on termites ; it locates its food by sound and also by detecting the scent secreted by the soldiers ; a single aardwolf is capable of consuming thousands of termites in a single night by using its long , sticky tongue . Sloth bears break open mounds to consume the nestmates , while chimpanzees have developed tools to " fish " termites from their nest . Wear pattern analysis of bone tools used by the early hominin <unk> robustus suggests that they used these tools to dig into termite mounds . 
 Among all predators , ants are the greatest enemy to termites . Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites . For example , Megaponera is a strictly termite @-@ eating ( <unk> ) genus that perform raiding activities , some lasting several hours . <unk> <unk> is another termite @-@ raiding species , with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home , all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails . The Malaysian <unk> ant <unk> <unk> uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces , as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies . Once inside , the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles . <unk> <unk> is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites . A scout will recruit 10 – 30 workers to an area where termites are present , killing them by immobilising them with their stinger . <unk> and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds , and so the termites are preyed on by these ants . No evidence for any kind of relationship ( other than a predatory one ) is known . Other ants , including <unk> , Camponotus , Crematogaster , <unk> , <unk> , Odontomachus , <unk> , Pachycondyla , Rhytidoponera , Solenopsis and <unk> , also prey on termites . In contrast to all these ant species , and despite their enormous diversity of prey , Dorylus ants rarely consume termites . 
 Ants are not the only invertebrates that perform raids . Many <unk> wasps and several species including <unk> <unk> and <unk> Araujo are known to raid termite mounds during the termites ' nuptial flight . 
 = = = Parasites , pathogens and viruses = = = 
 Termites are less likely to be attacked by parasites than bees , wasps and ants , as they are usually well protected in their mounds . Nevertheless , termites are infected by a variety of parasites . Some of these include dipteran flies , <unk> mites , and a large number of nematode parasites . Most nematode parasites are in the order <unk> ; others are in the genus Mermis , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites , a colony may migrate to a new location . Fungi pathogens such as such as Aspergillus <unk> and Metarhizium anisopliae are , however , major threats to a termite colony as they are not host @-@ specific and may infect large portions of the colony ; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact . M. <unk> is known to weaken the termite immune system . Infection with A. <unk> only occurs when a colony is under great stress . <unk> between two termite species does not occur in the termite world . 
 Termites are infected by viruses including <unk> and the Nuclear <unk> Virus . 
 = = = Locomotion and foraging = = = 
 Because the worker and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly , and the reproductives use their wings for just a brief amount of time , termites predominantly rely upon their legs to move about . 
 Foraging behaviour depends on the type of termite . For example , certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit , and others harvest food that is near the nest . Most workers are rarely found out in the open , and do not forage unprotected ; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators . Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food , and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a <unk> pheromone that attracts workers . Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other , and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands . In one species , Nasutitermes <unk> , there are three phases in a foraging expedition : first , soldiers scout an area . When they find a food source , they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge . In the second phase , workers appear in large numbers at the site . The third phase is marked by a decrease in the number of soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers . Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food . 
 = = = Competition = = = 
 Competition between two colonies always results in agonistic behaviour towards each other , resulting in fights . These fights can cause mortality on both sides and , in some cases , the gain or loss of territory . " Cemetery pits " may be present , where the bodies of dead termites are buried . 
 Studies show that when termites encounter each other in foraging areas , some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering . Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to the isolation of the area and thus the need to construct new tunnels . Conflict between two competitors does not always occur . For example , though they might block each other 's passages , colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus and Macrotermes <unk> are not always aggressive towards each other . Suicide cramming is known in <unk> formosanus . Since C. formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict , some termites will tightly squeeze into foraging tunnels and die , successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities . 
 Among the reproductive caste , neotenic queens may compete with each other to become the dominant queen when there are no primary reproductives . This struggle among the queens leads to the elimination of all but a single queen , which , with the king , will take over the colony . 
 Ants and termites may compete with each other for nesting space . In particular , ants that prey on termites usually have a negative impact on arboreal nesting species . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Most termites are blind , so communication primarily occurs through chemical , mechanical and <unk> cues . These methods of communication are used in a variety of activities , including foraging , locating reproductives , construction of nests , recognition of nestmates , nuptial flight , locating and fighting enemies , and defending the nests . The most common way of communicating is through antennation . A number of pheromones are known , including contact pheromones ( which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming ) and alarm , trail and sex pheromones . The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland . Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland , and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources : the sternal and tergal glands . When termites go out to look for food , they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation . A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects . Workers leave pheromones on these trails , which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors . Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues , vibrations , and physical contact . These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source . 
 When termites construct their nests , they use predominantly indirect communication . No single termite would be in charge of any particular construction project . Individual termites react rather than think , but at a group level , they exhibit a sort of collective cognition . Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building . The termite adds these objects onto existing structures , and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers . The result is a self @-@ organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals . 
 Termites can distinguish nestmates and non @-@ nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts : chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons released from the cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species . Each colony has its own distinct odour . This odour is a result of genetic and environmental factors such as the termites ' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites ' intestines . 
 = = = Defence = = = 
 See also Insect defences 
 Termites rely on alarm communication to defend a colony . Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens . Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores , through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates . Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones . 
 In some species , some soldiers block tunnels to prevent their enemies from entering the nest , and they may deliberately rupture themselves as an act of defence . In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier 's head , defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx @-@ like formation around the breach and bite at intruders . If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful , an entire colony may be destroyed , although this scenario is rare . 
 To termites , any breach of their tunnels or nests is a cause for alarm . When termites detect a potential breach , the soldiers will usually bang their heads apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach . Additionally , an alarmed termite will bump into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area , which is also a way to recruit extra workers . 
 The pantropical subfamily <unk> has a specialised caste of soldiers , known as nasutes , that have the ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn @-@ like frontal projection that they use for defence . <unk> have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must be fed by workers . A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete . 
 Soldiers of the species <unk> sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis – rupturing a large gland just beneath the surface of their cuticles . The thick , yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air , entangling ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest . Another termite , <unk> <unk> , also engages in suicidal defence . Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals , then deliberately rupture themselves , releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies . The soldiers of the neotropical termite family <unk> have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis , with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen . When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders , they engage in autothysis , creating a block that denies entry to any attacker . 
 Workers use several different strategies to deal with their dead , including burying , cannibalism , and avoiding a corpse altogether . To avoid pathogens , termites occasionally engage in <unk> , in which a nestmate will carry away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere . Which strategy is used depends on the nature of the corpse a worker is dealing with ( i.e. the age of the carcass ) . 
 = = = Relationship with other organisms = = = 
 A species of fungus is known to mimic termite eggs , successfully avoiding its natural predators . These small brown balls , known as " termite balls " , rarely kill the eggs , and in some cases the workers will even tend to them . This fungus mimics these eggs by producing a cellulose @-@ digesting enzyme known as <unk> . A unique mimicking behaviour exists between various species of <unk> beetles and certain termite species within <unk> . The beetles share the same cuticle hydrocarbons as the termites and even biosynthesize them . This chemical mimicry allows the beetles to integrate themselves within the termite colonies . The developed appendages on the <unk> abdomen of <unk> <unk> allows the beetle to mimic a termite worker . 
 Some species of ant are known to capture termites to use as a fresh food source later on , rather than killing them . For example , Formica nigra captures termites , and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground . Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs . Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and <unk> ants attack underground . Despite this , some termites and ants can coexist peacefully . Some species of termite , including Nasutitermes <unk> , form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species . The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period . 
 54 species of ants are known to inhabit Nasutitermes mounds , both occupied and abandoned ones . One reason many ants live in Nasutitermes mounds is due to the termites ' frequent occurrence in their geographical range ; another is to protect themselves from floods . Iridomyrmex also inhabits termite mounds although no evidence for any kind of relationship ( other than a predatory one ) is known . In rare cases , certain species of termites live inside active ant colonies . Some invertebrate organisms such as beetles , caterpillars , flies and millipedes are <unk> and dwell inside termite colonies ( they are unable to survive independently ) . As a result , certain beetles and flies have evolved with their hosts . They have developed a gland that secrete a substance that attracts the workers by licking them . Mounds may also provide shelter and warmth to birds , lizards , snakes and scorpions . 
 Termites are known to carry pollen and regularly visit flowers , so are regarded as potential pollinators for a number of flowering plants . One flower in particular , <unk> gardneri , is regularly pollinated by foraging workers , and it is perhaps the only Orchidaceae flower in the world to be pollinated by termites . 
 Many plants have developed effective defences against termites . However , seedlings are vulnerable to termite attacks and need additional protection , as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage . Defence is typically achieved by secreting <unk> chemicals into the woody cell walls . This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose . A commercial product , " <unk> " , has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint @-@ on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings . An extract of a species of Australian figwort , Eremophila , has been shown to repel termites ; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material to the extent that they will starve rather than consume the food . When kept close to the extract , they become disoriented and eventually die . 
 = = Nests = = 
 A termite nest can be considered as being composed of two parts , the inanimate and the animate . The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony , and the inanimate part is the structure itself , which is constructed by the termites . Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories : subterranean ( completely below ground ) , epigeal ( protruding above the soil surface ) , and arboreal ( built above ground , but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes ) . <unk> nests ( mounds ) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud . A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators . Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds . Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs , stumps and the dead parts of trees , as did termites millions of years ago . 
 To build their nests , termites primarily use faeces , which have many desirable properties as a construction material . Other building materials include partly digested plant material , used in carton nests ( arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood ) , and soil , used in subterranean nest and mound construction . Not all nests are visible , as many nests in tropical forests are located underground . Species in the subfamily <unk> are good examples of subterranean nest builders , as they only dwell inside tunnels . Other termites live in wood , and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood . Nests and mounds protect the termites ' soft bodies against desiccation , light , pathogens and parasites , as well as providing a fortification against predators . Nests made out of carton are particularly weak , and so the inhabitants use counter @-@ attack strategies against invading predators . 
 Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests ; this habitat is called <unk> . <unk> species of termites form multiple nests , or <unk> , connected by subterranean chambers . The termite genera <unk> and <unk> are known to have polycalic species . <unk> nests appear to be less frequent in mound @-@ building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of Nasutitermes . 
 = = = Mounds = = = 
 Nests are considered mounds if they protrude from the earth 's surface . A mound provides termites the same protection as a nest but is stronger . Mounds located in areas with torrential and continuous rainfall are at risk of mound erosion due to their clay @-@ rich construction . Those made from carton can provide protection from the rain , and in fact can withstand high precipitation . Certain areas in mounds are used as strong points in case of a breach . For example , <unk> colonies build narrow tunnels used as strong points , as the diameter of the tunnels is small enough for soldiers to block . A highly protected chamber , known as the " queens cell " , houses the queen and king and is used as a last line of defence . 
 Species in the genus Macrotermes arguably build the most complex structures in the insect world , constructing enormous mounds . These mounds are among the largest in the world , reaching a height of 8 to 9 metres ( 26 to 29 feet ) , and consist of chimneys , pinnacles and ridges . Another termite species , Amitermes meridionalis , can build nests 3 to 4 metres ( 9 to 13 feet ) high and 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 feet ) wide . 
 The sculptured mounds sometimes have elaborate and distinctive forms , such as those of the compass termite ( Amitermes meridionalis and A. <unk> ) , which builds tall , wedge @-@ shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north – south , which gives them their common name . This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation . The north @-@ south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun . The temperature then remains at a plateau for the rest of the day until the evening . 
 = = = Arboreal nests = = = 
 Arboreal carton nests of mangrove swamp @-@ dwelling Nasutitermes are enriched in lignin and depleted in cellulose and <unk> . This change is caused by bacterial decay in the gut of the termites : they use their faeces as a carton building material . Arboreal termites nests can account for as much as 2 % of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps . These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially <unk> wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees , namely , Rhizophora mangle ( red mangrove ) , Avicennia germinans ( black mangrove ) and Laguncularia racemose ( white mangrove ) .

 Termites construct shelter tubes , also known as earthen tubes or mud tubes , that start from the ground . These shelter tubes can be found on walls and other structures . Constructed by termites during the night , a time of higher humidity , these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators , especially ants . Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way . These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour . The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available . They range from less than 1 cm to several cm in width , but may extend dozens of metres in length .

 Owing to their wood @-@ eating habits , many termite species can do great damage to unprotected buildings and other wooden structures . Their habit of remaining concealed often results in their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged , leaving a thin layer of a wall that protects them from the environment . Of the 3 @,@ 106 species known , only 183 species cause damage ; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures . In North America , nine subterranean species are pests ; in Australia , 16 species have an economic impact ; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests , and in tropical Africa , 24 . In Central America and the West Indies , there are 17 pest species . Among the termite genera , <unk> has the highest number of pest species of any genus , with 28 species known to cause damage . Less than 10 % of drywood termites are pests , but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical , subtropical and other regions . <unk> termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil . 
 Drywood termites thrive in warm climates , and human activities can enable them to invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods , containers and ships . Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions . Some termites are considered invasive species . Cryptotermes brevis , the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world , has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia . 
 In addition to causing damage to buildings , termites can also damage food crops . Termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast @-@ growing plants . Most attacks occur at harvest time ; crops and trees are attacked during the dry season . 
 The damage caused by termites costs the southwestern United States approximately $ 1 @.@ 5 billion each year in wood structure damage , but the true cost of damage worldwide cannot be determined . Drywood termites are responsible for a large proportion of the damage caused by termites . 
 To better control the population of termites , various methods have been developed to track termite movements . One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens . Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit @-@ IgG markers using a rabbit @-@ IgG @-@ specific assay . More recently developed , less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white , cow milk , or soy milk proteins , which can be sprayed on termites in the field . Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein @-@ specific ELISA test . 
 = = = As food = = = 
 43 termite species are used as food by humans or are fed to livestock . These insects are particularly important in less developed countries where malnutrition is common , as the protein from termites can help improve the human diet . Termites are consumed in many regions globally , but this practice has only become popular in developed nations in recent years . 
 Termites are consumed by people in many different cultures around the world . In Africa , the alates are an important factor in the diets of native populations . Tribes have different ways of collecting or cultivating insects ; sometimes tribes will collect soldiers from several species . Though harder to acquire , queens are regarded as a delicacy . Termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein . They are regarded as pleasant in taste , having a nut @-@ like flavour after they are cooked . 
 <unk> are collected when the rainy season begins . During a nuptial flight , they are typically seen around lights to which they are attracted , and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected . The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing . The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp . Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil . Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food , or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited . 
 In addition to Africa , termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America . In Australia , Indigenous Australians are aware that termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity ; there are few explanations as to why . Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption ( geophagy ) in many countries including Kenya , Tanzania , Zambia , Zimbabwe and South Africa . Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture , as they are high in protein and can be used to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans . 
 = = = In agriculture = = = 
 Termites can be major agricultural pests , particularly in East Africa and North Asia , where crop losses can be severe ( 3 – 100 % in crop loss in Africa ) . <unk> this is the greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply , which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation . In South America , cultivated plants such as eucalyptus , upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations , with attacks on leaves , roots and woody tissue . Termites can also attack other plants , including cassava , coffee , cotton , fruit trees , maize , peanuts , soybeans and vegetables . Mounds can disrupt farming activities , making it difficult for farmers to operate farming machinery ; however , despite farmers ' dislike of the mounds , it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs . Termites can be beneficial to agriculture , such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil . Termites and ants can re @-@ colonise <unk> land that contains crop stubble , which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests . The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil , both essential for the growth of crops .

 The termite gut has inspired various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner , renewable energy sources . Termites are efficient bioreactors , capable of producing two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper . Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut , releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest . Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut , <unk> polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen . The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate , an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy . Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide a better understanding of the metabolic pathway . Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass . 
 The development of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has been inspired by the complex mounds that termites build . These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid , capable of climbing and lifting up bricks . Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars , or for building levees to prevent flooding . 
 Termites use sophisticated means to control the temperatures of their mounds . As discussed above , the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day . As the towers heat up , the solar chimney effect ( stack effect ) creates an updraft of air within the mound . Wind blowing across the tops of the towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds , which also include side vents in their construction . The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling , as well as in Europe by the Romans . It is only relatively recently , however , that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture . Especially in Africa , the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 The Eastgate Centre is a shopping centre and office block in central Harare , Zimbabwe , whose architect , Mick Pearce , used passive cooling inspired by that used by the local termites . It was the first major building exploiting termite @-@ inspired cooling techniques to attract international attention . Other such buildings include the Learning Resource Center at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and the Council House 2 building in Melbourne , Australia . 
 Few zoos hold termites , due to the difficulty in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests . One of the few that do , the Zoo Basel in Switzerland , has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations – resulting in an event very rare in captivity : the mass migrations of young flying termites . This happened in September 2008 , when thousands of male termites left their mound each night , died , and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit . 
 African tribes in several countries have termites as totems , and for this reason tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates . Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine ; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma , bronchitis , hoarseness , influenza , sinusitis , tonsillitis and whooping cough . In Nigeria , Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women . In Southeast Asia , termites are used in ritual practices . In Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand , termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace . Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits , believing a local guardian dwells within the mound ; this is known as <unk> and <unk> Kong . In urban areas , local residents construct red @-@ painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned , where they pray for good health , protection and luck .

 SMS Siegfried was the lead ship of the six @-@ member Siegfried class of coastal defense ships ( Küstenpanzerschiffe ) built for the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Beowulf , Frithjof , Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Hagen . Siegfried was built by the Germaniawerft shipyard between 1888 and 1890 , and was armed with a main battery of three 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1903 - 1904 . She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , but saw no action . Siegfried was demobilized in 1915 and used as a barracks ship thereafter . She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1920 .

 Siegfried was 79 meters ( 259 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 @.@ 90 m ( 48 @.@ 9 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 741 long tons ( 3 @,@ 801 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 14 @.@ 9 knots ( 27 @.@ 6 km / h ; 17 @.@ 1 mph ) and a range of approximately 1 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 760 km ; 1 @,@ 710 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Siegfried had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L / 35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets . Two were placed side by side forward , and the third was located aft of the main superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition . The ship was also equipped with six 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns in single mounts . Siegfried also carried four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all in swivel mounts on the deck . One was at the bow , another at the stern , and two amidships . The ship was protected by an armored belt that was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) amidships , and an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick .

 Siegfried was laid down in 1888 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel . She was launched on 10 August 1889 , and completed on 19 April 1890 . She was commissioned into the fleet on 29 April , and joined the I Division of the German fleet , along with the older ironclads Baden , Bayern , and Oldenburg , under Vizeadmiral Karl Deinhard . The I Division participated in several fleet maneuvers in 1891 , where they typically served as the German side in the war games . Siegfried did not participate in the 1892 maneuvers , having been replaced in the I Division by her recently @-@ commissioned sister ship Beowulf . 
 Over the winter of 1892 - 1893 , Siegfried and Beowulf joined the elderly ironclads König Wilhelm and Deutschland for a winter training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea . Siegfried again sat out the 1893 fleet maneuvers , instead of her sister Frithjof , which had just joined the fleet . In the 1897 maneuvers , Siegfried and all five of her sister ships formed the III Division . In 1898 , Siegfried again participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the III Division , along with Beowulf and Hildebrand . Her other three sisters were assigned to the IV Division . During the 1900 summer maneuvers , Siegfried served in the simulated hostile squadron , alongside Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Ägir . 
 Siegfried served on active duty until 1903 , when she was withdrawn from service . Starting in 1903 , she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction . The ship was lengthened to 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 @.@ 6 ft ) , which increased displacement to 4 @,@ 237 t ( 4 @,@ 170 long tons ; 4 @,@ 670 short tons ) . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers , and a second funnel was added . Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) tubes . Work was completed by 1904 . 
 She was brought back on active duty at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , and mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense , along with her sister ships . On 31 August 1915 , the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized , and Siegfried 's crew was transferred to other warships . She was then used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven , a role she filled until the end of the war . On 17 June 1919 , she was stricken from the naval register . The navy planned to convert her into a salvage ship , but the plan was abandoned and she was instead sold for 425 @,@ 000 marks to H. Peters in <unk> .

 = Coat of arms of Albany , New York = 
 The coat of arms of Albany , New York , is the heraldic symbol representing the city of Albany , the capital of the U.S. state of New York . The coat of arms is rarely seen by itself ; it is almost always used in the city seal or on the city flag . The current coat of arms was adopted in 1789 , although prior to that it was significantly simpler , ranging from stylized lettering to a caricature of a beaver . Included in the coat of arms are references to Albany 's agricultural and fur @-@ trading past . It is supported by a white man and an American Indian and is crested by a sloop . The coat of arms is meant to represent the " symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea " . 
 = = History = = 
 Albany began as the Dutch fur @-@ trading post Fort Orange in 1624 . Around the fort grew the village of Beverwijck ( English : Beaver District ) , which was incorporated in 1652 . In 1664 , the English sacked New Netherland and Beverwyck was renamed Albany in honor of the Duke of York and Duke of Albany ( later James II of England ) . 
 When the city was incorporated by provincial governor Thomas Dongan in 1686 under the Dongan Charter , it was empowered to have its own seal : 
 The said Mayor , Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Albany , and their successor shall and may forever hereafter , have one common seal to serve for the sealing of all and singular their affairs and business touching or concerning the said corporation . And it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Mayor , Aldermen and Commonalty of the said city of Albany , and their successors , as they shall see cause , to break , change , alter and new make their said common seal , and as often as to them shall seem convenient . 
 The first known use of the seal was on a deed from the city of Albany sold at auction . Signed by Albany 's first mayor , Pieter Schuyler , the document was sealed with red wax , the design on which was an octagon with a monogram of the letters ALB in the center topped with a crown ( see Figure 1 ) . This document was found in 1886 . This seal was again seen on a document from 1736 , though that too was not found until 1886 . The letters are presumed to be an abbreviation of the name of the city . However the meaning of the crown is unknown ; it was noted for being " hardly a kingly crown , nor in shape like a coronet , the head attire of nobility " . 
 Prior to 1752 ( but after 1736 ) , the seal had a beaver at center , with the letters " ALB " above it . This seal was replaced in 1752 with the abbreviation removed and replaced with " Albany " above the beaver and the year below as such : 
 Resolved and ordered by this Board — That the old seal of this corporation , now in the hands of the Mayor , be changed and altered , and that there be a new seal in its place , which new seal , being now produced to this board and approved of by them , the same is ordered to be lodged in the hands of our present clerk in his office for the use and behoof of this corporation , and that the present now new seal be henceforth our seal and called , deemed and esteemed the common seal of this corporation until it be altered and changed and the aforesaid former seal be null and void and dead in law to all intents and purposes whatsoever . 
 The seal from 1752 is shown in Figure 2 . The beaver honored Albany 's past as an important fur trading port . Adding to the history of this seal , one historian states , " [ The seal ] displays the beaver , but looking in the original , more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal , it was intended to represent . Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made . " In 1755 the original seal ( Figure 1 ) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses . So at this point the city had two seals , one corporate and one public . The earlier seal , however , was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on . 
 The current seal was adopted in 1789 and first shows up in 1790 , when Simeon De Witt , Albany 's city surveyor , included the arms on his map of the city . An updated map from 1794 also includes the arms . Both versions include a full landscape in the upper portion of the shield including multiple beavers and trees , as opposed to just one beaver and tree in the current version . There is no documented reasoning for changing the seal from the beaver to the coat of arms , and the coat of arms itself " seems to [ have ] no record authority " making it in any way official . 
 = = Description = = 
 The current coat of arms consists of numerous traditional heraldic attributes . The shield is party per fess argent and gules ; that is , split horizontally in two with a red lower half and silver upper half . Its lower half contains two golden sheaves of wheat on a red background ; this design represents Albany 's agricultural past . The upper half , which has a silver background , depicts a beaver gnawing at the stump of a fallen tree . This scene represents Beverwyck 's former fur trade , which was vital to the development of Albany . One supporter can be seen on each side of the shield . The man on the left is a European @-@ descended farmer dressed in simple clothes ; he is supporting the shield with his left hand . His right hand rests on his hip and a sickle hangs from his waist ; this references Albany 's former agricultural society . The man on the right is an American Indian dressed in a loin cloth and wearing moccasins and a quiver . He supports the shield with his right hand and holds a bow over his left shoulder . The two men supporting the shield together represent the cooperation between white immigrants and Indians in the early development of the city , which would not have existed without the Indian fur trade . The men stand on a scroll displaying the motto <unk> , meaning " the quality of acting with constant and careful attention " . The torse is argent and gules , following the pattern of the shield . The crest is a sloop under full sail facing left , " denoting Albany 's supremacy at the head of the sloop navigation of the Hudson River " . The coat of arms represents the " symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea " . At the time of Albany 's bicentennial ( 1886 ) , it was believed that only New York City and Albany possessed arms charged on a shield upheld by supporters . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Albany 's coat of arms is best known for its use on the city seal and flag . The seal incorporates the coat of arms in an outlined , white circle , with the letters , " The Seal of the City of Albany " above it . The flag is a horizontal tricolor of orange , white , and blue , and was adopted in 1909 as part of the tricentennial celebration of Henry Hudson 's discovery of the Hudson River . It was based on the Prince 's Flag as flown by the Dutch East India Company ( EIC ) , for which Hudson sailed in 1609 . Its flag was also a tricolor and included the company 's logo where the Albany coat of arms is located today . 
 Like Albany 's flag , the Prince 's Flag was an orange , white , and blue tricolor . The orange was derived from the coat of arms of the Prince of Orange , William the Silent . After 1660 , the orange stripe had been replaced by a red one , as the Dutch flag still remains , though no particular reason is cited . Albany chose to use the historic flag as its base . The flag was surrounded by controversy in 1916 , when Albany 's Common Council voted to change the colors to red , white , and blue as a show of patriotism during World War I. The change was vetoed by Mayor Joseph Stevens . 
 A life @-@ size sculpture of the coat of arms was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986 . Rosen took some liberty with the design , such as adding farm tools to emphasize the city 's agricultural and trading history , as well as adding previously undocumented detail ; the left supporter also takes on more of the look of an explorer ( e.g. , Henry Hudson ) than a farmer . The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan as part of the park across Broadway from the then @-@ newly renovated Union Station , which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees out of the building in 2010 . The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway . 
 = Our World ( TV series ) = 
 Our World is an American television news series that ran for 26 episodes , from September 25 , 1986 to May 28 , 1987 . The show was anchored by Linda Ellerbee and Ray Gandolf . Each episode of the series examined , through the use of archival film and television footage , one short period in American history . Our World aired on ABC . 
 Our World grew out of an earlier ABC News special called 45 / 85 , whose producer , Avram Westin , would go on to produce Our World . Each episode was produced on a budget of $ 350 @,@ 000 , less than half of the budget of a typical hour of prime time programming at the time . 
 Our World premiered to indifferent critical response but as the series progressed critics became effusive with their praise . Despite being critically well received and profitable for the network , Our World performed poorly in the Nielsen ratings , as its first half @-@ hour was programmed against the extremely popular The Cosby Show . ABC canceled the show after one season . Ellerbee tried to move the series to PBS but was unsuccessful .

 Our World was created by ABC News president Roone Arledge . The show had its genesis in a 1985 ABC News special called 45 / 85 , a three @-@ hour documentary that reviewed post @-@ World War II history with an emphasis on the Cold War . That special was produced by Avram " Av " Westin , who also produced Our World . Anchors Ellerbee and Gandolf co @-@ wrote Our World , which combined archival footage with new interviews with people who participated in or witnessed the events . Initial plans were that each episode would cover one year , but that idea was quickly scrapped ; Ellerbee said , " It 's hard enough to do a month , or even days . " 
 ABC hired Ellerbee away from NBC to co @-@ anchor the show . The network considered Sander <unk> , Dick Schaap and James Wooten as possible partners before selecting Gandolf , at the time the sports anchor for ABC 's World News Saturday and World News Sunday . 
 Set designers modeled the set for Our World after a corner news stand . For each episode , artifacts of the period being profiled , including magazines and political posters , decorated the set and a movie marquee listed the title of a film that was in theatres of the time . In the foreground was placed an Our World newspaper the headlines of which were the program 's title and the name of that program 's producer . 
 Each episode cost $ 350 @,@ 000 to produce as compared to the then @-@ typical $ 800 @,@ 000 cost of an hour of prime time network programming . The low budget combined with a dozen commercial spots sold at $ 35 @,@ 000 each meant that Our World generated an estimated $ 4 million in profit for ABC during its original run and summer repeats . 
 Our World producers selected each episode 's subject time period with the help of consultants from the Smithsonian Institution and Columbia University . The show was limited in its choices by the available footage for the given time period . Ellerbee recalled a viewer @-@ submitted proposal for an episode on the American Civil War , which could not be made because of the non @-@ existence of archive footage from the 1860s and the lack of any living eyewitnesses .

 Critical response to Our World was overall very favorable . Reviews of the premiere episode , however , were somewhat tepid , with The New York Times saying " There are worse ways to spend an hour " and calling the show " a pleasant hour " , while pointing to segments such as an interview with " a man , who , 17 years ago , slept in the house next door to a house struck by the Manson gang " , as " not terribly interesting . " The Los Angeles Times was harsher , calling the debut " rather bland " . While praising anchors Ellerbee and Gandolf , calling them " refreshing [ and ] off @-@ center , running against the TV mainstream , making words , not <unk> " , the Times ultimately felt that " Our World offers no sense of who we really were in 1969 because , typical of TV , it renders everything equal . " 
 With subsequent episodes , reviews improved . The Boston Globe , comparing its debut episode ( " a <unk> nostalgia trip that presented history the way MTV presents rock , in digestible , unrelated , bland bite @-@ sized bits " ) to an episode airing less than five months later , found it " light years ahead in terms of wit , style and historical perspective . It is still easily digestible , but there 's nothing bland about it . " The St. Petersburg Times said of the show , " It educated , but it was not school . It entertained , but it was not mindless . It was quality - television 's noblest service . " The San Diego Union concurred , citing Our World as " the most refreshing , fascinating and innovative history series ever on TV " . 
 Popular response was much less effusive . The show averaged 9 million viewers per episode , as compared to The Cosby Show , which garnered an average 63 million viewers per week . Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986 @-@ 7 television season , bringing in only a 6 @.@ 5 / 10 rating / share . One segment of the public who responded very favorably to the program was teachers , who assigned Our World as homework . ABC created a study guide for the show , mailing out some 39 @,@ 000 copies a month to educators and fans . 
 Gandolf , Ellerbee and Richard <unk> won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in News and Documentary Programming ( writing ) for the episode " Halloween 1938 " .

 ABC canceled Our World after its first season , replacing it with the situation comedies Sledge Hammer ! and The <unk> . Ellerbee and Gandolf learned that the show had been canceled from a segment on Entertainment Tonight . Ellerbee sharply criticized ABC for the cancellation , saying " If they had left it there for three to four years , it could have done what 60 Minutes did , which went against the Disney juggernaut on NBC . It could have developed slowly as an alternative program without being in the ratings race . " The advocacy group Viewers for Quality Television mounted a letter @-@ writing campaign to save the show – similar to campaigns that had saved Designing Women and Cagney and Lacey – and generated some 20 @,@ 000 letters of support , but the campaign was unsuccessful . 
 PBS expressed interest in obtaining the show . Although ABC asserted rights to the name " Our World , " Ellerbee said " We never liked that title to begin with " and stated that the name " Your World " was under consideration . Ellerbee planned to co @-@ produce the show through her production company , Lucky Duck Productions , in partnership with WNET . Ultimately , Ellerbee was unable to secure the estimated $ 5 million needed to produce the first season of 13 episodes and Our World did not make the transition to PBS . 
 In 1988 , CBS tried to revive the format of Our World with a television pilot called Try to Remember . Anchored by veteran newscaster Charles Kuralt , Try to Remember covered August 11 – 17 , 1969 , echoing Our World 's pilot coverage of the summer of 1969 . The show aired on Thursday , June 23 . Try to Remember did not get picked up as a regular series . 
 = 1997 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season was a below average season and is the most recent season to feature no tropical cyclones in August – typically one of the most active months . The season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The 1997 season was inactive , with only seven named storms forming , with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm . It was the first time since the 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the entire month of August . A strong El Niño is credited with reducing the number of storms in the Atlantic , while increasing the number of storms in the Eastern and Western Pacific basin to 19 and 29 storms , respectively . As is common in El Niño years , tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in the tropical latitudes , with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25 ° N. 
 The first system , an operationally unnoticed subtropical storm , developed north of The Bahamas on June 1 and dissipated by the following day without impact . Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June 30 and dissipated on July 4 , after causing minor affects in North Carolina . Hurricane Bill was a short @-@ lived storm between that lasted from July 11 to July 13 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland . As Bill as dissipating , Tropical Storm Claudette developed and caused rough seas in North Carolina . The most devastating storm was Hurricane Danny , which caused extensive flooding , particularly in southern Alabama . Danny resulted in 9 fatalities and about $ 100 million ( 1997 USD ) in damage . The outerbands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles , causing 2 deaths in $ 10 million in losses . The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused minor flooding in Puerto Rico . Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storms Fabian did not impact land . Collectively , the storms of the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12 fatalities and approximately $ 111 @.@ 46 million in damage .

 Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University ( CSU ) . A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , has eleven named storms , of which six reach hurricane strength , and two major hurricanes . The May 1997 forecast stated that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status . In addition , it was predicted that three of the seven hurricanes would intensify into a major hurricane – a Category 3 rating on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 = = = Season activity = = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , and an unnamed subtropical storm developed on the same day . 1997 was the least active hurricane season in above average era of tropical cyclogenesis , which began in 1995 . Only nine tropical depressions formed . Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status , and just three of these attained hurricane status . There was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status , which was slightly below the 1950 – 2005 average of two per season . Only Danny made landfall at hurricane strength during the season , although Hurricane Erika and Tropical Storm Grace also caused damage and fatalities . Those three cyclones collectively caused 11 deaths and $ 111 @.@ 46 million in damage . The last storm of the season , Tropical Storm Grace , dissipated on October 17 , over a month before the official end of the season on November 30 . 
 The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season had a very active beginning . In June , two tropical cyclones developed – the unnoticed subtropical storm and Tropical Storm Ana . An unusual four tropical cyclones formed in the month of July , three of which reached tropical storm intensity , and two of them became hurricanes . Despite the active start , the other months of the season featured record low activity , especially in August and September , both of which combined produced only one tropical cyclone . As a result of the active start and subsequent lack of activity , it showed that early season activity has no correlation to the entire season . The lone tropical cyclone during the period was Hurricane Erika , which developed on September 3 . In October , two short @-@ lived tropical cyclones developed , Fabian and Grace . Tropical cyclogenesis ceased after Grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 17 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 41 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Although officially , subtropical cyclones , such as the unnamed storm , are excluded from the total , the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Unnamed Subtropical Storm = = = 
 A cluster of thunderstorms developed over Florida in late May . A shortwave trough brought it to the northeast , enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation . The low pressure area , which formed on May 31 , developed into a subtropical depression on June 1 . Operationally , it was treated as a frontal low , but post @-@ analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime , and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm . It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States . The convection continued to wrap around the center , and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify . Late on June 1 , it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) while off the coast of North Carolina . The storm turned to the east , and transitioned extratropical late on June 2 southeast of Massachusetts . Shortly thereafter , the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Ana = = = 
 A frontal low pressure system off the coast of South Carolina developed into Tropical Depression One at 1200 UTC on June 30 . It moved slowly eastward , and attained tropical storm status on July 1 . After becoming a tropical storm , Ana slightly intensified . Early on July 2 , Ana attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 1 @,@ 000 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . Later on July 2 , a shortwave trough forced Ana to northeastward , into a region of increasing vertical wind shear . Simultaneously , Ana began to weaken , as it was moving into an area of decreasing sea surface temperatures ( SST ) . 
 By late on July 3 , Ana weakened to a tropical depression . The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July 4 , over the western Atlantic Ocean . The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty @-@ four hours later . Minimal impact was reported as a result of Ana , other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina . Due to the rough seas , 14 rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach . In addition , five rescues were made at Kure Beach and at least one person was hospitalized . However , there were no fatalities at either location . 
 = = = Hurricane Bill = = = 
 A large upper @-@ level low separated from a trough north of Puerto Rico in early July . Convection increased on July 7 after a surface trough developed , and a low pressure area formed east of the Bahamas once the upper @-@ level low retreated to the southwest . Wind shear decreased across the region , allowing the convection to increase and organize , and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on July 11 about 330 miles ( 530 km ) southwest of Bermuda . After developing , the cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front . It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill , and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda . As a result , a tropical storm warning was issued , although it was quickly dropped ; there was no impact on the island from Bill . 
 Bill quickly intensified as it continued northeastward . By midday on July 12 , an eye feature was observed on satellite images , which suggested that Bill intensified into hurricane status at a relatively high latitude . Bill had in fact intensified into a hurricane , and the storm had attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) minimum pressure of 986 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . After only 12 hours at hurricane status , Bill weakened back to tropical storm status , and on July 13 was absorbed by the cold front about 185 miles ( 298 km ) south of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Bill dropped very light rainfall on Newfoundland , peaking at slightly less than 1 inch ( 25 mm ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Claudette = = = 
 The frontal system that influenced the track of Hurricane Bill spawned a non @-@ tropical low off the southeast United States on July 11 . The low remained nearly stationary as the front dissipated , and it developed into Tropical Depression Three on July 13 about 325 miles ( 523 km ) south @-@ southeast of Wilmington , North Carolina . The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Claudette , based on reconnaissance aircraft data . It moved northeastward , passing southeast of the Outer Banks . Despite the presence of wind shear it developed banding features . On July 14 , the storm reached peak winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . Thereafter , Claudette turned eastward ahead of a frontal system . 
 Its associated thunderstorm activity was sporadic and relatively disorganized , and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on July 16 . Claudette briefly re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm before becoming extratropical later that day . Shortly thereafter , it merged with a cold front , while the remnants were last noted near the Azores on July 23 . Tropical Storm Claudette had minimal effects on land . Severe rip currents from Claudette in North Carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured , although no fatalities occurred . Some residents of coastal North Carolina were even disappointed that Claudette was to remain offshore , as the region was suffering from dry conditions . 
 = = = Hurricane Danny = = = 
 A tropical low over the northern Gulf of Mexico developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 . The depression headed slowly east @-@ northeastward , and intensified into Tropical Storm Danny on the following day . Danny continued east @-@ northeastward , and reached hurricane strength just before landfall near Buras , Louisiana . Because of the narrowness of that piece of land , most of Danny remained over water and it lost little strength . Danny re @-@ emerged into the Gulf of Mexico , and strengthened slightly making two landfalls in Alabama as a low @-@ end Category 1 hurricane on July 19 . After remaining stationary for a day , Danny moved northward and weakened to a tropical depression . Heading northward across Alabama , Danny turned to the east and crossed over the Southeastern United States . While centered over North Carolina , Danny interacted with a developing trough , which caused it to re @-@ intensify into a tropical storm . Shortly thereafter , Danny emerged over the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina / Virginia border on July 24 . Danny took a northward turn , and came within 30 mi ( 48 km ) of Nantucket Island on July 26 . It then turned out to sea and was absorbed by a front on July 27 . 
 Although Danny was a hurricane upon landfall , strong winds were confined to a small area , with only portions of extreme eastern Louisiana reporting hurricane @-@ force winds . Danny also dropped torrential amounts of rain in Louisiana , peaking at 11 @.@ 40 in ( 290 mm ) in Buras @-@ Triumph . Flooding occurred in portions of the state due to heavy rainfall . The floods and high winds produced by Danny damaged over 300 houses and more than 170 businesses in Louisiana alone . In Mississippi , Danny dropped heavy rainfall on the southern portion of the state , resulting in minor street and house flooding . As Danny crossed Dauphin Island , Alabama on July 19 , it dropped 37 @.@ 75 inches ( 959 mm ) of rain . This made Danny the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Alabama . Hurricane force @-@ winds were reported on Dauphin Island and the western shores of Mobile Bay . In the same area , many buildings had sustained roof damage . In addition , many homes on the Fowl and Fish Rivers reported significant damage . Further north in South Carolina and Virginia , Danny spawned several tornadoes ; some of them caused significant damage . Heavy rainfall also occurred in some isolated areas ; in central North Carolina between 8 – 12 inches ( 200 – 300 mm ) of rain was reported . Danny eventually affected Massachusetts , bring light rainfall and tropical storm @-@ force winds to the southeastern portions of the state . Overall , Danny caused nine fatalities , and approximately $ 100 million in damage . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Five = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 11 . The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic , and finally began to show consistent evidence of a cloud system center . Deep convection associated with the wave became concentrated on satellite images on July 17 , and it is estimated that the disturbance became Tropical Depression Five around 0600 UTC on that day while centered about 547 miles ( 880 km ) east of Barbados . The tropical depression moved west @-@ northwestward and started showing signs of falling apart on July 18 . Early on the following day , the depression degenerated into a tropical wave . Recon observations before the storm fell apart suggested that it may have briefly reached tropical storm strength . The tropical wave continued westward without regenerating and lost its identity on July 23 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = = Hurricane Erika = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six while it was centered about 1 @,@ 150 miles ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles on September 3 . Later that day , the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Erika . It moved west @-@ northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on September 4 . Erika passed a short distance to the north of the Lesser Antilles , and later turned to the north in response to an approaching trough . The hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125 mph ( 195 km / h ) on September 8 , and after maintaining peak strength for 24 hours Erika weakened over cooler waters . It turned to the east , weakened to a tropical storm , and became extratropical after passing near the Azores on September 15 . 
 The hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout the northern Lesser Antilles . The passage of Erika brought a cloud of ash to Antigua from the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat , a rare occurrence . Strong waves from the hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern Puerto Rico , and also killed two surfers . Moderate wind gusts in Puerto Rico left thousands without power , and the hurricane resulted in $ 10 million in damage to the Caribbean territory of the United States . Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in the Azores . Later in its duration , the storm brought hurricane @-@ force wind gusts and rainfall to the Azores , though no damage was reported . Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in the months of August and September , the first such occurrence in a hurricane season since 1929 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Fabian = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa near Dakar , Senegal on September 22 . The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later . While passing through the islands , heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported . Eventually , the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low @-@ level circulation . However , upper @-@ level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization . After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands , wind shear decreased , since the low was moving in the same direction as the upper @-@ level winds . 
 At 1800 UTC October 4 , it is estimated that system developed into Tropical Depression Seven , while 410 miles ( 660 km ) north of Puerto Rico . However , the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until 1500 UTC on October 7 . The depression strengthened and about 24 hours after forming , it became Tropical Storm Fabian later on October 5 . No further significant change in intensity occurred for the remainder of its duration , as Fabian had peaked with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . The storm began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1200 UTC on October 8 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Grace = = = 
 An extratropical low formed just north of Hispaniola on October 14 , and on the following day , it attained gale force winds . In addition , the system was also acquiring tropical characteristics , and was classified as Tropical Storm Grace on October 16 at 0000 UTC . Strong vertical wind shear prevented further intensification , and Grace immediately peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Though Grace was classified as a tropical cyclone , it still held onto some extratropical characteristics . Thereafter , Grace steadily weakened and eventually degenerated into an extratropical low on October 17 . 
 The precursor disturbance of Grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico , peaking at 12 @.@ 69 inches ( 322 mm ) in Aibonito . As a result , flash flooding occurred throughout the island of Puerto Rico , while landslides caused damage to roads and bridges . In addition , numerous rivers overflowed their banks , which forced 37 people to seek shelter across the island . One fatality occurred , and damage amounted to $ 1 @.@ 46 million . In addition , the extratropical system produced light to moderate rainfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands , and precipitation reached 7 inches ( 180 mm ) along western sides of the islands .

 = Jean @-@ Joseph Rabearivelo = 
 Jean @-@ Joseph Rabearivelo ( 4 March 1901 or 1903 – 22 June 1937 ) , born Joseph @-@ Casimir Rabearivelo , is widely considered to be Africa 's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of Madagascar . Part of the first generation raised under French colonization , Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education . His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects , including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions . He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews , soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals . He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy , as well as literary critiques , an opera , and two novels . 
 Rabearivelo 's early period of modernist @-@ inspired poetry showed skill and attracted critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions . The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality , garnering him strong praise and acclaim . Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews , Rabearivelo was never afforded access to the elite social circles of colonial Madagascar . He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments , including the death of his daughter , the French authorities ' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris , and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction . Following Rabearivelo 's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937 , he became viewed as a colonial martyr . 
 The death of Rabearivelo occurred just prior to the emergence of the Négritude movement , by which time the Malagasy poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as Léopold Sédar Senghor as Africa 's first modern poet . The Government of Madagascar declared Rabearivelo its national poet upon independence in 1960 . The legacy and influence of his works continue to be felt and his works are a focus of ongoing academic study . Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including Elie Rajaonarison have cited him as a major inspiration . A street and a high school in Antananarivo have been named after him , as well as a dedicated room in the National Library of Madagascar . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Jean @-@ Joseph Rabearivelo , born Joseph @-@ Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in Ambatofotsy ( north of Antananarivo ) , Madagascar , was the only child of an unwed mother descended from the <unk> ( " sons of Ralambo " ) caste of the Merina andriana ( nobles ) . When the French colonized Madagascar in 1897 , Merina nobles including Rabearivelo 's mother lost the privileges , prestige , and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy , the Kingdom of Imerina . Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born , situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the colonial system . He first studied at the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo , then transferred to the prestigious Collège Saint @-@ Michel , where he was expelled for lack of discipline , poor academic performance , and his reluctance to become religiously observant . He ended his studies at École Flacourt in 1915 . He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review <unk> <unk> under the pen name K. Verbal . 
 After leaving school , he worked a variety of low @-@ skilled jobs , including as a lace designer , an errand boy , and a secretary and interpreter to a district administrator . During this period he developed a passion for French 19th and 20th century literature and refined his fluency in the French language ; he also began teaching himself English , Spanish , and Hebrew . He changed his name to Jean @-@ Joseph Rabearivelo to have the same initials as Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , while continuing to occasionally use pseudonyms , including " <unk> <unk> " and " Jean <unk> " . He was particularly attracted to poets and writers who were outcasts in their own society , including Baudelaire and Rimbaud . 
 = = = Early period = = = 
 In 1920 , Rabearivelo was hired as an assistant librarian at the Cercle de l 'Union social club . That same year he drafted his first book , a short novel written in the Malagasy language . He began to correspond with a wide range of writers around the world , including André Gide , Paul Valéry , Jean <unk> , Paul Claudel , and Valery <unk> , and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar . By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island . In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l 'Imerina , a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life . In 1921 he befriended high @-@ level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature , including Robert <unk> , the colony 's financial manager , and Pierre <unk> , Madagascar 's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18 ° Latitude Sud . 
 He published his first collection of poems , La coupe de cendres ( " The Cup of Ashes " ) in 1924 ; the same year he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines , including 18 ° Latitude Sud in Antananarivo and La Vie in Paris . This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society , where he established himself as Madagascar 's leader not only in poetry and prose , but as an esteemed journalist , art critic , translator , and writer of essays and plays . 
 In 1925 he published a historical novel called L 'Aube Rouge ( " The Red Dawn " ) about the last years of the Kingdom of Imerina . In it he honored <unk> , the governor of Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the Menalamba rebellion . Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies , Sylves ( " Woodlands " ) and Volumes , in 1927 and 1928 respectively . He also published his second historical novel in 1928 , L <unk> ( " Interference " ) , which depicts the life of a noble family from the last years of the monarchy until colonization . Throughout the 1920s , he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy , including Baudelaire , Rimbaud , <unk> , Rilke , Whitman , and Góngora ; he also translated traditional Malagasy kabary ( oratory ) into French for publication in French @-@ language literary reviews . 
 In 1926 , Rabearivelo married Mary <unk> , the daughter of a local photographer , and together they had five children . He was also a womanizer and abused alcohol and opium , growing increasingly dependent on the substances after the death of his daughter . Rabearivelo constantly struggled with debt , and despite his growing fame and artistic success , he was unable to escape from poverty . 
 = = = Late period = = = 
 Throughout the 1930s , Rabearivelo joined with other Malagasy poets and writers in an emerging literary movement termed " <unk> ny Very " ( " The Search for Lost Values " ) , which sought to promote the traditional literary and oral arts of Madagascar . Together with fellow artists Charles <unk> and Ny Avana <unk> , in August 1931 he founded a literary journal called Ny <unk> @-@ <unk> ( " New Progress " ) to promote Malagasy @-@ language poetry . He published two more anthologies of thirty poems each : Presque @-@ Songes ( " Dream Images " ) ( 1931 ) and Traduit de la nuit ( " Translated from the Night " ) ( 1932 ) . As an experiment , he wrote Malagasy and French versions of each poem in these two books ; the French versions were published in 1934 and 1935 respectively . For the remainder of his life he focused primarily on the translation of <unk> ( traditional Malagasy poetry ) into French , work which was published posthumously . He also wrote Madagascar 's first and only opera , Imaitsoanala ( 1935 ) , named for the legendary heroine mother of King Ralambo ; it was set to music composed by <unk> Ratianarivo and was performed by Ratianarivo 's Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo . 
 In 1933 , his three @-@ year @-@ old daughter Voahangy became ill and died . Rabearivelo was deeply affected by this loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered . His last daughter , who was born in 1936 , he named <unk> ( " Voahangy Alive " ) . The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal . 
 The colonial high society of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo 's work as evidence of the success of the French assimilation policy and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa . In his journals , the poet wrote that he felt " used " by the French authorities in Madagascar . Governor Montagné awarded him an affiliation ( <unk> <unk> ) with the Académie Malgache in 1932 . But in 1937 , Rabearivelo 's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo 's colonial high society was betrayed . He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes , a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low @-@ ranking employee of the colonial administration . He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris , but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island 's delegation . Consequently , Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation , a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals . He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society , who condemned his unconventional behavior and views , particularly in light of his role as husband and father . His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture . 
 Rabearivelo was deeply troubled by these disappointments and his worsening chronic financial troubles , in addition to the continuing grief he felt for the death of his daughter . On 19 June 1937 , a French friend informed him that his hope to eventually earn a higher official role within the administrative authority could never materialize as he was largely self @-@ taught and lacked the required diplomas . Having staked his future on a government career , Rabearivelo began to muse about his own death in his journal , writing " Perhaps one needs to die to be found sincere . " 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Rabearivelo committed suicide by cyanide poisoning on the afternoon of 22 June 1937 . He may have been seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time . The morning of his suicide , Rabearivelo completed several unfinished works ; he then took fourteen 250 @-@ milligram quinine capsules with water at 1 : 53 pm , followed at 2 : 37 pm by ten grams of potassium cyanide . Before dying he wrote a final poem and burned the first five volumes of his personal journal , the <unk> Bleus ( " Blue Notebooks " , 1924 – 1937 ) , leaving four volumes of approximately 1 @,@ 800 pages that document his life after 4 January 1933 . In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide , concluding with his final entry at 3 : 02 pm . At the time of his death , only half of his twenty literary works had been published ; the remainder were printed posthumously . 
 = = Style and influences = = 
 Rabearivelo 's first poetic work , La coupe de cendres ( 1924 ) , demonstrates the evident mastery of meter and rhythm in his earliest works , despite an absence of innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses . The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases , the first being highly influenced by the symbolist and romantic schools of poetry , and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression , and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a " mythic past " with an " alienating modernity " . 
 In the romantic period , typified by Sylves ( 1927 ) and Volumes ( 1928 ) , Rabearivelo 's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of traditional models . He identified himself and his work as post @-@ symbolist in the early part of his artistic career . Regarding Rabearivelo 's works from this period , editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet 's evident talent but critiqued his over @-@ adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self @-@ expression . 
 Beginning in 1931 , his works begin to change in tone and show the influences of surrealism and modernism . His poems become more daring , free , and complex , while also reflecting greater doubt . According to academic Arnaud Sabatier , this change reflects " the rediscovery and embrace of the sound and images of traditional Malagasy poetry , from which he had previously distanced himself or which he had subjected to the colonial language and culture . " These later works are described by academic Claire Riffard as " his strangest , evoking rural and commonplace images alongside unexpected dreamlike visions , superimposing the new and the forgotten ... " His break from convention in this period offered greater freedom to reconcile his conflicted identity , such as through his bilingual creations , Presque @-@ Songes ( 1931 ) and Traduit de la nuit ( 1932 ) . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Rabearivelo has long been considered the first modern poet of Africa . Academic Arnaud Sabatier identifies him as " one of the most important writers of the twentieth century " . He has also been described by Radio France Internationale journalist Tirthankar Chanda as " the founder of the African <unk> " and " the enfant terrible of French literature " . Rabearivelo is the most internationally famous and influential Malagasy literary figure . Jeune Afrique described him as " Madagascar 's greatest poet " , a sentiment echoed by Léopold Sédar Senghor , first president of Senegal and founder of the Négritude movement , who called him the " prince of the Malagasy poets " . He was described by academic Claire Riffard as " one of the principal founders of contemporary Malagasy literature " , and following national independence in 1960 , the government of Madagascar affirmed his cultural contributions by promoting him as the island 's national writer . 
 Rabearivelo struggled throughout his life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience . He has been depicted as a martyr figure as a result of his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France . He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences ; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death , his work was commemorated at events organized in North America , Europe and Africa , including a week @-@ long conference at the University of Antananarivo . Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo 's elevation as a colonial martyr , arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African . 
 The Lycée Jean @-@ Joseph Rabearivelo was inaugurated in central Antananarivo on 21 December 1946 in honor of the poet . A room has been dedicated to the poet in the National Library of Madagascar , located in the capital city . 
 He was included in the seminal volume of poetry of the Négritude movement , Léopold Senghor 's Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie <unk> et malgache ( " Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry " ) , published in 1948 . He has inspired many Malagasy writers and poets after him , including Elie Rajaonarison , an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry . 
 The Francophone University Agency and Madagascar 's National Center for Scientific Research collaborated to publish the entirety of Rabearivelo 's works in three volumes . The first volume , comprising his journal and some of his correspondence with key figures in literary and colonial circles , was printed in October 2010 . The second volume , a compilation of all his previously published works , was released in July 2012 . The remaining 1 @,@ 000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format . The first complete English translation of his masterpiece Translated from the Night was published by Lascaux Editions in 2007 .

 = Wales = 
 Wales ( / <unk> / ; Welsh : Cymru [ <unk> ] ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . Located on the island of Great Britain , it is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3 @,@ 063 @,@ 456 and has a total area of 20 @,@ 779 km2 ( 8 @,@ 023 sq mi ) . Wales has over 1 @,@ 680 miles ( 2 @,@ 700 km ) of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . 
 Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 – 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters . 
 At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two @-@ thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was £ 45 @.@ 5 billion ( £ 15 @,@ 145 per head , 74 @.@ 0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) . 
 Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560 @,@ 000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the " land of song " , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The English words " Wales " and " Welsh " derive from the same Germanic root ( singular <unk> , plural Walha ) , which was itself derived from the name of the Celtic tribe known to the Romans as <unk> and which came to refer indiscriminately to all Celts and , later , to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire . The Old English @-@ speaking Anglo @-@ Saxons came to use the term <unk> when referring to the Celtic Britons in particular , and <unk> when referring to their lands . The modern names for some Continental European lands ( e.g. Wallonia and Wallachia ) and peoples ( e.g. the Vlachs via a borrowing into Old Church Slavonic ) have a similar etymology . 
 Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo @-@ Saxons associated with the Britons , including other non @-@ Germanic territories in Britain ( e.g. Cornwall ) and Germanic territories particularly associated with Celtic Britons ( e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ) , as well as items associated with non @-@ Germanic Europeans , such as the walnut . 
 The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales . These words ( both of which are pronounced [ <unk> ] ) are descended from the Brythonic word <unk> , meaning " fellow @-@ countrymen " . The use of the word Cymry as a self @-@ designation derives from the post @-@ Roman Era relationship of the Welsh with the Brythonic @-@ speaking peoples of northern England and southern Scotland , the peoples of " Yr Hen Ogledd " ( English : The Old North ) . It emphasised a perception that the Welsh and the " Men of the North " were one people , different from other peoples . In particular , the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples , who are of similar heritage , culture , and language to both the Welsh and the Men of the North . The word came into use as a self @-@ description probably before the 7th century . It is attested in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan <unk> ) c . 633 . In Welsh literature , the word Cymry was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh , though the older , more generic term <unk> continued to be used to describe any of the <unk> peoples ( including the Welsh ) and was the more common literary term until c . 1100 . Thereafter Cymry prevailed as a reference to the Welsh . Until c . 1560 the word was spelt <unk> or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland . 
 The Latinised forms of these names , Cambrian , <unk> and Cambria , survive as lesser @-@ used alternative names for Wales , Welsh and the Welsh people . Examples include the Cambrian Mountains ( which cover much of Wales and gave their name to the Cambrian geological period ) , the newspaper Cambrian News , and the organisations Cambrian Airways , Cambrian Railways , Cambrian Archaeological Association and the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art . Outside Wales , a related form survives as the name Cumbria in North West England , which was once a part of Yr Hen Ogledd . The Cumbric language , which is thought to have been closely related to Welsh , was spoken in this area until becoming extinct around the 12th century . This form also appears at times in literary references , as in the pseudohistorical " Historia Regum Britanniae " of Geoffrey of Monmouth , where the character of Camber is described as the eponymous King of Cymru . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistoric origins = = = 
 Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29 @,@ 000 years . Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years before present ( BP ) , when Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain . At that time sea levels were much lower than today , and the shallower parts of what is now the North Sea were dry land . The east coast of present day England and the coasts of present day Denmark , Germany and the Netherlands were connected by the former landmass known as Doggerland , forming the British Peninsula on the European mainland . Wales was free of glaciers by about 10 @,@ 250 BP , the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded . The post @-@ glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland , forming the Irish Sea . Doggerland was submerged by the North Sea and , by 8 @,@ 000 BP , the British Peninsula had become an island . By the beginning of the Neolithic ( c . 6 @,@ 000 BP ) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet ( 10 metres ) lower than today . John Davies has theorised that the story of <unk> 'r <unk> 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower , may be distant folk memories of this time . 
 Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people , gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering , to become settled farmers about 6 @,@ 000 BP – the Neolithic Revolution . They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land , developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production , and built <unk> such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5 @,@ 800 BP and 5 @,@ 500 BP . In common with people living all over Great Britain , over the following centuries the people living in what was to become known as Wales assimilated immigrants and exchanged ideas of the Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures . According to John T. Koch and others , Wales in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading @-@ networked culture that also included the other Celtic nations , England , France , Spain and Portugal where Celtic languages developed . This view , sometimes called " Atlantic @-@ Celtic " , stands against the view that the Celtic languages have their origins further east with the Hallstatt culture . By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries . 
 = = = Roman era = = = 
 The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete . Roman rule lasted over 300 years . The campaigns of conquest are the most widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era , because of the spirited , but ultimately unsuccessful , defence of their homelands by two native tribes : the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation , save for the southern coastal region of south Wales , east of the Gower Peninsula , where there is a legacy of Romanisation . The only town in Wales founded by the Romans , Caerwent , is in south east Wales . Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales , became Roman civitates . Wales had a rich mineral wealth . The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver . Roman economic development was concentrated in south @-@ eastern Britain , and no significant industries located in Wales . This was largely a matter of circumstance , as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination , and the forested , mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation . Although Latin became the official language of Wales , the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete , the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman , particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire . Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely ; state persecution ceased in the 4th century , as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313 . 
 Early historians , including the 6th century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history , as it is stated in literature as the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties . In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or <unk> <unk> , stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators , to launch a successful bid for imperial power ; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor . Gildas , writing in about 540 , says that Maximus departed Britain , taking with him all of its Roman troops , armed bands , governors and the flower of its youth , never to return . Having left with the troops and Roman administrators , and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future , his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers . The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties , including those of Powys and Gwent . It was this transfer of power that has given rise to the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation . He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of <unk> , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain , and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . 
 = = = Post @-@ Roman era = = = 
 The 400 @-@ year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales . After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410 , much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south @-@ east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y @-@ DNA subclades , some previously maintained that native Britons were displaced by the invaders . This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that the population has , mainly , at latest Hallstatt era origins , but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo @-@ Saxon source areas . However , by AD 500 , the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo @-@ Saxon rule . The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . Archaeological evidence , in the Low Countries and what was to become England , shows early Anglo @-@ Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 to 550 , which concurs with Frankish chronicles . John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . This tenacious survival by the Romano @-@ Britons and their descendants in the western kingdoms was to become the foundation of what we now know as Wales . With the loss of the lowlands , England 's kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria , and later Wessex , wrestled with Powys , Gwent and Gwynedd to define the frontier between the two peoples . 
 Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries , a resurgent late @-@ seventh @-@ century Powys checked Mercian advancement . Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands , had built Wat 's Dyke . According to John Davies , this endeavour may have been with Powys king <unk> ap <unk> 's own agreement , as this boundary , extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary , gave Oswestry to Powys . Another theory , after carbon dating placed the dyke 's existence 300 years earlier , is that it may have been built by the post @-@ Roman rulers of Wroxeter . King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this consultative initiative when he created a larger earthwork , now known as Offa 's Dyke ( <unk> Offa ) . Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa 's Dyke : " In the planning of it , there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent . On the Long Mountain near <unk> , the dyke veers to the east , leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh ; near <unk> , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap <unk> retained possession of the Fortress of <unk> . " And , for Gwent , Offa had the dyke built " on the eastern crest of the gorge , clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent . " However , Fox 's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research . Offa 's Dyke largely remained the frontier between the Welsh and English , though the Welsh would recover by the 12th century the area between the Dee ( Afon <unk> ) and the Conwy , known then as Y <unk> . By the 8th century , the eastern borders with the Anglo @-@ Saxons had broadly been set . 
 In 853 the Vikings raided Anglesey , but in 856 Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader , Gorm . The Britons of Wales later made their peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north . This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh . According to Annales Cambriae , in 894 , " Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi . " 
 = = = Medieval Wales = = = 
 The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as <unk> ( Modern Welsh <unk> ) , which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole . The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called <unk> , meaning " Saxons " . The Anglo @-@ Saxons called the Romano @-@ British ' Walha ' , meaning ' Romanised foreigner ' or ' stranger ' . The Welsh continued to call themselves <unk> ( Brythons or Britons ) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan <unk> ) c . 633 . In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930 – 942 , the words Cymry and <unk> are used as often as 15 times . However , from the Anglo @-@ Saxon settlement onwards , the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over <unk> . 
 From 800 onwards , a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r . 844 – 77 ) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons in turn would found three principal dynasties ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and <unk> for Powys ) . Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda ( r . 900 – 50 ) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930 , ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s . Maredudd ab Owain ( r . 986 – 99 ) of Deheubarth ( Hywel 's grandson ) would , ( again ) temporarily oust the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . 
 Maredudd 's great @-@ grandson ( through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn ( r . 1039 – 63 ) would conquer his cousins ' realms from his base in Powys , and even extend his authority into England . Historian John Davies states that Gruffydd was " the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales ... Thus , from about 1057 until his death in 1063 , the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years , Wales was one , under one ruler , a feat with neither precedent nor successor . " Owain Gwynedd ( 1100 – 70 ) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps <unk> ( prince of the Welsh ) , a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies . 
 Within four years of the Battle of Hastings England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . William I of England established a series of lordships , allocated to his most powerful warriors along the Welsh border , the boundaries fixed only to the east . This frontier region , and any English @-@ held lordships in Wales , became known as <unk> <unk> , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . The area of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed . The March of Wales , which existed for over 450 years , was abolished under the Acts of Union in 1536 . 
 Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr ( the Great , 1173 – 1240 ) , wrested concessions through the Magna Carta in 1215 and receiving the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , became the first Prince of Wales . His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd also secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267 . Later however , a succession of disputes , including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , daughter of Simon de Montfort , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . As a result of military defeat , the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277 . Peace was short lived and , with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended . With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution , the few remaining Welsh lords did homage for their lands to Edward I. Llywelyn 's head was carried through London on a spear ; his baby daughter Gwenllian was locked in the priory at Sempringham , where she remained until her death 54 years later . 
 To help maintain his dominance , Edward constructed a series of great stone castles : Beaumaris , Caernarfon and Conwy . His son , the future King Edward II of England , was born at Edward 's new castle at Caernarfon in 1284 . He became the first English Prince of Wales , not as an infant , but in 1301 . The apocryphal story that Edward tricked the Welsh by offering them a Welsh @-@ born Prince who could speak no English was first recorded in 1584 . The title also provided an income from the north @-@ west part of Wales known as the Principality of Wales , until the Act of Union ( 1536 ) , after which the term principality , when used , was associated with the whole of Wales . After the failed revolt in 1294 – 95 of Madog ap Llywelyn – who styled himself Prince of Wales in the <unk> Document – and the rising of Llywelyn Bren ( 1316 ) , the next major uprising was that led by Owain Glyndŵr , against Henry IV of England . In 1404 , Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France , Spain and Scotland . Glyndŵr went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns , including Machynlleth . But the rebellion failed , and Owain went into hiding in 1412 ; peace was essentially restored in Wales by 1415 . Although the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for post @-@ conquest government of the Principality of north Wales from 1284 until 1536 , there was no formal Union until 1536 . Shortly afterwards Welsh law , which had continued to be used in Wales after the Norman conquest , was fully replaced by English law , under what would become known as the Act of Union . 
 = = = Industrial Wales = = = 
 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution , which saw a rapid economic expansion between 1750 and 1850 , there were signs of small @-@ scale industries scattered throughout Wales . These ranged from industries connected to agriculture , such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying . Until the Industrial Revolution , Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner . The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area . With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall 's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then @-@ largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey , Swansea developed into the world 's major centre for non @-@ ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century . The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting , and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country . In the north of Wales , John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry , while in the south , a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil , where the four ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales . In the 1820s , south Wales alone accounted for 40 % of all pig iron manufactured in Britain . 
 In the late 18th century , slate quarrying began to expand rapidly , most notably in north Wales . The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15 @,@ 000 men by the late 19th century , and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade . Although slate quarrying has been described as ' the most Welsh of Welsh industries ' , it is coal mining which has become the single industry synonymous with Wales and its people . Initially , coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but , with the opening of canal systems and later the railways , Welsh coal mining saw a boom in its demand . As the south Wales coalfield was exploited , mainly in the upland valleys around Aberdare and later the Rhondda , the ports of Swansea , Cardiff and later Penarth , grew into world exporters of coal and , with them , came a population boom . By its height in 1913 , Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal . As well as in south Wales , there was also a significant coalfield in the north @-@ east of the country , particularly around Wrexham . As Wales was reliant on the production of capital goods rather than consumer goods , it possessed few of the skilled craftspeople and artisans found in the workshops of Birmingham or Sheffield in England and had few factories producing finished goods – a key feature of most regions associated with the Industrial Revolution . However , there is increasing support that the industrial revolution was reliant on harnessing the energy and materials provided by Wales and , in that sense , Wales was of central importance . 
 = = = Modern Wales = = = 
 Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a " relatively placid , self @-@ confident and successful nation " . Output from the coalfields continued to increase , with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9 @.@ 6 million tons of coal extracted in 1913 . The outbreak of the First World War ( 1914 – 1918 ) saw Wales , as part of the United Kingdom , enter hostilities with Germany . A total of 272 @,@ 924 Welshmen served in the war , representing 21 @.@ 5 % of the male population . Of these , roughly 35 @,@ 000 were killed . The two most notable battles of the War to include Welsh forces were those at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . 
 The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales . Since 1865 , the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and , following the general election of 1906 , only one non @-@ Liberal Member of Parliament , Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency in Westminster . Yet by 1906 , industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields . In 1916 , David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain when he was made head of the 1916 coalition government . In December 1918 , Lloyd George was re @-@ elected at the head of a Conservative @-@ dominated coalition government , and his poor handling of the 1919 coalminers ' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales . The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards a new political organisation , established by Hardie and others to ensure an elected representation for the working class , which is now called the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners ' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party , the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs . By 1922 , half of the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians — the start of a Labour hegemony which would dominate Wales into the 21st century . 
 After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century , Wales ' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s , leading to widespread unemployment and poverty in the south Wales valleys . For the first time in centuries , the population of Wales went into decline ; the scourge of unemployment only relented with the production demands of the Second World War . The Second World War ( 1939 – 1945 ) saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all the major theatres of war , with some 15 @,@ 000 of them killed . Bombing raids brought major loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943 , 10 % of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines , where there were labour shortages ; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low , especially in the Second World War , which was seen as a fight against fascism . Of the political parties active in Wales , only Plaid Cymru took a neutral stance , on the grounds that it was an " imperialist war " . 
 The 20th century saw a revival in Welsh national feeling . Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 , seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK . In 1955 , the term England and Wales became common for describing the area to which English law applied , and Cardiff was proclaimed as capital city of Wales . <unk> yr <unk> <unk> ( The Welsh Language Society ) was formed in 1962 , in response to fears that the language might soon die out . Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir supplying water to the English city of Liverpool . Despite 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voting against the bill ( the other one abstained ) , Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged , highlighting Wales ' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in the Westminster Parliament . Both the Free Wales Army and <unk> <unk> Cymru ( Welsh Defence Movement , abbreviated as MAC ) were formed as a direct result of the Tryweryn destruction , conducting campaigns from 1963 . In the years leading up to the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 , these groups were responsible for a number of bomb blasts — destroying water pipes , tax and other offices and part of the dam at the new <unk> reservoir project in Montgomeryshire , being built to supply water to the English Midlands . In 1966 the Carmarthen Parliamentary seat was won by Gwynfor Evans at a by @-@ election , Plaid Cymru 's first Parliamentary seat . In the following year , the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England was stated .
