 Paweł Jasienica was the pen name of Leon Lech Beynar ( 10 November 1909 – 19 August 1970 ) , a Polish historian , journalist and soldier . 
 During World War II , Jasienica ( then , Leon Beynar ) fought in the Polish Army , and later , the Armia Krajowa resistance . Near the end of the war , he was also working with the anti @-@ Soviet resistance , which later led to him taking up a new name , Paweł Jasienica , to hide from the communist government of the People 's Republic of Poland . He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines . He is best known for his 1960s books on Polish history — on the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty , the Jagiellon Dynasty , and the elected kings of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth . Those books , still popular , played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers . 
 Jasienica became an outspoken critic of the censorship in the People 's Republic of Poland , and as a notable dissident , he was persecuted by the government . He was subject to significant <unk> by the security services , and his second wife was in fact an agent of the communist secret police . For a brief period marking the end of his life , his books were prohibited from being distributed or printed .

 Beynar was born on 10 November 1909 in Simbirsk , Russia , to Polish parents , Mikołaj Beynar and Helena <unk> . His paternal grandfather , Ludwik Beynar , fought in the January Uprising and married a Spanish woman , Joanna Adela <unk> . His maternal grandfather , Wiktor Maliszewski , fought in the November Uprising . Both of his grandfathers eventually settled in the Russian Empire . His father , Mikołaj , worked as an agronomist . Beynar 's family lived in Russia and Ukraine — they moved from Simbirsk to a location near Bila Tserkva and Uman , then to Kiev until the Russian Revolution of 1917 , after which they decided to settle in the independent Poland . After brief stay in Warsaw , during the Polish – Soviet War , his family settled in Opatów , and in 1924 , moved to Grodno . 
 Beynar graduated from gymnasium ( secondary school ) in Wilno ( Vilnius ) and graduated in history from Stefan Batory University in Wilno ( his thesis concerned the January Uprising ) . At the university he was an active member of several organizations including Klub <unk> ( Intellectuals ' Club ) and <unk> Klub <unk> ( Academic Club of Vagabonds ) . After graduating , he finished training for the officer cadet ( <unk> ) in the Polish Army . From 1928 to 1937 he lived in Grodno , where he worked as a history teacher in a gymnasium ; later he was employed as an announcer for Polish Radio Wilno . Here also , Beynar embarked on his career as author and essayist , writing for a local newspaper , Słowo <unk> ( The Wilno Word ) . On 11 November 1934 he marred Władysława Adamowicz , and in 1938 his daughter Ewa was born . In 1935 he published his first history book - about king Zygmunt August , Zygmunt August na <unk> dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa ( Sigismund Augustus on the Lands of the Former Grand Duchy [ of Lithuania ] ) .

 During World War II , Beynar was a soldier in the Polish Army , fighting the German Wehrmacht when it invaded Poland in September 1939 . He commanded a platoon near Sandomierz and was eventually taken prisoner by the Germans . While in a temporary prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in Opatów , he was able to escape with the help of some old school friends from the time his family lived there in the early 1920s . He joined the Polish underground organization , " Związek Walki Zbrojnej " ( Association for Armed Combat ) , later transformed into the " Armia Krajowa " ( " AK " ; the Home Army ) , and continued the fight against the Germans . In the resistance he had the rank of lieutenant , worked in the local Wilno headquarters and was an editor of an underground newspaper " <unk> " . He was also involved in the underground teaching . In July 1944 he took part in the operation aimed at the liberation of Wilno from the Germans ( Operation <unk> Brama ) . In the wake of this operation , around 19 – 21 August , his partisan unit , like many others , was intercepted and attacked by the Soviets . He was taken prisoner ; sources vary as to whether he was to be exiled to Siberia or conscripted into the Polish People 's Army . Either way he escaped and rejoined AK partisans ( the Home Army 5th Wilno Brigade ) . For a while , he was an aide to Major Zygmunt <unk> ( <unk> ) and was member of the anti @-@ Soviet resistance , <unk> i <unk> ( WiN , Freedom and Independence ) . He was promoted to the rank of captain . Wounded in August 1945 , he left the Brigade before it was destroyed by the Soviets , and avoided the fate of most of its officers who were sentenced to death . While recovering from his wounds , he found shelter in the village of Jasienica . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 After recovering from his wounds in 1945 , Beynar decided to leave the resistance , and instead began publishing in an independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny . It was then that he took the pen @-@ name Jasienica ( from the name of the place where he had received treatment for his injuries ) in order not to endanger his wife , who was still living in Soviet @-@ controlled Vilnius , Lithuania . Soon he became a member of the weekly 's staff and then an editor . In 1948 he was arrested by the Polish secret police ( Polish : Urząd Bezpieczeństwa ) but after several weeks was released after the intervention of Bolesław Piasecki from the PAX Association . In gratitude to Piasecki , he worked with PAX in the future , leaving Tygodnik Powszechny for PAX in 1950 . From 1950 he was a director of Polish Caritas charity . His essays were published in <unk> i <unk> , Słowo <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Po <unk> . From at least this period till his death he would live in Warsaw . His wife Władysława died 29 March 1965 . 
 Over time he became increasingly involved in various dissident organizations . In December 1959 he became a vice president of the Union of Polish Writers ( Związek Literatów Polskich , <unk> ) . He also published in the magazine Świat ( 1951 – 1969 ) . In 1962 he was the last president of the literary discussion society , Klub <unk> <unk> . In 1966 he was a vice president of the PEN Club . While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity , later he turned to writing popular history in book format . In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works , historical books about history of Poland - the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty , the Jagiellonian dynasty , and the era of elected kings ( the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth ) . His book on the Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers . 
 Jasienica was , however , very outspoken in his criticism of the censorship in the People 's Republic of Poland . On 29 February 1968 during a <unk> meeting , <unk> presented a harsh critique of the government . These acts , and in particular his signing of the dissident Letter of 34 in 1964 against censorship and his involvement in the 1968 protests led to his being labeled a political dissident , for which he suffered government persecution . Partly as a response to government 's persecution of Jasienica , in 1968 the satirist Janusz Szpotański dedicated one of his anti @-@ government poems , Ballada o <unk> ( The Ballad of <unk> ) , written while Szpotański was in Mokotów Prison , to the writer . In the aftermath of the 1968 events , Polish communist media , and communist leader , Władysław Gomułka , on 19 March 1968 , alleged that in 1948 Jasienica was freed because he collaborated with the communist regime ; this allegation caused much controversy and damaged Jasienica 's reputation . He was subject to much <unk> by the security services . In December 1969 , five years after his first wife 's death , he became married again . This marriage , after his death , proven to be highly controversial , as his second wife was in fact a secret police informant before the marriage , and continued to write reports about him throughout their marriage . Since then , till his death , his books were prohibited from being distributed or printed . 
 Jasienica died from cancer on 19 August 1970 in Warsaw . Some publicists later speculated to what extent his death was caused by " hounding from the party establishment " . He is buried in Warsaw 's Powązki Cemetery . His funeral was attended by many dissidents and became a political manifestation ; Adam Michnik recalls seeing Antoni Słonimski , Stefan <unk> , Stanisław <unk> , Jerzy <unk> , Jan Józef Lipski and Władysław <unk> . Bohdan <unk> read a letter from Antoni <unk> . 
 = = Work = = 
 Jasienica book publishing begun with a historical book , Zygmunt August na <unk> dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa ( Sigismund Augustus in the lands of the former Grand Duchy ; 1935 ) . He is best known for his highly acclaimed and popular historical books from the 1960s about Piast Poland , Jagiellon Poland and the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth : Polska <unk> ( Piast Poland , 1960 ) , Polska <unk> ( Jagiellon Poland , 1963 ) and the trilogy Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów ( The Commonwealth of Both Nations , 1967 – 1972 ) . This trilogy made him one of the most popular Polish history writers . Throughout his life he avoided writing about modern history , to minimize the influence that the official , communist Marxist historiography would have on his works . This was also one of the reasons for the popularity of his works , which were seen as a rare , legally obtainable alternative to the official version of history . His books , publication of which resumed once again after his death , were labeled as " best @-@ selling " , and became the most reprinted postwar history of Poland . 
 His <unk> <unk> ( Two ways , 1959 ) about the January Uprising of the 1860s represent the latest historical period he has tackled . His other popular historical books include Trzej <unk> , ( Three chroniclers ; 1964 ) , a book about three medieval chroniclers of Polish history ( Thietmar of Merseburg , Gallus Anonymus and Wincenty Kadłubek ) , in which he discusses the Polish society through ages ; and <unk> z <unk> ( Last of the Family ; 1965 ) about the last queen of the Jagiellon dynasty , Anna <unk> . His <unk> o <unk> <unk> ( 1978 ; Thoughts on Civil War ) were the last book he has finished ; unlike majority of his other works , this book is ostensibly about the civil war ( <unk> ) in Brittany , France . This work does however contains numerous arguments applicable to more modern Polish history ; arguments that Jasienica thought would not be allowed by the censors if the book discussed Polish history . 
 In addition to historical books , Jasienica , wrote a series of essays about archeology - <unk> <unk> ( Slavic genealogy ; 1961 ) and <unk> na <unk> . <unk> ( Archeological excerpts : reports ; 1956 ) , journalistic travel reports ( Wisła <unk> <unk> , <unk> Nad <unk> ) and science and technology ( <unk> o <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . Those works were mostly created around the 1950s and 1960s . 
 His Pamiętnik ( Diary ) was the work that he begun shortly before his death , and that was never finished . 
 In 2006 , Polish journalist and former dissident Adam Michnik said that : 
 I belong to the generation ' 68 , a generation that has special debt to Paweł Jasienica - in fact he paid with his life for daring to defend us , the youth . I want for somebody to be able to write , at some point , that in my generation there were people who stayed true to his message . Those who never forgot about his beautiful life , his wise and brave books , his terrible tragedy . 
 Polish historian Henryk Samsonowicz echoes Michnik 's essay in his introduction to a recent ( 2008 ) edition of Trzej <unk> , describing Jasienica as a person who did much to popularize Polish history . Hungarian historian Balázs <unk> notes that " Jasienica 's impact of the formation of the popular interpretation of Polish history is hard to overestimate " . British historian Norman Davies , himself an author of a popular account of Polish history ( God 's Playground ) , notes that Jasienica , while more of " a historical writer than an academic historian " , had " formidable talents " , gained " much popularity " and that his works would find no equals in the time of communist Poland . Samsonowicz notes that Jasienica " was a brave writer " , going against prevailing system , and willing to propose new hypotheses and reinterpret history in innovative ways . Michnik notes how Jasienica was willing to write about Polish mistakes , for example in the treatment of Cossacks . Ukrainian historian Stephen <unk> also positively commented on Jasienica 's extensive coverage of the Polish @-@ Ukrainian history . Both Michnik and Samsonowicz note how Jasienica 's works contain hidden messages in which Jasienica discusses more contemporary history , such as in his <unk> ....

 During a MTV interview , Mars explained why the track was the first on the tracklist of the album " It really shows you what this album is going to be , and just where I was when I started this album " . He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record " There 's a moment in your life where you start going out every night , and it 's so fun , but then you start to lose yourself ; you get lost in the sauce " . The singer compared the song 's sentiment to " Lookin ' for Love In All the Wrong Places " , adding " It 's another confession " . 
 Mars stated that he wasn 't willing to stay too far from his roots when it comes to writing lyrics for his album . " I 'm not there yet ... to sing about politics " . He concluded , that writing and singing songs about girls is what he knows best , " I 'm not going to preach what I don 't know . As much as I love 2 Chainz 's " All I Want For My Birthday " . 
 A demo of the song , only featuring the vocals and an acoustic guitar , was exclusively released as bonus track on the Target edition of the album , on December 11 , 2012 . Almost a year later , on November 5 , 2013 , the demo of the song was also included on the deluxe edition of the album , released worldwide .

The record was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood , California and David Kutch mastered it . " Young Girls " was recorded by Levine at Levcon Studios in Los Angeles , California . Charles Moniz served as the track 's additional engineer , while the engineering of the Big Drums was handled by Brent <unk> and Ken Lewis . 
 " Young Girls " was first performed on Saturday Night Live and was released as the first promotional single taken from Unorthodox <unk> , on November 6 , 2012 on iTunes . Later , it was reported by Mars that the record was scheduled to be the second single from the album . This release involved little planning according to Mars " I felt [ it ] was good . None of these things are planned , which one goes first , which one goes second . One day I wake up and I say , ' You know what ? I want the world to hear this song that I wrote called ' Young Girls , ' and I put it out " . However , a week later , while performing " When I Was Your Man " on the third season finale of The Voice , he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album .

 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Young Girls " is a pop song , performed as a " woeful " midtempo ballad . The " pop anthem " is also influenced by a groove from Mars ' debut studio album , noticeable on the backing vocals , and it contains elements of " the shaded earnestness " found in " It Will Rain " . According to the sheet music published at Music Notes by Alfred Music , the song is composed in the key of A major with a time signature in common time , and a moderate groove of 125 beats per minute . Mars 's vocals range spans from the low note of F4 to the high note C6 . 
 The song opens with " methodical strings " mixed with " quadruplets , floppy and fuzz wind in the opening bars " , along with synths and a piano as Mars ' vocal delivery " soars " . The music progresses with a " thumping martial beat " on the percussion of the " heavy drums " , reminding " Phil Spector – esque tom @-@ toms " , and they " counterpoint to the ascendant melody " with " bits of electro " fading in the background . The chorus would fit in a " 60 's girl group " due to the join forces of Mars ' " retro crooner sensibilities with modern sonic flourishes " . Carl Williot of Idolator noted that the " delicate but dynamic production " on " Young Girls " is reminiscent of Lana Del Rey . 
 The lyrics to " Young Girls " follow the verse – pre @-@ chorus – chorus pattern . It begins with the singer " <unk> " trying to get noticed by " these bright @-@ eyed honeys " , since he can 't help to fall for their " dubious charms " , despite " recognizing [ the ] sin while indulging in it " . The song 's lyrics are in the same vein as Gary Puckett & The Union Gap 's " Young Girl " and The Knack 's " My Sharona " as pointed out by HitFix 's Melinda Newman . She added , the lyrics are " sweet " and tortuous as he sings " Oh , I still dream of a simple life / Boy meets girl / makes her his wife / But love don ’ t exist when you live like this ... All these roads steer me wrong / But I still drive them all night long / all night long " . There is a sentiment of " lament " in the song , " Oh you young wild girls / You ’ ll be the death of me " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Young Girls " debuted to mixed and positive reviews among critics . After its premiere during Mars ' performance on Saturday Night Live , it became available as a studio version with Chris Martins of Spin labeling it an " epic studio @-@ recorded glory " . On a more thorough review , Idolator 's Carl Williott found the production " dynamic " comparing it to compositions by Lana Del Rey and while " the pre @-@ chorus could be from a 60 's girl group " , the " percussion and electro flitting in the background " is what makes pop music nowadays . He concluded , that it 's " a flipside " to Mars ' lead single . HitFix 's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B- rating , praising the melody and Mars ' vocal delivery , writing " he makes it all sound so sweet , and as if he really is tortured by these young girls " , but ultimately calling the lyrics " a little skeevy " . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times , while reviewing the album , believed that it " swells something serious . The ambition is undeniable " . He compared it to the works U2 and Daughtry . Jessica Sager , music reviewer , of Pop Crush thought the track was pleasant as " a woeful ballad " giving a positive note to Mars ' vocals , ultimately calling the song " a good choice as the first track " on the album . 
 On mixed review , Andy Gill of The Independent , while describing Mars ' " impassioned shame " on the lyrics called the track " enjoyable " . The lyrics have not gone undecided for PopMatters ' Matt Cibula who named them a " classic lament " and added " is as widescreen and wide @-@ open as things get these days " . The same could be said for Jason Lipshut who , while writing for Billboard , found Mars ' " recognizing sin while indulging in it " on the " sleek " lyrics and <unk> . However , a " throwback vibe ( established from the backing vocals ) remain from Doo @-@ Wops " , while prospecting the earnest from " It Will Rain " . On the other hand , Paste 's Ryan Reed criticized Mars ' for playing safe on " Young Girls " , unlike most of the other tracks on the album . He explained that the singer " steps sideways " and the record " is a ' shout @-@ out @-@ to @-@ the @-@ honeys ' belter " for various reasons .

 = SMS Szent István = 
 SMS Szent István was a Tegetthoff @-@ class dreadnought of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the only one built in the Hungarian part of Austria @-@ Hungary . The Ganz & Company 's Danubius Yard in Hungarian @-@ owned Fiume ( current @-@ day Rijeka ) was awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets . She was named after Hungary 's first Christian king , Saint Stephen ( Hungarian : Szent István ) . She and her sister ships were regarded as very compact and powerful ships and were the first dreadnoughts in service with triple main @-@ gun turrets . 
 Her completion was delayed by the start of World War I , but she was commissioned in December 1915 . She spent the bulk of the war at anchor in Pola ( Pula ) , leaving harbour generally only for gunnery training . Her final mission began on the evening of 9 June 1918 when she sailed to rendezvous with the other dreadnoughts for an attack on the Otranto Barrage , scheduled for the following day . Two Italian MAS , a type of motor torpedo boat employed by the Regia Marina , discovered Szent István and her half @-@ sister Tegetthoff early in the morning of 10 June 1918 while returning after a night patrol off the Dalmatian coast . They penetrated past her escorts and torpedoed her twice abreast her boiler rooms . They flooded , which knocked out power to the pumps , and Szent István capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed . All but 89 of her crew were rescued . She is the only battleship whose sinking was filmed during World War I. 
 Her wreck was discovered in the mid @-@ 1970s , upside down , off the Croatian island of Premuda . She has been declared a protected site by the Croatian Ministry of Culture and casual diving is forbidden . 
 = = Design = = 
 Szent István differed from her half @-@ sisters mainly in her machinery . She only had two shafts and two turbines , unlike the four shaft arrangement of the other ships of her class . External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed . A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk in front of the mainmast . She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Szent István had an overall length of 152 @.@ 18 metres ( 499 ft 3 in ) , a beam of 28 metres ( 91 ft 10 in ) , and a draught of 8 @.@ 6 metres ( 28 ft 3 in ) at deep load . She displaced 20 @,@ 008 tonnes ( 19 @,@ 692 long tons ) at load and 21 @,@ 689 tonnes ( 21 @,@ 346 long tons ) at deep load . The <unk> for each propeller shaft was a solid , blade @-@ like fitting , unlike the strut @-@ type skegs used in her half @-@ sisters , that had such a high transversal resistance that the rudder could only be laid at a maximum angle of 10 ° at full speed to avoid a heavy list . The hull was built with a double bottom 1 @.@ 22 metres ( 4 ft 0 in ) deep with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of 25 @-@ millimetre ( 1 in ) plates . 
 She was fitted with two AEG @-@ Curtis steam turbines , each of which was housed in a separate engine @-@ room . The turbines were powered by twelve Babcock & Wilcox boilers in two boiler rooms . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 26 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 388 kW ) , enough for her designed speed of 20 knots ( 23 mph ; 37 km / h ) , but no figures from her trials are known to exist . She carried 1 @,@ 844 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 815 @.@ 4 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 267 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 263 @.@ 0 long tons ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 4 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 800 km ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) . 
 Szent István mounted twelve 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) / 45 @-@ caliber K 10 guns in four triple turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 91 in ) / 50 K 10 guns mounted in casemates amidships . Twelve 66 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) / 50 K 10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on the upper deck , above the casemates . Three more 66 @-@ mm K 10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for anti @-@ aircraft duties . Four 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted , one each in the bow , stern and on each broadside ; twelve torpedoes were carried . 
 The waterline armour belt of the Tegetthoff @-@ class dreadnoughts measured 280 millimetres ( 11 in ) thick between the midpoints of the fore and aft barbettes and thinned to 150 millimetres further towards the bow and stern , but did not reach either the bow or the stern . It was continued to the bow by a small patch of 110 – 130 @-@ millimetre ( 4 – 5 in ) armour . The upper armour belt had a maximum thickness of 180 millimetres ( 7 in ) , but it thinned to 110 millimeters from the forward barbette all the way to the bow . The casemate armour was also 180 millimetres thick . The sides of the main gun turrets , barbettes and main conning tower were protected by 280 millimetres ( 11 in ) of armour , except for the turret and conning tower roofs which were 60 to 150 millimetres ( 2 to 6 in ) thick . The thickness of the decks ranged from 30 to 48 millimetres ( 1 to 2 in ) in two layers . The underwater protection system consisted of the extension of the double bottom up to the lower edge of the waterline armour belt , with a thin 10 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) plate acting as the outermost bulkhead . It was backed by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two layered 25 @-@ millimetre plates . The total thickness of this system was only 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 ft 3 in ) which made it incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or mine explosion without rupturing .

 The ship was laid down on 29 January 1912 at Ganz & Company 's Danubius yard at Fiume ( current @-@ day Rijeka ) , the only large Hungarian shipyard in Croatia as Hungarian : János Hunyadi , commemorating the Hungarian national hero . Ganz & Company was awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets . This involved great expense by the Hungarian government , as the yard had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for , amongst others , Österreichischer Lloyd , and therefore had to be itself refitted for the building of larger vessels . However she was renamed Szent István by order of the Emperor Franz Joseph before she was launched on 17 January 1914 . It was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship , but Franz Joseph was too feeble and his heir , Archduke Franz Ferdinand , refused to be there as a consequence of his anti @-@ Hungarian attitudes . Franz Joseph sent a telegram of congratulations that negated the snub offered by his heir . During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators , but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers , killing one and crushing the arm of the other . Her fitting out was delayed by the start of the war , but she was finally commissioned on 13 December 1915 . 
 = = Service = = 
 Szent István was based at Pola ( Pula ) for the duration of her career . In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait . She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single , two @-@ day , trip to Pag Island . Only 5 @.@ 7 % of her life was spent at sea ; for the rest of the time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour . She was never even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned . 
 Her tenure in Pola was enlivened by a visit from the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm on 12 December 1917 during his inspection of the German submarine base there . The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the crews of her anti @-@ aircraft gun busy . 
 = = = Sinking = = = 
 By 1918 , the Allies had strengthened their blockade on the Strait of Otranto . As a result , it was becoming more difficult for German and Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats to get through the strait and into the Mediterranean . In response to these new measures at blockading the straits , the new commander of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with battleships , scout cruisers , and destroyers . During the night of 8 June , Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen . At about 11 : 00 pm on 9 June 1918 Szent István and Tegetthoff , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats , departed Pola , after some troubles getting the harbour defense barrage opened . They were en route to the harbour at Slano , north of Dubrovnik ( Ragusa ) to rendezvous with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen , for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage . At about 3 : 15 am on 10 June , two Italian MAS boats , MAS 15 and MAS 21 , spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast . The MAS platoon was commanded by Capitano di <unk> Luigi Rizzo , who had sunk the Austro @-@ Hungarian coastal defense ship SMS Wien in Trieste six months before . The individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively . Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts . MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff , but her torpedoes failed to hit the ship . MAS 15 fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3 : 25 am at Szent István . Both boats evaded any pursuit although MAS 15 had to discourage the Austro @-@ Hungarian torpedo boat Tb 76 T by dropping depth charges in her wake . Tegetthoff thought that the torpedoes were fired by submarines and pulled out of the formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks . She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes until she rejoined her half @-@ sister at 4 : 45 . 
 Szent István was hit by two 45 @-@ centimetre ( 18 in ) torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms . The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10 ° list to starboard . Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7 ° , but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed . While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed . However , water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side . This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights . The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard . An attempt by Tegetthoff to take the crippled battleship into tow was also abandoned after it became clear that Szent István was doomed . Flooding continued , and the ship capsized at 6 : 05 am off Premuda Island . Only 89 sailors died — 41 from Hungary — the low death toll partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the <unk> Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service . 
 Film footage exists of Szent István 's last half @-@ hour , taken by Linienschiffsleutnant Meusburger of the Tegetthoff with his own camera as well as by an official film crew . The two films were later spliced together and exhibited in the United States during the Great Depression . 
 The wreck of the Szent István was located in the mid @-@ 1970s by the SFR Yugoslav Navy . She is upside down at a depth of 66 metres ( 217 ft ) . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat , but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull . The two holes from the torpedo hits are visible in the side of the ship as is another deep hole which may be from a torpedo fired at Tegetthoff by MAS 21 . She is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and diving is forbidden without permission . In 2008 , divers from Hungary placed a wreath on the Szent István 's wreck during a ceremony that was attended by members of the Austrian and Croatian governments . All three countries were once part of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy , commander of the proposed attack , cancelled the attack because he thought that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola . 
 In fact the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there . Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo was awarded his second Gold Medal of Military Valor , his first was for sinking the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Wien in 1917 , and appointed a knight in the Order of the Crown of Italy . After the war MAS 15 was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the Museo del Risorgimento in Rome . The anniversary of the sinking has been celebrated by the Regia Marina , and its successor , the Marina Militare , as its Navy Day ( Italian : Festa della Marina ) . 
 = Masako Katsura = 
 Masako Katsura ( <unk> <unk> , Katsura Masako , 1913 – 1995 ) listen , nicknamed " <unk> " and sometimes called the " First Lady of Billiards " , was a Japanese carom billiards player who was most active in the 1950s . Katsura blazed a trail for women in the sport by competing and placing among the best in the male @-@ dominated world of professional billiards . First learning the game from her brother @-@ in @-@ law and then under the tutelage of Japanese champion <unk> Matsuyama , Katsura became Japan 's only female professional player . In competition in Japan she took second place in the country 's national three @-@ cushion billiards championship three times . In exhibition she was noted for running 10 @,@ 000 points at the game of straight rail . 
 After marrying a U.S. Army non @-@ commissioned officer in 1950 , Katsura emigrated with him to the United States in 1951 . There she was invited to play in the 1952 <unk> World Three @-@ Cushion Championship , ultimately taking seventh place at that competition . Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament . Her fame cemented , Katsura went on an exhibition tour of the United States with eight @-@ time world champion Welker Cochran , and later with 51 @-@ time world champion Willie Hoppe . In 1953 and 1954 she again competed for the world three @-@ cushion crown , taking fifth and fourth places respectively . 
 Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years . She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958 , and went on a one @-@ week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst , but did not compete in any professional tournaments . In 1959 , she made two television appearances on ABC 's You Asked for It , and one on the CBS primetime television hit What 's My Line ? . Katsura returned to competition in 1961 , playing a challenge match for the World Three @-@ Cushion title against Worst , then reigning world champion , and was defeated by him . Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter , only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976 . She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995 . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Little is known about Katsura 's childhood in Japan . Katsura had three sisters and a brother . Their father died when Katsura was 12 years old and she went to live with her older sister and her sister 's husband , Tomio Kobashi , who owned a billiard parlor . By 13 she was spending time in her brother @-@ in @-@ law 's billiard room , and by 14 she was working as a billiard attendant there . Kobashi was a fine player and taught Katsura the fundamentals of various carom billiards games . Katsura also had a billiard table at home , bought by her family after she showed intense interest in the sport . Katsura practiced diligently , and began competing against Japanese men and beating them . At just 15 , Katsura won the women 's championship straight rail tournament of Japan . " Then I turned professional and began touring with a sister all over Japan , China and Formosa " , said Katsura in a 1959 interview . Katsura 's two younger sisters , Noriko and <unk> , also won the women 's straight rail championship in other years . 
 In 1937 , Katsura met <unk> Matsuyama , who had won Japan 's national three @-@ cushion championship multiple times . Matsuyama was also U.S. national champion in 1934 , runner @-@ up three other times and had four second @-@ place finishes in world competition at 18 @.@ 2 balkline prior to World War II . Matsuyama was impressed with Katsura and began teaching her top level play . By 1947 , Katsura was a long @-@ established billiard star in Japan — the country 's only female professional player . 
 = = = Marriage and titles in Japan = = = 
 During 1947 Katsura caught the eye of American serviceman Vernon Greenleaf ( no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf ) , a master sergeant in the U.S. Army 's Quartermaster Corps who had been in the armed services for 22 years . Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions . Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her . They were married on November 30 , 1950 , but never had any children . 
 At the time of their marriage Katsura already boasted two second @-@ place finishes at Japan 's national three @-@ cushion championship ; one from the year prior to their wedding . She claimed the runner @-@ up spot for a third time the year of her marriage . About that time she accomplished the lofty feat of scoring 10 @,@ 000 contiguous points at straight rail in an exhibition by nursing the balls around the table 27 times over about 4 1 ⁄ 2 hours . She stopped at 10 @,@ 000 points only because it was a benchmark round number . In later years she said that her high run in three @-@ cushion billiards ( number of points scored consecutively in a single inning ) was 19 . 
 = = = Emigration to the U.S. = = = 
 In 1951 Greenleaf was transferred to a U.S. post from Haneda Air Base in Tokyo . He and Katsura , who spoke little English , set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge , debarking in San Francisco at the end of December 1951 , just a few months before the 1952 World Three @-@ Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin in that city on March 6 . Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran , whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament , had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama . Cochran was an 8 @-@ time world champion having won the world crown at three @-@ cushion billiards in 1933 , 1935 , 1937 , 1938 , 1944 and 1945 , and at 18 @.@ 2 balkline , in 1927 and 1934 . Cochran sent his son , W. R. ( Dick ) Cochran , a naval officer stationed in Japan , to investigate and received back a glowing report that said ( possibly to Cochran 's annoyance ) , " this girl is better than you are ! " Though the decision was ultimately in the hands of the Billiard Congress of America as tournament sponsor , they gave Cochran the option to invite her . 
 After Katsura arrived in the U.S. , she gave a private exhibition for Cochran , who wanted to make sure she was as good as reported before finalizing the invitation . At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail , made in the words of Cochran " almost unbelievable shots " after switching to balkline , and showed high competence at three @-@ cushion , consistently scoring . Cochran made the invite " final " and stated : " She 's the most marvelous thing I ever saw ... She 's liable to beat anybody , even Willie Hoppe ... I could not see any weak spots ... She 's going to give lots of those players fits . " As a warm @-@ up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952 .

 = = = First woman to compete for a world title = = = 
 Katsura 's participation in the 1952 World Three @-@ Cushion Billiards title marked the first time that a woman had competed for any world billiards title . This was only ten years after Ruth <unk> became the first woman to have ever been invited to play in any men 's professional billiard championship ( the New York State Championship of 1942 ) . The defending champion was the then 64 @-@ year @-@ old internationally renowned Willie Hoppe , who would retire later that year with 51 world titles to his name between 1906 and 1952 in three forms of carom billiards , three @-@ cushion , ( four sub @-@ disciplines of ) balkline and cushion caroms . Before the tournament , speculation had it that when Hoppe met Katsura in the championship in the race to 50 points format , he would defeat her with Katsura still needing at least 40 . After seeing her play , Hoppe said " she has a fine stroke and can make shots with either hand . I look forward to playing with her . " The public was fascinated by the novelty of a woman player . Life magazine reported that " San Franciscans who did not know a cue from a cucumber crowded in to see her ... Katy [ sic ] ... stole the show . " 
 = = = Tournament roster = = = 
 The 10 champions slated to play in the round robin format tournament were Katsura , her mentor , Matsuyama , favorite and defending champion Willie Hoppe , Mexican champion Joe Chamaco , Herb Hardt of Chicago , New York 's Art Rubin , Los Angeles ' Joe Procita , Ray Kilgore of San Francisco , Jay Bozeman of Vallejo and Binghamton 's Irving Crane . The championship between the invitees was to take place at Cochran 's 924 Club , with 45 total games to be played ( each player to play every other once ) over the 17 @-@ day tournament ending on March 22 , 1952 . The tournament was reported to have " The greatest billiard field since before World War II " . First place earned a $ 2 @,@ 000 purse ( today $ 17 @,@ 800 ) , plus thousands in exhibition fees . Following behind to eight places were prizes of $ 1 @,@ 000 , $ 700 , $ 500 , $ 350 , $ 300 , $ 250 and $ 250 respectively . 
 = = = Detail of play = = = 
 On the second day of the competition , March 7 , 1952 , Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match . They made quite a contrast as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney , while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as " so small and doll @-@ like she looks like a figurine in her flowing , gold @-@ satin gown . " Crane 's main discipline was straight pool , at which he won numerous championships , including six world titles . The match was close , but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 innings . On March 10 , Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings . Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead . On March 11 , she lost to Chamaco , 50 to 35 , but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50 – 43 in 63 innings , with runs of six , five and four . " Spectators exclaimed ' brilliant ' and ' sensational ' at some of her shots . " 
 On March 14 , Katsura faced the undefeated Hoppe , losing 50 to 31 in 36 innings . Though Hoppe was a darling of the public , the crowd of more than 500 spectators was clearly rooting for Katsura throughout . The next day she faced her mentor , Matsuyama , considered the contender with the best shot at beating Hoppe . Matsuyama edged out his protégé with a close 50 to 48 finish in 51 innings . By the 21st inning Matsuyama held a 29 – 21 lead . Katsura battled back , the score 43 – 42 in her favor by inning 33 , but Matsuyama ran three in the 46th inning , and Katsura could not close the gap . Mentor and protégé alike posted high runs of six in the match 
 On March 18 Katsura trounced Art Rubin 50 – 28 in 58 <unk> but was handed a worse defeat in her next match on March 20 , losing to Bozeman 50 to 18 in 52 innings . In her last match on March 21 , Katsura pulled off a 50 – 46 win against Kilgore in 61 innings . This was the biggest upset of the tournament . Kilgore , the " Giant Killer " , was the only player other than Matsuyama who was considered to have a fighting chance at dethroning Hoppe . Between this win and her earlier win over Procita , Katsura had beaten the only two players in the tournament that had won their matches against Hoppe . That evening a separate exhibition match between Katsura and Kilgore was featured on <unk> @-@ TV , with commentary provided by Cochran . The next day the tournament concluded with Hoppe repeating as champion as he had so many times before . Katsura took seventh place , ahead of Procita at eighth place , Chamaco at ninth and Rubin at tenth . Above her were Crane at sixth , Rubin at fifth , Kilgore at fourth , Bozeman at third and Matsuyama as runner @-@ up . 
 Following the competition , Jay Bozeman , said " We 've found it hard to believe that a woman could actually step into the best billiard championship in the world and hold her own . Miss Katsura is one of the finest players I 've faced in a world 's tournament , while Welker Cochran , five @-@ time holder of the Billiards World Crown , predicted : " Given another two or three years of American competition and she will be the world 's champion .... Masako has opened a new field for women . Her presence has made the game attractive to women for the first time . She has the power of a man and strokes beautifully . Her maneuvers with the cue ball are fantastic . All she needs is a bit more experience and she will be unbeatable . " 
 = = Exhibition tours = = 
 Soon after the 1952 championship , Cochran announced he was coming out of a seven @-@ year retirement to play an exhibition tour with Katsura . " Millions of fans want to see this charming first lady of billiards " he said , " now some of them can . " The duo previewed their tour with a three @-@ day engagement at the Garden City Parlor in San Jose starting on April 18 , 1952 . Thereafter , they planned stops in Kansas City ( May 2 – 3 ) ; Chicago ( May 5 – 11 ) ; Detroit in mid @-@ May ; and on to tentative stops in Cleveland , Buffalo , Boston , Philadelphia , Dallas , San Diego , Los Angeles and Long Beach . The format was to be a 100 @-@ point straight @-@ rail match , followed by a 50 @-@ point three @-@ cushion game played under tournament conditions with trick or " fancy " shots to follow . Katsura stated prior to departing : " I hope my tour will convince women that billiards is not only a man 's game . Women can play just as well as men . " 
 Billiards champion Tex Zimmerman ( Cochran 's partner in the 924 Club ) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty had a hand in organizing the tour . In preparation , they played up Katsura 's <unk> and her physical attractiveness . Tex Zimmerman 's wife sewed tight @-@ fitting kimonos for Katsura , slit up the side , which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels . Katsura was a tiny woman , weighing between 88 and 96 <unk> and standing 5 feet tall — just about the height of a standard cue stick . McGoorty later mused : " Masako was cute ! She was thirty @-@ nine years old but she looked twenty @-@ nine . She hopped around that table on her high heels , giving the fans a little smile , and everybody loved her . " 
 It was Katsura 's playing ability , though , rather than her other charms , that made her a phenomenon . When Cochran returned from his tour with Katsura he told McGoorty , who was a world class player in his own right , " you will have trouble with her . " When they finally got a chance to play , the match drew crowds . " They could have sold seats in the toilet ! " McGoorty exclaimed . After the match , McGoorty confirmed Cochran 's prediction : 
 I had trouble with her . I played hard and I threw her all the dirtiest stuff I knew , and I was lucky to win five out of the ten games . If you had the slightest idea of easing up on her because she was only a cute little girl , you were dead . She would murder you . I found out damn quick you could not leave her an open shot . If you did she would take those balls away from you and stick them right up your <unk> . The killer instinct — that broad had it , and never mind the little smile . 
 A number of pre @-@ booked stops on the tour suffered from lack of attendance . Cochran was very bitter about it . NEA sports editor , Harry Grayson indicated that the game was in general decline , and said that Cochran " traces the decline of championship and exhibition billiards to manufacturers taking the stars off the payroll during the depression . " In a previous exhibition tour by Cochran and Hoppe in 1945 , they had sold out in 13 cities . Despite some lackluster stops , upon her return to California , Katsura continued to play exhibition matches with the game 's greats . Katsura and Kilgore put on a week @-@ long exhibition in San Francisco in January 1953 , where they <unk> back and forth . On January 12 , Katsura beat Kilgore in their first match with runs of seven and ten , but lost to him in their second . The total points scored by the two at that time was 349 for Katsura to Kilgore 's 379 . 
 Katsura started another exhibition series with Cochran at his club in February 1953 and , tuning up for the 1953 world tournament , to start on March 26 , went on a nationwide tour with Willie Hoppe in the latter part of February 1953 . The 30 @-@ day tour of the northeastern U.S. included Chicago , Boston and other locations . Her husband accompanied her to provide translation . In their multiple @-@ day exhibition match in Chicago , it was reported in the midst that Katsura had unsurprisingly won only one out of four matches against Hoppe , often pegged as the greatest player of all time .

 With Hoppe retired as of 1952 , there was excitement over who would take the 1953 world three @-@ cushion crown , to be held in Chicago at the Chicago Town Club in the Sheraton Hotel . Eleven competitors were slated to play , many repeats of the prior year , including Chamaco , Katsura , Matsuyama , Bozeman , Kilgore , Procita and Rubin . New to the field were Harold Worst of Grand Rapids , Hollywood 's John Fitzpatrick , Mel Lundberg of Minneapolis and Ezequiel Navarra of Argentina . Navarra was considered the favorite by experts , having won championships that year in Cuba , Colombia , Peru and Argentina and having just come off an exhibition tour with Cochran in which Navarra averaged a formidable 1 @.@ 16 , scoring 1 @,@ 295 three @-@ cushions in 1 @,@ 120 innings over the length of the tour . 
 In Katsura 's first match she defeated Lundberg 50 – 44 , in 71 innings . Thereafter she : lost to Matsuyama 50 to 37 in 39 innings ; lost to Rubin , 50 – 37 , in 52 innings ; beat Fitzpatrick 50 – 38 in 50 innings , undefeated to that point ; beat Chamaco 50 to 44 , in 56 innings with a high run of eight ; upset favorite Navarra 50 to 40 in 43 innings ; followed by a loss to Kilgore , 50 to 41 , in 42 innings ; and a loss to Harold Worst 50 to 42 , in 52 innings ; but then defeated Bozeman 50 – 48 in 60 innings in her last match . When the dust had settled , Katsura shared fifth place with Matsuyama , each having won and lost five matches . The winner of the world crown was Kilgore with an eight @-@ win , two @-@ loss record . Navarra and Bozeman tied for second . 
 = = = Exhibitions and death of Matsuyama = = = 
 After the 1953 championship wrapped up , Katsura and Matsuyama gave an exhibition together in Long Beach , California ( advertisement at right ) . The format was 100 points at balkline , followed by a race to 40 at three @-@ cushion and then a trick shot exhibition . Katsura crushed her teacher , 100 – 11 and 100 – 3 at balkline , but Matsuyama won both the three @-@ cushion matches , 40 – 34 and 40 – 39 . This was Katsura and Matsuyama 's last close interaction . After returning to Japan , Matsuyama suffered a heart attack and died on December 20 , 1953 . He had had plans to move to Honolulu with his family , become an American citizen , and purchase a billiard parlor . His eldest son , Hideo , 18 , was attending a San Francisco high school at the time . He was said to have taught all of Japan 's top players , among which Katsura was the star pupil . 
 Next , Katsura played a five @-@ day , 600 point three @-@ cushion exhibition series with Ray Kilgore in San Francisco , March 12 – 17 , 1953 . At the end Kilgore was the winner with a final score of 600 to 547 . Kilgore said : " She played really remarkable billiards and I played a little over my head . " The next week Katsura faced Kilgore again in another exhibition at Welker Cochran 's room , beating him 50 – 33 in 45 innings .

 The 1954 World Three @-@ Cushion tournament was held in Buenos Aires with only 8 contestants : Katsura ; Ray Miller of Jackson , Michigan ; Harold Worst ; Argentinian brothers Juan and Ezequiel Navarra ; Welker Cochran , who had come out of retirement ; Chamaco ; and defending champion , Kilgore . As usual , Katsura was the sole female contestant . 
 In her first round she was victorious over Miller , 60 – 47 in 76 innings , then beat Chamaco 60 – 55 , but followed with a loss to Ezequiel Navarra 60 – 28 in 48 innings . Katsura then beat his brother , Juan Navarra , 60 – 52 in 77 innings in her last match to take fourth place overall . On the last day Harold Worst and Ezequiel Navarra ended in a tie with a playoff to be held initially to 60 points , later raised to a 350 point format , at which Worst ultimately prevailed on October 25 , 1954 .

 Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years . She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958 but had been in " virtual retirement " for about five years . During this break the second of Katsura 's two billiards instruction books came out in Japan : <unk> ( 1956 ) ( " Improve Your Billiards " ) . An earlier primer , <unk> ( " Introduction to Billiards " ) , was published in 1952 . In 1959 it was announced that Katsura and Harold Worst would compete in a one week exhibition match to 1 @,@ 200 points , beginning February 9 at Randolph Recreations in Chicago . Worst and Katsura moved their show to Philadelphia next where they played six matches at three @-@ cushion billiards to 50 points , and thereafter went to exhibit in New York .

 On March 1 , 1959 , Katsura appeared on CBS ' popular primetime television show , What 's My Line ? The show was in the format of a guessing game , in which a panel attempted to determine the line ( occupation ) , or in the case of a famous " mystery guest " , the identity of the contestant . After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board , show officials listed Katsura 's occupation for the audience as " Professional Billiard Player ( World 's Women 's Champion ) " . <unk> Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura 's occupation , though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture . Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC 's You Asked For It , going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue . She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25 , 1960 broadcast , this time operating in her bailiwick , demonstrating trick shots for the camera .

 By 1961 and for a few years prior , there was no longer an organized world three @-@ cushion championship . Accordingly , Harold Worst , the reigning champion since 1954 , issued a challenge match to Katsura to defend his title , with the match to take place March 13 – 18 of that year at the <unk> Hotel in Grand Rapids , Michigan , for a purse of $ 2 @,@ 000 . The preceding year Worst had issued a similar title @-@ defending challenge to Joe Chamaco of Mexico , which also took place in Grand Rapids at the same venue . Worst even took unsuccessful legal action to block an Argentinian three @-@ cushion tournament , billed as a " world title " event , that was scheduled to overlap the dates of his title match with Katsura . Worst defeated Katsura in six out of seven matches , with total three @-@ cushions scored between them , respectively , of 350 and 276 .

 Little was heard from Katsura for many years after the 1961 world championship . McGoorty lamented her retirement , stating various theories that he had heard bandied about in billiard circles , such as that her husband ( who died in June 1967 ) kept her from playing for various reasons . In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco . She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem . Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100 @-@ point run , " without a miss she smiled and bowed to the applauding crowd , stepping away from the spotlight , and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage . " Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister , Noriko , where she said she planned to live out her days . Katsura died in 1995 . In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura , billed as Katsura Memorial : The First Ladies Three Cushion <unk> , was held in Japan and aired on SKY PerfecTV ! 
 = Interstate 195 ( Maryland ) = 
 Interstate 195 ( I @-@ 195 ) is an Interstate highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The highway runs 4 @.@ 71 miles ( 7 @.@ 58 km ) from I @-@ 95 in Arbutus east to Baltimore / Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport ( BWI Airport ) in Linthicum . I @-@ 195 , which is also known as Metropolitan Boulevard , is the main connection between the airport terminal and highways leading to Baltimore , Washington , and Annapolis , including I @-@ 95 , MD 295 , and I @-@ 97 . The Interstate highway also has an interchange with MD 170 , which forms part of the Airport Loop that provides access to various airport @-@ related services . I @-@ 195 also links I @-@ 95 with Catonsville and the University of Maryland , Baltimore County ( UMBC ) , via a westward continuation of Metropolitan Boulevard that is part of MD 166 . 
 I @-@ 195 was constructed in three sections . The first section was a connection between MD 295 and the airport . This segment was built as Maryland Route 46 and completed in 1951 shortly after the opening of the airport , which was originally named Friendship International Airport . The second segment was completed at the opposite end of the highway in the mid @-@ 1970s , connecting U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) and I @-@ 95 with MD 166 and UMBC . The first two segments were connected when the portion between MD 295 and US 1 was constructed in the late 1980s . The whole length of the highway was completed and was marked as I @-@ 195 in 1990 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 195 begins at the western edge of its interchange with I @-@ 95 . The freeway continues west as MD 166 , which has a partial interchange for UMBC Boulevard , which leads to the UMBC campus , before ending next to a park and ride facility at Rolling Road , on which MD 166 continues north toward Catonsville . The I @-@ 95 interchange is a partial cloverleaf that has flyover ramps from northbound I @-@ 95 to westbound I @-@ 195 and from southbound I @-@ 95 to eastbound I @-@ 195 . I @-@ 195 heads southeast as a four @-@ lane freeway with a speed limit of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) across CSX 's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and meets US 1 at a four @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange . The highway crosses over I @-@ 895 ( Harbor Tunnel Thruway ) with no access and curves south on a viaduct to cross the Patapsco River , where the freeway passes from Baltimore County to Anne Arundel County , and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor , which also carries MARC 's Penn Line . I @-@ 195 parallels the railroad south to its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 ( Baltimore – Washington Parkway ) , which contains a flyover ramp from southbound MD 295 to eastbound I @-@ 195 . 
 I @-@ 195 curves southeast and passes under the BWI Trail ahead of its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 170 ( Aviation Boulevard ) , also known as the Airport Loop . The Airport Loop provides access to long @-@ term parking lots , the consolidated rental car facility , hotels , cargo and general aviation facilities , and the BWI Rail Station . The circumferential highway also provides indirect access to I @-@ 97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge . The Interstate 's speed limit drops to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) as it arrives at its eastern terminus at the entrance to BWI Airport . The eastbound roadway continues southeast into the airport proper , where it features a left exit for the hourly parking garage and then splits into two roadways for arriving and departing flights . After the two roadways — arriving flights on the lower level and departing flights on the upper level — loop between the terminal and the hourly parking garage , the roadways merge . The westbound direction of I @-@ 195 heads northwest from the airport after it issues a ramp toward long @-@ term parking and a U @-@ turn toward the terminal . 
 Like all Interstates , I @-@ 195 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length . 
 = = History = = 
 Friendship International Airport was constructed between 1947 and 1950 as the new primary airport for Baltimore . To directly connect the airport with Baltimore , an access road was planned to link the new Baltimore – Washington Expressway , later designated MD 295 , with the airport terminal . The first portion of the Friendship International Airport Access Road was completed from a full Y interchange at the expressway to an interchange with MD 170 in October 1949 and designated MD 46 . The access road was completed from MD 170 to the airport terminal in July 1951 , about the same time the expressway was completed between MD 46 and downtown Baltimore . The remainder of what is now I @-@ 195 was planned as early as 1969 , when the portion of Metropolitan Boulevard north of US 1 was placed under construction . The freeway opened from the US 1 ramps northwest through the I @-@ 95 interchange to an intersection with Sulphur Spring Road just south of the modern <unk> Road overpass in August 1974 . The freeway was extended to its present terminus at Rolling Road and the ramps to UMBC Boulevard were constructed in 1975 . Metropolitan Boulevard south of the I @-@ 95 interchange was marked as a second segment of MD 46 from when it opened . North of I @-@ 95 , the freeway was marked as a relocation of MD 166 . That segment of MD 46 was renumbered as an extension of MD 166 by 1981 . 
 The missing connection between US 1 and MD 295 resulted in a circuitous path for traffic between I @-@ 95 and BWI Airport . In 1974 , that route involved exiting I @-@ 95 at MD 100 , which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1 . Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176 , then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to the western end of MD 46 . Construction on the missing link , which by then was planned as part of I @-@ 195 , began in 1987 , when the highway 's bridges over US 1 and I @-@ 895 were constructed . The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I @-@ 895 overpass was completed , including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295 , and the intermediate section opened in June 1990 . The I @-@ 195 designation was applied to the highway 's present length at the same time , and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus . In 2002 , as part of an expansion project at the airport , several new ramps were constructed to access parking lots and facilitate an easier U @-@ turn for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal .

 = SM UB @-@ 12 = 
 SM UB @-@ 12 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. The submarine disappeared in August 1918 . 
 UB @-@ 12 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November . UB @-@ 12 was a little under 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 141 tonnes ( 125 and 139 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . UB @-@ 12 was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly . She was launched and commissioned as SM UB @-@ 12 in March 1915 . 
 UB @-@ 12 spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 22 merchant ships , about half of them British fishing vessels . The U @-@ boat was also responsible for sinking the British destroyer HMS Laforey in 1917 . By early 1917 , UB @-@ 12 had been converted into a minelayer with the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes . UB @-@ 12 disappeared after 19 August 1918 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 t ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . 
 UB @-@ 12 was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines — numbered UB @-@ 9 to UB @-@ 15 — ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . UB @-@ 12 was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November . As built , UB @-@ 12 was 27 @.@ 88 metres ( 91 ft 6 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 44 kW ) Körting 4 @-@ cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 7 @.@ 45 knots ( 13 @.@ 80 km / h ; 8 @.@ 57 mph ) , surfaced , and 6 @.@ 24 knots ( 11 @.@ 56 km / h ; 7 @.@ 18 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 12 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 12 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB @-@ 12 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . 
 After work on UB @-@ 12 was complete at the Weser yard , she was readied for rail shipment . The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars . In February 1915 , the sections of UB @-@ 12 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three @-@ week process . After UB @-@ 12 was assembled and launched on 2 March , she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials . 
 = = Early career = = 
 The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB @-@ 12 on 29 March 1915 under the command of Kapitänleutnant ( Kapt . ) Hans Nieland , a 29 @-@ year @-@ old first @-@ time U @-@ boat commander . On 18 April , UB @-@ 12 joined the Flanders Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote des Marinekorps U @-@ Flotille Flandern ) , which had been organized on 29 March . When UB @-@ 12 joined the flotilla , Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive , begun in February . During this campaign , enemy vessels in the German @-@ defined war zone ( German : Kriegsgebiet ) , which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom , were to be sunk . Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag . 
 On 24 July , Nieland and UB @-@ 12 sank four British fishing vessels while patrolling between 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Lowestoft . All four of the sunken ships were smacks — sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails — which were stopped , boarded by crewmen from UB @-@ 12 , and sunk with explosives . UB @-@ 12 similarly sank a pair of smacks off Lowestoft on 4 August , and another trio from 23 to 25 August . 
 On 21 November , Nieland was succeeded by Oberleutnant zur See ( Oblt . ) Wilhelm Kiel in command of UB @-@ 12 . Under Kiel 's command , UB @-@ 12 sank three ships on 21 February 1916 : the 100 @-@ ton Belgian fishing ship La Petite Henriette , the largest sunk to @-@ date by UB @-@ 12 , and another pair of British smacks , Oleander and W.E. Brown . 
 UB @-@ 12 sank her largest ship , Silksworth Hall of 4 @,@ 777 gross register tons ( GRT ) , on 10 April . The British @-@ registered ship was en route from Hull to Philadelphia in ballast when Kiel torpedoed her without warning a little more than one nautical mile ( two kilometers ) from the <unk> Lightvessel . Other ships picked up 31 survivors from Silksworth Hall , but 3 men were lost . Later in the month , Admiral Reinhardt Scheer , the newest commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the High Seas Fleet , called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return , and all boats in port to remain there . 
 = = Grand Fleet ambush attempts = = 
 In mid @-@ May , Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet . The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland , luring the British fleet across " ' nests ' of submarines and mine @-@ fields " . In support of the operation , UB @-@ 12 and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30 / 31 May to form a line 18 nautical miles ( 33 km ; 21 mi ) east of Lowestoft . This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich , should they sortie north to join the battle . Unfortunately for the Germans , the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which , coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping , aroused British suspicions . 
 A delayed departure of the German High Seas Fleet for its sortie ( which had been redirected to the Skagerrak ) and the failure of several of the U @-@ boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer 's anticipated ambush to be a " complete and disappointing failure " . In UB @-@ 12 's group , only UB @-@ 10 sighted the Harwich forces , and they were too far away to mount an attack . The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland , which took place 31 May – 1 June . 
 Kapitänleutnant Georg Gerth took command of UB @-@ 12 on 26 June , after Oblt . Kiel was assigned to command the new minelaying submarine UC @-@ 18 . Two months later , Admiral Scheer set up another ambush for the British fleet with plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland ( as had been the original intention in May ) . The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning . As in May , UB @-@ 12 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces . As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla , UB @-@ 12 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August . Once again , British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush , causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16 : 00 on 18 August , five hours before the German fleet sailed . Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland , and then to eventually call off the whole operation . Although U @-@ boats to the north sank two British light cruisers , UB @-@ 12 and her group played no part in the action . 
 In September , Gerth led UB @-@ 12 in sinking two more ships and capturing a third ship as a prize . The 313 @-@ ton Norwegian steamer <unk> was sunk on 6 September , while the 55 @-@ ton Marjorie was sunk on the 28th . In between the Dutch ship Niobe was seized as a prize on the 7th . 
 = = Conversion to minelayer = = 
 UB @-@ 12 and three sister boats — UB @-@ 10 , UB @-@ 16 , and UB @-@ 17 — were all converted to minelaying submarines . UB @-@ 12 was at the dockyard from November 1916 to January 1917 , and it is likely the boat was converted during this timeframe . The conversion involved removing the bow section containing the pair of torpedo tubes from each U @-@ boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each . In the process , the boats were lengthened to 105 feet ( 32 m ) , and the displacement increased to 147 t ( 145 long tons ) on the surface , and 161 t ( 158 long tons ) below the surface . 
 During this same time , Kapt . Gerth was transferred to SM UC @-@ 61 , and replaced on UB @-@ 12 by Oblt . Friedrich Moecke in early November . Moecke was , in turn , replaced by Oblt . Ernst Steindorff in January 1917 . 
 By March , the newly converted submarine had begun laying mines off the French coast . The French Navy trawler Elisabeth struck one of UB @-@ 12 's mines off Calais on 13 March and sank . Five days later , the British auxiliary minesweeper Duchess of Montrose sank with a loss of 12 men after detonating a mine laid by UB @-@ 12 off Gravelines . On 23 March , HMS Laforey , a destroyer with the Dover Patrol , struck one of UB @-@ 12 's mines off Cape Gris @-@ Nez and went down with the loss of 59 men . 
 In May , UB @-@ 12 was on a patrol with UB @-@ 39 in the English Channel . On the night of 14 / 15 May while UB @-@ 12 was on the surface , Steindorff noted a large underwater explosion some miles away in a British minefield , and when UB @-@ 39 failed to return to Zeebrugge , one of the bases for the Flanders Flotilla , reported what was likely the demise of UB @-@ 39 at the hands of a British mine . 
 April found two more victims added to UB @-@ 12 's tally . On the 20th , <unk> , another British auxiliary minesweeper was lost on one of UB @-@ 12 's mines near the Dyck Lightvessel . Six days later , the British steamer <unk> was mined while loaded with pit props destined for Dunkirk . The 1 @,@ 744 @-@ ton cargo ship was the largest ship sunk by UB @-@ 12 since the Silksworth Hall , sunk the previous April . UB @-@ 12 sank another two ships under Steindorff 's command , one each in June and July . The steamer Dulwich — carrying coal from Seaham for London — was mined and sunk with the loss of five men on 10 June . One month later , the French patrol vessel Jupiter I was mined off Calais . These were the last two ships credited to mines from UB @-@ 12 for the next fourteen months . 
 = = Fate = = 
 UB @-@ 12 's activities over the next year are not well documented , and no specific record of her can be found in English @-@ language sources . However , it is known that during this period , she was helmed by four different commanders , with the final officer , Oblt . Ernst <unk> , assuming command in May 1918 . Under <unk> 's command , UB @-@ 12 departed Zeebrugge on 19 August to lay mines in the Downs off the Kentish coast , but never returned . According to one British source , UB @-@ 12 was herself mined off Helgoland sometime in August . Author Dwight Messimer considers this unlikely given that Helgoland is nowhere near the route that UB @-@ 12 could have taken to get to the Downs . A postwar German study concluded the two most likely fates for UB @-@ 12 were that she either struck a British mine or was destroyed by one of her own mines that malfunctioned during deployment . Messimer also considers it possible that UB @-@ 12 may have had a diving accident related to her conversion to a minelayer . 
 Some two months after UB @-@ 12 's presumed loss , she was credited with the sinking of her final ship . On 27 October , two weeks before the end of the war , the 92 @-@ ton British ship <unk> struck one of UB @-@ 12 's mines near the Elbow Lightvessel and sank .

 = Wulfstan ( died 1023 ) = 
 Wulfstan ( sometimes Lupus ; died 28 May 1023 ) was an English Bishop of London , Bishop of Worcester , and Archbishop of York . He should not be confused with Wulfstan I , Archbishop of York , or Wulfstan , Bishop of Worcester . He is thought to have begun his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk . He became the Bishop of London in 996 . In 1002 he was elected simultaneously to the diocese of Worcester and the archdiocese of York , holding both in plurality until 1016 , when he relinquished Worcester ; he remained archbishop of York until his death . It was perhaps while he was at London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons , or homilies , on the topic of Antichrist . In 1014 , as archbishop , he wrote his most famous work , a homily which he titled the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos , or the Sermon of the Wolf to the English . 
 Besides sermons Wulfstan was also instrumental in drafting law codes for both kings Æthelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England . He is considered one of the two major writers of the late Anglo @-@ Saxon period in England . After his death in 1023 , miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb , but attempts to have him declared a saint never bore fruit . 
 = = Life = = 
 Wulfstan 's early life is obscure , but he was certainly the uncle of one Beorhtheah , his successor at Worcester but one , and the uncle of Wulfstan of Worcester . About Wulfstan 's youth we know nothing . He probably had familial ties to the Fenlands in East Anglia , and to Peterborough specifically . Although there is no direct evidence of his ever being monastic , the nature of Wulfstan 's later episcopal career and his affinity with the Benedictine Reform argue that he had once studied and professed as a Benedictine monk , perhaps at Winchester . According to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , Wulfstan was consecrated bishop of London in 996 , succeeding <unk> . Besides the notice in the Chronicle , the first record of his name is in a collection of nine Latin penitential letters collected by him , three of which were issued by him as bishop of London , and one by him as " Archbishop of the English " . The other five letters in the collection ( only one of which is addressed to Wulfstan , as archbishop ) were issued by Pope Gregory V and by a Pope John ( either Pope John XVII or Pope John XVIII ) . In the letters issued by Wulfstan as bishop of London he styles himself " Lupus episcopus " , meaning " the bishop Wolf " . " Lupus " is the Latin form of the first element of his Old English name , which means " wolf @-@ stone " . 
 In 1002 Wulfstan was elected Archbishop of York and was immediately translated to that see . Holding York also brought him control over the diocese of Worcester , as at that time it was practice in England to hold " the potentially disaffected northern archbishopric in plurality with a southern see . " He held both Worcester and York until 1016 , resigning Worcester to <unk> while retaining York . There is evidence , however , that he retained influence over Worcester even after this time , and that <unk> perhaps acted " only as a suffragan to Wulfstan . " Although holding two or more episcopal sees in plurality was both uncanonical and against the spirit of the Benedictine Reform , Wulfstan had inherited this practice from previous archbishops of York , and he was not the last to hold York and Worcester in plurality . 
 Wulfstan must have early on garnered the favour of powerful men , particularly Æthelred king of England , for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred 's reign from 1005 to 1016 . There is no doubt that Wulfstan had a penchant for law ; his knowledge of previous Anglo @-@ Saxon law ( both royal and ecclesiastical ) , as well as ninth @-@ century Carolingian law , was considerable . This surely made him a suitable choice for the king 's legal draftsman . But it is also likely that Wulfstan 's position as archbishop of York , an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom , made him not only a very influential man in the North , but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South . It is indicative of Wulfstan 's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for , and perhaps advisor to , the Danish king Cnut , who took England 's West Saxon throne in 1016 . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Wulfstan was one of the most distinguished and effective Old English prose writers . His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres , including homilies ( or sermons ) , secular laws , religious canons , and political theory . With Ælfric of Eynsham , he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh @-@ century England , a period which , ecclesiastically anyway , was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform . The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy , a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries . The Reform promoted a regular ( i.e. based on a <unk> , or rule ) life for priests and clerics , a strict church hierarchy , the primacy of the Roman see , the authority of codified or canonical church law , and stressed the importance of catholic , that is universal , church practices throughout all Christendom . These ideas could only thrive in a social and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy 's and the laity 's obedience to the authority of the church on all things spiritual , and also on many things secular and juridical . This was one of the main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan 's legal and quasi @-@ legal writings . But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that , in order for this Reform model to thrive in England , the English clergy and laity ( especially the laity ) needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith . Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen 's steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices , like , for example , knowledge of Christ 's life and passion , memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles ' Creed , proper baptism , and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass . It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices , that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity . 
 In a series of homilies begun during his tenure as Bishop of London , Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose , working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings . He used intensifying words , distinctive vocabulary and compounds , rhetorical figures , and repeated phrases as literary devices . These devices lend Wulfstan 's homilies their tempo @-@ driven , almost feverish , quality , allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes . An example from one of his earliest sermons , titled Secundum <unk> , describes with vivid rhetorical force the <unk> of Hell ( notice the alliteration , parallelism , and rhyme ) : 
 Wa þam <unk> þe <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , & <unk> is <unk> <unk> ; þær is <unk> & <unk> & aa <unk> <unk> ; þær is <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> <unk> <unk> . Wa þam þe þær <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> him <unk> þæt he man <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> he <unk> . 
 " Woe then to him who has earned for himself the torments of Hell . There there is everlasting fire roiling painfully , and there there is everlasting filth . There there is groaning and moaning and always constant wailing . There there is every kind of misery , and the press of every kind of devil . Woe to him who dwells in torment : better it were for him that he were never born , than that he become thus . " 
 This type of heavy @-@ handed , though effective , rhetoric immediately made Wulfstan 's homilies popular tools for use at the pulpit . 
 There is good evidence that Wulfstan 's homiletic style was appreciated by his contemporaries . While yet bishop of London , in 1002 he received an anonymous letter in Latin praising his style and eloquence . In this letter , an unknown contemporary refuses to do a bit of translation for Wulfstan because he fears he could never properly imitate the Bishop 's style The Chronicle of Ely said of his preaching that " when he spoke , it was as if his listeners were hearing the very wisdom of God Himself . " Though they were rhetorically ornate , Wulfstan 's homilies show a conscious effort to avoid the intellectual conceits presumably favoured by educated ( i.e. monastic ) audiences ; his target audience was the common English Christian , and his message was suited to everyone who wished to flock to the cathedral to hear it . Wulfstan refused to include in his works confusing or philosophical concepts , speculation , or long narratives – devices which other homilies of the time regularly employed ( likely to the dismay of the average parishioner ) . He also rarely used Latin phrases or words , though a few of his homilies do survive in Latin form , versions that were either drafts for later English homilies , or else meant to be addressed to a learned clergy . Even so , even his Latin sermons employ a straightforward approach to sermonising . Wulfstan 's homilies are concerned only with the " bare bones , but these he invests with a sense of urgency of moral or legal <unk> in a time of great danger " . 
 The canon of Wulfstan 's homiletic works is somewhat ambiguous , as it is often difficult to tell if a homily in his style was actually written by Wulfstan , or is merely the work of someone who had appreciated <unk> style and imitated it . However , throughout his episcopal career , he is believed to have written upwards of 30 sermons in Old English . The number of his Latin sermons has not yet been established . He may also have been responsible , wholly or in part , for other extant anonymous Old English sermons , for his style can be detected in a range of homiletic texts which cannot be directly attributed to him . However , as mentioned , some scholars believe that Wulfstan 's powerful rhetorical style produced imitators , whose homilies would now be difficult to distinguish from genuine <unk> homilies . Those homilies which are certainly by Wulfstan can be divided into ' blocks ' , that is by subject and theme , and in this way it can be seen that at different points in his life Wulfstan was concerned with different aspects of Christian life in England . The first ' block ' was written ca . 996 – 1002 and is concerned with eschatology , that is , the end of the world . These homilies give frequent descriptions of the coming of Antichrist and the evils that will befall the world before Christ 's Second Coming . They likely play on the anxiety that surely developed as the end of the first millennium AD approached . The second ' block ' , written around 1002 – 1008 , is concerned with the tenets of the Christian faith . The third ' block ' , written around 1008 – 1020 , concerns archiepiscopal functions . The fourth and final ' block ' , written around 1014 – 1023 , known as the " Evil Days " ' block ' , concerns the evils that befall a kingdom and people who do not live proper Christian lives . This final block contains his most famous homily , the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos , where Wulfstan rails against the deplorable customs of his time , and sees recent Viking invasions as God 's punishment of the English for their lax ways . About 1008 ( and again in a revision about 1016 ) he wrote a lengthy work which , although not strictly homiletic , summarises many of the favourite points he had hitherto expounded upon in his homilies . Titled by modern editors as the Institutes of Polity , it is a piece of ' estates literature ' which details , from the perspective of a Christian polity , the duties of each member of society , beginning with the top ( the king ) and ending at the bottom ( common folk ) . 
 = = Language = = 
 Wulfstan was a native speaker of Old English . He was also a competent <unk> . As York was at the centre of a region of England that had for some time been colonised by people of Scandinavian descent , it is possible that Wulfstan was familiar with , or perhaps even bilingual in , Old Norse . He may have helped incorporate Scandinavian vocabulary into Old English . Dorothy Whitelock remarks that " the influence of his sojourns in the north is seen in his terminology . While in general he writes a variety of late West Saxon literary language , he uses in some texts words of Scandinavian origin , especially in speaking of the various social classes . " In some cases , Wulfstan is the only one known to have used a word in Old English , and in some cases such words are of Scandinavian origin . Some words of his that have been recognised as particularly Scandinavian are : 
 <unk> " slave , servant " ( cf . Old Norse <unk> ; cp . Old English <unk> ) bonda " husband , householder " ( cf . Old Norse bondi ; cp . Old English ceorl ) eorl " nobleman of high rank , ( Danish ) jarl " ( cf . Old Norse jarl ; cp . Old English ealdorman ) <unk> " to make someone ready , to put someone to flight " ( cf . Old Norse <unk> ) <unk> " close <unk> " ( cf . Old Norse <unk> ) <unk> " law " ( cf . Old Norse lag ; cp . Old English <unk> ) 
 Some Old English words which appear only in works under his influence are : 
 <unk> " were @-@ wolf " <unk> " incest " <unk> " light @-@ scot " ( a tithe to churches for candles ) <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 = = Church reform and royal service = = 
 Wulfstan was very involved in the reform of the English church , and was concerned with improving both the quality of Christian faith and the quality of ecclesiastical administration in his dioceses ( especially York , a relatively impoverished diocese at this time ) . Towards the end of his episcopate in York , he established a small monastery in Gloucester , which had to be re @-@ established in 1058 after being burned . In addition to his religious and literary career , Wulfstan enjoyed a lengthy and fruitful career as one of England 's foremost statesmen . Under both Æthelred II and Cnut , Wulfstan was primarily responsible for the drafting of English law codes relating to both secular and ecclesiastical affairs , and seems to have held a prominent and influential position at court . He drew up the laws that Æthelred issued at <unk> in 1008 , which dealt with the cult of St Edward the Martyr , the raising and equipping of ships and ship 's crews , the payment of tithes , and a ban on the export of ( Christian ) slaves from the kingdom . Pushing for religious , social , political , and moral reforms , Wulfstan " wrote legislation to reassert the laws of earlier Anglo @-@ Saxon kings and bring order to a country that had been unsettled by war and influx of Scandinavians . " 
 In 1009 Wulfstan wrote the edict that Æthelred II issued calling for the whole nation to fast and pray for three days during Thorkell 's raids on England , in a national act of penance . Only water and bread were to be eaten , people should walk to church barefoot , a payment of one penny from each hide of land was to be made , and everyone should attend Mass every day of the three days . Anyone not participating would be fined or flogged . After Cnut conquered England , Wulfstan quickly became an advisor to the new king , as evidenced by Wulfstan 's influence on the law code issued by Cnut . After the death of Lyfing , Archbishop of Canterbury in 1020 , Wulfstan consecrated his successor Æthelnoth in 1020 , and wrote to Cnut asking the king to grant the same rights and dignities for the new archbishop that previous archbishops had held . Wulfstan also wrote the laws that were issued by Cnut at Winchester in 1021 or 1022 . These laws continued in force throughout the 11th century , as they were the laws referred to in Domesday Book as " the law of King Edward " . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Wulfstan died at York on 28 May 1023 . His body was taken for burial to the monastery of Ely , in accordance with his wishes . Miracles are ascribed to his tomb by the Liber Eliensis , but it does not appear that any attempt to declare him a saint was made beyond this . The historian Denis Bethell called him the " most important figure in the English Church in the reigns of Æthelred II and Cnut . 
 Wulfstan 's writings influenced a number of writers in late Old English literature . There are echoes of Wulfstan 's writings in the 1087 entry of the Peterborough Chronicle , a version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle written at Peterborough Abbey . This entry has long been famous as it deals with the death of King William the Conqueror , and contrasts his worldly power with his status after death . Other suggestions of Wulfstan 's writing occur in works of Old English including the Soul 's Address to the Body . His law codes , which were written under Æthelred and Cnut , remained in effect through the reign of King Edward the Confessor , and were still being reaffirmed in 1100 , when King Henry I of England swore a coronation oath to observe the laws of King Edward . 
 The unique 11th century manuscript of the Early English Apollonius of Tyre may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Wulfstan 's homilies . 
 = = Works = = 
 Wulfstan wrote some works in Latin , and numerous works in Old English , then the vernacular . He has also been credited with a few short poems . His works can generally be divided into homiletic , legal , and philosophical categories . 
 Wulfstan 's best @-@ known homily is Sermo Lupi ad Anglos , or Sermon of the Wolf to the English . In it he proclaims the depredations of the " Danes " ( who were , at that point , primarily Norwegian invaders ) a scourge from God to lash the English for their sins . He calls upon them to repent of their sinful ways and " return to the faith of baptism , where there is protection from the fires of hell . " He also wrote many homilies relating to the Last Days and the coming of the Antichrist . Age of the Antichrist was a popular theme in Wulfstan 's homilies , which also include the issues of death and Judgment Day . Six homilies that illustrate this theme include : Secundum <unk> , Secundum <unk> , De <unk> , De <unk> Antichrist , Secundum Marcum and " De <unk> <unk> " . De <unk> was the " first full development of the Antichrist theme " , and Wulfstan addressed it to the clergy . Believing that he lived at the time right before the Antichrist was to come , he felt compelled to diligently warn and teach the clergy to withstand the dishonest teaching of the enemies of God . These six homilies also include : emphasis that the hour of the Antichrist is very near , warnings that the English should be aware of false Christs who will attempt to seduce men , warnings that God will pass judgement on man 's faithfulness , discussion of man 's sins , evils of the world , and encouragement to love God and do his will . He wrote the Canons of Edgar and The Law of Edward and Guthrum which date before 1008 . The Canons was written to instruct the secular clergy serving a parish in the responsibilities of their position . The Law of Edward and Guthrum , on the other hand , is an ecclesiastical law handbook . Modern editors have paid most attention to his homilies : they have been edited by Arthur Napier , by Dorothy Whitelock , and by Dorothy Bethurum . Since that publication , other works that were likely authored by Wulfstan have been identified ; a forthcoming edition by Andy Orchard will update the canon of Wulfstan 's homilies . Wulfstan was also a book collector ; he is responsible for amassing a large collection of texts pertaining to canon law , the liturgy , and episcopal functions . This collection is known as <unk> 's Commonplace Book . A significant part of the Commonplace book consists of a work once known as the <unk> pseudo @-@ <unk> , though it has most recently been edited as Wulfstan 's Canon Law Collection ( a.k.a. Collectio canonum Wigorniensis ) . This work is a collection of conciliar decrees and church canons , most of which he culled from numerous ninth and tenth @-@ century Carolingian works . This work demonstrates the wide range of Wulfstan 's reading and studies . He sometimes borrowed from this collection when he wrote his later works , especially the law codes of Æthelred . There are also a number of works which are associated with the archbishop , but whose authorship is unknown , such as the Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor . 
 = = Style = = 
 Wulfstan ’ s style is highly admired by many sources , easily recognisable and exceptionally distinguished . “ Much Wulfstan material is , more @-@ over , attributed largely or even solely on the basis of his highly idiosyncratic prose style , in which strings of syntactically independent two @-@ stress phrases are linked by complex patterns of alliteration and other kinds of sound play . Indeed , so idiosyncratic is Wulfstan ’ s style that he is even ready to rewrite minutely works prepared for him by <unk> ” ( Blackwell , 495 ) . From this identifiable style , 26 sermons can be attributed to Wulfstan , 22 of which are written in Old English , the others in Latin . However , it ’ s suspected that many anonymous materials are Wulfstan ’ s as well , and his handwriting has been found in many manuscripts , supplementing or correcting material ( 495 ) . He wrote more than just sermons , including law @-@ codes and sections of prose . 
 Certainly he must have been a very talented writer , gaining a reputation of eloquence while he still lived in London ( Bethurum , 58 ) . In a letter to him , “ the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop ’ s skill ” ( 58 ) . Similarly , “ [ o ] ne early student of Wulfstan , <unk> , and his latest editor , Jost , agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose ” ( <unk> , 229 ) . This suggests Wulfstan ’ s writing is not only eloquent , but poetic , and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm ( 229 ) . Taking a look at Wulfstan ’ s actual manuscripts , presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile , it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well @-@ structured – even his notes in the margins are well @-@ organised and tidy , and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable . 
 = Norse funeral = 
 Norse funerals , or the burial customs of Viking Age North Germanic Norsemen ( early medieval Scandinavians ) , are known both from archaeology and from historical accounts such as the Icelandic sagas , Old Norse poetry , and notably from the account of Ahmad ibn Fadlan . 
 Throughout Scandinavia , there are many remaining tumuli in honour of Viking kings and chieftains , in addition to runestones and other memorials . Some of the most notable of them are at the Borre mound cemetery , in Norway , at Birka in Sweden and Lindholm Høje , and Jelling in Denmark . 
 A prominent tradition is that of the ship burial , where the deceased was laid in a boat , or a stone ship , and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession , sometimes including sacrificed slaves . Afterwards , piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains in order to create a tumulus . 
 = = Grave goods = = 
 It was common to leave gifts with the deceased . Both men and women received grave goods , even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre . A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall , who were buried alive with the person , or in a funeral pyre . The amount and the value of the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from . It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life , and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally . 
 The usual grave for a thrall was probably not much more than a hole in the ground . He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died . Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life . A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding . An artisan , such as a blacksmith , could receive his entire set of tools . Women were provided with their jewellery and often with tools for female and household activities . The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg ship burial , which was for a woman ( probably a queen or a priestess ) who lived in the 9th century . 
 = = Funerary monuments = = 
 A Viking funeral could be a considerable expense , but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted . In addition to being a homage to the deceased , the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants . Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields . The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the <unk> dynasty , and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships . 
 Jelling , in Denmark , is the largest royal memorial from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra , and in honour of himself . It was only one of the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb , but both barrows , the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times . 
 On three locations in Scandinavia , there are large grave fields that were used by an entire community : Birka in Mälaren , Hedeby at Schleswig and Lindholm Høje at Ålborg . The graves at Lindholm Høje show a large variation in both shape and size . There are stone ships and there is a mix of graves that are triangular , quadrangular and circular . Such grave fields have been used during many generations and belong to village like settlements . 
 = = Rituals = = 
 Death has always been a critical moment for those bereaved , and consequently death is surrounded by taboo @-@ like rules . Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions , people use rites . The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation at the same time as they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives . 
 Despite the warlike customs of the Vikings , there was an element of fear surrounding death and what belonged to it . If the deceased was not buried and provided for properly , he might not find peace in the afterlife . The dead person could then visit the bereaved as a revenant or draugr . Such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted as a sign that additional family members would die . It was first and foremost in times of starvation , when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes , that rumours about revenants began to flourish . The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared . The dead person had to die anew ; a stake could be put through the corpse , or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living . 
 Other rituals involved the preparation of the corpse . Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda references a concern funeral rite involving the cutting of nails lest <unk> nails from the dead be available for the completion of the construction of Naglfar , the ship used to transport the army of jötunn at Ragnarök . 
 = = = Ibn Fadlan account = = = 
 A 10th @-@ century Arab Muslim writer named Ahmad ibn Fadlan produced a description of a funeral of a Scandinavian , probably Swedish , chieftain who was on an expedition on the eastern route . The account is a unique source on the ceremonies surrounding the Viking funeral of a chieftain . Regardless of ethnic attribution ( Norse , Slavic or else ) the source says " Rus " ( <unk> ) , and the attribution is still disputed . 
 The dead chieftain was put in a temporary grave , which was covered for ten days until they had sewn new clothes for him . One of his thrall women volunteered to join him in the afterlife and she was guarded day and night , being given a great amount of intoxicating drinks while she sang happily . When the time had arrived for cremation , they pulled his longship ashore and put it on a platform of wood , and they made a bed for the dead chieftain on the ship . Thereafter , an old woman referred to as the " Angel of Death " put cushions on the bed . She was responsible for the ritual . 
 Then they disinterred the chieftain and gave him new clothes . In his grave , he received intoxicating drinks , fruits , and a stringed instrument . The chieftain was put into his bed with all his weapons and grave offerings around him . Then they had two horses run themselves sweaty , cut them to pieces , and threw the meat into the ship . Finally , they sacrificed a hen and a cock . 
 Meanwhile , the thrall girl went from one tent to the other and had sexual intercourse with the men . Every man told her : " Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him " . In the afternoon , they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame , where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times . Every time , the girl told of what she saw . The first time , she saw her father and mother , the second time , she saw all her relatives , and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld . There , it was green and beautiful and together with him , she saw men and young boys . She saw that her master beckoned for her . By using intoxicating drinks , they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame , she would then see into the realm of the dead . The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story " Völsa þáttr , " where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld . 
 Thereafter , the thrall girl was taken away to the ship . She removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman . Thereafter she removed her finger rings and gave them to the old woman 's daughters , who had guarded her . Then they took her aboard the ship , but they did not allow her to enter the tent where the dead chieftain lay . The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang and bade her friends farewell . 
 Then the girl was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard . Six men entered the tent to have intercourse with the girl , after which they forced her onto her master 's bed . Two men grabbed her hands , and two men her wrists . The angel of death put a rope around her neck and while two men pulled the rope , the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife . Thereafter , the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame . It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead . 
 Afterwards , a round barrow was built over the ashes , and in the centre of the mound they erected a staff of birch wood , where they carved the names of the dead chieftain and his king . Then they departed in their ships .

 <unk> could be sacrificed during a funeral so they could serve their master in the next world . The sexual rites with the slave girl symbolize her role as a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain . 
 <unk> hin skamma contains several stanzas in which the Valkyrie Brynhildr gives instructions for the number of slaves to be sacrificed for the funeral of the hero Sigurd , and how their bodies were to be arranged on the pyre , as in the following stanza : 
 Occasionally in the Viking Age , a widow was sacrificed at her husband ’ s funeral . 
 = = = Cremation = = = 
 It was common to burn the corpse and the grave offerings on a pyre , in which the temperature reached 1 @,@ 400 ° C ( 2 @,@ 550 ° F ) — much higher than modern crematorium furnaces attain . Only some incinerated fragments of metal and of animal and human bones would remain . The pyre was constructed to make the pillar of smoke as massive as possible , in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife . The symbolism is described in the Ynglinga saga : 
 " Thus he ( Odin ) established by law that all dead men should be burned , and their belongings laid with them upon the pile , and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth . Thus , said he , every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile ; and he would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth . For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory , and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone ; which custom remained long after Odin 's time . " 
 = = = Funeral ale and the passing of inheritance = = = 
 On the seventh day after the person had died , people celebrated the <unk> ( the word both for the funeral ale and the feast , since it involved a ritual drinking ) . The funeral ale was a way of socially demarcating the case of death . It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance . If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead , the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority . 
 Several of the large runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance , such as the <unk> stone , which explains how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone , which tells that a girl was the sole heir after the death of all her uncles . They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper . One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs . It is dated to the 5th century and is , consequently , the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female 's right to inheritance . 
 = Kratos ( God of War ) = 
 Kratos , the " Ghost of Sparta " , is a video game character from Sony Santa Monica 's God of War series , which is loosely based on Greek mythology . Kratos first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War , which led to the development of six additional games featuring the character as the protagonist . Another installment is in development , which will take the character to Norse mythology . Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the God of War comic series and novels . The character was voiced by Terrence C. Carson from 2005 to 2013 , with Christopher Judge taking over the role in the upcoming God of War . Antony Del Rio voiced the character as a child in God of War : Ghost of Sparta . 
 In the series , Kratos embarks on a series of often forced adventures in attempts to avert disaster or to change his fate . He is usually portrayed as being oblivious to all else , often engaging in morally ambiguous activities and performing acts of extreme violence . He is a Spartan warrior who becomes the " Ghost of Sparta " after accidentally killing his family on behalf of Ares ' trickery . He becomes the God of War after killing Ares , and is eventually revealed to be a demigod and the son of Zeus , who betrays Kratos . Each adventure forms part of a saga with vengeance as a central theme , providing additional information about Kratos ' origins and his relationships with his family and the gods . 
 The God of War franchise is a flagship title for the PlayStation brand and Kratos is one of its most popular characters . The character has been well received by critics and has become a video game icon , a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters , such as Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog , and Lara Croft . The character is now associated with other products and has had various cameos in PlayStation games outside of the God of War series . 
 = = Concept and design = = 
 God of War creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a character that looked brutal , but did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero . The character would not wear traditional armor as Jaffe wanted him to be individualistic . Although the idea of using a fully masked character was approved , the concept was abandoned as the design seemed soulless and lacked a defined personality . Some models included unconventional elements , such as portraying him carrying an infant on his back , while others had excessive detail , such as hair and other " flowing things " . 
 Charlie Wen , director of visual development on God of War and God of War II , is responsible for designing Kratos . Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture , which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant , introducing the idea of the double @-@ chained blades and eventually Kratos ' iconic design . Double @-@ chained blades were chosen as Kratos ' signature weapon because they emphasized the character 's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid . Jaffe said of the final version of the character , " [ Kratos ] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint , I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head . " 
 Kratos ’ most noticeable feature is his ash @-@ white complexion , a story development which earns him the title " Ghost of Sparta . " Other distinctive features include a scar across his right eye , and a large , red tattoo that threads from his left eye , circles his left torso , and ends at his left shoulder . The tattoo was originally blue , but was changed late in production . The scar is eventually revealed to be the result of a childhood encounter with the Olympian God , Ares , while the tattoo is a tribute to his dead brother Deimos , who had similar birth markings . Other changes that occur during the course of the series include the temporary addition of divine armor when Kratos is the God of War , an abdominal scar , ability @-@ enhancing armor such as an <unk> called the Golden Fleece ( all God of War II ) , and the Boots of Hermes ( God of War III ) . According to an early God of War script , the character is 6 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) to 6 feet 7 inches ( 2 @.@ 01 m ) . 
 Kratos ' appearance can be altered in bonus play ; completing the game at certain levels of difficulty and in challenge modes will unlock bonus costumes . Several costumes were available exclusively via pre @-@ order and other promotions ( e.g. God of War III , which features three costumes based on early sketches of the character ) from the PlayStation Store . Although many bonus costumes are consistent with story themes , others are humorous or farcical — such as the female costume " Athena " and the " Spud of War " . 26 bonus costumes are available for use throughout the series and two are available in two games respectively ( " God of War Armor " in God of War II and Ghost of Sparta , and " Deimos " in Ghost of Sparta and God of War III ) .

 = = = Backstory and comics ( past ) = = = 
 Throughout the series , Kratos is portrayed as an antihero , often performing questionable actions . Although backstory is seen in the original God of War , Kratos ' childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series . In Ghost of Sparta , it is revealed that an oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans — imprisoned after the Great War — but rather by a mortal , a marked warrior . The Olympians Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos , Kratos ' younger brother , who had strange birthmarks . Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos . Kratos attempted to stop Ares , but Ares swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye . Taken to Death 's Domain , Deimos was imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death , Thanatos . Believing Deimos to be dead , Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo , identical to his brother 's birthmark , to honor his sibling . 
 Through flashbacks in the comic series written by Marv Wolfman , Kratos meets his wife Lysandra and they have a daughter named Calliope . Upon birth , Calliope was stricken with the plague . In order to save his daughter , Kratos was granted a quest to find the Ambrosia of Asclepius , an elixir with magical healing properties . Five of the gods entered into a wager with Ares : each chose a champion to search for the Ambrosia with Ares ' champion being Kratos . Kratos overcame all obstacles , including , among others , Hades ' champion the Barbarian Prince Alrik , who eventually became the Barbarian King , and saved his daughter . 
 Via flashbacks in God of War , it is revealed that Kratos became the youngest captain of Sparta 's army ( also shown in the comics ) , but had a thirst for power . When Kratos was faced with total defeat at the hands of a barbarian horde led by the Barbarian King , the Spartan called to the Olympian god Ares for aid . Kratos was given the Blades of Chaos , destroyed his enemies , and blindly followed Ares , killing hundreds in his name . After Ares tricked Kratos into murdering his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope in a temple dedicated to Athena , the Spartan was shocked out of his bloodlust and renounced service to Ares . As the temple burned , a village oracle cursed Kratos and condemned him to wear the " mark of his terrible deed " ; the ashes of his family , which turn his skin white , earning him the title " Ghost of Sparta " . 
 = = = Ascension , Chains of Olympus , and God of War = = = 
 In Ascension , it is revealed that because Kratos renounced Ares , it broke his blood oath to the god and as such , Kratos was imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies . He was helped by the oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies . In order to completely be free of Ares ' oath , Kratos was forced to kill Orkos , who begged Kratos to do so . Although free of his oath to the god , he was flooded with memories of killing his family . He then vowed to serve the other gods in order to receive forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds , but he was openly defiant . 
 In Chains of Olympus , Kratos is reluctant to help the gods when Helios was kidnapped , and openly abandoned them when Persephone offered him a chance to be reunited with his daughter . Kratos , however , was forced to reverse his decision when Persephone used the Titan Atlas in a bid to destroy the world and in turn , the spirit of Calliope . Knowing that while intervention would save Calliope , it would separate him from his family forever , a bitter Kratos killed Persephone , imprisoned Atlas , and freed Helios . 
 By the time of God of War , Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares . When he confronted his patron Athena , she advised him that if he killed the rampaging Ares , the gods would forgive his sins . With this selfish motive , he again agreed , and after finding and using Pandora 's Box , he was successful . Despite being freed of Ares ' influence , including the Blades of Chaos , Kratos was forgiven , but was not relieved of his nightmares . A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide , but was saved by Athena , who guided him to Olympus . Awarded the Blades of Athena , Kratos became the new God of War .

 The comic series also shows Kratos ' present search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius . This time , he plans to destroy the Ambrosia to prevent the worshipers of Ares from resurrecting their former master . In this quest , Kratos overcame several enemies , including the Chaos Giant Gyges , before destroying the Ambrosia . Still haunted by the visions of his mortal past in Ghost of Sparta , and against the advice of Athena , Kratos embarked on a quest to find his mother , Callisto , in the city of Atlantis . Callisto attempted to reveal the identity of Kratos ' father before being transformed against her will into a beast that Kratos was forced to kill . Before dying , Callisto advised Kratos to search for his brother Deimos in Sparta . Kratos first freed the Titan Thera from imprisonment , which caused the destruction of Atlantis . In Sparta , Kratos learned of Deimos ' location : the Domain of Death . He found and freed Deimos , who remained hostile toward his brother . After a skirmish between the siblings , Thanatos attacked Deimos , but after being rescued by Kratos , the pair joined forces to battle their foe . Although Thanatos killed Deimos , the god was in turn killed by Kratos . Kratos then returned to Olympus , enraged at the gods . In Betrayal , Kratos had been shunned by the other gods and decided to lead his Spartan army to overrun Greece . He was falsely accused of murdering Argos , and he killed Ceryx , the son of Hermes , for interfering in his search for the true assassin , who escaped .

 Kratos then joined the Spartan army in Rhodes , intent on destruction . Zeus , however , weakened Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus , which Zeus used to kill Kratos . Although he overcame all obstacles , Kratos was stunned at Zeus ' betrayal and swore revenge as he died . Kratos fell into the Underworld , but was rescued by the Titan Gaia . Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War , Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus . Kratos , fueled by anger at his betrayal , agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate , who are capable of returning him to the moment of Zeus ' treachery . Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless — in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan , killed several Greek heroes without hesitation , and deliberately sacrificed two scholars . All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos , who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation . Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him ; only then does Kratos show remorse . He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is in fact his father , a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father , Cronos . Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus . Encouraged by Gaia , Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War , and with their assistance , stormed Mount Olympus .

 Although Kratos killed Poseidon , he was abandoned by Gaia when his first encounter with Zeus went poorly . Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans , Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena , who also provided the Blades of Exile , that he needed to find the Flame of Olympus , which is the key to defeating Zeus . Kratos murdered both Titans and gods , ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame . Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora 's Box ( engulfed by the Flame ) is Pandora herself , Kratos came to care for Pandora , who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope . Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame , but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option . Finding the box empty , and driven berserk by Zeus ' mockery , Kratos attacked his father . Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus , she was destroyed by Kratos , who then apparently defeated Zeus . Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos , who retreated into his psyche . Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra . Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him . Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus . Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope ; the contents of Pandora 's Box . In a selfless act , Kratos refused , stated his need for vengeance was gone , and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus , which dispersed the power across the world for mankind 's use . Athena , disappointed with Kratos , removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus . The post @-@ credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos ' whereabouts unknown .

 Many years after the events of God of War III , Kratos has ended up in the world of Norse mythology . He now has a son and Kratos teaches the boy hunting and survival skills . A mentor and protector of his son , who seeks his father 's respect , Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years . He hopes to teach his son and make amends for his past . Since Kratos lost his infamous double @-@ chained blades in his climactic battle with Zeus , he now uses a magical battle axe . His attire and personality have also changed as he now sports a full beard and presents a calmer demeanor than the previous games .

 Kratos is also the main character in novelizations of the game series by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman . The novels are a retelling of the games and offer deeper insights into their stories . The first novel , titled God of War , was published in May 2010 , and the second novel , titled God of War II , was published in February 2013 . A film adaptation of the original God of War was announced in 2005 , but has remained in development hell . In 2010 , Jaffe stated that the " script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig who plays [ James ] Bond , but he turned it down . " He also said that another actor had since been signed to the role of Kratos , and that " this new person is pretty good , if that ends up true . " The film 's new writers , Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan , were announced in July 2012 , and in August 2012 , the writers stated that they plan to humanize Kratos and explore his past .

 Kratos ' character received positive response by video game publications . GameSpot regarded Kratos as a " sympathetic antihero " and a " badass " , and described him as endearing due to his unforgiving demeanor , but added that the slowly @-@ developing story offered players " no understanding [ of him ] " in the game 's early stages . IGN said he was ruthless , merciless and savage , noting the character 's main motive is vengeance and " all he desires is murder . " IGN also stated that in time the player would begin to " love and loathe Kratos and hate Ares . " GamePro said it was " Kratos ' tragic fall and brutal ascension to the peaks of Mount Olympus that made the original God of War so memorable . " PlayStation Universe said he was " certainly a unique character and a warrior to be reckoned with , " and that " this iconic PlayStation anti @-@ hero will surely not be forgotten . " 
 At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards , Kratos was nominated for " Character of the Year " and awarded the " Biggest Badass " award . He was included in GameSpot 's " All Time Greatest Video Game Hero " contest and reached the " Elite Eight " round before losing to Mario . The 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition lists Kratos as the ninth most popular video game character . In 2011 , Empire ranked him as the 15th @-@ greatest video game character . In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked Kratos , " one of PlayStation ’ s most popular representatives , " as the eighteenth- " most memorable , influential , and badass " protagonist in games : " Being insanely violent isn ’ t exactly an uncommon trait amongst game characters , but driven by a rage wrought from his guilt ( slaughtered thousands , including — oops — his wife and daughter ) Kratos kills with such convincing visceral aggression it elevates him way beyond the status of brain @-@ dead murder @-@ bot . " In 2010 , Game Guru said that " practically anyone , even if they hadn 't played any of the God of War games , would know about Kratos . " 
 Kratos has been included on several top video game character lists : GamesRadar listed him as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade , stating that while he appears at first to be a generic character , players eventually learn that he is both an " unstoppable force of nature " and a " broken , tragic man " . Knowing of the talks regarding a God of War film , both IGN and UGO Networks listed Kratos as a character who deserved his own movie . In 2008 , IGN listed him as one of the characters wanted for an " ultimate fighting " game , featuring characters from all consoles and all eras of gaming . He was included on the list of the best anti @-@ heroes by IGN in 2012 . In 2011 , Complex listed several of his finishing moves in their fifty " craziest fatalities in video games " list at 30th , 28th , 24th , 14th , and number @-@ one spots for his finishing moves on Hades , Hercules , Helios , the Hydra , and Poseidon , respectively .

" Jeremy " Norm " Scott , creator of the comic strip Hsu and Chan , stated in Electronic Gaming Monthly that Kratos was average and " did not exist , except as an avatar for the player . " In 2009 , IGN listed Kratos as the sixth @-@ most overrated video game character . Cheat Code Central also listed Kratos as the sixth @-@ most overrated video game character in a 2011 top @-@ ten list .

 The Triangle Link ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a fixed link with three branches that connects the islands of Stord and Bømlo to each other and to the mainland at Sveio , Norway . It consists of the underwater Bømlafjord Tunnel from Sveio to the island of Føyno , the Stord Bridge from there to Stord , and a road including the Bømla Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge to Bømlo . The section from Sveio to Stord is part of European Route E39 , while the branch to Bømlo is part of County Road 542 . 
 The Bømlo Tunnel is 7 @,@ 860 meters ( 25 @,@ 790 ft ) long and reaches 260 meters ( 850 ft ) below mean sea level . It is the longest subsea tunnel in Norway and was the deepest in the world when it opened . The Stord Bridge and Bømla Bridge are both suspension bridges , with lengths of 1 @,@ 077 and 998 metres ( 3 @,@ 533 and 3 @,@ 274 ft ) and main spans of 677 and 577 meters ( 2 @,@ 221 and 1 @,@ 893 ft ) . The Spissøy Bridge is a 283 @-@ meter ( 928 ft ) beam bridge . The link is 21 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 13 @.@ 4 mi ) long toll road with a toll plaza on Føyno . The section from Stord to Bømlo has a pedestrian and bicycle path . 
 Plans for a link between Bømlo and Stord were first launched as a pontoon bridge in the 1960s . In the late 1980s , the plans evolved into a triangular project . There was controversy surrounding the project , in particular from environmentalists . The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1996 , and construction started the following year . The bridges and link between Stord and Bømlo opened on 28 December 2000 , while the tunnel opened on 30 April 2001 . The link cost 1 @.@ 8 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) after substantial cost overruns and will remain a toll road until 30 April 2013 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Triangle Link is part of two routes , European Route E39 and County Road 542 . The section from Stord to Sveio , including the Stord Bridge and the Bømlafjord Tunnel , is part of E39 — the Coastal Highway — which runs along the west coast of Norway . The section from the interchange on Føyno , including the <unk> Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge , is on County Road 542 . The link acts both as a mainland connection for Stord and Bømlo to the mainland at Sveio , as well as a link between the two island communities , which have a combined population of 30 @,@ 000 . 
 The Bømlafjord Tunnel is a 7 @,@ 860 @-@ meter ( 25 @,@ 790 ft ) long subsea tunnel which crosses Bømlafjorden . It is 11 meters ( 36 ft ) wide , 4 @.@ 7 meters ( 15 ft ) tall and reaches 260 @.@ 4 meters ( 854 ft ) below mean sea level . The tunnel has three lanes , one downhill and two uphill , with the direction of the extra lane switching at the bottom . When it opened , it was the longest and second @-@ deepest subsea tunnel in Europe . Stord Bridge is a suspension bridge which crosses Digernessundet , connecting Stord with Føyno . It is 1 @,@ 077 meters ( 3 @,@ 533 ft ) long and has a main span ( distance between the pylons , or towers ) of 677 meters ( 2 @,@ 221 ft ) . The bridge is 13 @.@ 5 meters ( 44 ft ) wide and has a clearance of 18 meters ( 59 ft ) . It has two 97 @-@ meter ( 318 ft ) tall pylons , one <unk> on <unk> and one on Føyno . The pylons were built in concrete , while the deck is built as 19 in steel sections , each 36 meters ( 118 ft ) long and weighing 150 tonnes ( 150 long tons ; 170 short tons ) . Stord Bridge has the second @-@ longest span in Norway , after the Askøy Bridge . 
 Bømla Bridge is a suspension bridge which crosses Spissøysundet , connecting Spissøy and <unk> . It is 998 meters ( 3 @,@ 274 ft ) long and has a main span of 577 meters ( 1 @,@ 893 ft ) . The bridge is 13 meters ( 43 ft ) wide and has a clearance of 36 meters ( 118 ft ) . The higher clearance was built to allow ship traffic which runs through <unk> between Bømlo and Stord to continue to run . The bridge has two 105 @-@ meter ( 344 ft ) tall pylons , one <unk> on <unk> and one on Spissøy . The bridge has a similar aesthetically design to the Stord Bridge , and also features a steel deck with concrete pylons . It has the fifth @-@ longest span in Norway . Spissøy Bridge is a beam bridge which crosses Gassasundet , connecting Bømlo with Spissøy . It is 283 meters ( 928 ft ) long , consists of five spans and has a clearance of 7 meters ( 23 ft ) . 
 The fixed link project also includes 12 kilometers ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) of highway . On Stord , E39 received a new two @-@ lane , limited @-@ access road from <unk> to the bridge . This included a new grade separated ( two @-@ level ) interchange in the southern part of <unk> and a culvert — the Digernes Tunnel — immediately before the bridge . In Sveio , the link included 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) of new limited @-@ access road from the tunnel to a grade @-@ separated interchange at Dalshovda . In Bømlo , there was a new road built across the islands of Spissøy and Nautøy — including an intersection on Spissøy . It further consisted of a new section of road from the Bømlo side of Spissøy Bridge at Gassasundet to <unk> , and from Gassasundet to <unk> , including a new tunnel through <unk> . A combined pedestrian and bicycle path runs along the whole section between Stord and Bømlo , with a grass division on the land parts between the road and the path . <unk> and walls were built with natural stone . 
 The tolls are collected at a toll plaza located on Føyno . The plaza is constructed as a grade @-@ separated intersection , so that any car passes through the plaza once . However , traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo does not have to pay . Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza , while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange . There is also an intersection allowing access to the island . The plaza has six lanes , of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection . The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection , which allows passage without stopping , in addition to manual collection . Passengers , pedestrians , bicycles , motorcyclists and mopeds are free . As of 2011 , the fees are NOK 85 for cars and NOK 270 for trucks . Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company , and receive a 40 percent discount .

 = = = Pontoon bridge proposals = = = 
 The first recorded proposal for a connection between Bømlo and Stord was made in the 1960s by sheriff , and later mayor of Fitjar , Finn <unk> . Christened the Island Road , he proposed a series of eleven bridges and causeways which would run from <unk> in Fitjar via <unk> to <unk> in Bømlo . While local politicians were not opposed to the plan , the recent municipal merger between Bømlo , <unk> and <unk> made them prioritize other sectors and the project was abandoned without any official investigations . 
 A new route was launched by Bømlo Mayor <unk> <unk> , who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet . He was inspired by the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen . In 1973 , the municipal councils of Bømlo , Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process , which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal . The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno . There were protests from Wichmann <unk> who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic . Similar protests also came from the shipping industry , who wished to continue using Stokksundet ; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across <unk> . To illustrate their point , one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of <unk> . The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974 . 
 In the early 1980s , plans for Stord Airport , Sørstokken were launched . The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again brought up in 1982 as the industry on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport . A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 to look into the possibilities for a bridge . Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. <unk> , it issued Engineer Harald <unk> the task to author a report and recommendation . He made three proposals : a pontoon or suspension bridge between <unk> and <unk> ; a suspension bridge between <unk> and <unk> , which would terminate just south of the new airport ; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes , without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago . The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed . The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport , but stated that one closer further away would be fine . 
 Mapping of traffic patterns on Bømlo was undertaken by Hordaland Public Roads Administration in 1984 , and based on this and other feedback , a pontoon bridge between Foldrøyholmen and Sørstokken was recommended . It was estimated to cost NOK 190 million , in addition to auxiliary roads for NOK 40 million . Following the opening of the Vardø Tunnel in 1982 , the first subsea tunnel in Norway , Engineer Finn <unk> <unk> proposed a fixed link which involved a combined bridge , road and tunnels between the islands , including a suspension bridge over Digernessundet , a causeway and low bridge onwards to a 2 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometer ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) subsea tunnel under Spissøysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet . In addition , a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) long tunnel would have had to be constructed from Føyno to <unk> in Sveio . 
 The company Johannes Sørlie launched an all @-@ tunnel proposal in 1985 , which would cost NOK 700 million and give 18 kilometers ( 11 mi ) of subsea tunnel connecting Bømlo to Stord and the mainland . The committee was positive to the proposals , while Josef Martinsen , director of Hordaland Public Roads Administration , stated that the project was unrealistic . Sveio Municipality was subsequently invited as a member of the planning committee . On 14 May 1985 , the committee voted to encourage the municipal councils to pass planning which involved a bridge across Sørstokken , and aimed to get the plans into Norwegian Road Plan 1990 – 1993 . The committee continued its work until it dissolved itself in October 1986 and was replaced by the limited company Ytre Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap AS ( SBT ) . The company was owned by the municipalities of Bømlo , Stord , Fitjar and Sveio , Hordaland County Municipality and the banks Bergen Bank , Sparebanken Vest , <unk> , Haugesund Bank and Christiania Bank . 
 A new master plan for the project was completed by the Public Roads Administration in December 1986 . It proposed four main routes : via the Fitjar Archipelago ; via <unk> with a pontoon bridge to Sørstokken ; a suspension bridge from <unk> to <unk> ; or via Spissøy , <unk> and Føyno to Digernes . They recommended choosing the pontoon bridge . SBT stated that this was only to be a first stage , and that a second stage should involve a tunnel to the mainland . In a <unk> SBT and representatives for the shipping industry at the end of 1986 , it was decided that SBT would start working for a mainland connection that would not hinder sailing . 
 A report published by SBT in 1987 looked at details for a subsea tunnel to the mainland . It was the first official document to use the " Triangle Link " term , although this had previously been used by the press . A delegation traveled to Washington State in the United States and British Columbia in Canada to look at their seven pontoon bridges , while seismic surveys were undertaken in Bømlafjorden . SBT changed its name to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link . The issue became the subject of major local debate and was supplemented by a demand from residents in southern Bømlo that they did not want to lose their ferry service , which would be faster than driving via the fixed link . 
 = = = Opposition = = = 
 The Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge . SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards receiving permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services . On 16 September , they unanimously supported the triangular proposal , which was estimated to cost NOK 660 million . This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration , who stated that it would take longer time to plan — and thus complete — the Triangle Link . A poll from January 1988 showed that 78 @.@ 6 percent of the population of Bømlo wanted the Triangle Link , while 8 @.@ 6 percent wanted the pontoon bridge . On 6 January , SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for the Triangle Link , and by February sufficient funding had been secured . 
 From 1988 , environmentalists started actively opposing the Triangle Link . The most active was the local chapter of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature , which stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy . Instead , they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge . An action group was established . Hallgeir <unk> stated that Stord had a lack of beaches and that the two islands " were the last low , forested islands in the area after the paradise <unk> had been converted to an industrial area for Aker Stord during the 1970s " . He further stated that environmentalists were skeptical to floating bridges , but that in this case it would be the lesser of two evils . The Stord Society for the Conservation of Nature applied for municipal grants to make a critical report , but this was rejected by the majority of the municipal council . By June , a new chapter had been established on Bømlo , and the group stated that it was irresponsible to build a link which would result in a massive increase in car use . Future In Our Hands started a petition which collected 1 @,@ 600 signatures . A poll from 1990 showed that in Stord , 35 percent were in favor of the project , while 36 @.@ 7 percent were opposed , given that the ferry service was improved , among other things with night ferries and increased comfort . 
 Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link , who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public . Gisle Tjong was another opponent , who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last : they could just as well last 60 as 15 years . Instead , he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees , place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds . Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord , while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support . However , in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry , as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link . Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels . 
 = = = Political processes = = = 
 Bømlo Municipal Council voted unanimously in favor of the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988 . Two days later , the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council . Olav <unk> at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge , but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link . The following week , Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link , without either a debate or dissent in the council . Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals . Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge , and stated that two and a half years of work on a master plan had been wasted . A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989 , estimating the costs at NOK 890 million . It recommended that the Langevåg – Buavåg Ferry remain , but the other four ferry services be terminated . The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry , that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions . 
 During late 1989 , advance tolls on the ferries were approved by the municipal councils and the county council , who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990 , but this was not immediately supported by the government . On 18 and 19 September 1990 , the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas of the Triangle Link , the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel . By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants , as it could be entirely financed with tolls . Tore Haugen , Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus , proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans . However , Lars Gunnar Lie , Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party , stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects . 
 In 1991 , the master plan was appealed by the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature to the Ministry of Transport and Communications . The appeal was seconded by the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management . In the 1991 municipal election , the Socialist Left Party was the only party which was opposed to the fixed link , and they received a large increase in votes , increasing for 7 to 21 percent in Stord . The same year , Dag Hareide in the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature started lobbying up towards national politicians in an attempt to stop the issue in Parliament . High @-@ profile people who were opposed to the project included Per <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Kenneth Sivertsen . 
 The issue of advanced tolls was reviewed by the county council on 23 October 1991 , where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed , the latter representing the Socialist Left Party , the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party . In June 1992 , the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link , as there would not be sufficient state grants to build both projects . Both would require between NOK 200 and 300 million , and it would not be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997 . In the council meeting on 18 June 1992 , a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected . The council then , with 44 against 30 votes , chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge , which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party . The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link . The Socialist Left Party 's proposal to build neither received 11 votes . 
 In July , the master plan was passed by the Council of State . On 10 December 1992 , Parliament approved advanced payment of tolls on the ferry , which were made effective from 1 January 1993 . Ticket prices increased with between NOK 10 and 12 . This resulted in protests from the ferry employees who stated that they would have to collect the tolls which would remove their jobs ; Norwegian Seafarers ' Union representatives stated that they considered suing the state . Work on the development plan started in 1992 . It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project 's cost by NOK 200 million . In May 1994 , it was made subject to consultative statements . 
 Norwegian Road Plan 1994 – 97 was considered by Parliament during 1993 . Minister of Transport and Communications , Kjell Opseth of the Labour Party , stated that he wanted to equally prioritize the Triangle Link and the Hardanger Bridge , but that it would be unrealistic to build both in the same period . At a county council meeting on 21 April 1993 , the council decided with 60 against 20 votes that the county would not prioritize between the two projects . Opseth subsequently stated that in his opinion , the Triangle Link should be prioritized . In 1995 , a report on the Coastal Highway ( E39 ) was presented , which recommended that the Skjersholmane – Valevåg Ferry be removed . 
 Particularly within the Labour Party there was disagreement about whether or not to build the Hardanger Bridge . In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord , there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park , and that it subsequently would result in an all @-@ year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife . Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge . 
 When the standing committee visited the two projects in 1996 , they were met by demonstrators in favor of the bridge in Hardanger , and demonstrators in opposition to the fixed link in Sunnhordland . In May , SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Party to consider other solution , which could have postponed the project several years . Parliament decided on 11 June 1996 , with 144 against 20 votes , to build the Triangle Link . The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed , while the Hardanger Bridge was put aside . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Construction started on 15 February 1997 . Before the first blast could be taken by County Mayor Magnar <unk> , representatives for <unk> <unk> and Youth , and The People 's Movement Against the Triangle Link had to be moved . The only police officer at the festivities was Sheriff Reidar <unk> , who was not dressed in his police uniform and had not brought with him his badge . The demonstrators did not move until a police boat had been sent with the necessary documentation and <unk> could prove his identity as a law enforcer . Elin <unk> Boasson of Nature and Youth stated that it was " a day of sorrow " . 
 Core samples showed that the tunnel would have to be built 30 meters ( 98 ft ) deeper than originally planned to avoid deposits . The tunneling was undertaken by NCC Eeg @-@ Henriksen from the Føyno side and by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration from the Sveio side . Construction from Sveio started on 16 September 1997 and from Føyno on 6 March 1998 . The tunnel was built at an average speed of 55 meters ( 180 ft ) per week , with the record being 96 @.@ 7 meters ( 317 ft ) . The lowest point was reached on 5 May 1999 and the breakthrough took place on 2 September , five months before schedule . Sixty people participated in a course to master fear of tunnels organized by the toll company . When it opened , the tunnel was the longest and second @-@ deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway , after the <unk> Tunnel . 
 The Stord and Bømla Bridges were both constructed using the same method and by the same contractors , <unk> Triangle Contractor , a joint venture between NCC Eeg @-@ Henriksen and HBG Steel Structures . Construction started on the Stord Bridge on 20 February 1999 . After the pylons were completed , two catwalks were erected between them , with the constructors choosing a continual catwalk instead of three separate ones . The cables were spun on @-@ site using a reel ; this also allowed for cost savings , as the reels could be used two times . The cables were spun using the air spinning with controlled tension , which allowed spinning with little space use and with a crew with limited experience with spinning . The two bridges were the first time that on @-@ site spinning was used in Norway . The fastening poles were delivered five weeks after schedule ; a new mounting method was developed which allowed them to be installed in a quarter of the time , in part by using a helicopter , and the whole five @-@ week delay was eradicated . This allowed the deck sections to be installed as scheduled . The decks were produced in Schiedam , Netherlands , for the Stord Bridge and in Italy for the Bømlo Bridge . These were sent by barge to Sunnhordland . The section length was different between the two bridges , the Stord Bridge having them in lengths of 36 meters ( 118 ft ) and the Bømla Bridge in sections of 24 meters ( 79 ft ) . This was to accommodate the latter 's smaller vertical curvature . 
 The entire project cost NOK 1 @,@ 814 million . The costs were distributed to NOK 476 million for the Bømlafjord Tunnel , NOK 433 million for the Stord Bridge , NOK 336 million for the Bømla Bridge , NOK 46 million for the Spissøy Bridge , NOK 36 million for the Digernes Tunnel , NOK 325 million for roadways and NOK 172 for administration and common costs . The investment cost was split between state grants and NOK 1 @,@ 036 million in debt taken up by the toll company . When the project was passed by Parliament it had a budget of NOK 1 @,@ 260 million . The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK 900 million in three projects , the Triangle Link , the Lærdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555 . The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle Link . As a consequence , Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament . 
 = = = Opening and operation = = = 
 The first part of the link , between Stord and Sveio , including the Stord Bridge and Bømlafjord Tunnel , was taken into use on 27 December 2000 . The official opening and the National Road 542 opening took place on 30 April 2001 . The opening of the first stage allowed two ferry services to be replaced , the Skjersholmane – Valevåg Ferry , which connected Stord to Sveio , and the Skjersholmane – <unk> Ferry , which connected Stord to <unk> . With the opening of the Bømlo connection , the two remaining ferries could be closed : the <unk> – <unk> Ferry , which connected Stord with Bømlo , and the <unk> – Valevåg Ferry , which connected Bømlo to Sveio . The Langevåg – Buavåg Ferry , which connects the southern part of Bømlo to Sveio , was not closed . In 2000 , the four closed ferry services transported 884 @,@ 216 vehicles and 1 @,@ 935 @,@ 875 people . 
 From the start the toll plaza used Autopass , a standard which allows automatic passage through the toll plaza without stopping . The system was launched by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in 2001 and the Triangle Link was the first to take the system into use . The tollway was also the first in the country to allow subscriptions to be made via the Internet . The initial charges were NOK 75 for cars up to 3 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 3 @.@ 4 long tons ; 3 @.@ 9 short tons ) or 6 @.@ 0 meters ( 19 @.@ 7 ft ) length , NOK 225 for small trucks , between 6 @.@ 0 and 12 @.@ 4 meters ( 19 @.@ 7 and 40 @.@ 7 ft ) , and NOK 450 for longer vehicles . 
 In 2004 the Public Roads Administration published a report documenting high administration costs in the 46 toll companies throughout the country . Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge , SBT received the harshest criticism in the report . Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry <unk> and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized , as it cost the toll company NOK 118 @,@ 000 . Also annual board member fees of NOK 200 @,@ 000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money . The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK 300 @,@ 000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations . The report was rejected by the board , who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and that the Public Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state @-@ run toll collection agency . Øyvind <unk> withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005 . He was at the time also member of parliament for the Conservative Party . 
 As a consequence of the report , Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February , in which chairman Harry <unk> was replaced . Pål <unk> was elected new chairman . At the same time the annual meeting demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on <unk> and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association . In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration , SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs . The toll changed the operator of the toll plaza from Bru- og <unk> to <unk> in 2010 . The same year the toll plaza had 1 @,@ 910 @,@ 280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK 142 million . This made it the ninth @-@ largest toll road in Norway by revenue . The toll collection is scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013 . 
 = French ironclad Suffren = 
 Suffren was a wooden @-@ hulled , armored frigate of the Océan class , built for the French Navy in the mid to late 1860s as an improvement over the Provence @-@ class ironclad . Although she was laid down in 1866 , the ship was not launched until 1872 and commissioned in 1876 . Suffren was one of the French ships assigned to the international squadron gathered to force the Ottoman Empire to carry out its obligations under the Treaty of Berlin in 1880 . The ship was paid off in 1895 and discarded two years later . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ironclads were designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the Provence @-@ class ironclads . The ships were central battery ironclads , with the armament concentrated amidships . For the first time in a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull . Like most ironclads of their era , they were equipped with a metal @-@ reinforced ram . 
 The ship measured 87 @.@ 73 meters ( 287 ft 10 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 52 meters ( 57 ft 6 in ) . Suffren had a maximum draft of 9 @.@ 09 meters ( 29 ft 10 in ) and displaced 7 @,@ 800 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 700 long tons ) . Her crew numbered between 750 and 778 officers and men . The metacentric height of the ship was very low , between 1 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 m ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ships had one horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engine driving a single propeller . Their engines were powered by eight oval boilers . On sea trials the engine produced 4 @,@ 100 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 100 kW ) and Suffren reached 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ; 16 @.@ 5 mph ) . She carried 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The Océan @-@ class ships were barque or barquentine @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area around 2 @,@ 000 square meters ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 These ships had their main armament mounted in four barbettes on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery , with the remaining guns on the battery deck below the barbettes . Suffren 's armament was upgraded , before she commissioned , to four 274 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) guns in the barbettes , and on the battery deck , four 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns , six 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns and one 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) gun . By 1885 , all of the 138 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by six 120 @-@ millimeter guns . 
 The 18 @-@ caliber 274 @-@ millimeter Modéle 1870 gun fired an armor @-@ piercing , 476 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 216 @.@ 0 kg ) shell while the gun itself weighed 22 @.@ 84 long tons ( 23 @.@ 21 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 424 ft / s ( 434 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 3 inches ( 360 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 138 @-@ millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed 2 @.@ 63 long tons ( 2 @.@ 67 t ) . It fired a 61 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 0 kg ) explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 529 ft / s ( 466 m / s ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 At some point the ship received a dozen 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft . However , the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft . 
 Late in the ship 's career , four above @-@ water 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added .

 Suffren was laid down at Cherbourg in July 1866 , but was not launched until 26 December 1872 . The ship began her sea trials on 15 January 1873 and was completed on 5 August . She was placed into reserve after her completion and was not commissioned until 1 March 1876 when she became flagship of the Cherbourg Division . Throughout her career Suffren was often used as a flagship because of her spacious admiral 's quarters . 
 On 1 September 1880 the ship was assigned to the division that participated in the international naval demonstration at Ragusa later that month under the command of Vice Admiral Seymour of the Royal Navy in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro . Suffren was reduced to reserve in 1881 and not recommissioned until 23 August 1884 when she was assigned to the Northern Squadron . The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron about 1888 and remained there until paid off in 1895 and condemned in 1897 . 
 = Revolt of the Comuneros = 
 The Revolt of the Comuneros ( Spanish : Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla , " War of the Communities of Castile " ) was an uprising by citizens of Castile against the rule of Charles V and his administration between 1520 and 1521 . At its height , the rebels controlled the heart of Castile , ruling the cities of Valladolid , Tordesillas , and Toledo . 
 The revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the Crown of Castile after the death of Queen Isabella I in 1504 . Joanna the Mad , Isabella 's daughter , inherited the throne with her Burgundian husband King Philip I. However , Philip died two years into their reign , and their son Charles was only six years old . Due to his youth and Joanna 's mental instability , Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father , King Ferdinand II of Aragon , as a regency . After Ferdinand 's death in 1516 , the sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and Aragon . Charles had been raised in the Netherlands with little knowledge of Castilian . He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics . These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites , who could see the threat to their power and status . 
 In 1519 , Charles was elected Holy Roman Emperor . He departed for Germany in 1520 , leaving the Dutch cardinal Adrian of Utrecht to rule Castile in his absence . Soon , a series of anti @-@ government riots broke out in the cities , and local city councils ( Comunidades ) took power . The rebels chose Charles ' own mother , Queen Joanna , as an alternative ruler , hoping they could control her madness . The rebel movement took on a radical anti @-@ feudal dimension , supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility . On April 23 , 1521 , after nearly a year of rebellion , the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the Battle of Villalar . The following day , rebel leaders Juan de Padilla , Juan Bravo , and Francisco Maldonado were beheaded . The army of the comuneros fell apart . Only the city of Toledo kept alive the rebellion , until its surrender in October 1521 . 
 The character of the revolution is a matter of historiographical debate . According to some scholars , the revolt was one of the first modern revolutions , notably because of the anti @-@ noble sentiment against social injustice and its basis on ideals of democracy and freedom . Others consider it a more typical rebellion against high taxes and perceived foreign control . From the 19th century onwards , the revolt has been mythologized by various Spaniards , generally liberals who drew political inspiration from it . Conservative intellectuals have traditionally adopted more pro @-@ Imperial stances toward the revolt , and have been critical of both the motives and the government of the comuneros . With the end of Franco 's dictatorship and the establishment of the autonomous community of Castile and León , positive commemoration of the Comunidades has grown . April 23 is now celebrated as Castile and León Day , and the incident is often referred to in Castilian nationalism . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Discontent had been brewing for years before the Revolt of the Comuneros . The second half of the 15th century saw profound political , economic , and social changes in Spain . Economic growth created new urban industries and offered a route to power and wealth not tied to the aristocracy . Support from these urban elites was critical to Ferdinand and Isabella 's centralization of power , and they acted as a counterweight to the landed aristocracy and the clergy . 
 However , with Queen Isabella I 's death in 1504 , this alliance between the national government and the budding middle class faltered . The Castilian government decayed with each successive administration , becoming rife with corruption . King Philip I ruled for a mere two years ; he was replaced by Archbishop Cisneros as regent for a short time , and then by Isabella 's widower Ferdinand who ruled from Aragon . Ferdinand 's claim to continue ruling Castile as regent was somewhat tenuous after Isabella 's death , but no plausible alternatives existed as the sovereign , their widowed daughter Joanna , was mentally unfit to reign on her own . The landed nobility of Castile took advantage of the weak and corrupt Royal Council to illegally expand their territory and domain with private armies while the government did nothing . In response , the towns signed mutual defense pacts , relying on each other rather than the national government . 
 The budgets of both Castile and Aragon had been in poor condition for some time . The government had expelled the Jews in 1492 and the Muslims of Granada in 1502 , moves that undercut lucrative trades and businesses . Ferdinand and Isabella had been forced to borrow money to pay troops during and after the Reconquista , and Spanish military obligations had only increased since then . A large number of troops were required to maintain stability in recently conquered Granada , threatened by revolt from the maltreated <unk> ( former Muslims who had converted to Christianity ) and frequent naval raids from Muslim nations along the Mediterranean . Additionally , Ferdinand had invaded and occupied the Iberian part of Navarre in 1512 , and forces were required to garrison it against Navarrese revolts and French armies . Very little money was left to pay for the royal army in Castile proper , let alone service foreign debts . The corruption in the government since Isabella 's death only made the budget shortfalls worse . 
 = = = Succession of Charles = = = 
 In 1516 , Ferdinand died . The remaining heir was Ferdinand and Isabella 's grandson Charles , who became King Charles I of both Castile and Aragon in co @-@ regency with his mother Joanna . Charles was brought up in Flanders , the homeland of his father Philip , and barely knew Castilian . The people greeted him with skepticism , but also hoped he would restore stability . With the arrival of the new king in late 1517 , his Flemish court took positions of power in Castile ; young Charles only trusted people he knew from the Netherlands . Among the most scandalous of these was the appointment of the twenty @-@ year @-@ old William de Croÿ as Archbishop of Toledo . The Archbishopric was an important position ; it had been held by Archbishop Cisneros , the former regent of the country . Six months into his rule , discontent openly simmered among rich and poor alike . Even some monks began to agitate , denouncing the opulence of the royal court , the Flemish , and the nobility in their sermons . One of the first public protests involved placards posted in churches , which read : 
 You , land of Castile , very wretched and damned are you to suffer that as noble a kingdom as you are , you will be governed by those who have no love for you . 
 With the unrest growing , Charles ' paternal grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I died in 1519 . A new election had to be held to choose the next emperor . Charles campaigned aggressively for the post , vying with King Francis I of France to bribe the most prince @-@ electors . Charles I won the election , becoming Emperor Charles V and cementing the power of the House of Habsburg . He prepared to head to Germany to take possession of his new domains in the Holy Roman Empire . 
 = = = New taxes : The Cortes of Santiago and Corunna = = = 
 Charles had already stressed the treasury to its limit with his extravagant Flemish court , and over 1 million gold florins were spent in bribes for the election . Taxes had to be raised to cover the debt , but any new taxes must be approved by the Cortes ( Castile 's own parliamentary body ) . Thus , in late March 1520 , Charles convened the Cortes in Santiago de Compostela . Charles ensured the Cortes would only have limited power , and further attempted to stack the Cortes with pliable representatives he could bribe . Support for the opposition only increased in response , and the representatives demanded that their grievances be heard first before any new tax was granted . 
 A group of clerics soon circulated a statement in protest of the king . It argued three points : any new taxes should be rejected ; Castile should be embraced and the foreign Empire rejected ; and if the king did not take into account his subjects , the Comunidades themselves should defend the interests of the kingdom . It was the first time where the word <unk> ( communities , communes ) was used to signify the independent populace , and the name would stick to the councils later formed . 
 At this point , most of the members of the Cortes in Santiago intended to vote against the king 's requested duties and taxes , even with the Cortes stacked with royalists . In response , Charles decided to suspend the Cortes on April 4 . He convened them again in Corunna on April 22 , this time getting his program passed . On May 20 , he embarked for Germany , and left as regent of his Spanish possessions his former tutor , Adrian of Utrecht ( better known as the future Pope Adrian VI ) . 
 = = Beginnings of the Revolt = = 
 = = = <unk> in Toledo = = = 
 In April 1520 , Toledo was already unstable . The city council had been at the forefront of protests against Charles ' bid to become Holy Roman Emperor . They decried the short @-@ term expenses that would be borne by Castile and questioned the role of Castile in this new political framework , given the possibility that the land would become a mere imperial province . The situation erupted when the royal government summoned the most radical of the city councilors away from the city , intending to send back more easily controllable replacements on a royal salary . The order came on April 15 ; one day later , as the councilors prepared to leave , a large crowd opposed to the departure rioted and drove out the royal administrators instead . A citizen 's committee was elected under the leadership of Juan López de Padilla and Pero <unk> de la Vega , naming themselves a Comunidad . On April 21 , the remaining administrators were driven from the fortifications of the Alcázar of Toledo . 
 Following Charles ' departure to Germany , the riots multiplied in the cities of central Castile , especially after the arrival of legislators who had voted " yes " to the taxes Charles had asked for . Segovia had some of the earliest and most violent incidents ; on May 30 , a mob of <unk> murdered two administrators and the city 's legislator who had voted in favor . Incidents of a similar size occurred in cities such as Burgos and Guadalajara , while others , such as León , Ávila , and Zamora , suffered minor altercations . 
 = = = Proposals to other cities = = = 
 With widespread discontent circulating , on June 8 Toledo 's council suggested to cities with a vote in the Cortes to hold an emergency meeting . They proffered five goals : 
 Cancel the taxes voted in the Cortes of Corunna . 
 A return to the local @-@ controlled <unk> system of taxation . 
 Reserve official positions and church benefices for Castilians . 
 <unk> money from leaving the kingdom to fund foreign affairs . 
 Designate a Castilian to lead the kingdom in the absence of the king . 
 These claims , especially the first two , spread quickly through society . Ideas began to circulate of replacing the king ; Toledo 's leaders floated the possibility of turning the cities of Castile into independent free cities , similar to Genoa and other Italian republics . Competing proposals suggested keeping the monarchy , but dethroning Charles . They proposed that he be replaced by either his mother Queen Joanna or his Castilian @-@ born brother Ferdinand . With these ideas , the revolt shifted from a simple protest against taxes to a broader revolution . Many cities , while not quite in outright revolt , stopped sending taxes to the Royal Council and began to self @-@ govern .

 = = = Blockade of Segovia = = = 
 The situation moved closer to armed conflict on June 10 . Rodrigo Ronquillo had been sent to Segovia by the Royal Council to investigate the recent murder of Segovia 's legislator , but Segovia refused him entry . Unable to besiege a city of 30 @,@ 000 with only a small force , Ronquillo instead set out to blockade foodstuffs and other supplies from entering Segovia . The people of Segovia , led by militia leader and noble Juan Bravo , rallied around the Comunidad . Segovia requested aid against Ronquillo 's army from the Comunidades of Toledo and Madrid . The cities responded by sending their militias , captained by Juan de Padilla and Juan Zapata , who won in the first major confrontation between the forces of the king and the rebels . 
 = = = The Junta of Ávila = = = 
 Other cities now followed the lead of Toledo and Segovia , deposing their governments . A revolutionary Cortes , La Santa Junta de las Comunidades ( " Holy Assembly of the Communities " ) , held its first session in Ávila and declared itself the legitimate government deposing the Royal Council . Padilla was named Captain @-@ General , and troops were assembled . Still , only four cities sent representatives at first : Toledo , Segovia , Salamanca , and Toro . 
 = = = Burning of Medina del Campo = = = 
 Faced with the situation in Segovia , Regent and Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht decided to use the royal artillery , located in nearby Medina del Campo , to take Segovia and defeat Padilla . Adrian ordered his commander Antonio de Fonseca to seize the artillery . Fonseca arrived on August 21 in Medina , but encountered heavy resistance from the townspeople , as the city had strong trade links to Segovia . Fonseca ordered the setting of a fire to distract the resistance , but it grew out of control . Much of the town was destroyed , including a Franciscan monastery and a trade warehouse containing goods valued at more than 400 @,@ 000 ducats . Fonseca had to withdraw his troops , and the event was a public relations disaster for the government . Uprisings throughout Castile occurred , even in cities that previously had been neutral such as Castile 's capital , Valladolid . The establishment of the Comunidad of Valladolid caused the most important core of the Iberian plateau to declare for the rebels , upending the stability of the government . New members now joined the Junta of Ávila and the Royal Council looked discredited ; Adrian had to flee to Medina de Rioseco as Valladolid fell . The royal army , with many of its soldiers unpaid for months , started to disintegrate . 
 = = = The Junta of Tordesillas = = = 
 The comunero army now properly organized itself , integrating the militias of Toledo , Madrid , and Segovia . Once told of Fonseca 's attack , the comunero forces went to Medina del Campo and took possession of the artillery that had just been denied to Fonseca 's troops . On August 29 , the comuneros ' army arrived at Tordesillas with the goal of declaring Queen Joanna the sole sovereign . The Junta moved from Ávila to Tordesillas at the Queen 's request and invited cities that had not yet sent representatives to do so . A total of thirteen cities were represented in the Junta of Tordesillas : Burgos , Soria , Segovia , Ávila , Valladolid , León , Salamanca , Zamora , Toro , Toledo , Cuenca , Guadalajara , and Madrid . The only invited cities that failed to attend were the four Andalusian cities : Seville , Granada , Cordova , and Jaén . Since most of the kingdom was represented at Tordesillas , the Junta renamed itself the Cortes y Junta General del Reino ( " General Assembly of the Kingdom " ) . On September 24 , 1520 , the mad Queen , for the only time , presided over the Cortes . 
 The legislators met with Queen Joanna and explained the purpose of the Cortes : to proclaim her sovereignty and restore lost stability to the kingdom . The next day , September 25 , the Cortes issued a declaration pledging to use arms if necessary and for the whole to aid any one city that was threatened . On September 26 , the Cortes of Tordesillas declared itself the new legitimate government and denounced the Royal Council . Oaths of self @-@ defense were taken by all the cities represented over the week , finishing by September 30 . The revolutionary government now had structure and a free hand to act , with the Royal Council still ineffective and confused . 
 = = = Scope of the rebellion = = = 
 The comuneros were strong in the central plateau of the Iberian Peninsula , as well as scattered other places such as Murcia . The rebels sought to propound their revolutionary ideas to the rest of the kingdom , but without much success . There were few attempts at rebellion elsewhere , such as in Galicia to the northwest or in Andalusia to the south . Comunidades in the south were set up in Jaén , Úbeda , and Baeza , unique in Andalusia , but with time they were drawn back into the royalists . Murcia stayed with the rebel cause , but did not coordinate much with the Junta , and the rebellion there had a character closer to the nearby Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Valencia in Aragon . In Extremadura to the southwest , the city of Plasencia joined the Comunidades , but this was undermined by the close proximity of other royalist cities such as Ciudad Rodrigo and Cáceres . A close correlation can be drawn between poor economic fortunes over the previous twenty years and the rebellion ; central Castile suffered from agricultural failure and other setbacks under the Royal Council , while Andalusia was relatively prosperous with its maritime trade . Andalusia 's leadership also feared that in the instability of a civil war , the <unk> of Granada would likely revolt .

 The growing success of the comuneros emboldened people to accuse members of the old government of complicity with royal abuses . The protests attacked the landed nobility as well , many of whom had illegally taken property during the reign of the regents and weak kings after Isabella 's death . In Dueñas , the Count of Buendía 's vassals revolted against him on September 1 , 1520 , encouraged by rebel monks . This uprising was followed by others of a similar anti @-@ feudal nature . The leadership of the comuneros was forced to take a stance on these new rebellions ; reluctant to openly endorse them , the Junta initially denounced them but did nothing to oppose them . The dynamics of the uprising thus changed profoundly , as it could now jeopardize the status of the entire manorial system . The nobles had previously been somewhat sympathetic to the cause due to their loss of privileges to the central government . However , these new developments lead to a dramatic drop in support for the comuneros from aristocrats , who were frightened by the more radical elements of the revolution . 
 = = = Response of Charles V = = = 
 At first , Charles seemed not to grasp the magnitude of the revolt . He continued to demand payments from Castile ; with the government of Castile still in arrears , Cardinal Adrian found it impossible to secure any new loans . A letter from Cardinal Adrian on August 25 warned Charles of the severity of the situation : 
 Your Highness is making a great error if you think that you will be able to collect and make use of this tax ; there is no one in the Kingdom , not in Seville or Valladolid or any other city who will ever pay anything of it ; all the grandees and members of the council are amazed that Your Highness has scheduled payments from these funds . 
 Once he realized that a full @-@ fledged revolution was underway , Charles responded vigorously . Through Cardinal Adrian , he undertook new policy initiatives , such as canceling the taxes granted in the Cortes of Corunna . Most important was the appointment of two new Castilian co @-@ regents : the Constable of Castile , <unk> Fernández , and the Admiral of Castile , <unk> Enríquez . This negated two of the most salient complaints of the rebels . In addition , Adrian approached the nobles to convince them that their best interests lay with the king . The Royal Council was re @-@ established in the fief of Admiral Enríquez , Medina de Rioseco , which enabled the Council to be nearer to the revolting cities and reassure skeptical supporters . While the royal army was still in tatters , many high nobles maintained their own well @-@ trained mercenary armies — armies that with the revolt 's recent radicalization would now fight for the king . 
 = = Organization , funding , and diplomacy = = 
 The first political defeats of the comuneros came in October 1520 . The comuneros ' attempt to use Queen Joanna for legitimacy did not bear fruit , as she blocked their initiatives and refused to sign any edicts . In turn , dissenting voices inside the comuneros now began to be heard , especially in Burgos . The wavering position of Burgos was soon known to the royalists , and the Constable of Castile negotiated with Burgos 's government . The Royal Council granted a number of significant concessions to Burgos in exchange for them leaving the Junta . 
 Following this incident , the Royal Council hoped that other cities would imitate Burgos and leave the comuneros peacefully . Valladolid , the former seat of royal power , was considered especially likely to turn , but too many supporters of the king had left city politics and lost their influence . It remained rebel @-@ controlled . The Admiral of Castile continued his campaign to try to convince the comuneros to return to the royal government and thereby avoid a violent suppression . This attitude concealed a great shortage of funds on the royal side . 
 During October and November 1520 , both sides accepted that a military conclusion would soon be necessary and actively devoted themselves to fundraising , recruiting soldiers , and training their troops . The comuneros organized their militias in the major cities and levied new taxes on the countryside ; they also took measures aimed at eliminating waste , routinely auditing their treasurers and dismissing those thought to be corrupt . The royal government , which had lost much of its revenue due to the revolt , sought loans from Portugal and from conservative Castilian bankers , who saw reassuring signs in the switch of the allegiance of Burgos . 
 = = Battle of Tordesillas = = 
 = = = Leadership disputes = = = 
 Gradually , both the city of Toledo and its leader Juan de Padilla lost influence within the Junta , though Padilla retained popularity and prestige among the commoners . Two new figures emerged within the Comunidades , Pedro Girón and Antonio Osorio de Acuña . Girón was one of the most powerful nobles who supported the comuneros ; his rebellion is thought to originate from Charles ' refusal to grant Girón the prestigious Duchy of Medina @-@ Sidonia a year prior to the war . Antonio de Acuña was the Bishop of Zamora . Acuña was also the head of the Comunidad in Zamora and the leader of its army , which included more than 300 priests . 
 On the royalist side , the nobles could not agree on what tactics to use . Some preferred to directly challenge the rebels in combat , while others such as the Constable of Castile favored continued waiting and the building of defensive fortifications . The Admiral of Castile preferred negotiations and exhausting all the possible peaceful options first . Patience , however , began to run thin ; armies were expensive to maintain once assembled . In late November 1520 , both armies took positions between Medina de Rioseco and Tordesillas , and a confrontation was inevitable . 
 = = = Royal capture = = = 
 With Pedro Girón in command , the army of the comuneros advanced on Medina de Rioseco , following the orders of the Junta . Girón established his headquarters in <unk> , a town merely 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from the royalist army . The royalists occupied nearby villages to cut communication lines back to other comuneros . 
 This situation continued until December 2 , when Girón , apparently thinking the royal army would remain entrenched , moved his forces west to the small town of Villalpando . The town surrendered the next day without resistance , and the troops began looting the estates in the area . However , with this movement , the comuneros left the path to Tordesillas completely unprotected . The royal army took advantage of the blunder , marching by night on December 4 and occupying Tordesillas the next day . The small rebel garrison was overwhelmed . 
 Seizure of Tordesillas marked a serious defeat for the comuneros , who lost Queen Joanna and with her their claim to legitimacy . In addition , thirteen representatives of the Junta were imprisoned , though others fled and escaped . Morale fell among the rebels , and much angry criticism was directed towards Pedro Girón for his maneuvering of the troops out of position and for his failure to attempt to retake Tordesillas or capture Medina de Rioseco . Girón was obliged to resign from his post and withdrew from the war . 
 = = Events of December and January = = 
 = = = Reorganization of the comuneros = = = 
 Following the loss of Tordesillas , the comuneros regrouped in Valladolid . The Junta reconvened on December 15 , but with only eleven cities represented , down from a height of fourteen . Soria and Guadalajara 's representatives did not return , and Burgos had left earlier . Valladolid would be the third capital of the rebels , after Ávila and Tordesillas . 
 The situation was somewhat worse for the army , with a large number of desertions in Valladolid and Villalpando . This forced the rebels to intensify their recruitment drives , especially in Toledo , Salamanca , and Valladolid itself . With these new recruits and the arrival of Juan de Padilla to Valladolid , the rebel military apparatus was rebuilt and morale bolstered . At the beginning of 1521 , the comuneros prepared for an all @-@ out war , despite disagreements within the movement . Some suggested seeking a peaceful resolution , while others favored continuing the war . Those who favored war were divided between two tactics : occupy <unk> and Torrelobatón , a less ambitious proposal defended by Pero <unk> de la Vega ; or lay siege to Burgos , a tactic favored by Padilla . 
 = = = Military initiatives in Palencia and Burgos = = = 
 In the far north of Castile , the rebel army began a series of operations conducted by Antonio de Acuña , bishop of Zamora . They received orders from the Junta on December 23 to try and raise a rebellion in Palencia . They were tasked with expelling royalists , collecting taxes on behalf of the Junta , and creating an administration sympathetic to the comuneros cause . Acuña 's army made a series of raids into the area around Dueñas , raising more than 4 @,@ 000 ducats and inspiring the peasantry . He returned to Valladolid in early 1521 , then came back to Dueñas on January 10 to begin a major offensive against the nobles of Tierra de Campos . The nobles ' land and holdings were completely devastated . 
 In mid @-@ January , Pedro de Ayala , Count of Salvatierra , joined the comuneros and organized an army of about two thousand men who set about raiding the north of Castile . Nearby , Burgos awaited the fulfillment of the pledges made by Cardinal Adrian after they had joined the royalist cause two months prior . The slow response led to dissatisfaction and uncertainty in the city . Ayala and Acuña , aware of this situation , decided to besiege Burgos , Ayala from its north and Acuña from its south . They also sought to undermine the defenses by encouraging a revolt of the inhabitants of Burgos . 
 = = = Royalist response = = = 
 Still in Germany , Charles V issued the Edict of Worms on December 17 , 1520 ( not to be confused with the Edict of Worms of May 25 , 1521 , against Martin Luther ) , which condemned 249 prominent Comunidad members . For secular rebels , the punishment was death ; clergy were to receive lighter penalties . Similarly , the edict also declared that those who supported the Comunidades were traitors , disloyal , rebels , and infidels . 
 The Royal Council 's next move was the occupation of Ampudia in Palencia , a town loyal to the Count of Salvatierra . The Junta sent Padilla to meet Acuña ; their combined force besieged the royal army at the castle of <unk> . The royal army slipped away by nightfall , and <unk> was forced to pay tribute to avoid being pillaged . Ampudia was recovered by the rebels the next day , January 16 . 
 Meanwhile , the rebellion in Burgos scheduled for January 23 was a failure due to poor coordination with the besieging army ; it started two days early and was easily crushed . The comuneros of Burgos had to surrender , and this was the last rebellion to be seen in Castile . 
 = = Rebel campaigns of early 1521 = = 
 = = = Padilla 's decision on the rebels ' next move = = = 
 After abandoning the siege of Burgos due to the failure of its revolt , Padilla decided to return to Valladolid , while Acuña opted to resume his skirmishing and harassment of noble properties around Tierra de Campos . With this series of actions , Acuña intended to destroy or occupy the homes of the prominent nobles . The rebels now set themselves completely against the manorial system . This would be one of the strongest features of the second phase of the rebellion . 
 After the recent setbacks suffered by the comuneros , Padilla realized that they needed a victory to raise morale . He decided to take Torrelobatón and its castle . Torrelobatón was a stronghold halfway between Tordesillas and Medina de Rioseco , and was very close to Valladolid . Taking it would grant the rebels an excellent fortress for launching military operations and remove a threat on Valladolid . 
 = = = Battle of Torrelobatón = = = 
 On February 21 , 1521 , the siege of Torrelobatón began . Outnumbered , the town nevertheless resisted for four days , thanks to its walls . On February 25 , the comuneros entered the town and subjected it to a massive looting spree as a reward to the troops . Only churches were spared . The castle resisted for another two days . The comuneros then threatened to hang all of the inhabitants , at which point the castle surrendered . The defenders did secure an agreement to spare half of the goods inside the castle , thus avoiding further looting . 
 The victory in Torrelobatón lifted the spirits of the rebel camp while worrying the royalists about the rebel advance , exactly as Padilla hoped . The faith of the nobles in Cardinal Adrian was again shaken , as he was accused of having done nothing to avoid losing Torrelobatón . The Constable of Castile began to send troops to the Tordesillas area to contain the rebels and prevent any further advances . 
 Despite the renewed enthusiasm among the rebels , a decision was made to remain in their positions near Valladolid without pressing their advantage or launching a new attack . This caused many of the soldiers to return to their home communities , tired of waiting for salaries and new orders . This was a problem the comunero forces had throughout the war ; they possessed only a small number of full @-@ time soldiers , and their militias were constantly " dissolving and recruiting . " A serious attempt to negotiate a peaceful end to the war was tried again by the moderates , but was undercut by extremists of both sides . 
 In the north , after the failure of the siege of Burgos in January , the Count of Salvatierra resumed his campaign . He set off to cause an uprising in <unk> , the homeland of the Constable of Castile , and besieged Medina de Pomar and Frías . 
 = = = Acuña 's southern campaign = = = 
 William de Croÿ , the young Flemish Archbishop of Toledo appointed by Charles , died in January 1521 in Worms , Germany . In Valladolid , the Junta proposed to Antonio de Acuña that he submit himself as a candidate for the seat . 
 Acuña departed for Toledo in February with a small force under his command . He traveled south , declaring his impending claim on the archdiocese to every village as he passed . This raised enthusiasm among the commoners , who received him with cheers , but aroused suspicion in the aristocracy . They feared Acuña might attack their holdings as he did in Tierra de Campos . The Marquis of Villena and Duke of <unk> contacted Acuña and persuaded him to sign a pact of mutual neutrality . 
 Acuña soon had to confront Antonio de Zúñiga , who had been appointed commander of the royalist army in the Toledo area . Zúñiga was a prior in the Knights of St. John , who maintained a base in Castile at the time . Acuña received information that Zúñiga was in the area of Corral de <unk> , and pursued battle with him near <unk> . Zúñiga drove the rebel forces off , and then launched a counterattack of his own between Lillo and El <unk> , inflicting a crushing defeat on Acuña . Acuña , a relentless self @-@ promoter , tried to minimize the loss and even claimed that he had emerged victorious from the confrontation . 
 Undaunted , Acuña continued into Toledo . He appeared at the <unk> Plaza in the heart of the city on March 29 , 1521 , Good Friday . The crowd gathered around him and took him directly to the cathedral , claiming the archbishop 's chair for him . The next day he met with María Pacheco , wife of Juan de Padilla and de facto leader of the Toledo Comunidad in her husband 's absence . A brief rivalry emerged between the two , but it was resolved after mutual attempts at reconciliation . 
 Once settled in the archdiocese of Toledo , Acuña began to recruit any men he could find , enlisting soldiers from fifteen to sixty years old . After royalist troops burned the town of Mora on April 12 , Acuña returned to the countryside with roughly 1 @,@ 500 men under his command . He moved into <unk> , and from there conducted raids and operations against royalist @-@ controlled rural areas . He first attacked and pillaged <unk> de la <unk> , then faced Zúñiga again in an inconclusive battle near the Tagus river in Illescas . Light skirmishing near Toledo would continue until news of Villalar ended the war . 
 = = Battle of Villalar = = 
 In early April 1521 , the royalist side moved to combine their armies and threaten Torrelobatón . The Constable of Castile moved his troops ( including soldiers recently transferred from the defense of Navarre ) southwest from Burgos to meet with the Admiral 's forces near Tordesillas . Meanwhile , the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobatón , which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred . Their forces were suffering from desertions , and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobatón 's castle vulnerable . Juan de Padilla considered withdrawing to Toro to seek reinforcements in early April , but wavered . He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23 , losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in <unk> . 
 The combined royalist army pursued the comuneros . Again , the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry , with their army consisting of 6 @,@ 000 infantry and 2 @,@ 400 cavalry against Padilla 's 7 @,@ 000 infantry and 400 cavalry . Heavy rain slowed Padilla 's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels ' 1 @,@ 000 arquebusiers nearly useless . Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of Vega de <unk> , but his infantry was too slow . He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar . The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks , and the battle became a slaughter . There were an estimated 500 – 1 @,@ 000 rebel casualties and many desertions . 
 The three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured : Juan de Padilla , Juan Bravo , and Francisco Maldonado . They were beheaded the next morning in the Plaza of Villalar , with a large portion of the royalist nobility present . The remains of the rebel army at Villalar fragmented , with some attempting to join Acuña 's army near Toledo and others deserting . The rebellion had been struck a crippling blow . 
 = = End of the war = = 
 After the Battle of Villalar , the towns of northern Castile soon succumbed to the king 's troops , with all its cities returning their allegiance to the king by early May . Only Madrid and Toledo kept their Comunidades alive . 
 = = = Resistance of Toledo = = = 
 The first news of Villalar arrived in Toledo on April 26 , but was largely ignored by the local Comunidad . The magnitude of the defeat became apparent in a few days , after the first survivors began arriving in the city and confirmed the fact that the three rebel leaders had been executed . Toledo was declared in mourning over the death of Juan de Padilla . 
 After the death of Padilla , Bishop Acuña lost popularity in favour of María Pacheco , Padilla 's widow . People began to suggest negotiating with the royalists , seeking to avoid further suffering in the city . The situation looked even worse after the surrender of Madrid on May 11 . The fall of Toledo seemed only to be a matter of time . 
 However , one ray of hope remained for the rebels . Castile had withdrawn some of its troops from occupied Navarre to fight the comuneros , and King Francis I of France used the opportunity to invade with support from the Navarrese . The royalist army was forced to march on Navarre to respond rather than besiege Toledo . Acuña left Toledo to travel to Navarre , but he was recognized and caught . It is disputed whether he was seeking to join the French and continue fighting , or was simply fleeing . 
 María Pacheco took control of the city and the remains of the rebel army , living in the Alcázar , collecting taxes , and strengthening defenses . She requested the intervention of her uncle , the respected Marquis of Villena , to negotiate with the Royal Council , hoping he would be able to obtain better concessions . The Marquis eventually abandoned the negotiations , and María Pacheco took on personal negotiations with Prior Zúñiga , the commander of the besieging forces . Her demands , though somewhat galling to honor , were ultimately minor , such as guaranteeing the property and reputation of her children . 
 Still concerned about the French , the royal government gave in . With the support of all parties , the surrender of Toledo was orchestrated on October 25 , 1521 . Thus , on October 31 the comuneros left the Alcázar of Toledo and new officials were appointed to run the city . The truce guaranteed the freedom and property of all the comuneros . 
 = = = Revolt of February 1522 = = = 
 The new administrator of Toledo restored order and brought the city back under royal control . However , he also provoked former comuneros . María Pacheco continued her presence in the city and refused to hand over all the hidden weapons until Charles V personally signed the agreements reached with the Order of St. John . This unstable situation came to an end on February 3 , 1522 , when the generous terms of the surrender were annulled . Royal soldiers filled the city and the administrator ordered Pacheco 's execution . Riots broke out in protest . The incident was temporarily remedied thanks to the intervention of María de Mendoza , the sister of María Pacheco . Another truce was granted , and while the former comuneros were defeated , the distraction was exploited by María Pacheco to escape to Portugal disguised as a farmer . 
 = = = Pardon of 1522 = = = 
 Charles V returned to Spain on July 16 , 1522 . Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur , but only sporadically . Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros , or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king , and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much . 
 Back in Valladolid , Charles declared a general pardon on November 1 . The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros , a small figure given the huge number of rebels . Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the 293 excluded from the pardon . More pardons were issued later , after pressure from the Cortes ; by 1527 , the repression was completely at end . Of the 293 , 23 were executed , 20 died in prison , 50 purchased amnesty , and 100 were pardoned later . The fates of the rest are unknown . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 María Pacheco successfully escaped to Portugal , where she lived in exile the remaining ten years of her life . Bishop Acuña , captured in Navarre , was stripped of his ecclesiastical standing and executed after he killed a guard while trying to escape . Pedro Girón received a pardon conditional on him going into exile to Oran in North Africa , where he served as a commander against the Moors . Queen Joanna was locked in Tordesillas by her son . She would remain there for thirty @-@ five years , the rest of her life . 
 Emperor Charles V would go on to rule one of the largest and most sprawling empires in European history . As a consequence , Charles was nearly constantly at war , fighting France , England , the Papal States , the Ottoman Turks , the Aztecs , the Incas , and the Protestant Schmalkaldic League during his reign . Spain would provide the bulk of the Habsburgs ' armies and financial resources over this period . Charles placed Castilians in high governmental positions in both Castile and the Empire at large , and generally left the administration of Castile in Castilian hands . In that sense , the revolt could be considered successful . 
 Some of the reforms of Isabella I which reduced noble power were reversed as a price for luring the nobility to the royalist side . However , Charles understood that noble encroachment of power had helped cause the revolt , and embarked upon a new reform program . Unpopular , corrupt , and ineffective officials were replaced ; judicial functions of the Royal Council were limited ; and local courts were revitalized . Charles also adjusted the membership of the Royal Council ; its hated president was replaced , the aristocracy 's role reduced , and more gentry were added to it . Realizing that the urban elite needed to have a stake in the royal government once more , Charles gave many of them positions , privileges , and government salaries . The Cortes , while not as important as the comuneros had hoped , nevertheless maintained its power ; it was still required to approve new taxes and could advise the king . Charles also discouraged his officials from using overly coercive methods , after seeing his heavy @-@ handed treatment of the Cortes of Corunna backfire . If anything , the co @-@ option of the middle class worked too well ; when Charles ' successor King Phillip II demanded a <unk> large tax increase in the 1580s , the Cortes was too dependent on the Crown for money to effectively resist policies that would wreck the economy . 
 = = Later influence = = 
 The revolt , fresh in the memory of Spain , is referenced in several literary works during Spain 's Golden Age . Don Quixote references the rebellion in a conversation with Sancho , and Francisco de Quevedo uses the word " comunero " as a synonym for " rebel " in his works . 
 In the 18th century , the comuneros were not held in high regard by the Spanish Empire . The government was not amenable to encouraging rebellions , and only used the term to condemn opposition . In the Revolt of the Comuneros in Paraguay , the rebels did not take the name willingly ; it was only meant to disparage them as traitors . Another Revolt of the Comuneros in New Granada ( modern Colombia ) was similarly unrelated to the original except in name . 
 At the beginning of the 19th century , the image of the comuneros began to be rehabilitated by scholars such as Manuel Quintana as precursors of freedom and martyrs against absolutism . The decline of Castilian liberty was linked to the later decline of Spain . The first major commemorative event came in 1821 , the third centenary of the Battle of Villalar . Juan Martín Díez , a nationalistic liberal military leader who had fought in the resistance against Napoleon , led an expedition to find and exhume the remains of the three leaders executed in 1521 . Díez praised the comuneros on behalf of the liberal government in power at the time , likely the first positive governmental recognition for their cause . This view was challenged by conservatives who viewed a centralized state as modern and progressive , especially after the anarchy and fragmentation of the 1868 Revolution in Spain . Manuel <unk> , a conservative government minister , published the six @-@ volume Historia <unk> y <unk> de las Comunidades de Castilla from 1897 – 1900 , one of the most important works of scholarship on the revolt . Drawing on collected original sources , <unk> emphasized the fiscal demands of the comuneros , and cast them as traditionalist , reactionary , medieval , and feudal . Though a liberal , intellectual Gregorio Marañón shared the dim view of the comuneros that again prevailed in Spain ; he cast the conflict as one between a modern , progressive state open to beneficent foreign influence against a conservative , reactionary , and xenophobic Spain hypersensitive to religious and cultural deviance with an insistence on spurious racial purity . 
 General Franco 's government from 1939 – 1975 also encouraged an unfavorable interpretation of the comuneros . According to approved historians such as José María <unk> , the revolt was fundamentally an issue of petty Spanish regionalism , something which Franco did his best to discourage . Additionally , the comuneros did not properly appreciate Spain 's " imperial destiny . " 
 Since the mid @-@ twentieth century , others have sought more materialist reasons for the revolt . Historians such as José Antonio <unk> and Joseph Pérez portray the developing revolt as alliances of different social coalitions around shifting economic interests , with the " industrial bourgeoisie " of artisans and <unk> combining with the intellectuals and the low nobility against the aristocrats and the merchants . <unk> , who views the revolt as one of the first modern revolutions , especially stresses the ideological conflict and intellectual nature of the revolt , with features such as the first proposed written constitution of Castile . 
 With Spain 's transition to democracy following Franco 's death , celebration of the comuneros started to become permissible again . On April 23 , 1976 , a small ceremony was held clandestinely in Villalar ; only two years later , in 1978 , the event had become a huge demonstration of 200 @,@ 000 in support of Castilian autonomy . The autonomous community of Castile and León was created in response to public demand in 1983 , and it recognized April 23 as an official holiday in 1986 . Similarly , each February 3 since 1988 has been celebrated by the Castilian nationalist party Tierra <unk> in Toledo . The celebration highlights the roles of Juan de Padilla and María Pacheco , and is done in memory of the rebellion in 1522 , the last event of the war .

 " Sexual Harassment " is the second episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's eighth episode overall . The episode was written by B. J. Novak and directed by Ken Kwapis . The episode first aired in the United States on September 27 , 2005 on NBC . " Sexual Harassment " introduced the character of Todd Packer , played by David Koechner , who would become a recurring character on the series . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is concerned when he believes Dunder Mifflin is targeting him for sexual harassment training . Meanwhile , Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) anxiously awaits the arrival of her mother , and Michael 's obnoxious friend Todd Packer ( David Koechner ) spends the day in the office . 
 Novak was inspired to write the episode after attending an NBC sexual harassment seminar that the cast and crew had to attend before the series began . Many jokes and personal experiences involving sexual harassment were added into the script . This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter , which is rare for a network comedy . Novak explained that he had to fight NBC to get the word " boner " on the air . One station refused to air the episode due to the language . " Sexual Harassment " received moderately positive reviews from television critics . The episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 13 million viewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Michael Scott 's ( Steve Carell ) " best friend forever " Todd Packer ( David Koechner ) offends the staff with crude gossip about an upper management scandal . Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) informs Michael that he will conduct a review of the company 's sexual harassment policies because the CFO resigned after allegations made by his secretary . Michael 's indignation that this will put a damper on his easygoing office environment rises to outrage when he learns that the corporate headquarters is sending down a lawyer to talk to him . Michael and the warehouse staff mock the sexual harassment video , but the crude remarks come to a screeching halt when Jan Levinson ( Melora Hardin ) and the lawyer arrive from Corporate . 
 While Michael angrily announces that he can no longer be friends with his staff and that he will never tell another joke again , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) goads Michael into breaking his vow immediately , to the approval of Packer . Michael 's attitude suddenly changes when he realizes that he is not in trouble , and that the lawyer 's job is to protect him . After Packer tells a crude joke at the expense of Phyllis , Michael defends her , telling the entire office that he finds Phyllis attractive and that the only thing he worries about when he 's near her " is getting a boner " . 
 Meanwhile , Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) waits with anticipation for her mother ( Shannon Cochran ) to arrive from out of town . Pam 's mother arrives and asks in whispers ( <unk> by an embarrassed Pam ) , " Which one is Jim ? " Michael stops Packer when he tries to share another inappropriate joke and concludes with his misguided thoughts on sexual harassment .

 " Sexual Harassment " was written by B. J. Novak , who also acts on the show as Ryan Howard . The episode was the third entry of the series directed by Ken Kwapis . Kwapis had previously directed " Pilot " and " Diversity Day " . The inspiration for the episode was the NBC sexual harassment seminar that the cast and crew had to attend before the series began . Having both worked in office environments prior to filming The Office , Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey both noted that on the days of sexual harassment seminars , they would be harassed by their co @-@ workers as a joke . This experience was added to the script for the episode . " Sexual Harassment " introduces Michael 's catchphrase " That 's what she said , " which writer B. J. Novak says was something he heard repeated in college . The " What has two thumbs and X ? This guy " joke also comes from Novak 's college days . Jenna Fischer later revealed that a good majority of Dwight 's exchange with Toby about female anatomy was improvised . 
 When it came time to cast Todd Packer , the crew 's first choice was David Koechner , who had starred alongside Carell in the hit 2004 comedy movie Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy . Production for the episode had to be delayed so that Koechner could be secured for the part . Novak noted that Koechner was one of the few actors who was " talented enough to make Steve Carell break up on set " , a feat that he notes was " worth " the delays . 
 When deciding what car Packer would own , writer B. J. Novak wanted to use a Mustang , but none were available . Producer Kent Zbornak decided to get Packer a red Chevrolet Corvette , which Novak now admits is " even better " . This episode aired with a warning that it contained adult content and subject matter , which is rare for a network comedy . Novak explained that he had to fight NBC to get the word " boner " on the air because the replacement — " <unk> " — didn 't have , according to Novak , " the same redemption for Michael at the end . " The disclaimer was a compromise . A station in Kentucky nevertheless refused to air this episode . Pam 's mother was played by Shannon Cochran in this episode of the series , in the first appearance of the character at this point in the show . Cochran was unable to return to play the character for the season six episode " Niagara " , due to scheduling conflicts with a year @-@ long theater contract , and was thus replaced by Linda Purl .

 " Sexual Harassment " received moderately positive reviews from critics . Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad wrote that the episode " was OK , nothing great . " Sciannamea went on to explain that the " subject was funny , but I thought the writers were trying too hard to push the envelope " , making the episode " uneven " . " Miss Alli " of Television Without Pity gave the episode a " B + " grade . Erik Adams of The A.V.

Adams was slightly critical of the main plot , noting that the show had " difficulty maintaining the comedic momentum " , but he reasoned that this was probably largely due to " Michael @-@ on @-@ defense " being a " difficult character to write " , because " there aren ’ t many good ways of displaying his humanity while he ’ s also fighting for the right to be an asshole .

 = Summerteeth = 
 Summerteeth is the third studio album by the Chicago alternative rock band Wilco . Released through Reprise Records on March 9 , 1999 , the album was heavily influenced lyrically by twentieth century literature , as well as singer Jeff Tweedy 's marital problems . Unlike previous albums , Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed in the studio with Pro Tools . Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio , a contrast to the band 's previous albums , which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs . 
 The album was met with critical acclaim from numerous outlets , including AllMusic , Chicago Tribune and The Village Voice . Summerteeth sold approximately 200 @,@ 000 copies — a modest number compared to the sales of their 1996 album Being There . Wilco agreed to remix " Can 't Stand It " with David Kahne to cater to radio markets , but the single failed to attract substantial airplay . 
 = = Production = = 
 Wilco released Being There in 1996 to a higher level of commercial success than its first album , A.M. , selling 300 @,@ 000 copies ( nearly double the number of its first record ) . After the promotional tour to support Being There , Wilco began to record tracks for a third album . The initial Summerteeth recording sessions were in November 1997 at Willie Nelson 's music studio in Spicewood , Texas . Lead singer Jeff Tweedy was particularly emotional during the sessions because he was upset that he was unable to spend time with his wife and son because of the constant touring schedule . As a result , the songs recorded then reflected an introspective view that was also influenced by literature that Tweedy was reading at the time . While touring , Tweedy would read books by Henry Miller , William H. Gass and John Fante . According to Tweedy : 
 I definitely wanted to get better at writing , and those things happened simultaneously with trying to read better . I would write tons of stuff in my head , and forget . Some songs on Being There , I don 't think I ever wrote any lyrics down ... To fight that , I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them . By writing things down , and putting more words into my head , it put more words in my mouth when I turned on the tape recorder to sing . 
 The sessions produced a number of songs , including " I 'm Always in Love " , " She 's a Jar " and the Henry Miller @-@ inspired murder ballad " Via Chicago " . Tweedy 's relationship with his wife Sue Miller became the inspiration for several of the songs , although she was portrayed mostly in a negative sense . Miller was reluctantly willing to give Tweedy the creative license to write songs , but was concerned about lyrics such as " she begs me not to hit her " from " She 's a Jar " . 
 Before the album was completed , Wilco decided to collaborate with Billy Bragg on the album that became Mermaid Avenue . Once the Mermaid Avenue sessions were completed , Wilco entered Chicago 's Kingsize <unk> with engineers Dave <unk> and Mike Hagler to finish Summerteeth . Tweedy and Bennett wanted to start the recording sessions again by experimenting with a new approach to mixing the songs . Unlike previous material , which was performed live in the studio , the pair heavily overdubbed many of the songs with Pro Tools . As a result , the contributions of other members were diminished . To complement the " bold , but depressing " lyrics , Tweedy relied more heavily on the production skills of the multi @-@ instrumentalist Jay Bennett , who played a variety of instruments besides his usual lead guitar and keyboard work , including Mellotron , tambourine and synthesizers . Bennett even played the bass guitar and drums when the bass guitarist John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer were not in the studio . Coomer was not pleased about a reduced role in the band : 
 After a series of personnel changes , Reprise Records sought to release a hit single from the album to increase album sales . Wilco agreed to do this " once and once only " on the basis that they wanted to cooperate with the label that allowed them such freedom . The band and Reprise executives agreed to re @-@ mix " Can 't Stand It " to make it more radio @-@ friendly . Within one day , the song was remixed into the version that appeared on Summerteeth , cutting out portions of the bridge and adding bells . " Can 't Stand It " failed to cross over from adult album alternative to modern rock radio stations .

 Upon release , Summerteeth peaked at number 78 on the Billboard 200 . It was their first album to chart in the top 40 in the United Kingdom . By 2003 , it had sold over 200 @,@ 000 copies . The album was placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics ' poll for 1999 , and Pitchfork gave it position 31 in its list of the best albums of the 1990s . 
 Jason Ankeny of AllMusic gave the album five stars , lauding its " lush string arrangements and gorgeous harmonies " . Ankeny also compared the music on the album to The Band in their prime . Pitchfork Media writer Neil Lieberman praised how Wilco " craft [ ed ] an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself " and how Bennett " paint [ ed ] the album in Technicolor " . Robert Christgau gave the album a two @-@ star honorable mention , calling it " old @-@ fashioned <unk> lacking not pedal steel , who cares , but the concreteness modern <unk> eschews " . The Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot championed the album in his review and ranked it the year 's best album , calling it " pop so gorgeous it belies the intricate studio experimentation that brought it to life " .

 = Halton Castle = 
 Not to be confused with Alton Castle . 
 Halton Castle is in the former village of Halton which is now part of the town of Runcorn , Cheshire , England . The castle is situated on the top of Halton Hill , a sandstone prominence overlooking the village . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and a scheduled ancient monument . 
 It was the seat of the Barons of Halton from the 11th century until the 14th century and it then passed to the Duchy of Lancaster . It was besieged twice in the Civil War after which its structure deteriorated . In the 18th century a new courthouse was built on the site of the previous gatehouse . The castle lies in ruins apart from the courthouse which has been converted into a public house . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Building and administration = = = 
 Although there is no surviving evidence , it is likely that Halton Hill was a settlement in prehistoric times . Following the Norman conquest , the Barony of Halton was established by Hugh Lupus , Earl of Chester . The first baron to be appointed was Nigel of Cotentin and it is almost certain that he would have built a motte and bailey castle on the site , constructing it from wood , although the excavations in 1986 – 87 showed no evidence of a motte and bailey structure or of a timber tower or palisade . It is most probable that during the 12th century the wooden structure was replaced by a castle built from the local sandstone although no documentary evidence of this remains . Details of the building works are obscure but it has been suggested that John of Gaunt , the 14th baron , made alterations to the castle but this again has not been confirmed by documentary evidence . When the 15th baron , Henry Bolingbroke , ascended the throne as King Henry IV , the castle became the property of the Duchy of Lancaster . 
 The earliest documentary evidence of building work at Halton Castle shows that during the 15th century and into the 16th century it was regularly maintained . Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built . There is no evidence that the castle featured in the Wars of the Roses ; this would have been unlikely because of its relatively obscure position . However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair . During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison , an administrative centre , and a court of law . In 1580 – 81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants , but there is no evidence that it was ever used for that purpose . 
 = = = Royal visits = = = 
 There is little evidence of any visits by eminent people to the castle , although there is a belief that in 1207 King John visited and donated £ 5 towards the upkeep of its chapel . Edward II certainly visited the castle and was there for three days in November 1323 , during which time he also visited Norton Priory . 
 = = = Civil War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Civil War the castle was garrisoned by the Royalists under the command of Captain Walter Primrose who had been appointed by Earl Rivers . It was besieged by Parliamentary forces under Sir William Brereton in 1643 , and the Royalists eventually surrendered after several weeks . On hearing of the approach of superior Royalist forces led by Prince Rupert , the Parliamentarians abandoned the castle and it was held again for the Royalists under Colonel Fenwick . There was a second siege in 1644 but , as the fortunes of the Royalists declined elsewhere , they withdrew from Halton and the Parliamentarians under Sir William Brereton re @-@ occupied the castle . In 1646 a " Council of War " was held in Warrington where it was decided that the defences of the castles at Halton and Beeston were to be dismantled . In time this was achieved and Halton castle was to have no further military function . By 1650 the castle was said to be " very ruinous " . 
 = = = More recent history = = = 
 The condition of the building continued to deteriorate although the gatehouse remained in use as a court . In 1728 George Cholmondeley , 2nd Earl of Cholmondeley leased the site from the Crown . In 1737 a courthouse was built on the site of the medieval gatehouse . Henry Sephton , a Liverpool architect and builder and John Orme , a joiner from Prescot , were appointed to carry out the work . The first floor was the courtroom and prisoners were held in the basement . By 1792 the courthouse had fallen into disrepair and money was found to repair it , although the source of that money is unclear . The court continued to function there until 1908 . 
 Around 1800 three folly walls had been added to the existing ruined walls on the east side of the castle to make it look more impressive from Norton Priory , the home of Sir Richard Brooke . One of these walls was demolished around 1906 . During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure . In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council . In 1986 – 87 the site of the castle was excavated . 
 = = Present state = = 
 The castle continues to be owned by the Duchy of Lancaster and the site is managed by the Norton Priory Museum Trust . The interior of the castle is occasionally opened to the public and there are plans to make it more accessible in the future . The castle is a Grade I listed building . Its walls are in a ruinous state but the circumference is intact and it is possible to walk completely around the exterior . From its prominent position there are extensive views in all directions , including Lancashire , Cheshire , the Pennines , the hills of the Peak District and the mountains of North Wales . The courthouse is now a public house , the Castle Hotel . Its first floor is used as a function room and the basement contains the cellars of the public house . It is designated as a Grade II * listed building . 
 = Hindu – German Conspiracy = 
 The Hindu – German Conspiracy ( Note on the name ) was a series of plans between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalist groups to attempt Pan @-@ Indian rebellion against the British Raj during World War I , formulated between the Indian revolutionary underground and exiled or self @-@ exiled nationalists who formed , in the United States , the Ghadar Party , and in Germany , the Indian independence committee , in the decade preceding the Great War . The conspiracy was drawn up at the beginning of the war , with extensive support from the German Foreign Office , the German consulate in San Francisco , as well as some support from Ottoman Turkey and the Irish republican movement . The most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a Pan @-@ Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army from Punjab to Singapore . This plot was planned to be executed in February 1915 with the aim of overthrowing British rule over the Indian subcontinent . The February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement and arrested key figures . Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed . 
 Other related events include the 1915 Singapore Mutiny , the Annie Larsen arms plot , the Jugantar – German plot , the German mission to Kabul , the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India , as well as , by some accounts , the Black Tom explosion in 1916 . Parts of the conspiracy included efforts to subvert the British Indian Army in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. 
 The Indo @-@ German alliance and the conspiracy were the target of a worldwide British intelligence effort , which was successful in preventing further attempts . American intelligence agencies arrested key figures in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair in 1917 . The conspiracy resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu – German Conspiracy Trial — at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States . 
 This series of events was consequential to the Indian independence movement . Though largely subdued by the end of World War I , it came to be a major factor in reforming the Raj 's Indian policy . Similar efforts were made during World War II in Germany and in Japanese @-@ controlled Southeast Asia , where Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army respectively , and in Italy where Mohammad Iqbal <unk> formed the <unk> Azad <unk> . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nationalism had become more and more prominent in India throughout the last decades of the 19th century as a result of the social , economic and political changes instituted in the country through the greater part of the century . The Indian National Congress , founded in 1885 , developed as a major platform for loyalists ' demands for political liberalisation and for increased autonomy . The nationalist movement grew with the founding of underground groups in the 1890s . It became particularly strong , radical and violent in Bengal and in Punjab , along with smaller but nonetheless notable movements in Maharashtra , Madras and other places of South India . In Bengal the revolutionaries more often than not recruited the educated youth of the urban middle @-@ class <unk> community that epitomised the " classic " Indian revolutionary , while in Punjab the rural and military society sustained organised violence . 
 = = = Indian revolutionary underground = = = 
 The controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact . Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad , it became a focal issue for Indian revolutionaries . Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century . Several significant events took place . These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants , prominent public figures and Indian informants , including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant @-@ Governor Sir Andrew Fraser . Matters came to a head when the 1912 Delhi – Lahore Conspiracy , led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose , attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India , Charles Hardinge . In the aftermath of this event , the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground . Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time , Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years . By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914 , the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal . In Bengal the movement , with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore , had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration . The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon 's Report on Revolutionary Organisation , which reported that Jatin Mukherjee ( Bagha Jatin ) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter 's visit to Calcutta in 1912 , and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition . At the same time an increasingly strong pan @-@ Islamic movement started developing , mainly in the north and north @-@ west regions of India . With the onset of the war in 1914 , the members of this movement formed an important component of the conspiracy . 
 At the time of the partition of Bengal , <unk> Krishna Varma founded India House in London and received extensive support from notable expatriate Indians including Madam <unk> Cama , Lala Lajpat Rai , S. R. Rana , and Dadabhai Naoroji . The organisation – ostensibly a residence for Indian students – in reality sought to promote nationalist opinion and pro @-@ independence work . India House drew young radical activists of the likes of M. L. Dhingra , V. D. Savarkar , V. N. Chatterjee , M. P. T. Acharya and Lala Har Dayal . It developed links with the revolutionary movement in India and nurtured it with arms , funds and propaganda . The authorities in India banned Indian Sociologist and other literature published by the House as " seditious " . Under V. D. Savarkar 's leadership , the House rapidly developed as a centre for intellectual and political activism and as a <unk> ground for radical revolutionaries among Indian students in Britain , earning the moniker " The most dangerous organisation outside India " from Valentine <unk> . In 1909 in London M. L. Dhingra fatally shot Sir W. H. Curzon Wyllie , political aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Secretary of State for India . In the aftermath of the assassination , the Metropolitan Police and the Home Office rapidly suppressed India House . Its leadership fled to Europe and to the United States of America . Some ( like Chatterjee ) moved to Germany ; Har Dayal and many others moved to Paris . 
 Organisations founded in the United States and in Japan emulated the example of London 's India House . Krishna Varma nurtured close interactions with Turkish and Egyptian nationalists and with Clan na Gael in the United States . The joint efforts of Mohammed Barkatullah , S. L. Joshi and George Freeman founded the Pan @-@ Aryan Association — modelled after Krishna Varma 's Indian Home Rule Society — in New York in 1906 . Barkatullah himself had become closely associated with Krishna Varma during a previous stay in London , and his subsequent career in Japan put him at the heart of Indian political activities there . Myron <unk> , an acquaintance of Krishna Varma and an admirer of Swami Vivekananda , founded an " India House " in Manhattan in New York in January 1908 . Amidst a growing Indian student population , erstwhile members of the India House in London succeeded in extending the nationalist work across the Atlantic . The Gaelic American reprinted articles from the Indian Sociologist , while liberal press @-@ laws allowed free circulation of the Indian Sociologist . Supporters could ship such nationalist literature and pamphlets freely across the world . New York increasingly became an important centre for the Indian movement , such that Free Hindustan — a political revolutionary journal closely mirroring the Indian Sociologist and the Gaelic American published by Taraknath Das — moved in 1908 from Vancouver and Seattle to New York . Das established extensive collaboration with the Gaelic American with help from George Freeman before it was proscribed in 1910 under British diplomatic pressure . This Irish collaboration with Indian revolutionaries resulted in some of the early but failed efforts to smuggle arms into India , including a 1908 attempt on board a ship called the SS <unk> which sailed from New York for the Persian Gulf before it was searched at Smyrna . The Irish community later provided valuable intelligence , logistics , communication , media , and legal support to the German , Indian , and Irish conspirators . Those involved in this liaison , and later involved in the plot , included major Irish republicans and Irish @-@ American nationalists like John Devoy , Joseph <unk> , Roger Casement , Éamon de Valera , Father Peter Yorke and Larry de Lacey . These pre @-@ war contacts effectively set up a network which the German foreign office tapped into as war began in Europe . 
 = = = Ghadar Party = = = 
 Large @-@ scale Indian immigration to the Pacific coast of North America took place in the 20th century , especially from Punjab , which faced an economic depression . The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country . The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth . The community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same welcome and rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants . The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent , protests and anti @-@ colonial sentiments within the community . Faced with increasingly difficult situations , the community began organising itself into political groups . Many Punjabis also moved to the United States , but they encountered similar political and social problems . Meanwhile , India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910 , but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco . The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast , and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement . 
 The Ghadar Party , initially the ' Pacific Coast Hindustan Association ' , was formed in 1913 in the United States under the leadership of Har Dayal , with <unk> Singh <unk> as its president . It drew members from Indian immigrants , largely from Punjab . Many of its members were also from the University of California at Berkeley including Dayal , Tarak Nath Das , Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle . The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates , especially in the United States , Canada and Asia . Ghadar meetings were held in Los Angeles , Oxford , Vienna , Washington , D.C. , and Shanghai . 
 Ghadar 's ultimate goal was to overthrow British colonial authority in India by means of an armed revolution . It viewed the Congress @-@ led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter 's constitutional methods as soft . Ghadar 's foremost strategy was to entice Indian soldiers to revolt . To that end , in November 1913 Ghadar established the <unk> Ashram press in San Francisco . The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature . 
 Towards the end of 1913 , the party established contact with prominent revolutionaries in India , including Rash Behari Bose . An Indian edition of the Hindustan Ghadar essentially espoused the philosophies of anarchism and revolutionary terrorism against British interests in India . Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab , and Ghadarite publications that reached Bombay from California were deemed seditious and banned by the Raj . These events , compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the Delhi @-@ Lahore Conspiracy of 1912 , led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature , which emanated mostly from San Francisco . 
 = = = Germany and the Berlin Committee = = = 
 With the onset of World War I , an Indian revolutionary group called the Berlin Committee ( later called the Indian Independence Committee ) was formed in Germany . Its chief architects were C. R. Pillai and V. N. Chatterjee . The committee drew members from Indian students and erstwhile members of the India House including <unk> Bhattacharya , Dr. Abdul Hafiz , Padmanabhan Pillai , A. R. Pillai , M. P. T. Acharya and Gopal <unk> . Germany had earlier opened the Intelligence Bureau for the East headed by archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim . Oppenheim and Arthur Zimmermann , the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the German Empire , actively supported the Berlin committee , which had links with Jatin Mukherjee — a Jugantar Party member and at the time one of the leading revolutionary figures in Bengal . The office of the <unk> @-@ member committee at <unk> <unk> was accorded full embassy status . 
 The German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann @-@ Hollweg authorised German activity against British India as World War I broke out in September 1914 . Germany decided to actively support the Ghadarite plans . Using the links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany ( including Irish nationalist and poet Roger Casement ) and the German Foreign Office , Oppenheim tapped into the Indo @-@ Irish network in the United States . Har Dayal had helped organise the Ghadar party before his arrest in the United States in 1914 . He however jumped bail and made his way to Switzerland , leaving the party and publications in the charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj , who became the Ghadar president in 1914 . The German consulate in San Francisco was tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California . A naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von <unk> with the help of the Indian nationalist journalist Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles <unk> established links with Bharadwaj . Meanwhile , in Switzerland the Berlin committee was able to convince Har Dayal that organising a revolution in India was feasible .

 In May 1914 , the Canadian government refused to allow the 400 Indian passengers of the ship Komagata Maru to disembark at Vancouver . The voyage had been planned as an attempt to circumvent Canadian exclusion laws that effectively prevented Indian immigration . Before the ship reached Vancouver , German radio announced its approach , and British Columbian authorities prepared to prevent the passengers from entering Canada . The incident became a focal point for the Indian community in Canada which rallied in support of the passengers and against the government 's policies . After a two @-@ month legal battle , 24 of them were allowed to immigrate . The ship was escorted out of Vancouver by the Protected cruiser HMCS Rainbow and returned to India . On reaching Calcutta , the passengers were detained under the Defence of India Act at Budge Budge by the British Indian government , which made efforts to forcibly transport them to Punjab . This caused rioting at Budge Budge and resulted in fatalities on both sides . Ghadar leaders like Barkatullah and Taraknath Das used the inflammatory passions surrounding the Komagata Maru event as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party 's fold . 
 The British Indian Army , meanwhile , was contributing significantly to the Allied war effort in World War I. Consequently , a reduced force , estimated to have been 15 @,@ 000 troops in late 1914 , was stationed in India . It was in this scenario that concrete plans for organising uprisings in India were made . 
 In September 1913 a Ghadarite named <unk> Singh visited Shanghai to promote the nationalist cause amongst Indians there , followed by a visit to India in January 1914 when Singh circulated Ghadar literature amongst Indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for Hong Kong . Singh reported that the situation in India as favourable for revolution . 
 By October 1914 , many Ghadarites had returned to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations , spreading propaganda and literature , and arranging to get arms into the country . The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by <unk> Singh , left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August . They were to sail on to India , where they would be provided with arms to organise a revolt . At Canton , more Indians joined , and the group , now numbering about 150 , sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel . They were to be joined by more Ghadarites arriving in smaller groups . During September and October , about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia , <unk> Maru , China , Manchuria , SS <unk> Maru , SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru . Although the Korea 's party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta , a successful underground network was established between the United States and India , through Shanghai , Swatow , and Siam . <unk> Singh , the Ghadar operative in Shanghai , is believed to have spent $ 30 @,@ 000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India . The Ghadarites in India were able to establish contact with sympathisers within the British Indian Army as well as build networks with underground revolutionary groups . 
 = = = East Asia = = = 
 Efforts had begun as early as 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India . When a clear idea of the conspiracy emerged , more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support . Herambalal Gupta , who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee 's directives , took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission . Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms . While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause , obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult . 
 The revolutionaries started negotiations with the Chinese government through James Dietrich , who held Sun Yat @-@ sen 's power of attorney , to buy a million rifles . However , the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders . From China , Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement . However , he was forced into hiding within 48 hours when he came to know that the Japanese authorities planned to hand him over to the British . Later reports indicated he was protected at this time by Toyama Mitsuru right @-@ wing political leader and founder of the <unk> nationalist secret society . 
 The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore , a strong supporter of Pan @-@ Asianism , met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count <unk> , a former premier , in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement . Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany , on the grounds that American war preparation could actually be directed against Japan . Later in 1915 , Abani Mukherji — a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose — is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from Japan . The ascendancy of Li <unk> to Chinese Presidency in 1916 , led to the negotiations reopening through his former private secretary who resided in the United States at the time . In exchange for allowing arms shipments to India via China 's borders , China was offered German military assistance and the rights to 10 % of any material shipped to India via China . The negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful due to Sun Yat Sen 's opposition to an alliance with Germany .

 The Indian nationalists then in Paris had , with Egyptian revolutionaries , made plans to assassinate Lord Kitchener as early as 1911 . These plans were however not implemented . After the war began , this plan was revived , and Har Dayal 's close associate Gobind Behari Lal visited Liverpool in March 1915 from New York to put this plan in action . He may also have intended at this time to bomb the docks in Liverpool . However , these plans ultimately failed . Chattopadhyaya also attempted at this time to revive links with the remnants of India House that survived in London , and through Swiss , German and English sympathisers then resident in Britain . Among them were Meta Brunner ( a Swiss woman ) , <unk> <unk> ( an Indian man ) and his common law German wife Anna Brandt , and Hilda <unk> ( an English woman in Yorkshire ) . Chattopadhyaya 's correspondences were however traced by censor , leading to the arrest of the cell . Among other plans that were considered at the time were large scale conspiracies in June 1915 to assassinate the Foreign Secretary Lord Grey and War minister Lord Kitchener . In addition , they also intended to target the French President Raymond Poincaré and Prime Minister René Viviani , King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and his Prime Minister Antonio <unk> . These plans were coordinated with the Italian anarchists , with explosives manufactured in Italy . Barkatullah , by now in Europe and working with the Berlin Committee , arranged for these explosives to be sent to the German consulate in Zurich , from where it was expected to be taken charge of by an Italian anarchist named Bertoni . However , British intelligence was able to infiltrate this plot , and successfully pressed Swiss police to expel Abdul Hafiz . 
 In the United States , an elaborate plan and arrangement was made to ship arms from the country and from the Far East through Shanghai , Batavia , Bangkok and Burma . Even while Herambalal Gupta was on his mission in China and Japan , other plans were explored to ship arms from the United States and East Asia . The German high command decided early on that assistance to the Indian groups would be pointless unless given on a substantial scale . In October 1914 , German Vice Consul <unk> von Schack in San Francisco approved the arrangements for funds and armaments . $ 200 @,@ 000 worth of small arms and ammunition were acquired by the German military attaché Captain Franz von Papen through Krupp agents , and arranged for its shipment to India through San Diego , Java , and Burma . The arsenal included 8 @,@ 080 Springfield rifles of Spanish – American War vintage , 2 @,@ 400 Springfield carbines , 410 Hotchkiss repeating rifles , 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cartridges , 500 Colt revolvers with 100 @,@ 000 cartridges , and 250 Mauser pistols along with ammunition . The schooner Annie Larsen and the sailing ship SS Henry S were hired to ship the arms out of the United States and transfer it to the SS Maverick . The ownership of ships were hidden under a massive smokescreen involving fake companies and oil business in south @-@ east Asia . For the arms shipment itself , a successful cover was set up to lead British agents to believe that the arms were for the warring factions of the Mexican Civil War . This ruse was successful enough that the rival Villa faction offered $ 15 @,@ 000 to divert the shipment to a Villa @-@ controlled port . 
 Although the shipment was meant to supply the mutiny planned for February 1915 , it was not dispatched until June of that year , by which time the conspiracy had been uncovered in India and major leaders had been arrested or gone into hiding . The plot for the shipment itself failed when disastrous co @-@ ordination prevented a successful rendezvous off Socorro Island with the Maverick . The plot had already been infiltrated by British intelligence through Indian and Irish agents linked closely with the conspiracy . Upon returning to <unk> , Washington after several failed attempts , the Annie Larsen 's cargo was promptly seized by US customs . The cargo was sold at an auction despite the German Ambassador Count Johann von <unk> 's attempts to take possession , insisting they were meant for German East Africa . The Hindu – German Conspiracy Trial opened in 1917 in the United States on charges of gun running and at the time was one of the lengthiest and most expensive trials in American legal history . Franz von Papen attempted to sabotage rail lines in Canada and destroy the Welland Canal . He also attempted to supply rifles and dynamite to Sikhs in British Columbia to blast railway bridges . These plots in Canada did not materialise . Among other events in the United States that have been linked to the conspiracy is the Black Tom explosion when , on the night of 30 July 1916 , saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort . Although blamed solely on German agents at the time , later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen , the Irish movement , the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States .

 By the start of 1915 , many Ghadarites ( nearly 8 @,@ 000 in the Punjab province alone by some estimates ) had returned to India . However , they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis . Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion , many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore , Ferozepur and Rawalpindi . Various plans had been made to attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer , near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914 . In another plan , a group of Sikh soldiers , the <unk> <unk> , planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November . A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh . In Bengal , the Jugantar , through Jatin Mukherjee , established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta . In August 1914 , Mukherjee 's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company , a major gun manufacturing firm in India . In December 1914 , several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta . Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle . These rebellious acts , which were until then organised separately by different groups , were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India , V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra , and <unk> Sanyal in Benares . A plan was made for a unified general uprising , with the date set for 21 February 1915 . 
 = = = February 1915 = = = 
 In India , unaware of the delayed shipment and confident of being able to rally the Indian sepoy , the plot for the mutiny took its final shape . Under the plans , the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February . This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab , which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin , resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore . The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day ( which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized ) and was to strike immediately . However , Punjab CID successfully infiltrated the conspiracy at the last moment through a sepoy named Kirpal Singh . Sensing that their plans had been compromised , D @-@ Day was brought forward to 19 February , but even these plans found their way to the intelligence . Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 January were thwarted . Attempted revolts in the 26th Punjab , 7th Rajput , 130th Baluch , 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments were suppressed . Mutinies in Firozpur , Lahore , and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested , although some managed to escape or evade arrest . A last @-@ ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and V. G. Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut . Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore , but was arrested in Varanasi , and V. G. Pingle was apprehended in Meerut . Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces . Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan . Other leaders , including Giani Pritam Singh , Swami <unk> Puri and others fled to Thailand . 
 On 15 February , the 5th Light Infantry stationed at Singapore was among the few units to mutiny successfully . Nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied on the afternoon of the 15th , along with nearly a hundred men of the Malay States Guides . This mutiny lasted almost seven days , and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians . The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden , who were asked by the mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended the barracks after the mutineers had left ( sheltering some British refuges as well ) until the prison camp was relieved . The mutiny was suppressed only after French , Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements . Of 200 people tried at Singapore , 47 mutineers were shot in public executions , the rest were transported for life to East Africa . Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years . In all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled Some historians , including Hew Strachan , argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit , the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy . Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy . 
 = = = Christmas Day Plot = = = 
 In April 1915 , unaware of the failure of the Annie Larsen plan , Papen arranged , through Krupp 's American representative Hans Tauscher , a second shipment of arms , consisting of 7 @,@ 300 Springfield rifles , 1 @,@ 930 pistols , 10 Gatling guns and nearly 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cartridges . The arms were to be shipped in mid June to Surabaya in the East Indies on the Holland American steamship SS <unk> . However , the intelligence network operated by Courtenay Bennett , the Consul General to New York , was able to trace the cargo to Tauscher in New York and passed the information on to the company , thwarting these plans as well . In the meantime , even after the February plot had been scuttled , the plans for an uprising continued in Bengal through the Jugantar cohort under Jatin Mukherjee ( Bagha Jatin ) . German agents in Thailand and Burma , most prominently Emil and Theodor <unk> — brothers of the German Finance minister Karl Helfferich — established links with Jugantar through <unk> Lahiri in March that year . In April , Jatin 's chief lieutenant Narendranath Bhattacharya met with the <unk> and was informed of the expected arrival of the Maverick with arms . Although these were originally intended for Ghadar use , the Berlin Committee modified the plans , to have arms shipped into India to the eastern coast of India , through Hatia on the Chittagong coast , <unk> in the Sundarbans and Balasore in Orissa , instead of Karachi as originally decided . From the coast of the Bay of Bengal , these would be collected by Jatin 's group . The date of insurrection was fixed for Christmas Day 1915 , earning the name " The Christmas Day Plot " . Jatin estimated that he would be able to win over the 14th Rajput Regiment in Calcutta and cut the line to Madras at Balasore and thus take control of Bengal . Jugantar also received funds ( estimated to be Rs 33 @,@ 000 between June and August 1915 ) from the Helfferich brothers through a fictitious firm in Calcutta . However , it was at this time that the details of the Maverick and Jugantar plans were leaked to Beckett , the British Consul at Batavia , by a defecting Baltic @-@ German agent under the alias " Oren " . The Maverick was seized , while in India , police destroyed the underground movement in Calcutta as an unaware Jatin proceeded according to plan to the Bay of Bengal coast in Balasore . He was followed there by Indian police and on 9 September 1915 , he and a group of five revolutionaries armed with Mauser pistols made a last stand on the banks of the river <unk> <unk> . Seriously wounded in a gun battle that lasted seventy five minutes , Jatin died the next day in the town of Balasore . 
 To provide the Bengal group enough time to capture Calcutta and to prevent reinforcements from being rushed in , a mutiny coinciding with Jugantar 's Christmas Day insurrection was planned for Burma with arms smuggled in from neutral Thailand . Thailand ( Siam ) was a strong base for the Ghadarites , and plans for rebellion in Burma ( which was a part of British India at the time ) had been proposed by the Ghadar party as early as October 1914 , which called for Burma to be used as a base for subsequent advance into India . This Siam @-@ Burma plan was finally concluded in January 1915 . Ghadarites from branches in China and United States , including Atma Ram , Thakar Singh , and Banta Singh from Shanghai and <unk> Singh and Bhagwan Singh from San Francisco , attempted to infiltrate Burma Military Police in Thailand , which was composed mostly of Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims . Early in 1915 , Atma Ram had also visited Calcutta and Punjab and linked up with the revolutionary underground there , including Jugantar . Herambalal Gupta and the German consul at Chicago arranged to have German operatives George Paul Boehm , Henry Schult , and Albert <unk> sent to Siam through Manila with the purpose of training the Indians . <unk> Singh returned to Shanghai tasked to send two expeditions , one to reach the Indian border via Yunnan and the other to penetrate upper Burma and join with revolutionary elements there . The Germans , while in Manila , also attempted to transfer the arms cargo of two German ships , the Sachsen and the Suevia , to Siam in a schooner seeking refuge at Manila harbour . However , US customs stopped these attempts . In the meantime , with the help of the German Consul to Thailand Remy , the Ghadarite established a training headquarters in the jungles near the Thai @-@ Burma border for Ghadarites arriving from China and Canada . German Consul General at Shanghai , Knipping , sent three officers of the Peking Embassy Guard for training and in addition arranged for a Norwegian agent in Swatow to smuggle arms through . However , the Thai Police high command , which was largely British , discovered these plans and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the Austrian chargé d 'affaires . Thailand , although officially neutral , was allied closely with Britain and British India . On 21 July , the newly arrived British Minister Herbert Dering presented Foreign Minister Prince <unk> with the request for arrest and extradition of Ghadarites identified by the Indian agent , ultimately resulting in the arrest of leading Ghadarites in August . Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites , who were captured and later hanged . 
 Also to coincide with the proposed Jugantar insurrection in Calcutta was a planned raid on the penal colony in the Andaman Islands with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies . The raid would release the political prisoners , helping to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast . The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft , a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France . It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May 1915 , after consultation with the Indian committee , and the raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans . Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands . However , Vincent Kraft was a double agent , and leaked details of Knipping 's plans to British intelligence . His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by " Oren " , but given the successive failures of the Indo @-@ German plans , the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping . 
 = = = Afghanistan and the Middle East = = = 
 Another arm of the conspiracy was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East , while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war on the side of the Central Powers , which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan @-@ Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India . After Russia 's defeat in the 1905 Russo @-@ Japanese war , her influence had declined , and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub @-@ continent capable of directly threatening India . 
 In the spring of 1915 , an Indo @-@ German expedition was sent to Afghanistan via the overland route through Persia . Led by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap , this mission sought to invite the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan to break with Britain , declare his independence , join the war on the Central side , and invade British India . It managed to evade the considerable Anglo @-@ Russian efforts that were directed at intercepting it in Mesopotamia and in the Persian deserts before it reached Afghanistan in August 1915 . In Afghanistan , it was joined in Kabul by members of the pan @-@ Islamic group Darul Uloom Deoband led by Maulana <unk> Sindhi . This group had left India for Kabul at the beginning of the war while another group under Mahmud al @-@ Hasan made its way to Hijaz , where they hoped to seek support from the Afghan Emir , the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany for a pan @-@ Islamic insurrection beginning in the tribal belt of north @-@ west India . The Indo @-@ German mission pressed Emir Habibullah to break from his neutral stance and open diplomatic relations with Germany , eventually hoping to rally the Emir to the German war effort . Habibullah Khan vacillated on the mission 's proposals through much of the winter of 1915 , hoping to maintain his neutral stance till the course of the war offered a concrete picture . However , the mission opened at this time secret negotiations with the pro @-@ German elements in the Emir 's court and advisory council , including his brother <unk> Khan and son Amanullah Khan . It found support among Afghan intellectuals , religious leaders and the Afghan press which rallied with increasingly anti @-@ British and pro @-@ Central articles . By 1916 the Raj was forced to intercept copies of the Afghan newspaper Siraj al Akhbar sent to India . It raised to the Emir a threat of a coup d 'état in his country and unrest among his tribesmen , who were beginning to see him as subservient to British authority even as Turkey called for a pan @-@ Islamic Jihad . 
 In December 1915 , the Indian members founded the Provisional Government of India , which it was hoped would weigh on Habibullah 's advisory council to aid India and force the Emir 's hands . In January 1916 , the Emir approved a draft treaty with Germany to buy time . However , the Central campaign in the Middle East faltered at around this time , ending hopes that an overland route through Persia could be secured for aid and assistance to Afghanistan . The German members of the mission left Afghanistan in June 1916 , ending the German intrigues in the country . Nonetheless , Mahendra Pratap and his Provisional Government stayed behind , attempting to establish links with Japan , Republican China and Tsarist Russia . After the Russian revolution , Pratap opened negotiations with the Soviet Union , visiting Trotsky in Red Petrograd in 1918 , and Lenin in Moscow in 1919 and he visited the Kaiser in Berlin in 1918 . He pressed for a joint Soviet @-@ German offensive through Afghanistan into India . This was considered by the Soviets for some time after the 1919 coup in Afghanistan in which Amanullah Khan was instated as the Emir and the third Anglo @-@ Afghan war began . Pratap may also have influenced the " Kalmyk Project " , a Soviet plan to invade India through Tibet and the Himalayan buffer states . 
 In the Middle Eastern theatre , members of the Berlin Committee , including Har Dayal and M. P. T. Acharya , were sent on missions to Baghdad and Syria in the summer of 1915 , tasked to infiltrate the Indian Expeditionary Force in southern Mesopotamia and Egypt and to attempt to assassinate British officers . The Indian effort was divided into two groups , one consisting of a Bengali revolutionary P.N. Dutt ( alias Dawood Ali Khan ) and <unk> <unk> . This group arrived at Bushire , where they worked with Wilhelm <unk> and distributed nationalist and revolutionary literature among Indian troops in Mesopotamia and Persia . The other group , working with Egyptian nationalists , attempted to block the Suez Canal . These groups carried out successful clandestine work in spreading nationalist literature and propaganda amongst the Indian troops in Mesopotamia , and on one occasion even bombed an officer 's mess . Nationalist work also extended at this time to recruiting Indian prisoners of war in Constantinople , Bushire , Kut @-@ al @-@ Amara . M. P. T. Acharya 's own works were directed at forming the Indian National Volunteer Corps with the help of Indian civilians in Turkey , and to recruiting Indian prisoners of war . He is further known to have worked along with Wilhelm <unk> in Bushire amongst Indian troops . The efforts were , however , ultimately hampered by differences between the Berlin committee members who were predominantly Hindus , and Indian revolutionaries already in Turkey who were largely Muslims . Further , the Egyptian nationalists distrusted the Berlin Committee , which was seen by the former as a German instrument . 
 Nonetheless , in culmination of these efforts , Indian prisoners of war from France , Turkey , Germany , and Mesopotamia — especially Basra , Bushehr , and from Kut al Amara — were recruited , raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces on many fronts . The <unk> , led by Amba Prasad Sufi , attempted to organise incursions to the western border of India from Persia , through Balochistan , to Punjab . Amba Prasad was joined during the war by Kedar Nath Sondhi , Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry . These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there , and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes ' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans . The Aga Khan 's brother was killed while fighting the rebels . The rebels also successfully harassed British forces in Sistan in Afghanistan , confining them to <unk> in Balochistan , and later moving towards Karachi . Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of <unk> and <unk> . The Baluchi chief of <unk> , having declared his independence from British rule , also joined the Ghadarites . But the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces . The Ghadarite forces , their supply lines starved , were finally dislodged . They retreated to regroup at Shiraz , where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz . Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle , but the Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919 . By the end of 1917 , divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand , and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other . Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation , as well as <unk> in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation . The failure of the February plot , the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China 's participation in the war in 1917 , and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly . Infiltration by British agents , change in American attitude and stance , and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded . 
 = = Counter intelligence = = 
 British intelligence began to note and track outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy by as early as 1911 . Incidents like the Delhi @-@ Lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) of the existence of a large @-@ scale network and plans for pan @-@ Indian militant unrest . Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal — the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time — and on Punjab , which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru . Har Dayal 's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose , and were " cleaned up " in the wake of the Delhi bomb case . 
 = = = In Asia = = = 
 At the outbreak of the war , Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites , who often made little effort to hide their plans and objectives . These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy , and in discovering Har Dayal 's whereabouts . Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries . 
 In Punjab , the CID , although aware of possible plans for unrest , was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915 . A dedicated force was formed , headed by the Chief of Punjab CID , and including amongst its members <unk> Hayat Khan ( later head of Punjab CID himself ) . In February that year , the CID was successful in recruiting the services of Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan . Singh , who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry , was able to infiltrate the leadership , being assigned to work in his cousin 's regiment . Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy , but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence . As the date for the mutiny approached , a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the mutiny day to the evening of 19 February , which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day . No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him , and he rushed to inform <unk> Hayat Khan of the change of plans . Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled , Singh was detained by the would @-@ be mutineers , but managed to escape under the cover of answering the call of nature . 
 The role of German or Baltic @-@ German double @-@ agents , especially the agent named " Oren " , was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 and in as scuttling Bagha Jatin 's plans in winter that year . Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft , a planter from Batavia , who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured . Maps of the Bengal coast were found on Kraft when he was initially arrested and he volunteered the information that these were the intended landing sites for German arms . Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war . Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap 's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence .

 By the time the war broke out , the Indian Political Intelligence Office , headed by John Wallinger , had expanded into Europe . In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office , approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau . This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues . After the outbreak of the war Wallinger , under the cover of an officer of the British General Headquarters , proceeded to France where he operated from Paris , working with the French political police , the Sûreté . Among Wallinger 's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham , who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference . Among other enterprises , the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe . A British agent named Donald <unk> was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhyaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm II 's invitation . It is said that Somerset Maugham based several of his stories on his first @-@ hand experiences , modelling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath . The short story " Giulia <unk> " is a blend of <unk> 's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari 's story . Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories . 
 The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin 's plans . The network was in touch with the members in the United States , and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots . The American network , headed by E. V. <unk> , was a counter @-@ espionage network of nearly 80 members who , as Habsburg subjects , were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats . <unk> had begun working with Guy Gaunt , who headed Courtenay Bennett 's intelligence network , at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network , passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities . 
 In the Middle East , British counter @-@ intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph 's Jihad , while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission . The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan , and to protect British supply caravans in <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold . Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916 .

 In the United States , the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through Irish and Indian channels . The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W. C. Hopkinson , who was born and raised in India and spoke fluent Hindi . Initially Hopkinson had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath Das . The Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian <unk> on the East Coast as early as 1910 . Francis Cunliffe Owen , the officer heading the Home Office agency in New York , had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps , the famous New York advocate , as members of the Clan @-@ na @-@ Gael . Owens ' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS <unk> plan . The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans , sensing infiltration , encouraged formation of an exclusively Indian society . 
 Following this , several approaches were adopted , including infiltration through an Indian national named Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to Hopkinson , and through the use of the famous American Pinkerton 's detective agency . Bela Singh was later murdered in India in the 1930s . Hopkinson was assassinated in a Vancouver courthouse by a Ghadarite named <unk> Singh , in October , 1914 . Charles Lamb , an Irish double agent , is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution . An Indian operative , codenamed " C " and described most likely to have been the adventurous Chandra Kanta Chakravarty ( later the chief prosecution witness in the trial ) , also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence .

 The conspiracy led to several trials in India , most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial , which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny . Other trials included the Benares , Simla , Delhi , and Ferozepur conspiracy cases , and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge . At Lahore , a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial . Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence , 114 transported for life , and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment . Several of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands . Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted . The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot . Following the conclusion of the trial , diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably . 
 In the United States , the Hindu – German Conspiracy Trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on 12 November 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair . One hundred and five people participated , including members of the Ghadar Party , the former German Consul @-@ General and Vice @-@ Consul , and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco . The trial itself lasted from 20 November 1917 to 24 April 1918 . The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused , Ram Chandra , by a fellow defendant , Ram Singh , in a packed courtroom . Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal . In May 1917 , eight Indian nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain . In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an imperialist war . The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations . Strong public support in favour of the Indians , especially the revived Anglophobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles , allowed the Ghadarite movement to be revived despite British concerns .

 The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain 's policies , both within the empire and in international relations . The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911 . Alarmed at the agile organisation , which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others , the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan @-@ Indian revolutions were spreading through India " like some hidden fire " . A massive , concerted , and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement . Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen , while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned .

 The conspiracy , judged by the British Indian Government 's own evaluation at the time , and those of several contemporary and modern historians , was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century . 
 In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India , it was a major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915 . Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O 'Dwyer , then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab , and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement . It was also a factor that guided British political concessions and Whitehall 's India Policy during and after World War I , including the passage of Montagu – Chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917 . The events of the conspiracy during World War I , the presence of Pratap 's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union , and a still @-@ active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal ( as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India ) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt , an English judge . It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India , especially in Punjab and Bengal . On the recommendations of the committee , the Rowlatt Act , an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915 , was enforced in India . 
 The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy . At the time , British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India . The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention . News of young <unk> who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India . The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India . It was at this time that Mahatma Gandhi , until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene , began emerging as a mass leader . 
 Ominously , in 1919 , the Third Anglo @-@ Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah 's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission . In addition , in India , Gandhi 's call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests . The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly , with disruptions of rail , telegraph and communication systems . The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April , with some recording that " practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets , the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20 @,@ 000 . " In Amritsar , over 5 @,@ 000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh . This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days . Michael O 'Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill @-@ concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May , on the lines of the 1857 revolt , at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer . The Amritsar massacre , as well as responses preceding and succeeding it , contrary to being an isolated incident , was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy . James <unk> Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab , and the British response that ended in the massacre . 
 Lastly , British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India , which ultimately saw Gandhi 's rise in the Indian movement .
