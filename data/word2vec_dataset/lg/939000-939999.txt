 Hallingskeid Station ( Norwegian : Hallingskeid stasjon ) is a train station on the Bergensbanen line in the municipality of Ulvik in Hordaland county , Norway . Located at an elevation of 1 @,@ 110 meters ( 3 @,@ 640 ft ) above mean sea level , the station is situated inside a snow tunnel . It opened along with the central section of the line on 10 June 1908 and remained as a staffed station until 1982 . It is located on the Hardangervidda plateau in an area without population or road access . The station therefore serves trekkers and mountaineers . Only some of the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) trains stop at the station . 
 The original station building was designed by Paul Due , who used the same architectural plan for four other mountain stations on the line . The snow tunnel has caught fire five times . The fires in 1948 , 1953 and 2008 only caused minor damage to the tunnel itself . The 1960 fire burned @-@ down the tunnel , the station building and most of the station area . The last fire , in 2011 , had a Class 73 train caught in the tunnel ; both it and the tunnel were damaged beyond repair .

 The station was opened on 10 June 1908 , along with the rest of the central portion of the Bergen Line . The station building was of the Mountain Station Variant 1 type , designed by Paul Due . This made it identical to <unk> Station , and with only slight variations to <unk> Station , Finse Station and Myrdal Station . During construction , NSB built several buildings for their staff . Two of the houses and an assembly building have been preserved . They were built in 1900 and represent an example of buildings from the construction time . One is partially built in stone , partially in wood , while the other two are entirely in wood . All are now used as cabins . The sick ward for the <unk> was bought by Kari <unk> in 1909 converted to a hotel , named <unk> . 
 Because of the harsh winter conditions , the station area was gradually built with snow tunnels to keep the snow off the tracks . This included the platforms and most of the passing loop at the station . In 1914 – 15 , the station serviced 398 passengers , and in 1919 – 20 , it serviced 684 passengers , both times making it the least used station on the line . In 1948 , the western part of the snow tunnel caught fire , and although it spread to the station building , it was quickly put out by the staff . In 1953 , there was again a fire in the tunnel . 
 = = = 1960 fire = = = 
 In 1960 , there was a major fire which burned down most of the station area . On 22 October , two boys were playing with matches and had lit some wood shavings in the tunnel , about 100 meters ( 330 ft ) from the station building . The tunnel quickly caught on fire , which spread towards the other buildings . The fire was discovered by Station Master Mons <unk> , who immediately notified Bergen Station , Myrdal Station , and Finse Station . The morning expresses in both directions were en route to Hallingskeid , with the east @-@ bound train about half an hour away . It was forced to turn around at Myrdal , and the passengers were bused from Voss Station across the mountain . A train with a fire engine containing 20 @,@ 000 litres ( 4 @,@ 400 imp gal ; 5 @,@ 300 US gal ) of water was sent from Myrdal and a fire engine was dispatched from Finse , but the fire spread quickly and within an hour the station building , the guard house and 500 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of tunnel had burnt down . The incident occurred around noon . By 12 : 30 the next day , when the morning express passed the station , 500 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of track had been replaced . Work had been done by 100 men in two shifts around the clock . Four families with a total of fourteen people lost their houses in the fire . The fire caused the hotel to burn down , and it was never rebuilt . A new station building opened in 1970 was built on the same foundation as the old . 
 The section past the station took electric traction into use on 7 December 1964 . The station received automatic train control from 23 September 1982 , and starting on 1 October 1982 , the station became unmanned . On 2 October 2008 , there was a fire in a 100 @-@ meter ( 330 ft ) long snow tunnel 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) west of Hallingskeid . Traffic was stopped and a combination of a fire train and helicopter put out the fire . However , the track and overhead lines past the station were destroyed . The line re @-@ opened on 4 October . 
 = = = 2011 fire = = = 
 A fire started in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid on 16 June 2011 . It was caused by sparks from welding , which had been completed at 07 : 45 . A freight train passed through the station at 09 : 16 and the welders left the station at 09 : 30 . The passenger trains which caught on fire , pass through the station at 10 : 06 . As the station is unmanned , there was no prior warning of the fire until the driver saw it from the cab just as the train entered the tunnel . At nearly the same instance , he reached the point of the line were the fire had caused the power to cut . He immediately applied the emergency brake , which allowed the train to stop 5 to 10 meters ( 16 to 33 ft ) from the fire . Because the train had no power , it was not possible to reverse out . The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated , which took 15 to 20 minutes , and included two people in a wheelchair . Passengers were told to not bring any possessions with them , and many passengers lost valuables , such as laptop computers . All personnel acted according to regulations and no @-@ one was injured in the accident . According to the motorman , had he not lost the power , he would have continued through the tunnel , as the fire was just beginning . 
 The Norwegian Civil Defence , who did the main bulk of the rescue work , stated that they had been planning on an exercise which would have been identical to the accident , with a train stuck in exactly the same tunnel while it was on fire . The rescue work was difficult , as there is no road connection to the area and all materials have to be transported to the area by air . In addition , the mobile telephone and radio network was out . Representatives stated that it would have been easier if they could have used the GSM @-@ R network operated by the railway , which was functioning . The train , which consisted of a twin Class 73 electric multiple unit , burnt up and was destroyed in the fire . These cost NOK 100 million each . The fire forced the temporary closure of the Bergen Line , which was reopened in the evening on 23 June . The cost of the accident was NOK 250 million , of which most was for the unit which was written off . 
 According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway , the rescue work was hampered by , among other things : lack of fire crew at Voss to drive the fire engine , a defective helicopter bucket , and a three @-@ hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål . Also , the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported . Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels , and the National Rail Administration admitted that they should be made of a more fire @-@ proof material , such as concrete or steel . Following the accident , the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work .

 The station is located 322 @.@ 80 kilometers ( 200 @.@ 58 mi ) from Oslo and at 1 @,@ 110 @.@ 1 meters ( 3 @,@ 642 ft ) above mean sea level . The station is not staffed and serves no local population . The area around the station has no road access , and the station serves only for trekking in the Hardangervidda plateau . There is a self @-@ serve cabin run by the Norwegian Trekking Association nearby . The station building itself is owned by Rom Eiendom , a subsidiary of the Norwegian State Railways . The station has a waiting room and washrooms . Up to three daily services in each direction of the Oslo – Bergen service , operated by the state railways , call at Hallingskeid , with up to two bypassing the station each day . 
 = Mom and Dad = 
 Mom and Dad ( known as The Family Story in the United Kingdom ) is a feature @-@ length 1945 film directed by William Beaudine , and largely produced by the exploitation film maker and presenter Kroger Babb . Mom and Dad is considered the most successful film within its genre of " sex hygiene " films . Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the National Legion of Decency , it went on to become one of the highest @-@ grossing films of the 1940s . 
 The film is regarded as an exploitation film as it was repackaged controversial content designed to establish an educational value that might circumvent U.S. censorship laws . Babb 's marketing of his film incorporated old @-@ style medicine show techniques , and used unique promotions to build an audience . These formed a template for his later works , which were imitated by his contemporary filmmakers . In 2005 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mom and Dad tells the story of Joan Blake ( June Carlson ) , a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin ( Bob Lowell ) . After being sweet talked by Griffin , she has sex with him . The girl requests " hygiene books " from her mother Sarah Blake ( Lois Austin ) ; however , the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married . The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake ( George Eldredge ) that the pilot has died in a crash . She tears up a letter she had been writing to him , and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission . 
 The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit , sending her into a state of despair . She takes advice from her teacher , Carl Blackburn ( Hardie Albright ) , who had previously been fired for teaching sex education . Blackburn blames her mother for the problem , and accuses her of " neglect [ ing ] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth . " Only then is the girl able to confront her mother . 
 The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births - one natural and one Caesarian . In some screenings , a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad , and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease . Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings , although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl 's child , sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption .

 = = Production = = 
 Despite the commercially successful run of Babb 's debut film , Dust to Dust — a reworked version of the 1938 film Child Bride — his production company Cox and Underwood disbanded , forcing him to form his own unit , Hygienic Productions . Having attended a meeting in Burkburnett , Texas , that discussed the alleged <unk> of young women by G.I.s from nearby Sheppard Air Force Base , Babb was inspired to shoot a film based on the subject . His future wife Mildred Horn drafted a screenplay which later evolved into Mom and Dad . Babb located 20 investors willing to fund the movie , and hired William Beaudine as director . 
 Production of the film cost Babb and his investors a total of $ 63 @,@ 000 . The movie was shot in five separate studios over six days in 1944 , and was spread across various Monogram Pictures lots ; co @-@ producer J. S. Jossey was a Monogram stockholder . On January 3 , 1945 , Mom and Dad premiered at the Warner Bros. theatre in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . 
 The plot is padded with a large amount of filler . Films of this type were usually produced quickly and at minimal cost , and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value , the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status . Eric Schaefer notes that the " primary purpose " of the plot of Mom and Dad was to " serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted " , such as the live birth scene . The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also , and many posters for the film promised that " You [ will ] actually SEE the birth of a baby ! " The dialogue is carefully worded , and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time . In particular , at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy . 
 = = Marketing and presentation = = 
 In a Washington Post article covering Babb 's career , the film critic Kenneth Turan wrote that Mom and Dad did not " flourish because of its birth footage or because of its puerile plot , which Babb himself disparages . . . [ its ] success flowed , rather , from Babb 's extraordinary promotional abilities . " The film was exhibited across the United States , and over 300 prints were produced . In the weeks preceding the screening , local presenters sought to attract the attention of the town 's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film 's moral basis . This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city , who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own . 
 The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or Hallmark Productions , and they nominally based their campaign from information provided by a standard and detailed pressbook containing cast and crew information , as well as other promotional and marketing materials . Babb 's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with advertisements and letters , in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere . In keeping with his motto of " You gotta tell ' em to sell ' em , " the film became so ubiquitous that Time wrote that its presentation " left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life . " 
 The local pitch included a variety of limited screenings , including adults @-@ only showings , viewings segregated by gender , and a live lecture by the " Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes " which was often placed during the intermission . At any one time , a number of " Elliot Forbes " es would give simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film . In some predominantly African @-@ American areas , Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens was hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes . The " Elliot Forbes " actors were usually people local to the production company , sometimes out @-@ of @-@ work performers . Along with " Forbes " , presentations were often held with " nurses " in attendance , ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due to the content of the film ; such " nurses " were often hired locally . 
 Modern Film Distributors later distributed the film , and sold over forty @-@ five thousand copies of the books Man and Boy and Woman and Girl following Forbes 's lecture . The text was written by Babb 's wife , and was filled with both biological and sexual education materials relevant to the film 's subject matter ; generating extra profit items for their distributors . The sales of these books netted an estimated $ 31 @,@ 000 for the distribution company , while Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies . 
 Babb insisted that the program be followed closely ; a contractual agreement with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach . Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing , extra newsreels or short films were not permitted , although previews were allowed . A contractual agreement disallowed matinée pricing , set specific times for the segregated viewings , and prohibited the screening of the film on Sundays .

 Mom and Dad is the third highest grossing film of the 1940s in dollar value , and returned close to $ 63 for each dollar invested by its backers . The Los Angeles Times estimates that the film grossed between $ 40 million and $ 100 million , and it has been cited as the most successful sex hygiene film ever released . It remains the most profitable pre @-@ 1960 exploitation film ; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s and 1950s , even when scaled against those year 's mainstream releases . 
 The film was at the center of many high profile lawsuits and condemnations . The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s , and fought many local censorship battles , and fought bitterly against the motion picture censorship system . It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and Mom and Dad during the film 's run . Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense , and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his <unk> . One successful challenge was in New York City , where Mom and Dad remained censored until 1956 , when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board , deciding that human birth did not qualify as " indecent " . 
 According to Modern Film Distributors , as of the end of 1956 , the film has been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide attendance figure of over 175 million people , at over 650 @,@ 000 performances . Card <unk> purchased the rights to exhibit the film in New Zealand and Australia during the mid @-@ 1960s , almost twenty years after the film 's debut . In the late 1970s , a story on Babb by the Press @-@ Enterprise estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages . 
 The film 's success spawned a number of imitators , who sought to saturate the market with genre imitations . In particular , Street Corner recycled Babb 's plot , substituting a concerned physician for a concerned teacher . In 1948 , Universal produced a similar film , The Story of Bob and Sally , but was unable to screen it due to the production code , and eventually sold the rights . The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors , a group of exploitation filmmakers , in an effort to minimize booking conflicts . 
 In 1969 , the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America for a film rating , in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie theaters ; it received an R rating . The film was such a success that it is still shown decades later around the world . In 2005 , a version was added to the National Film Registry .

 " The Call of the Simpsons " is the seventh episode of The Simpsons ' first season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 18 , 1990 . It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer . Albert Brooks made his first guest appearance on The Simpsons in this episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob . 
 In this episode , Homer decides to purchase an RV and the Simpsons set off for a vacation in the wilderness . After accidentally driving it off the edge of a cliff , the family find themselves trapped in the woods . As Homer and Bart try to find a way back to civilization , Homer gets himself covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist . The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer . Meanwhile , Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears .

 Homer , envious of Ned Flanders 's new motor home , goes to Bob 's RV Round @-@ up to buy one of his own , but because of his poor credit rating , he is only qualified for a smaller dilapidated one , much to his family 's disgust . Thrilled with the new RV , Homer takes his family on an excursion . Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge 's suggestion to turn back on the main road , the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice . The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff , leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness . 
 Homer and Bart set out for help , unaware that Maggie is tagging along , while Marge and Lisa stay behind . Separated from Homer and Bart , Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears . Meanwhile , Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes , but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud . Marge and Lisa make themselves comfortable by a campfire , while the boys freeze in the wilderness . The next day , Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive , only to be attacked by the bees , but evades them by jumping into a mud pit . A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud , mistaking him for Bigfoot , and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers . 
 Marge , having been rescued along with Lisa by park rangers , identifies the monster in question as her husband and causing quite a controversy . Cold , hungry , and exhausted , Homer and Bart stumble upon the cave housing Maggie and the bears . Homer is soon captured and taken to a lab for testing . The authorities allow Homer to return home after scientists agree that he is " either a below @-@ average human being or a brilliant beast . " While watching the news coverage of the whole debacle , Homer worries about the insults he 'll receive from his co @-@ workers , until Marge consoles him , calling him " my brilliant beast . "

 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wesley Archer . A plot twist that involved Homer being carried away to an eagle nest and being raised as a baby eagle was suggested for this episode by executive producer James L. Brooks , but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead . The sequence with Marge and Lisa by the bonfire was originally longer and included a conversation between the two about boys , but it was cut from the episode . In the original script , Homer and Bart were not talking in the scene where they concealed their private parts with mud and moss , but Sam Simon thought it would be " too funny to leave as a stage direction " and they added dialogue to the scene . 
 Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as the voice of Cowboy Bob . He was not sure if he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show or not at the time , like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons , and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits . This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written . A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode , trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees , rocks , fences and the way the cars were positioned . Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode .

 In its original American broadcast on February 18 , 1990 , " The Call of the Simpsons " finished third place in the ratings for that day , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 6 and a 22 percent audience share . The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1990 in the category " Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special " . IGN.com named Albert Brooks ' guest performance in this episode , along with his four other appearances on The Simpsons , the best guest appearance in the show 's history . 
 " The Call of the Simpsons " received mixed reviews from critics . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , both criticized and praised the episode saying : " This episode is a bit less than the sum of its parts . The early stuff at the RV Round @-@ Up is much better than the main camping story , although there 's some nice Marge @-@ Lisa bonding , and who could resist Maggie and the bears ? " In a DVD review of the first season , David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1 @.@ 5 / 5 , adding " the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep . This type of gag would be very different today , if done at all . " Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode " a perfect example of the first season ’ s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly @-@ drawn neuroses " and stated that " it was this combination that made Groening ’ s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling , and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television . " Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that " while [ the episode ] doesn ’ t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons , it ’ s a generally solid show " and added that " the episode uses a <unk> tone than usual for this era , but it works , and the program is consistently fun " .

 The roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film . For example , Ciarán Hinds assumed the role of Aberforth Dumbledore , Albus Dumbledore 's brother and bartender of the Hog 's Head inn . 
 In the book , a significant number of characters who have not appeared since some of the earlier novels , reappear to defend Hogwarts in the large , final battle . Director David Yates said , " I want to get them all back " , referring to his desire to bring back as many actors who have appeared in the franchise as possible for the climactic battle sequence in the film . Sean Biggerstaff , Jim Broadbent , Gemma Jones , Miriam <unk> , and Emma Thompson reprise their roles from earlier films briefly during the battle scene . For the final scene in the film which is set nineteen years after the film 's main story , the actors playing the main characters were made to look older through the use of makeup and special effects not once but twice ; the second being after the characters ' aged photos leaked onto the internet .

 Part 2 was filmed back @-@ to @-@ back with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 from 19 February 2009 to 12 June 2010 , with reshoots for the epilogue scene taking place at Leavesden Film Studios on 21 December 2010 . Director David Yates , who shot the film with director of photography Eduardo Serra , described Part 2 as " operatic , colourful and fantasy @-@ oriented " , a " big opera with huge battles . " 
 The idea of splitting the final book into two films came from " creative imperative " and it was suggested by the executive producer Lionel Wigram . David Heyman , initially , responded negatively , but Wigram asked , “ No , David . How are we going to do it ? ” . After re @-@ reading the book and discussing it with Steve Kloves , he agreed with the division .

 In an interview with Architectural Digest , production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part 2 . Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank , he said , " our banking hall , like any other , is made of marble and big marble columns . And it has great strength . The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions . That was part of the fun of the set : we exaggerated the size of it , we exaggerated the weight of it , and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble . " About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank 's vaults , he noted , " We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum <unk> them to be shiny gold and silver . John Richardson , the special effects supervisor , made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels , so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it . " 
 Craig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine , saying that " the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts . The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls , the entrance hall , the entrance of the Great Hall , part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone , so yeah . A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really – maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely . " When asked about the King 's Cross scene near the end of the film , Craig said , " We experimented a lot , quite honestly . I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white – so we experimented with <unk> floors , we experimented with different kind of white covering everything : white paint , white fabric , and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it , and a series of camera tests were done , so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research . "

 Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke said that " It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts , and we had to do it in different stages of production . We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews , to flying into windows and interior spaces . So , we took the plunge at the end of 2008 , and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative . " He went on to say that " It 's taken two years – getting renders out , texturing every facet of the building , constructing interiors to see through windows , building a destruction version of the school . We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with . With a practical Hogwarts , we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down . Instead , as David Yates finds the flow and structure , we are able to handle new concepts and ideas . " 
 On the quality of 3 @-@ D in film , Burke told Los Angeles Times , " I think it 's good , actually . I think people are going to be really pleased . I know everyone 's a little nervous and sceptical of 3 @-@ D these days , but the work has been done very , very well . We 've done over 200 shots in 3 @-@ D and in the visual effects as well , because so much of it is CG , so the results are very , very good . I think everyone 's going to be really impressed with it , actually . " Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3 @-@ D conversion , saying that " The way David Yates is approaching 3 @-@ D is he 's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view . Trying to use the sense of isolation , of separation that sometimes 3 @-@ D gives you , to heighten that at appropriate moments . So we 're approaching it in a storytelling way . " 
 In 2012 , the visual effects in the film were nominated for an Oscar . The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects at the 65th BAFTA Awards in 2012 .

In a separate interview , Desplat also made note that John Williams ' themes will be present in the film " much more than in part one . " The soundtrack for the film was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards .

 Philip Womack in The Daily Telegraph commented , " This is monumental cinema , awash with gorgeous tones , and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer , young or old : there is darkness in all of us , but we can overcome it . " He further expressed that David Yates " transmutes [ the book ] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle . " Another review was released on the same day from Evening Standard , who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated " Millions of children , parents , and those who should know better won 't need reminding what a Horcrux is – and director David Yates does not let them down . In fact , in some ways , he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book .

 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film 3 1 ⁄ 2 out of 4 stars and said , " The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted ( relative ) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone all those magical years ago .

 = 1969 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1969 Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest Atlantic hurricane season since 1933 . The hurricane season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 . The season had the highest number of systems reach hurricane status – twelve – in a single season , until that record was surpassed in 2005 . Activity began with a series of five tropical depressions , the first of which developed on May 29 . The third system in that series , Tropical Depression Seven , caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Jamaica in early June . The final in the series formed on July 25 , the same day that Tropical Storm Anna developed . Neither the former nor latter caused significant impact on land . Later in the season , Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Nine caused severe local flooding in the Florida Panhandle and southwestern Georgia in September . Hurricane Blanche was a small and short @-@ lived tropical cyclone in mid @-@ August that resulted in minimal effects . 
 The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Camille , which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on August 17 and devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States upon striking Mississippi the next day . Strong winds and storm surge heights especially impacted Mississippi and Louisiana . Later in its duration , the storm caused severe flooding Virginia and West Virginia . Camille alone was responsible for 259 deaths and $ 1 @.@ 4 billion . All damage figures are in 1969 USD , unless otherwise noted . It was the costliest United States hurricane at the time , until Hurricane Agnes in 1972 . In early September , Hurricane Francelia caused deadly floods in Central America , with 271 people killed in Central America . Hurricane Inga had the third longest duration of an Atlantic tropical cyclone . The last storm , Hurricane Martha , was the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama . Martha caused minor flooding in the former and Costa Rica . Overall , the systems of the season collectively caused 535 deaths and over $ 1 @.@ 49 billion in losses . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The 1969 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 . Of the twenty @-@ four tropical cyclones that developed in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1969 , eighteen of them intensified into tropical storms ; this was above the 1950 – 2000 average of 9 @.@ 6 named storms . In terms of tropical storms , it was the busiest season since 1933 . Twelve of the eighteen named storms reached hurricane status , a record that stood until there were fifteen named storms in 2005 . Five of the hurricanes deepened into major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Between 1950 and 2000 , there was an average of 2 @.@ 3 major hurricanes per season . Throughout the season , the U.S. Weather Bureau issued more advisories than in any previous season . Additionally , reconnaissance aircraft were utilized for more flight hours than in any year in the Atlantic basin until that point . The season officially ended on November 30 . 
 Hurricane Camille made landfall in Mississippi on August 18 as a Category 5 hurricane , becoming one of only three tropical cyclones to strike the United States as a Category 5 , other than the Labor Day hurricane in 1935 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . Project Stormfury had some of its most successful seeding experiments on Hurricane Debbie , which declined in wind speed by 31 % on the first day and by 18 % of the following day . With a duration of almost 25 days from September 20 to October 15 , Hurricane Inga is the third longest @-@ lasting tropical cyclone in the Atlantic , behind only the San Ciriaco hurricane of 1899 and Hurricane Ginger in 1971 . On November 24 , Hurricane Martha became the first tropical cyclone on record to strike Panama . 
 The season was above average despite an El Niño , which typically suppresses tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic Ocean while increasing activity in the eastern Pacific Ocean . The Atlantic upper tropospheric shear line , a semi @-@ permanent feature that extended southeastward into the Caribbean Sea , which enhances outflow from disturbances , remained persistent throughout the season . However , the opposite periphery of the shear line inhibits the divergent outflow of a disturbance . This may have increased the number of tropical cyclones developing , while causing other storms to remain weak or dissipating over the deep tropics . Additionally , an abnormally strong mid @-@ tropospheric ridge replaced the further south than normal westerlies that deterred tropical cyclone formation in 1968 . Five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall , causing 535 deaths and $ 1 @.@ 49 billion in damage ; Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Nine also resulted in damage . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis began early , with two tropical depressions forming on May 29 . Neither intensified into a named storm . In June , two additional tropical depressions developed , both of which failed to reach tropical storm intensity . Activity briefly went dormant between June 15 and July 25 , when the next depression originated . That same day , the season 's first named storm , Anna , developed over the eastern Atlantic . There were five tropical cyclones that formed in the month of August – Blanche , Camille , Debbie , Eve , and Francelia . Camille was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season , peaking as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 900 mbar ( 27 inHg ) . 
 September was the most active month of the season , with six tropical cyclones , five of which intensified into a tropical storm – Gerda , Holly , Inga , and an unnamed hurricane . Of the five named storms that originated in October , three intensified into hurricanes , including Kara , Laurie , and an unnamed storm . This was well above the currently used 1981 – 2010 average of two tropical storms in one hurricane in the month of October . Although an unnamed hurricane existed into November , Martha was the only tropical cyclone to originate in that month . Martha , the last storm of the season , dissipated over Panama on November 25 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 166 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 Tropical Depression Seven developed near the Yucatan Peninsula on June 7 . It moved north , reaching western Cuba by the following day . As the depression moved towards Florida , small @-@ craft warnings were issued for the southern coast . The depression made landfall in Florida on June 9 and dissipated shortly thereafter . As a result of 2 to 3 in ( 51 to 76 mm ) rain in Cuba , Radio Havana warned of a flash flood and later reported that three rivers were overflowing in Camagüey . Flooding also forced 1 @,@ 801 people from their homes . Sustained winds of 15 to 25 mph ( 24 to 40 km / h ) and gusts up to 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) were observed on the island . Impact from the depression in Florida is unknown . 
 Damage was catastrophic in Jamaica with landslides , flooding , broken communication lines , cancellation of its railway service and evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes . The Jamaica Railway Corporation 's trains were disrupted by landslides blocking the tracks from Spanish Town to Port Antonio and floodwaters inundating a bridge in Gregory Park . A train bound for Kingston was disrupted by the flooded bridge , as was a diesel tram , isolating both trains at Richmond . Furthermore , the former train did not reach its destination due to landslides . The Jamaica Telephone Company reported troubles due to waterlogged telephone lines . Schools and colleges in Kingston suspended classes and motorists in the area had difficulty traveling due to flooded roads . Correspondents from The Gleaner reported heavy rains , which inundated roads , washed away livestock and destroyed crops . On June 9 , the Church Welfare Organization of the West Indies Junior Seventh Day Adventists set out food , money and blankets the victims .

 On July 23 , a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa . By 0600 UTC on July 25 , the system developed into Tropical Depression Twelve . Initially , the depression strengthened slowly while moving west @-@ northwestward . Eventually , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Anna on July 27 . Intensification continued during the next 66 hours . On July 29 , Anna peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 002 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Thereafter , the storm began to weaken and moved in a more northwesterly direction . Late on July 31 , Anna was downgraded to a tropical depression , while situated north of the Lesser Antilles . 
 Anna briefly re @-@ strengthened into a tropical storm late on August 1 . The storm re @-@ curved northeastward on July 2 and remained offshore of the East Coast of the United States . Ana once again reached tropical storm status by early on July 3 . Further intensification occurred , with the storm reaching winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) later that day . However , Anna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after merging with an extratropical low pressure area at 0000 UTC on August 4 , while centered near Sable Island . The remnants continued rapidly east @-@ northeastward across the Atlantic until becoming unidentifiable on August 5 .

 A tropical wave was initially tracked about 1 @,@ 300 mi ( 2 @,@ 100 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles on August 6 . The system curved west @-@ northward on August 6 and eventually moved around the western periphery of the Bermuda high . Late on August 10 , a circulation developed and by 0000 UTC on August 11 , the system became a tropical depression while located about 530 mi ( 850 km ) east of <unk> Beach , Florida . Under the influence of a trough , it headed rapidly north to north @-@ northeastward . After ships reported winds up to 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Blanche later on August 11 . 
 Significant intensification then occurred . Later on August 11 , Navy reconnaissance reports indicated that Blanche reached hurricane intensity . After winds peaked at 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , the strong southwesterly current which Blanche was embedded in caused the storm to accelerate northeastward . On August 12 , the storm began losing tropical characteristics near Sable Island ; namely , the wind field was becoming asymmetrical . At Sable Island , a weather station reported sustained winds of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) and gusts up to 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) . While passing to the south of Newfoundland , Blanche was absorbed by a frontal zone at 0000 UTC on August 13 . 
 = = = Hurricane Camille = = = 
 A tropical disturbance moved off the west coast of Africa on August 5 , and developed into Tropical Storm Camille near Grand Cayman on August 14 . The storm strengthened quickly and was a Category 3 hurricane when it struck near the western tip of Cuba on August 15 . The storm damaged 100 homes on Isla de la Juventud , while 20 @,@ 000 residents were left homeless on the mainland ; Five fatalities were also reported . Early on August 16 , Camille emerged into the Gulf of Mexico . Between August 16 and August 17 , the storm rapidly deepened , with a minimum barometric pressure of 905 mbar ( 26 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Later on August 17 , Camille peaked as a 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) Category 5 . It likely maintained this intensity until landfall near Bay St. Louis , Mississippi early on August 18 ; Camille was one of only three tropical cyclones to strike the United States as a Category 5 , the others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . Mississippi bore the brunt of Hurricane Camille . A combination of strong winds and large storm surges caused adverse impact in the state . In Mississippi alone , 3 @,@ 881 dwellings were destroyed and 41 @,@ 848 were damaged . About 406 trailers were destroyed and an additional 325 suffered major losses . An estimated 645 farm buildings were destroyed and another 2 @,@ 002 received major damage . In addition , 569 small businesses were impacted . 
 In Mississippi 's neighboring states of Alabama and Louisiana , 1 @,@ 781 homes were destroyed and 6 @,@ 000 others were inflicted losses . About 676 trailers were demolished and 296 were severely impacted . Additionally , 124 small businesses were either destroyed or incurred major damage . Camille rapidly weakened after landfall on August 18 and was only a tropical depression about 24 hours later . However , the storm maintained intensity as it recurved to the east over the Ohio River Valley . It dropped heavy rainfall while approaching the Atlantic Ocean , especially in Virginia . Up to 27 in ( 690 mm ) fell in west central Nelson County . In Nelson County alone , 133 bridges washed out , while in some places entire communities were under water . Rivers crested at record heights , causing severe flooding . In the state of Virginia and West Virginia combined , an estimated 349 homes were destroyed and 2 @,@ 587 received damage to some degree . Eighty @-@ three trailers were demolished and 71 others received major losses . Reportedly , 730 farm buildings were destroyed and 535 were inflicted minor damage . Ninety @-@ six small businesses were also severely damage or destroyed . Along its path , rainfall was recorded in several other states , including Arkansas , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Maryland , New Jersey , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Tennessee . After reaching the Atlantic , Camille re @-@ strengthened into a 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) tropical storm , but was absorbed by a cold front south of Newfoundland on August 22 . With losses estimated at $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , Camille was considered the costliest hurricane in United States history at the time . Additionally , there were 256 deaths in the United States . 
 = = = Hurricane Debbie = = = 
 On August 14 , a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and the coast of Africa . The following day , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Debbie . By late on August 16 , Debbie became a Category 1 hurricane . Moving northwestward , it intensified further to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) on August 18 . However , the storm then began oscillating between a Category 1 and a Category 3 hurricane for the next few days , possibly due to being seeded by silver iodide as part of Project Stormfury . On August 20 , Debbie attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 951 mbar ( 28 @.@ 1 inHg ) . 
 The storm curved northeastward as Hurricane Camille moved offshore the East Coast of the United States and briefly weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on August 21 , before re @-@ strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane hours later . Debbie accelerated and fell to Category 2 intensity by midday on August 23 . The storm curved northward and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on the following day , shortly before passing just offshore Newfoundland . Debbie turned northeastward and deteriorated to a tropical storm on August 25 . Several hours later , the hurricane dissipated about 225 mi ( 360 km ) east @-@ northeast of Cape Farewell , Greenland . In Newfoundland , wind gusts up to 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) were observed in St. John 's , while rainfall up to 0 @.@ 98 in ( 25 mm ) was recorded along the Avalon and Bonavista peninsulas . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Eve = = = 
 In the wake of Hurricane Camille , a quasi @-@ stationary front moved across the Southern United States and became situated over North Florida . A cut @-@ off low pressure area developed along the system and acquired a low @-@ level circulation . By 0000 UTC on August 25 , the system was classified as a tropical depression while located about 100 mi ( 160 km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . Due to cold air in the region , the depression strengthened slowly while tracking nearly due east . Late on August 25 , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eve . 
 On August 26 , the National Hurricane Center noted although conditions would prevent rapid deepening , further intensification was possible . The storm threatened the Mid @-@ Atlantic states and Bermuda , but remained offshore and caused no impacts in either region . Eve strengthened slightly on August 26 , reaching maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Although the storm weakened later that day , Eve reached its minimum barometric pressure of 996 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . Early on August 2 , Eve was downgraded to a tropical depression . It began to succumb to the effects of cold air , which entrained the circulation of the storm . At 0000 UTC on August 28 , Eve degenerated into a trough of low pressure while located about 70 mi ( 110 km ) west @-@ northwest of Bermuda . 
 = = = Hurricane Francelia = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near the Windward Islands on August 29 . Initially , the depression slowly strengthened while moving west @-@ northwestward and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Francelia until more than 24 hours later . While located north of Honduras , it curved west @-@ southwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 1 . The storm briefly became a Category 3 hurricane on September 2 , peaking with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Late on September 3 , Francelia made landfall near Punta Gorda , Belize with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . The storm quickly weakened inland , and less than 24 hours later , it dissipated over northern Guatemala . However , the remnants of Francelia later contributed to the development of Hurricane Glenda in the eastern Pacific Ocean . 
 During its early stages , Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea . While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America , heavy precipitation fell in some countries , especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $ 15 million in damage . Throughout the country , approximately 10 @,@ 200 people were left homeless . In neighboring Honduras , the hurricane caused damage in the northern portions of the country , with the offshore Bay Islands Department being particularly hard hit . There , the storm damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns . In El Salvador , flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage . Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service , and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops . A number of rivers in the region flooded , including the Belize River , which reached 36 ft ( 11 m ) above normal . Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala , until Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . Overall damage was estimated at $ 35 @.@ 6 million , and there were 271 deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Gerda = = = 
 A tropical wave located over the central Bahamas developed into a tropical depression on September 6 . The depression moved northwestward and initially remained disorganized . By early on September 7 , the depression made landfall near West Palm Beach , Florida . Impact in the state was minimal , limited mostly to light rainfall . Later on September 7 , the depression reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean just south of Cape Canaveral . It began to strengthen on the following day and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gerda at 0600 UTC . By late on September 8 , Gerda intensified into a hurricane . The storm deepened significantly further , peaking with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) on September 9 . Early on September 10 , Gerda weakened slightly while approaching New England and Atlantic Canada . 
 It made landfall near Eastport , Maine on September 10 and was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to strike the state . Despite landfall as a Category 2 hurricane , the strongest sustained wind speed recorded was 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) in Washington County , Maine . Twenty @-@ four @-@ hour rainfall amounts exceeding 4 in ( 100 mm ) were observed in some areas of New England , with a precipitation peak of 5 @.@ 67 in ( 144 mm ) in Wellfleet , Massachusetts . Due to the winds and rainfall , portions of Maine , Massachusetts , and New Hampshire reported power outages and localized flooding . By 0600 UTC on September 10 , Gerda became extratropical over southeastern Quebec . In Atlantic Canada , winds left many without electricity in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , and left about $ 3 @.@ 5 million in losses to apple crops . 
 = = = Hurricane Holly = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 8 . Moving westward to west @-@ northwestward , it developed into a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on September 14 , while located about 1 @,@ 250 mi ( 2 @,@ 315 km ) southeast of Puerto Rico , based on Hurricane Hunter observations of an organized circulation . It quickly organized and was soon upgraded to Tropical Storm Holly . Continuing northwestward , it steadily intensified , and the Hurricane Hunters reported that Holly attained hurricane status on September 16 , with peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . 
 On September 16 , Holly weakened slightly while turning westward toward the Lesser Antilles . Due to the lack of good upper @-@ level outflow , as well as unfavorable water , Holly quickly weakened to tropical storm status on September 18 , as confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters . By the next day , it weakened to tropical depression status and later moved through the Lesser Antilles . Holly dissipated on September 21 in the Caribbean Sea , while situated between the Los Roques archipelago of Venezuela and Puerto Rico . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Nine = = = 
 Ship reports on September 19 indicated the presence of low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico , centered about 300 mi ( 480 km ) west @-@ northwest of Key West , Florida . It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1200 UTC on that day . The depression headed north @-@ northwestward and did not strengthen . By early on September 21 , the depression made landfall between Panama City and Port St. Joe , Florida . It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area only a few hours later . A high @-@ pressure ridge blocked the system 's movement , moving it to the east . By September 23 , the system became a low pressure trough . Upper @-@ level wind shear moved the circulation to the east @-@ northeast and moved into the Atlantic Ocean the next day . 
 Rainfall in peaked at 23 @.@ 4 in ( 590 mm ) in Havana , with and exceeding 15 in ( 380 mm ) in most of the central Panhandle . Many bridges and roads were washed out or inundated by water , including portions of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 20 between Tallahassee and Panama City . In addition , a tornado spawned by the depression destroyed a trailer , damaged 30 homes , and toppled ballpark bleachers , fences , lights , and electrical poles . Damage in Florida reached almost $ 3 @.@ 78 million , including $ 1 @.@ 65 million to crops and $ 2 @.@ 135 million to property . In southwest Georgia , precipitation totals exceeding 5 in ( 130 mm ) were common , while rainfall peaked at 14 in ( 360 mm ) in southern Decatur County . Severe local flooding ensued , causing damage to property and crops , mostly to peanuts that were not threshed . Up to 7 in ( 180 mm ) of rainfall fell in Alabama , while precipitation totals reached 3 in ( 76 mm ) in Tennessee , South Carolina , North Carolina , and Virginia . 
 = = = Hurricane Inga = = = 
 A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on September 20 . By the following day , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Inga while centered about 930 mi ( 1 @,@ 500 km ) east @-@ southeast of San Juan , Puerto Rico . At the time , the storm was moving westward at 14 mph ( 23 km / h ) . However , by September 23 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression . The depression continued west @-@ northwestward , passing north of the Leeward Islands , before drifting northwestward . Inga became a tropical storm again on September 29 . It continued to intensify , and achieved hurricane status on September 30 , while curving northeastward . The storm then turned towards the south , and ultimately completed a cyclonic loop as it bent back westward . Late on October 3 , Inga turned to the northwest . 
 Early on October 5 , the hurricane produced wind gusts up to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) on Bermuda , though minimal impact occurred other than power outages . Thereafter , Inga curved northeastward and continued deepen . Later on October 5 , it peaked as a Category 3 with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 964 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) . While moving into an environment of colder sea surface temperatures , the storm began to weaken . As cold air became entrained into its circulation , the storm began to lose tropical characteristics . Inga briefly re @-@ strengthened while beginning to drift generally eastward . However , storm turned southward and began to weaken , deteriorating to a tropical storm on October 10 . Heading westward , Inga was downgraded to a tropical depression , before dissipating fully on October 15 , while located about 290 mi ( 470 km ) from where it initially attained hurricane status . 
 = = = Subtropical Storm One = = = 
 An upper @-@ level low pressure area in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico spawned a subtropical depression at 1200 UTC on September 29 . Operationally , it was classified as Tropical Depression Thirty @-@ Two . Six hours later , the strengthened into a subtropical storm . Early on the following day , the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . It maintained that intensity for about 24 hours , before cool air and wind shear began weakening the storm early on October 1 . Shortly thereafter , the storm weakened back to a subtropical depression , a few hours prior to landfall near Fort Walton Beach , Florida . The subtropical depression rapidly dissipated inland . 
 Rainfall was relatively light and the heaviest amounts were displaced far east of the track , with precipitation peaking at 6 @.@ 74 inches ( 171 mm ) in Saint Augustine , Florida . Closer to the location of landfall , rainfall reached nearly 4 inches ( 100 mm ) in Pensacola . Several waterspouts were reported in the Panama City area , while a tornado in <unk> and unroofed a home in the St. James community . United States Coast Guard planes searched for three people in a light aircraft that went missing as it traveled from <unk> Springs to Sebring . The storm brought rainfall to several others states , reaching as far north as Maine . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Jenny = = = 
 On October 1 , a tropical depression developed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea from the same cut @-@ off low pressure that spawned the previous subtropical storm on September 29 . The depression moved quickly north @-@ northeastward and struck Cuba early on October 2 . While approaching the southwest coast of Florida later that day , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Jenny . Simultaneously , Jenny attained its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 1 @,@ 000 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . Around 0000 UTC on October 2 , the storm made landfall between Fort Myers and Naples , Florida , with winds of 40 mph ( 60 km / h ) . Jenny emerged into the western Atlantic as a tropical depression , but increased ridging forced the storm to track west @-@ southwestward back over Florida . The cyclone was unable to re @-@ strengthen and dissipated on October 6 south of Louisiana . 
 The storm crossed Cuba as a tropical depression . Minimal impact was reported . The storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall over parts of the Florida Peninsula , peaking at 6 @.@ 61 in ( 168 mm ) near <unk> . Minor road washouts were reported in Lee County . Rainfall along the lower Kissimmee River and the Lake Okeechobee basin caused some pastures and flood plain areas to be inundated by water . Lake Kissimmee rose 1 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) in height due to precipitation . Jenny 's remnants later contributed to the development of heavy rains in southern Louisiana . 
 = = = Hurricane Kara = = = 
 A cold core trough of low pressure over the western Atlantic Ocean warmed on the eastern end , becoming a tropical depression on October 7 about 135 mi ( 215 km ) north of Punta Cana , Dominican Republic . The depression passed south of Turks and Caicos Islands and later to the west of Mayaguana . Early on October 9 , the system turned northward and intensified into Tropical Storm Kara after several hours . Southwesterly flow associated with an upper @-@ level trough then caused the storm to curve northeastward . On October 10 , an upper @-@ level low pressure formed offshore North Carolina . Initially , Kara moved rapidly north @-@ northwest around the low . However , by October 11 , Kara and the low merged , resulting in the former moving erratically . While tracking southwestward into warmer ocean temperatures , the storm continued to strengthen . 
 After executing a small cyclonic loop , Kara developed an eye feature on October 14 , before strengthening into a hurricane on October 15 . While moving offshore North Carolina , the storm brought tides of 1 to 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal between October 10 and October 15 , causing coastal flooding in very low @-@ lying areas . By October 15 , an upper @-@ level westerlies forced the storm to move northeastward and accelerate . Kara then became to strengthen further and became a Category 2 hurricane at 1800 UTC on October 17 . Six hours later , the storm peaked with sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . Kara began losing tropical characteristics and weakening after encountering a cold trough over the northeast Atlantic , falling to tropical storm intensity late on October 18 . The storm soon became extratropical about 435 mi ( 700 km ) north @-@ northeast of Corvo Island in the Azores . 
 = = = Hurricane Laurie = = = 
 A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression while located about 75 mi ( 120 km ) northeast of Guanaja in the Bay Islands Department of Honduras . Although conditions were favorable for rapid deepening , the depression failed to do so because it was not vertically stacked and struck the Yucatan Peninsula late on October 18 . After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on the following day , the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Laurie . Later on October 19 , Laurie curved northward and continued intensifying . At 12 : 00 UTC on October 20 , the storm became a hurricane . It then curved eastward over the central Gulf of Mexico and continued to deepen , peaking as a Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 973 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Thereafter , drier air began weakening Laurie on October 22 . Laurie curved southeastward and then southward , allowing it to remain well offshore the Gulf Coast of the United States . 
 Early on October 23 , the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while curving west @-@ southwestward . Late the following day , Laurie deteriorated into a tropical depression . After moving southwestward and then southward , the storm made landfall near Paraíso , Tabasco , Mexico , early on October 27 . Laurie promptly dissipated . Offshore , oil rig personnel were evacuated as the storm approached . A hurricane watch was issued from Galveston , Texas , to Pensacola , Florida ; the watch was extended eastward to Apalachicola , Florida , on October 21 . Voluntary evacuations occurred in southern Louisiana out of fear of a storm similar to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 or Camille early that year . Impact on land was primarily limited to minor beach erosion . It caused minor damage in the Yucatan Peninsula , and in Tabasco . 
 = = = Hurricane Martha = = = 
 Tropical Storm Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 21 . Initially , the storm developed with sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , skipping tropical depression status . It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane . Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) on November 22 . Subsequently , Martha weakened and drifted southward . On November 24 , Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province , Panama , as a strong tropical storm . Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama . The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November 25 . 
 Because the storm weakened prior to landfall , strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries . In Panama , more than 13 inches ( 330 mm ) of precipitation may have fallen in some areas . Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante , Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low @-@ lying areas of Puerto Armuelles , Chiriquí . The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica . Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San José . Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito . Damage in Costa Rica reached $ 30 million and 5 deaths were reported . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 In addition to the 20 other tropical cyclones of the season , there were three minor tropical depressions . The first tropical depression ( numbered five ) , developed on May 29 about 85 mi ( 135 km ) southeast of Cutler Bay , Florida . The depression tracked northeastward , and passed through the Bahamas on the Abaco Islands later that day . After crossing the Bahamas , the depression continued northeastward , and eventually dissipated 430 mi ( 690 km ) southwest of Bermuda on May 30 . No impact was reported in the Bahamas . Also on May 29 , Tropical Depression Six developed while centered 40 mi ( 60 km ) south @-@ southwest of San Andrés Island , Colombia . The depression headed west @-@ northwestward toward the coast of Nicaragua , however , it quickly veered away to the northeast . For the rest of its duration , the depression mainly headed north or north @-@ northeastward across the Caribbean Sea . On June 1 , the day that the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season officially began , Tropical Depression Six made landfall on the Zapata Peninsula in Cuba . The depression dissipated early on June 2 . No impact was reported in Cuba or Nicaragua . 
 Between June 7 and June 9 , the notable Tropical Depression Seven existed . At 0000 UTC on June 12 , Tropical Depression Eight formed about 55 mi ( 90 km ) east of Cozumel , Quintana Roo . It moved west @-@ northwestward without strengthening and made landfall between Playa del Carmen and Puerto Morelos , <unk> Roo , later that day with winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . The depression moved slowly across the Yucatán Peninsula until emerging into the Gulf of Mexico along the north coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on June 14 . No intensification occurred in the Gulf of Mexico occurred , and by 0000 UTC on June 15 , the depression dissipated while located about 50 mi ( 80 km ) north @-@ northeast of Progreso , Yucatán . A tropical wave situated about 400 mi ( 640 km ) east of Trinidad developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on July 25 . The depression moved northwestward toward the Lesser Antilles and later that day crossed Barbados with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . It continued to the northwest and may have struck Martinique on June 26 . At 0000 UTC on the following day , the depression dissipated about 30 mi ( 50 km ) west @-@ southwest of Basseterre , Guadeloupe . 
 In addition to the tropical depressions , four additional unnamed storms existed during the season . A subtropical depression formed offshore North Carolina on September 21 . It reached subtropical storm strength that day . A few days later , it reached hurricane strength while moving to the northeast . The storm dissipated on September 26 while located about 200 mi ( 320 km ) south of Newfoundland . Another storm developed from a subtropical depression southwest of the Azores on September 24 . After drifting west @-@ southwest , it moved westward and strengthened into a subtropical storm on September 25 , and later a tropical storm . The cyclone reached its 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) peak on September 27 while moving northward . On September 29 , it dissipated east of Newfoundland . A subtropical depression formed west @-@ southwest of the Azores on October 28 . Moving northwestward , it reached tropical storm status on October 29 and soon peaked with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The storm became extratropical to the west of the Azores on October 31 . A large extratropical storm over the North Atlantic formed a subtropical storm on October 31 south of Newfoundland . It moved southeast , gaining tropical characteristics and strength on the way . It reached hurricane strength on November 4 , peaking as a minimal Category 1 storm while approaching the Azores , but weakened prior to passing through the islands . The system dissipated on November 7 . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 The following names were used for named storms that formed in the Atlantic basin in 1969 . Storms were named Blanche , Camille , Eve , Francelia , Holly , Kara , Laurie and Martha for the first time in 1969 . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . At some point after the season began , the name Carol ( originally the C name on this year 's list ) was replaced with Camille . After the season , the name Camille was retired . 
 = Middle Ages = 
 In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . 
 Population decline , <unk> , invasion , and movement of peoples , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large @-@ scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the seventh century , North Africa and the Middle East — once part of the Byzantine Empire — came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still @-@ sizeable Byzantine Empire survived in the east and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or " Code of Justinian " , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued . The Franks , under the Carolingian dynasty , briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th century . It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions — Vikings from the north , Hungarians from the east , and Saracens from the south . 
 During the High Middle Ages , which began after 1000 , the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase . <unk> , the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles , and feudalism , the political structure whereby knights and lower @-@ status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors , were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages . The Crusades , first preached in 1095 , were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims . Kings became the heads of centralised nation states , reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant . Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism , a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason , and by the founding of universities . The theology of Thomas Aquinas , the paintings of Giotto , the poetry of Dante and Chaucer , the travels of Marco Polo , and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages . 
 The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine , plague , and war , which significantly diminished the population of Europe ; between 1347 and 1350 , the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans . Controversy , heresy , and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict , civil strife , and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms . Cultural and technological developments transformed European society , concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period . 
 = = Etymology and periodisation = = 
 The Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing European history : classical civilisation , or Antiquity ; the Middle Ages ; and the Modern Period . 
 Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the " Six Ages " or the " Four Empires " , and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world . When referring to their own times , they spoke of them as being " modern " . In the 1330s , the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre @-@ Christian times as antiqua ( or " ancient " ) and to the Christian period as nova ( or " new " ) . Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People ( 1442 ) . Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to Petrarch 's two . The " Middle Ages " first appears in Latin in 1469 as media <unk> or " middle season " . In early usage , there were many variants , including medium <unk> , or " middle age " , first recorded in 1604 , and media <unk> , or " middle ages " , first recorded in 1625 . The alternative term " medieval " ( or occasionally " mediaeval " or " <unk> " ) derives from medium <unk> . Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th @-@ century historian Christoph <unk> divided history into three periods : Ancient , Medieval , and Modern . 
 The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is 476 , first used by Bruni . For Europe as a whole , 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages , but there is no universally agreed upon end date . Depending on the context , events such as Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas in 1492 , the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 , or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used . English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period . For Spain , dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516 , the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504 , or the conquest of Granada in 1492 . Historians from Romance @-@ speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts : an earlier " High " and later " Low " period . English @-@ speaking historians , following their German counterparts , generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals : " Early " , " High " , and " Late " . In the 19th century , the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the " Dark Ages " , but with the adoption of these subdivisions , use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages , at least among historians . 
 = = Later Roman Empire = = 
 The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the second century AD ; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories . Economic issues , including inflation , and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century , with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers . Military expenses increased steadily during the third century , mainly in response to the war with the Sasanian Empire , which revived in the middle of the third century . The army doubled in size , and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit . The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial , or landowning , class , and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns . More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army , which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax @-@ collectors in the empire than tax @-@ payers . 
 The Emperor Diocletian ( r . 284 – 305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative <unk> in one division were considered valid in the other . In 330 , after a period of civil war , Constantine the Great ( r . 306 – 337 ) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital , Constantinople . Diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy , reformed taxation , and strengthened the army , which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation , a declining birthrate , and pressures on its frontiers , among others . Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century , diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach . For much of the 4th century , Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between the rich and poor , and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns . Another change was the Christianisation , or conversion of the empire to Christianity , a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries . 
 In 376 , the Goths , fleeing from the Huns , received permission from Emperor Valens ( r . 364 – 378 ) to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans . The settlement did not go smoothly , and when Roman officials mishandled the situation , the Goths began to raid and plunder . Valens , attempting to put down the disorder , was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378 . As well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north , internal divisions within the empire , especially within the Christian Church , caused problems . In 400 , the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and , although briefly forced back from Italy , in 410 sacked the city of Rome . In 406 the Alans , Vandals , and <unk> crossed into Gaul ; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern @-@ day Spain . The Migration Period began , when various peoples , initially largely Germanic peoples , moved across Europe . The Franks , Alemanni , and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles , Saxons , and Jutes settled in Britain , and the Vandals went on to cross the strait of Gibraltar after which they conquered the province of Africa . In the <unk> the Huns began invading the empire ; their king Attila ( r . 434 – 453 ) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447 , Gaul in 451 , and Italy in 452 . The Hunnic threat remained until Attila 's death in 453 , when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart . These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire . 
 By the end of the 5th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units , ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century . The deposition of the last emperor of the west , Romulus Augustulus , in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire . By 493 the Italian peninsula was conquered by the Ostrogoths . The Eastern Roman Empire , often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart , had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories . The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory , but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west , Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained ; the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula ( Gothic War ) in the reign of Justinian ( r . 527 – 565 ) was the sole , and temporary , exception .

 The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire . Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as " invasions " , they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire . Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration . The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho ( d . 408 ) , Aetius ( d . 454 ) , Aspar ( d . 471 ) , Ricimer ( d . 472 ) , or <unk> ( d . 516 ) , who were partly or fully of non @-@ Roman background . When the line of western emperors ceased , many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background . Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common . This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes , including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state . Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar , and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects . Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions . An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities . Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes , instead relying on granting them land or rents . This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed . Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms . Slavery declined as the supply weakened , and society became more rural . 
 Between the 5th and 8th centuries , new peoples and individuals filled the political void left by Roman centralised government . The Ostrogoths , a Gothic tribe , settled in Roman Italy in the late fifth century under Theoderic the Great ( d . 526 ) and set up a kingdom marked by its co @-@ operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths , at least until the last years of Theodoric 's reign . The Burgundians settled in Gaul , and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s . Between today 's Geneva and Lyon , it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . Elsewhere in Gaul , the Franks and Celtic Britons set up small polities . Francia was centred in northern Gaul , and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric I ( d . 481 ) . His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for its grave goods , which included weapons and a large quantity of gold . 
 Under Childeric 's son Clovis I ( r . 509 – 511 ) , the founder of the Merovingian dynasty , the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity . The Britons , related to the natives of Britannia — modern @-@ day Great Britain — settled in what is now Brittany . Other monarchies were established by the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula , the Suebi in northwestern Iberia , and the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa . In the sixth century , the Lombards settled in Northern Italy , replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all . By the late sixth century , this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy , the Kingdom of the Lombards . 
 The invasions brought new ethnic groups to Europe , although some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others . In Gaul for instance , the invaders settled much more extensively in the north @-@ east than in the south @-@ west . Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula . The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages . The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on , but distinct from , Latin , collectively known as Romance languages . These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries . Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire , but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe . 
 = = = Byzantine survival = = = 
 As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms , the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century . There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire ; most occurred in the Balkans . Peace with the Sasanian Empire , the traditional enemy of Rome , lasted throughout most of the 5th century . The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church , with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe . Legal developments included the codification of Roman law ; the first effort — the Codex Theodosianus — was completed in 438 . Under Emperor Justinian ( r . 527 – 565 ) , another compilation took place — the Corpus Juris Civilis . Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths , under Belisarius ( d . 565 ) . The conquest of Italy was not complete , as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian 's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests . At the emperor 's death , the Byzantines had control of most of Italy , North Africa , and a small foothold in southern Spain . Justinian 's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the early Muslim conquests , but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian 's successors were due not just to over @-@ taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire , which made raising troops difficult . 
 In the Eastern Empire the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs added a further difficulty for Justinian 's successors . It began gradually , but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and <unk> , and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551 . In the 560s the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube ; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to pay tribute . They remained a strong power until 796 . An additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice ( r . 582 – 602 ) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute . This led to a period of peace , but when Maurice was overthrown , the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius ( r . 610 – 641 ) controlled large chunks of the empire , including Egypt , Syria , and Anatolia until Heraclius ' successful counterattack . In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories . 
 = = = Western society = = = 
 In Western Europe , some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs . Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared , and while literacy remained important , it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status . In the 4th century , Jerome ( d . 420 ) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible . By the 6th century , Gregory of Tours ( d . 594 ) had a similar dream , but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero , he was chastised for learning shorthand . By the late 6th century , the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book . Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship , but some original works were created , along with now @-@ lost oral compositions . The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris ( d . 489 ) , Cassiodorus ( d. c . 585 ) , and Boethius ( d. c . 525 ) were typical of the age . 
 Changes also took place among laymen , as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits . Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold . Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces . Family ties within the elites were important , as were the virtues of loyalty , courage , and honour . These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society , examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul . Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation . Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men , with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul . In Anglo @-@ Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers , but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries . Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative . 
 Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility . Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology ; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century . Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes . <unk> patterns in the West were not uniform ; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns , but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm . These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies , some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy . Land settlement also varied greatly . Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants . Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside . There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems . Unlike in the late Roman period , there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat , and it was possible for a free peasant 's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord . 
 Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages . Although Italian cities remained inhabited , they contracted significantly in size . Rome , for instance , shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30 @,@ 000 by the end of the 6th century . Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use . In Northern Europe , cities also shrank , while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials . The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals . Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities , the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity . Officially they were tolerated , if subject to conversion efforts , and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas . 
 = = = Rise of Islam = = = 
 Religious beliefs in the Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries . Judaism was an active proselytising faith , and at least one Arab political leader converted to it . Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians ' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts , especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula . All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad ( d . 632 ) . After his death , Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia , starting with Syria in 634 – 635 and reaching Egypt in 640 – 641 , Persia between 637 and 642 , North Africa in the later seventh century , and the Iberian Peninsula in 711 . By 714 , Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al @-@ Andalus . 
 The Islamic conquests reached their peak in the mid @-@ eighth century . The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks , but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate . The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe , losing control of sections of the Muslim lands . Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula , the Aghlabids controlled North Africa , and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt . By the middle of the 8th century , new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean ; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy . Franks traded timber , furs , swords and slaves in return for silks and other fabrics , spices , and precious metals from the Arabs . 
 = = = Trade and economy = = = 
 The migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean . African goods stopped being imported into Europe , first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples . By the end of the 7th century , under the impact of the Muslim conquests , African products were no longer found in Western Europe . The replacement of goods from long @-@ range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages . This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean , such as northern Gaul or Britain . Non @-@ local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods . In the northern parts of Europe , not only were the trade networks local , but the goods carried were simple , with little pottery or other complex products . Around the Mediterranean , pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium @-@ range networks , not just produced locally . 
 The various Germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms . Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century , when it was replaced by silver coins . The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier , while the Anglo @-@ Saxon version was called a penny . From these areas , the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000 . Copper or bronze coins were not struck , nor were gold except in Southern Europe . No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted . 
 = = = Church and monasticism = = = 
 Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests , but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas . Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language , practices , and liturgy from the western Church . The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin . Theological and political differences emerged , and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm , clerical marriage , and state control of the church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities . The formal break came in 1054 , when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other , which led to the division of Christianity into two churches — the western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the eastern branch the Orthodox Church . 
 The ecclesiastical structure of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact , but the papacy was little regarded , and few of the western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership . Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and eastern theological controversies . The register , or archived copies of the letters , of Pope Gregory the Great ( pope 590 – 604 ) survived , and of those more than 850 letters , the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople . The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain , where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo @-@ Saxons to Christianity . Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries , going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent . Under such monks as Columba ( d . 597 ) and Columbanus ( d . 615 ) , they founded monasteries , taught in Latin and Greek , and authored secular and religious works . 
 The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West . The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria . Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life , called <unk> , which was pioneered by <unk> ( d . 348 ) in the 4th century . Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony . Benedict of Nursia ( d . 547 ) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century , detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot . Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages , in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families , centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions , and bases for missions and <unk> . They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region . Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages . Monks were also the authors of new works , including history , theology , and other subjects , written by authors such as Bede ( d . 735 ) , a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries . 
 = = = Carolingian Europe = = = 
 The Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia , Neustria , and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries , all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty , who were descended from Clovis . The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria . Such warfare was exploited by Pippin ( d . 640 ) , the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the <unk> throne . Later members of his family inherited the office , acting as advisers and regents . One of his descendants , Charles Martel ( d . 741 ) , won the Battle of Poitiers in 732 , halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees . Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , and East Anglia , which were descended from the Anglo @-@ Saxon invaders . Smaller kingdoms in present @-@ day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts . Ireland was divided into even smaller political units , usually known as tribal kingdoms , under the control of kings . There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland , of varying importance . 
 The Carolingian dynasty , as the successors to Charles Martel are known , officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III ( r . 752 – 768 ) . A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought , and gained , authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II ( pope 752 – 757 ) . Pippin 's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers , exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel , and circulated stories of the family 's great piety . At the time of his death in 768 , Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons , Charles ( r . 768 – 814 ) and Carloman ( r . 768 – 771 ) . When Carloman died of natural causes , Charles blocked the succession of Carloman 's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria . Charles , more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne , embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe , eventually controlling modern @-@ day France , northern Italy , and Saxony . In the wars that lasted beyond 800 , he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land . In 774 , Charlemagne conquered the Lombards , which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States . 
 The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history , marking a return of the Western Roman Empire , since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors . It also marks a change in Charlemagne 's relationship with the Byzantine Empire , as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state . There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire . The Frankish lands were rural in character , with only a few small cities . Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms . Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia , in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean . The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor , as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts , who administered the counties the empire had been divided into . Clergy and local bishops served as officials , as well as the imperial officials called <unk> <unk> , who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters . 
 = = = Carolingian Renaissance = = = 
 Charlemagne 's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the " Carolingian Renaissance " . Literacy increased , as did development in the arts , architecture and jurisprudence , as well as liturgical and scriptural studies . The English monk Alcuin ( d . 804 ) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria . Charlemagne 's chancery — or writing office — made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule , allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe . Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy , imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains , as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches . An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying , correcting , and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics , with the aim of encouraging learning . New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced . Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language , changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government . By the reign of Charlemagne , the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin . 
 = = = Breakup of the Carolingian Empire = = = 
 Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs , but was unable to do so as only one son , Louis the Pious ( r . 814 – 840 ) , was still alive by 813 . Just before Charlemagne died in 814 , he crowned Louis as his successor . Louis 's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and , after 829 , civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire . Eventually , Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I ( d . 855 ) as emperor and gave him Italy . Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald ( d . 877 ) , his youngest son . Lothair took East Francia , comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards , leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps . Louis the German ( d . 876 ) , the middle child , who had been rebellious to the last , was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother . The division was disputed . Pepin II of Aquitaine ( d. after 864 ) , the emperor 's grandson , rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine , while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia . Louis the Pious died in 840 , with the empire still in chaos . 
 A three @-@ year civil war followed his death . By the Treaty of Verdun ( 843 ) , a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy , and his imperial title was recognised . Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern @-@ day Germany . Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands , comprising most of modern @-@ day France . Charlemagne 's grandsons and great @-@ grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants , eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost . In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands , with the crowning of Hugh Capet ( r . 987 – 996 ) as king . In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier , in 911 , with the death of Louis the Child , and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I ( r . 911 – 918 ) as king . 
 The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions , migrations , and raids by external foes . The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings , who also raided the British Isles and settled there as well as in Iceland . In 911 , the Viking chieftain Rollo ( d. c . 931 ) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple ( r . 898 – 922 ) to settle in what became Normandy . The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms , especially Germany and Italy , were under continual Magyar assault until the invader 's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 . The breakup of the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states , some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily , as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms . 
 = = = New kingdoms and Byzantine revival = = = 
 Efforts by local kings to fight the invaders led to the formation of new political entities . In Anglo @-@ Saxon England , King Alfred the Great ( r . 871 – 899 ) came to an agreement with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century , resulting in Danish settlements in Northumbria , Mercia , and parts of East Anglia . By the middle of the 10th century , Alfred 's successors had conquered Northumbria , and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain . In northern Britain , Kenneth MacAlpin ( d. c . 860 ) united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba . In the early 10th century , the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany , and was engaged in driving back the Magyars . Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I ( r . 936 – 973 ) as Holy Roman Emperor . In 972 , he secured recognition of his title by the Byzantine Empire , which he sealed with the marriage of his son Otto II ( r . 967 – 983 ) to <unk> ( d . 991 ) , daughter of an earlier Byzantine Emperor Romanos II ( r . 959 – 963 ) . By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability ; Otto III ( r . 996 – 1002 ) spent much of his later reign in the kingdom . The western Frankish kingdom was more fragmented , and although kings remained nominally in charge , much of the political power devolved to the local lords . 
 Missionary efforts to Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped strengthen the growth of kingdoms such as Sweden , Denmark , and Norway , which gained power and territory . Some kings converted to Christianity , although not all by 1000 . Scandinavians also expanded and colonised throughout Europe . Besides the settlements in Ireland , England , and Normandy , further settlement took place in what became Russia and in Iceland . Swedish traders and raiders ranged down the rivers of the Russian steppe , and even attempted to seize Constantinople in 860 and 907 . Christian Spain , initially driven into a small section of the peninsula in the north , expanded slowly south during the 9th and 10th centuries , establishing the kingdoms of Asturias and León . 
 In Eastern Europe , Byzantium revived its fortunes under Emperor Basil I ( r . 867 – 886 ) and his successors Leo VI ( r . 886 – 912 ) and Constantine VII ( r . 913 – 959 ) , members of the Macedonian dynasty . Commerce revived and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces . The military was reorganised , which allowed the emperors John I ( r . 969 – 976 ) and Basil II ( r . 976 – 1025 ) to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts . The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning , a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance . Writers such as John <unk> ( fl. early 10th century ) composed new hymns , poems , and other works . Missionary efforts by both eastern and western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians , Bulgars , Bohemians , Poles , Magyars , and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus ' . These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples — the states of Moravia , Bulgaria , Bohemia , Poland , Hungary , and the Kievan Rus ' . Bulgaria , which was founded around 680 , at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea . By 1018 , the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire . 
 = = = Art and architecture = = = 
 Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century , although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries . By the beginning of the 8th century , the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture . One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept , or the " arms " of a cross @-@ shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave . Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church , usually at the west end of the building . 
 Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court , and the monasteries and churches they supported . It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art , but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles . Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo @-@ Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book , and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period . Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories , originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down . Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art , but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair , several reliquaries , and finds such as the Anglo @-@ Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France , <unk> from Visigothic Spain and <unk> near Byzantine territory . There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites , including the Irish Tara Brooch . Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers , including the Insular Book of Kells , the Book of Lindisfarne , and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. <unk> , which is one of the few to retain its " treasure binding " of gold encrusted with jewels . Charlemagne 's court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian art , and by the end of the period near life @-@ sized figures such as the Gero Cross were common in important churches . 
 = = = Military and technological developments = = = 
 During the later Roman Empire , the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops . The creation of heavily armoured cataphract @-@ type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th @-@ century Roman military . The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers — ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo @-@ Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths , who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies . During the early invasion period , the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare , which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider . The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier , and weaker , Scythian composite bow . Another development was the increasing use of <unk> and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour . 
 The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period , with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry . The use of militia @-@ type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period . Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted , a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry , rather than true cavalry . One exception was Anglo @-@ Saxon England , where the armies were still composed of regional levies , known as the fyrd , which were led by the local elites . In military technology , one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow , which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages . Another change was the introduction of the stirrup , which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops . A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe , which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain . 
 = = High Middle Ages = = 
 = = = Society and economic life = = = 
 The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous expansion of population . The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80 million between 1000 and 1347 , although the exact causes remain unclear : improved agricultural techniques , the decline of slaveholding , a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested . As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants . Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities , usually known as manors or villages . These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services , in a system known as <unk> . There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond , with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north . The practice of <unk> , or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them , also contributed to the expansion of population . 
 Other sections of society included the nobility , clergy , and townsmen . Nobles , both the titled nobility and simple knights , exploited the manors and the peasants , although they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism . During the 11th and 12th centuries , these lands , or fiefs , came to be considered hereditary , and in most areas they were no longer divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period . Instead , most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son . The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land , its military service as heavy cavalry , control of castles , and various immunities from taxes or other impositions . Castles , initially in wood but later in stone , began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time , and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals . Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords . Nobles were stratified ; kings and the highest @-@ ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land , as well as other nobles . Beneath them , lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people . Knights were the lowest level of nobility ; they controlled but did not own land , and had to serve other nobles . 
 The clergy was divided into two types : the secular clergy , who lived out in the world , and the regular clergy , who lived under a religious rule and were usually monks . Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population , usually less than one per cent . Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility , the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy . The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class . <unk> were in a somewhat unusual position , as they did not fit into the traditional three @-@ fold division of society into nobles , clergy , and peasants . During the 12th and 13th centuries , the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded . But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population . 
 Jews also spread across Europe during the period . Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries , but Spanish Jews , long settled in Spain under the Muslims , came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity . Most Jews were confined to the cities , as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants . Besides the Jews , there were other non @-@ Christians on the edges of Europe — pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe . 
 Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male , whether their father , husband , or other kinsman . Widows , who were often allowed much control over their own lives , were still restricted legally . Women 's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks . Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household , child @-@ care , as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house . They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home . At harvest @-@ time , they were also expected to help with field @-@ work . <unk> , like peasant women , were responsible for the household , and could also engage in trade . What trades were open to women varied by country and period . <unk> were responsible for running a household , and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives , but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs . The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns , as they were unable to become priests . 
 In central and northern Italy and in Flanders , the rise of towns that were to a degree self @-@ governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations . Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League , and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice , Genoa , and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean . Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period , allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants . In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered , famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders , Marco Polo ( d . 1324 ) . Besides new trading opportunities , agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields , which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand . Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money , and gold coinage was again minted in Europe , first in Italy and later in France and other countries . New forms of commercial contracts emerged , allowing risk to be shared among merchants . Accounting methods improved , partly through the use of double @-@ entry bookkeeping ; letters of credit also appeared , allowing easy transmission of money . 
 = = = Rise of state power = = = 
 The High Middle Ages was the formative period in the history of the modern Western state . Kings in France , England , and Spain consolidated their power , and set up lasting governing institutions . New kingdoms such as Hungary and Poland , after their conversion to Christianity , became Central European powers . The Magyars settled Hungary around 900 under King Árpád ( d. c . 907 ) after a series of invasions in the 9th century . The papacy , long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings , first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world ; the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III ( pope 1198 – 1216 ) . Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic and Finnic north @-@ east brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into European culture . 
 During the early High Middle Ages , Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty , which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period . In 1024 , they were replaced by the Salian dynasty , who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV ( r . 1084 – 1105 ) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy . His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility . A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V ( r . 1111 – 25 ) , who died without heirs , until Frederick I Barbarossa ( r . 1155 – 90 ) took the imperial throne . Although he ruled effectively , the basic problems remained , and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century . Barbarossa 's grandson Frederick II ( r . 1220 – 1250 ) , who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother , clashed repeatedly with the papacy . His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy . He and his successors faced many difficulties , including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid @-@ 13th century . Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus ' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241 , 1259 , and 1287 . 
 Under the Capetian dynasty France slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility , growing out of the Île @-@ de @-@ France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries . They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy , who in 1066 under William the Conqueror ( duke 1035 – 1087 ) , conquered England ( r . 1066 – 87 ) and created a cross @-@ channel empire that lasted , in various forms , throughout the rest of the Middle Ages . Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy , when Robert Guiscard ( d . 1085 ) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily . Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II ( r . 1154 – 89 ) and his son Richard I ( r . 1189 – 99 ) , the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France , brought to the family by Henry II 's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine ( d . 1204 ) , heiress to much of southern France . Richard 's younger brother John ( r . 1199 – 1216 ) lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus ( r . 1180 – 1223 ) . This led to dissension among the English nobility , while John 's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to Magna Carta , a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England . Under Henry III ( r . 1216 – 72 ) , John 's son , further concessions were made to the nobility , and royal power was diminished . The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries , bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration . Under Louis IX ( r . 1226 – 70 ) , royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe . 
 In Iberia , the Christian states , which had been confined to the north @-@ western part of the peninsula , began to push back against the Islamic states in the south , a period known as the Reconquista . By about 1150 , the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of León , Castile , Aragon , Navarre , and Portugal . Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states , initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba , which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas , who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re @-@ established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s . Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century , culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248 . 
 = = = Crusades = = = 
 In the 11th century , the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East , occupying Persia during the 1040s , Armenia in the 1060s , and Jerusalem in 1070 . In 1071 , the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV ( r . 1068 – 71 ) . The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor , which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland . Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat , they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive . The Turks also had difficulties , losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars . The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria , which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans . 
 The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control . The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II ( pope 1088 – 99 ) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos ( r . 1081 – 1118 ) for aid against further Muslim advances . Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part . Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099 . One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East . These were especially brutal during the First Crusade , when the Jewish communities in Cologne , Mainz , and Worms were destroyed , and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction . Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order , the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers , which fused monastic life with military service . 
 The crusaders consolidated their conquests into crusader states . During the 12th and 13th centuries , there were a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding Islamic states . Appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades , such as the Third Crusade , called to try to regain Jerusalem , which had been captured by Saladin ( d . 1193 ) in 1187 . In 1203 , the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople , and captured the city in 1204 , setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire . The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261 , but never regained their former strength . By 1291 all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland , although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived on the island of Cyprus for several years afterwards . 
 Popes called for crusades to take place elsewhere besides the Holy Land : in Spain , southern France , and along the Baltic . The Spanish crusades became fused with the Reconquista of Spain from the Muslims . Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades , similar Spanish military religious orders were founded , most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century . Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later , and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries . These crusades also spawned a military order , the Order of the Sword Brothers . Another order , the Teutonic Knights , although originally founded in the crusader states , focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225 , and in 1309 moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia . 
 = = = Intellectual life = = = 
 During the 11th century , developments in philosophy and theology led to increased intellectual activity . There was debate between the realists and the nominalists over the concept of " universals " . Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of Aristotle and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism . Scholars such as Peter Abelard ( d . 1142 ) and Peter Lombard ( d . 1164 ) introduced Aristotelian logic into theology . In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe , signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns . Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities . Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism , an attempt by 12th- and 13th @-@ century scholars to reconcile authoritative texts , most notably Aristotle and the Bible . This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason and culminated in the thought of Thomas Aquinas ( d . 1274 ) , who wrote the Summa Theologica , or Summary of Theology . 
 Chivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts . This culture was expressed in the vernacular languages rather than Latin , and comprised poems , stories , legends , and popular songs spread by troubadours , or wandering minstrels . Often the stories were written down in the chansons de geste , or " songs of great deeds " , such as The Song of Roland or The Song of Hildebrand . Secular and religious histories were also produced . Geoffrey of Monmouth ( d. c . 1155 ) composed his Historia Regum Britanniae , a collection of stories and legends about Arthur . Other works were more clearly history , such as Otto von Freising 's ( d . 1158 ) Gesta Friderici Imperatoris detailing the deeds of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa , or William of Malmesbury 's ( d. c . 1143 ) Gesta Regum on the kings of England . 
 Legal studies advanced during the 12th century . Both secular law and canon law , or ecclesiastical law , were studied in the High Middle Ages . Secular law , or Roman law , was advanced greatly by the discovery of the Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century , and by 1100 Roman law was being taught at Bologna . This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe . Canon law was also studied , and around 1140 a monk named Gratian ( fl . 12th century ) , a teacher at Bologna , wrote what became the standard text of canon law — the Decretum . 
 Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra , which allowed more advanced mathematics . Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy 's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century . Medicine was also studied , especially in southern Italy , where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno . 
 = = = Technology and military = = = 
 In the 12th and 13th centuries , Europe produced economic growth and innovations in methods of production . Major technological advances included the invention of the windmill , the first mechanical clocks , the manufacture of distilled spirits , and the use of the astrolabe . <unk> spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan , probably working in or near Pisa . 
 The development of a three @-@ field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two @-@ field system to two @-@ thirds under the new system , with a consequent increase in production . The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently , aided by the spread of the horse collar , which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen . Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture , factors that aided the implementation of the three @-@ field system . 
 The construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology , leading to the development of large stone buildings . Ancillary structures included new town halls , houses , bridges , and tithe barns . Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon . Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern @-@ post rudder , both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed . 
 In military affairs , the use of infantry with specialised roles increased . Along with the still @-@ dominant heavy cavalry , armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen , as well as sappers and engineers . Crossbows , which had been known in Late Antiquity , increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries . The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed @-@ face helmets , heavy body armour , as well as horse armour . Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid @-@ 13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304 , although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon . Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s , and hand @-@ held guns were in use by the 1360s . 
 = = = Architecture , art , and music = = = 
 In the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms , from which the term " Romanesque " is derived . Where available , Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials . From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque , the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form . Just before 1000 there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe . Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls , openings topped by semi @-@ circular arches , small windows , and , particularly in France , arched stone vaults . The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of façades , especially in France , and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals . According to art historian C. R. Dodwell , " virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall @-@ paintings " , of which few survive . Simultaneous with the development in church architecture , the distinctive European form of the castle was developed , and became crucial to politics and warfare . 
 Romanesque art , especially metalwork , was at its most sophisticated in Mosan art , in which distinct artistic personalities including Nicholas of Verdun ( d . 1205 ) become apparent , and an almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at Liège , contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick . Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts , and wall @-@ painting flourished in churches , often following a scheme with a Last Judgement on the west wall , a Christ in Majesty at the east end , and narrative biblical scenes down the nave , or in the best surviving example , at Saint @-@ Savin @-@ sur @-@ <unk> , on the barrel @-@ vaulted roof . 
 From the early 12th century , French builders developed the Gothic style , marked by the use of rib vaults , pointed arches , flying buttresses , and large stained glass windows . It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals , and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe . Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England . Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches , which continued to use extensive wall @-@ paintings , now almost all lost . 
 During this period the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops , so that according to <unk> Benton " by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops " , and the book of hours developed as a form of devotional book for lay @-@ people . Metalwork continued to be the most prestigious form of art , with Limoges enamel a popular and relatively affordable option for objects such as reliquaries and crosses . In Italy the innovations of Cimabue and Duccio , followed by the Trecento master Giotto ( d . 1337 ) , greatly increased the sophistication and status of panel painting and fresco . Increasing prosperity during the 12th century resulted in greater production of secular art ; many carved ivory objects such as gaming @-@ pieces , combs , and small religious figures have survived . 
 = = = Church life = = = 
 Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century , as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life . Cluny Abbey , founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909 , was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms , a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear . Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour . It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen , thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords . 
 Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church . The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX ( pope 1049 – 1054 ) , and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century . This involved Pope Gregory VII ( pope 1073 – 85 ) and Emperor Henry IV , who initially clashed over episcopal appointments , a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture , clerical marriage , and simony . The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands , but the papacy insisted on the Church 's independence from secular lords . These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms . The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities . It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors . 
 The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements . Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms , people sought to participate in new forms of religious life . New monastic orders were founded , including the Carthusians and the Cistercians . The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux ( d . 1153 ) . These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen , who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler <unk> monasticism of early Christianity , or to live an Apostolic life . Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged . Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome , Jerusalem , and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors , and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence . 
 In the 13th century mendicant orders — the Franciscans and the Dominicans — who swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging , were approved by the papacy . Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the <unk> also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries , but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy . Others joined the Cathars , another heretical movement condemned by the papacy . In 1209 , a crusade was preached against the Cathars , the Albigensian Crusade , which in combination with the medieval Inquisition , eliminated them . 
 = = Late Middle Ages = = 
 = = = War , famine , and plague = = = 
 The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines , culminating in the Great Famine of 1315 – 17 . The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age , which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures . The years 1313 – 14 and 1317 – 21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe , resulting in widespread crop failures . The climate change — which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century — was accompanied by an economic downturn . 
 These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death , a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years . The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe , about one @-@ third of the population . Towns were especially hard @-@ hit because of their crowded conditions . Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited , and in some places fields were left unworked . Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields . Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food , both of which cut into agricultural income . Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings , and popular uprisings broke out across Europe . Among the uprisings were the <unk> in France , the Peasants ' Revolt in England , and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders . The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe , manifested by the foundation of new charities , the self @-@ mortification of the <unk> , and the scapegoating of Jews . Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century ; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages . 
 = = = Society and economy = = = 
 Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death . Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned , as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas . Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe , as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free . Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents . The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period . Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders , and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments . Partly at the urging of landlords , governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death . Non @-@ clergy became increasingly literate , and urban populations began to imitate the nobility 's interest in chivalry . 
 Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306 . Although some were allowed back into France , most were not , and many Jews emigrated eastwards , settling in Poland and Hungary . The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 , and dispersed to Turkey , France , Italy , and Holland . The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century , fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms . Many banking firms loaned money to royalty , at great risk , as some were bankrupted when kings defaulted on their loans . 
 = = = State resurgence = = = 
 Strong , royalty @-@ based nation states rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages , particularly in England , France , and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula : Aragon , Castile , and Portugal . The long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry . Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled . Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient , and the rate of taxation often increased . The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority . 
 Throughout the 14th century , French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility . They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France , leading to the Hundred Years ' War , waged from 1337 to 1453 . Early in the war the English under Edward III ( r . 1327 – 77 ) and his son Edward , the Black Prince ( d . 1376 ) , won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers , captured the city of Calais , and won control of much of France . The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war . In the early 15th century , France again came close to dissolving , but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc ( d . 1431 ) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453 . The price was high , as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict . Conversely , the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity , doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal . The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture , which had previously been the dominant influence . The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years ' War , and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346 . 
 In modern @-@ day Germany , the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule , but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form . Further east , the kingdoms of Poland , Hungary , and Bohemia grew powerful . In Iberia , the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula ; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century , while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns . After losing the Hundred Years ' War , England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses , which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor ( r . 1485 – 1509 as Henry VII ) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III ( r . 1483 – 85 ) at Bosworth in 1485 . In Scandinavia , Margaret I of Denmark ( r. in Denmark 1387 – 1412 ) consolidated Norway , Denmark , and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar , which continued until 1523 . The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League , a commercial confederation of city states that traded from Western Europe to Russia . Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce ( r . 1306 – 29 ) , who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328 . 
 = = = Collapse of Byzantium = = = 
 Although the <unk> emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261 , they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands . They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople , the city itself , and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea . The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia , the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city @-@ state of Venice . The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe , the Ottomans , who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century . The Ottomans expanded into Europe , reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 . Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396 ; a great army was sent to the Balkans , where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis . Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453 . 
 = = = Controversy within the Church = = = 
 During the tumultuous 14th century , disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1305 – 78 , also called the " Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy " ( a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews ) , and then to the Great Schism , lasting from 1378 to 1418 , when there were two and later three rival popes , each supported by several states . Ecclesiastical officials convened at the Council of Constance in 1414 , and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes , leaving only two claimants . Further depositions followed , and in November 1417 the council elected Martin V ( pope 1417 – 31 ) as pope . 
 Besides the schism , the western church was riven by theological controversies , some of which turned into heresies . John Wycliffe ( d . 1384 ) , an English theologian , was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine . Wycliffe 's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages : Lollardy in England and <unk> in Bohemia . The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus , who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance . The Hussite church , although the target of a crusade , survived beyond the Middle Ages . Other heresies were manufactured , such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV ( r . 1285 – 1314 ) and the Hospitallers . 
 The papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages , holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist . This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy . The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages , veneration of relics , and belief in the power of the Devil . Mystics such as Meister Eckhart ( d . 1327 ) and Thomas à Kempis ( d . 1471 ) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life , which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation . Besides mysticism , belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread , and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum , the most popular handbook for witch @-@ hunters . 
 = = = Scholars , intellectuals , and exploration = = = 
 During the Later Middle Ages , theologians such as John Duns Scotus ( d . 1308 ) and William of Ockham ( d. c . 1348 ) , led a reaction against scholasticism , objecting to the application of reason to faith . Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of " universals " . Ockham 's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy . Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law . The lone exception to this trend was in England , where the common law remained pre @-@ eminent . Other countries codified their laws ; legal codes were promulgated in Castile , Poland , and Lithuania . 
 Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy . The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest , but the secondary subjects of the trivium — grammar , rhetoric , logic — were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities . Commercial secondary schools spread , and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise . Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries . Lay literacy rates rose , but were still low ; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500 . 
 The publication of vernacular literature increased , with Dante ( d . 1321 ) , Petrarch ( d . 1374 ) and Giovanni Boccaccio ( d . 1375 ) in 14th @-@ century Italy , Geoffrey Chaucer ( d . 1400 ) and William Langland ( d. c . 1386 ) in England , and François Villon ( d . 1464 ) and Christine de Pizan ( d. c . 1430 ) in France . Much literature remained religious in character , and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin , a new demand developed for saints ' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages . This was fed by the growth of the Devotio Moderna movement , most prominently in the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life , but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes <unk> ( d . 1361 ) . Theatre also developed in the guise of miracle plays put on by the Church . At the end of the period , the development of the printing press in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500 . 
 In the early 15th century , the countries of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe . Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal ( d . 1460 ) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands , the Azores , and Cape Verde during his lifetime . After his death , exploration continued ; Bartolomeu Dias ( d . 1500 ) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama ( d . 1524 ) sailed around Africa to India in 1498 . The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus ( d . 1506 ) in 1492 that discovered the Americas . The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot ( d . 1498 ) in 1497 , which landed on Cape Breton Island . 
 = = = Technological and military developments = = = 
 One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry . The English also employed longbowmen , but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success . Armour continued to advance , spurred by the increasing power of crossbows , and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand @-@ held guns that were developed . Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears . 
 In agriculture , the increased usage of sheep with long @-@ <unk> wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun . In addition , the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool , tripling production . A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments , which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer . Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill , allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing . The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden , increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality . The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions . 
 = = = Late medieval art and architecture = = = 
 The Late Middle Ages in Europe as a whole correspond to the Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods in Italy . Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles , which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century , until almost the end of the period . International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400 , producing masterpieces such as the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry . All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality , and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons , commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery , ivory caskets , <unk> chests , and maiolica pottery . These objects also included the Hispano @-@ <unk> ware produced by mostly <unk> potters in Spain . Although royalty owned huge collections of plate , little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup . Italian silk manufacture developed , so that western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world . In France and Flanders tapestry weaving of sets like The Lady and the Unicorn became a major luxury industry . 
 The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building , as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved , as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant 'Andrea . Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common , especially as churches created many side @-@ chapels . Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck ( d . 1441 ) and Rogier van der Weyden ( d . 1464 ) rivalled that of Italy , as did northern illuminated manuscripts , which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites , who also commissioned secular books , especially histories . From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular , though still expensive . There were around 30 @,@ 000 different editions of incunabula , or works printed before 1500 , by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others . Very small woodcuts , nearly all religious , were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century . More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images . 
 = = Modern perceptions = = 
 The medieval period is frequently caricatured as a " time of ignorance and superstition " that placed " the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity . " This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Enlightenment , when scholars contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period , to the detriment of the Middle Ages . Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world ; Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith , and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition . 
 Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages . Science historian Edward Grant writes , " If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [ in the 18th century ] , they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities " . Also , contrary to common belief , David Lindberg writes , " the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free ( particularly in the natural sciences ) to follow reason and observation wherever they led " . 
 The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions . One misconception , first propagated in the 19th century and still very common , is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat . This is untrue , as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere . Lindberg and Ronald Numbers , another scholar of the period , state that there " was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [ Earth 's ] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference " . Other misconceptions such as " the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages " , " the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science " , or " the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy " , are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth , although they are not supported by current historical research .

 The Yuan @-@ Tseh Lee Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy , also known as the Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy ( AMiBA ) , is a radio telescope designed to observe the cosmic microwave background and the Sunyaev @-@ Zel 'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies . It is located on Mauna Loa in Hawaii , at 3 @,@ 396 metres ( 11 @,@ 142 ft ) above sea level . 
 AMiBA was originally configured as a 7 @-@ element interferometer atop a <unk> mount . Observations at a wavelength of 3 mm ( 86 – 102 GHz ) started in October 2006 , and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev @-@ Zel 'dovich effect were announced in 2008 . In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements , and it is capable of further expansion to 19 elements . AMiBA is the result of a collaboration between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics , the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility , and also involves researchers from other universities . 
 = = Design = = 
 AMiBA was initially configured as a 7 @-@ element interferometer , using 0 @.@ 576 m Cassegrain dishes mounted on a 6 m carbon fibre <unk> mount . It is located on Mauna Loa , Hawaii , and observes at 3 mm ( 86 – 102 GHz ) to minimize foreground emission from other , non @-@ thermal sources . The telescope has a retractable shelter , made from seven steel trusses and PVC fabric . 
 The receivers are based on <unk> Microwave Integrated Circuit ( <unk> ) technology , with low noise amplifiers cooled to 15 K , which have 20 GHz bandwidths and provide 46 dB of amplification . The signals are mixed with a local oscillator to reduce their frequency , prior to correlation with an analog <unk> . The system temperatures are between 55 and 75 K. 
 AMiBA started in 2000 , with funding for 4 years from the Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics Project of the Taiwan Ministry of Education . A 2 @-@ element prototype was set up on Mauna Loa in 2002 . Further funding for a second 4 years was provided by the National Science Council . The mount arrived on site in 2004 , and the platform was installed in 2005 . The first 7 elements were then installed ( " <unk> " ) , and the telescope 's first light was in September 2006 , observing Jupiter . The telescope was dedicated in October 2006 to Yuan @-@ Tseh Lee . The array was upgraded to have thirteen 1 @.@ 2 m dishes in 2009 ( " <unk> " ) . After extensive testing and calibration , scientific observations resumed in 2011 . It is further expandable up to 19 elements . 
 = = Observations = = 
 The primary goal of AMiBA is to observe both the temperature and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at multipoles between 800 and 8 @,@ 000 ( corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky ) , as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev @-@ Zel 'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies , which has a maximum decrement around 100 GHz . In its initial configuration , it measures up to multipoles of 3 @,@ 000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes . The telescope only observes at night during good weather , using planets for calibration . 
 Six clusters were imaged in 2007 : the Abell clusters 1689 , 1995 , 2142 , 2163 , <unk> and 2390 , which have redshifts between 0 @.@ 091 and 0 @.@ 322 . For the largest and brightest four of these — Abell 1689 , <unk> , 2142 and 2390 — comparisons were made with X @-@ ray and Subaru weak lensing data to study the cluster layout and radial properties , specifically of the mass profiles and baryon content . It is predicted that AMiBA with either 13 or 19 elements will be able to detect around 80 clusters per year via the SZ effect .

 = White Mountain art = 
 White Mountain art is the body of work created during the 19th century by over four hundred artists who painted landscape scenes of the White Mountains of New Hampshire in order to promote the region and , consequently , sell their works of art . 
 In the early part of the 19th century , artists ventured to the White Mountains of New Hampshire to sketch and paint . Many of the first artists were attracted to the region because of the 1826 tragedy of the Willey family , in which nine people lost their lives in a mudslide . These early works portrayed a dramatic and untamed mountain wilderness . Dr. Robert McGrath describes a Thomas Cole ( 1801 – 1848 ) painting titled Distant View of the Slide that Destroyed the Willey Family thus : " ... an array of broken stumps and errant rocks , together with a gathering storm , suggest the wildness of the site while evoking an appropriate ambient of darkness and desolation " . The images stirred the imagination of Americans , primarily from the large cites of the northeast , who traveled to the White Mountains to view the scenes for themselves . Others soon followed : innkeepers , writers , scientists , and more artists . The White Mountains became a major attraction for tourists from the New England states and beyond . The circulation of paintings and prints depicting the area enabled those who could not visit , because of lack of means , distance , or other circumstance , to appreciate its beauty . 
 Transportation improved to the region ; inns and later grand resort hotels , complete with artists in residence , were built . Benjamin Champney ( 1817 – 1907 ) , one of the early artists , popularized the Conway Valley . Other artists preferred the Franconia area , and yet still others ventured to Gorham , Shelburne and the communities of the north . Although these artists all painted similar scenes within the White Mountains , each artist had an individual style that characterized his work . These landscape paintings in the Hudson River tradition , however , eventually fell out of favor with the public , and , by the turn of the century , the era for White Mountain art had ended . 
 = = The Willey tragedy = = 
 On August 28 , 1826 , torrential rains in the White Mountains caused a mudslide on Mount Willey . The Willey couple , with their five children , lived in a small house in the notch between Mounts Willey and Webster . They evacuated their home with the help of two hired men to escape the landslide , but all seven <unk> and the two hired men died in the avalanche . The Willey home was left standing . Rescuers later found an open Bible on a table in the home , indicating that the family retreated in haste . 
 The news of the Willey tragedy quickly spread across the nation . During the ensuing years , it would become the subject of literature , drawings , local histories , scientific journals , and paintings . One such example is the painting by Thomas Hill ( 1829 – 1908 ) titled Crawford Notch , the site of the Willey tragedy before the slide . The Willey disaster started a new awareness of the American landscape and the raw wilderness of the White Mountains . This allure — tragedy and untamed nature — was a powerful draw for the early artists who painted in the White Mountains of New Hampshire . Thomas Cole ( 1801 – 1848 ) in his diary entry of October 6 , 1828 , wrote , " The site of the Willey House , with its little patch of green in the gloomy desolation , very naturally recalled to mind the horrors of the night when the whole family perished beneath an avalanche of rocks and earth . " 
 The incident provided the basis for an 1835 story by Nathaniel Hawthorne titled " The Ambitious Guest " . 
 = = Early artists = = 
 In 1827 , one of the first artists to sketch in the White Mountains was Thomas Cole , founder of the style of painting that would later be called the Hudson River School . Cole ’ s 1839 work , A View of the Pass Called the Notch of the White Mountains , is perhaps the best and finest examples of early 19th @-@ century White Mountain art . Catherine Campbell , in her reference New Hampshire Scenery , stated , " The Notch of the White Mountains [ is a ] magistral work , one of the undisputed masterpieces of White Mountain painting . " Two other early White Mountain painters were the Massachusetts artists Alvan Fisher ( 1792 – 1863 ) and Thomas Doughty ( 1793 – 1856 ) . The works of these early artists depicted dramatic landscapes and man ’ s relative insignificance compared to nature . " Fisher 's turbulent view [ of The Notch ] also emphasizes the power of the mountains and the fragility of human enterprise . " These paintings helped to promote the region at a time when the White Mountains were an unknown wilderness . 
 Beginning in the 1830s , the landscape painters of the Hudson River School " sought to define America and what it was to be an American . Artists of that time saw themselves as scientists making documents that expressed Christian truths and democratic ideals . " 
 In 1851 , John Frederick Kensett ( 1816 – 1872 ) produced a large canvas , 40 x 60 inches , of Mount Washington that has become one of the best and finest later examples of White Mountain art . Barbara J. MacAdam , the Jonathan L. Cohen Curator of America Art at the Hood Museum of Dartmouth College , has written : " John Frederick Kensett first made the scene famous through his monumental landscape , Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway ... Kensett 's image became the single most effective mid @-@ nineteenth @-@ century advertisement for the scenic charms of the White Mountains and of North Conway in particular . Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway , purchased by the American Art Union , was made into a print by the engraver James Smillie ( 1833 – 1909 ) and distributed to over 13 @,@ 000 Art Union subscribers throughout the country . Many artists painted copies of this same scene from the print , and Currier and Ives published a lithograph of this view in 1860 . Kensett ’ s painting is another example of a work of art that helped to popularize the region . Catherine Campbell described the painting as " canonical among White Mountain paintings " and " the best known landscape view of the era . " 
 Because of the proximity of Boston to the White Mountains , artists from that city became the predominate visitors and artists to capture White Mountain views . Beginning with Benjamin Champney in 1838 , and continuing through the 19th century , his friends and fellow artists traveled to the mountains . In 1854 these artists , including Francis Seth Frost ( 1825 – 1902 ) , Alfred T. Ordway ( 1821 – 1897 ) , Samuel Lancaster Gerry ( 1813 – 1891 ) , and Samuel W. Griggs ( 1827 – 1898 ) , were the founding members of the Boston Art Club , which for many years became a venue to view White Mountain paintings . 
 = = Travel to the region = = 
 Early coach travel to the White Mountains was time @-@ consuming . Before the advent of rail travel , a stagecoach ride from Portland , Maine to Conway , New Hampshire , a distance of fifty miles , took a day . When the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad completed its route from Portland to Gorham in 1851 , tourists and artists could travel in relative comfort to the White Mountains , and were within eight miles of Mount Washington and the Glen House . 
 Although rail lines to North Conway were not complete until the early 1870s , an innkeeper in the area , Samuel Thompson , established coach service from Conway to North Conway and , subsequently , to Pinkham Notch . Thompson is also credited with enticing artists to North Conway in order to promote the region . In the early 1850s , Thompson convinced a young artist , Benjamin Champney , to visit North Conway . 
 = = Benjamin Champney and the allure of North Conway = = 
 Benjamin Champney , a New Hampshire native , made his first trip to the White Mountains in 1838 on a summer excursion . As an emerging artist in the second half of the 19th century , Champney ’ s style was influenced by the Hudson River School , yet he developed a unique style of his own . Dr. Donald D. Keyes has stated , " Champney witnessed major artistic changes ; yet his art remained solidly in the camp of the Romantic artists of his youth . " In 1853 , Champney bought a home in North Conway and spent the rest of his life painting in the greater Conway area . He attracted other artists to the region and opened his studio to them as well as to tourists . Champney , in his autobiography of 1900 , wrote : " My studio has been the resort of many highly cultivated people from all parts of our country and even from foreign lands , and I have enjoyed much and learned much from the interchange of ideas with refined and intelligent minds . " He also described the popularity of North Conway , " Thus every year brought fresh visitors to North Conway as the news of its attractions spread , until in 1853 and 1854 the meadows and the banks of the Saco were dotted all about with white umbrellas in great numbers . " 
 Largely because of Champney ’ s promotion of the area , these artists traveled to North Conway in the summer to paint . The area was filled with artists painting en plein air . By 1855 , North Conway had become " … the pet valley of our landscape painters . There are always a dozen or more here during the sketching season , and you can hardly glance over the meadows , in any direction , without seeing one of their white umbrellas shining in the sun , " thus echoing Champney 's own words . By the 1850s , North Conway had arguably become the first artist colony in the United States . Winslow Homer ( 1836 – 1910 ) depicted these artists in his 1868 painting titled Artists <unk> in the White Mountains . 
 = = Later artists = = 
 In all , over four hundred artists are known to have painted White Mountain views during the 19th century . They came from the Boston area , Maine , Pennsylvania , and New York . Most of the Hudson River School painters worked in the White Mountains while maintaining studios in New York City , including such well @-@ known artists as Sanford Robinson Gifford ( 1823 – 1880 ) and Jasper Francis <unk> ( 1823 – 1900 ) . 
 Most artists came to the White Mountains in the summer , but returned to their urban studios , or sometimes to warmer climates like Florida , in the winter . Therefore , paintings of winter scenes are not common . A few artists , like Champney , Edward Hill ( 1843 – 1923 ) , and Edward 's brother , Thomas Hill , would sometimes paint these rarer winter scenes . Two examples of winter paintings , both illustrated in this article , are Thomas Hill 's Mount Lafayette in Winter and Benjamin Champney 's Moat Mountain from North Conway . Frank Henry Shapleigh ( 1842 – 1906 ) had a home in Jackson and was a prolific painter of New Hampshire scenes , both in summer and winter . 
 By mid @-@ century , the later painters changed their style from the idealized views of the earlier painters to more literal views of the mountains . Dr. Donald D. Keyes has written , " ... the aesthetics of the time [ 1840s and 1850s ] were also changing , with less emphasis placed on the Sublime and more on fact — ' realism ' . " These more literal views were sought after by tourists as mementos of their travels in an era before photography . As an example of how literal these depictions were , see the composite image where a painting by George Albert Frost ( 1843 – 1907 ) of Franconia Notch painted in 1883 is compared to a photograph of the scene in 2004 . 
 = = Grand resort hotels = = 
 It was during the 1860s that many of the region 's resort hotels were built and became popular as major summer destinations for affluent city dwellers from Boston , New York , and Philadelphia . By 1865 , White Mountain tourism was " so immense that it tasks to the utmost the capacity of all the hotels and boarding houses " . During the latter half of the 19th century , many of the artists took up residence at one of these grand hotels and became known as artists @-@ in @-@ residence . This arrangement had advantages for both the artist and the hotel . Once established , the artists invited guests to their studios to view their works . The guests purchased original works to bring home as a remembrance of the White Mountains . The hotel benefited by having another attraction to keep guests for an extended stay . 
 Two well @-@ known artists @-@ in @-@ residence were Edward Hill and Frank Henry Shapleigh . Hill worked at the Profile House in Franconia Notch for fifteen years , from 1877 to 1892 , and spent shorter stays at the <unk> Hotel and the Glen House . Frank Shapleigh was the artist @-@ in @-@ residence at the Crawford House in Crawford Notch for sixteen years , from 1877 to 1893 . 
 = = Working in North Conway , Franconia , and points north = = 
 North Conway , by virtue of its unique location in the southern Mount Washington Valley , was a gathering place for many of the artists . The artist Asher B. Durand ( 1796 – 1886 ) , in a letter to The Crayon in 1855 , described the appeal of North Conway : 
 " Mount Washington , the leading feature of the scene , ... rises in all his majesty , and with his contemporary patriots , Adams , Jefferson , Munroe [ sic ] , bounds the view at the North . On either hand , subordinate mountains and ledges slope , or abruptly descend to the fertile plain that borders the Saco , stretching many miles southward , rich in varying tints of green fields and meadows , and beautifully interspersed with groves and scattered trees of graceful form and deepest verdure ... where every possible shade of green is harmoniously mingled . " 
 A favorite spot in North Conway for viewing and painting Mount Washington was Sunset Hill . Typical for this view , in 1858 Champney painted Mount Washington from Sunset Hill that looks down on his own house and backyard , and out across North Conway ’ s Intervale . North Conway afforded vantage points for other frequently painted views — Moat Mountain , Kearsarge North , and Mount <unk> . North Conway was also a short distance from two of the three notches of the White Mountains : Pinkham Notch , and Crawford Notch . 
 Many artists also traveled to the third notch , Franconia Notch , to paint . A rivalry developed between the Franconia artists and the North Conway artists . Each faction believed that their location had the most beautiful view of the mountains . Those who preferred Franconia felt that North Conway , as early as 1857 , had been overrun by tourists . Barbara J. MacAdam , in her essay " A Proper Distance from the Hills , " stated : " To meet this growing demand [ for tourists ] , railroad lines were extended and new hotels constructed on a grand scale . In the process , those qualities that had drawn artists to North Conway in the first place became endangered . " Daniel Huntington ( 1816 – 1906 ) , writing from West <unk> in 1855 , described the appeal of the Franconia region to the landscape painter . 
 " I find it indeed a very agreeable and desirable place for landscape study ... The <unk> river which winds through the valley , is somewhat like the Saco in the vicinity of Conway . Its banks are mostly of sand , occasionally varied by broken masses of rock ... The valley is narrower than that of the Saco , and is quite different in the character of its half @-@ wooded hill @-@ sides . " 
 In the Franconia region , artists painted Mount Lafayette , Franconia Notch , Eagle Cliff , and New Hampshire 's well @-@ known icon , the Old Man of the Mountain . Edward Hill , George McConnell , and Samuel Lancaster Gerry all painted the subject of the Old Man . Fewer artists worked in the area north of the Presidential Range .

 = = Characteristics of the artists = = 
 Each White Mountain artist had certain characteristics that would distinguish his work from that of other artists . These characteristics may be more suggestive of an artist than even his signature , since signatures are sometimes forged . 
 Benjamin Champney was a master at painting water and is known for warm autumn colors . William F. <unk> ( 1866 – 1951 ) , in his later style , used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling . George McConnell ( 1852 – 1929 ) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings . Edward Hill often created a canopy @-@ like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate the focus of a painting , a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude . Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry ( 1813 – 1891 ) included dogs , people on horseback , and women and men in red clothing . Francis Seth Frost ( 1825 – 1902 ) was known to use small figures , wispy clouds , and an oval format . Alfred Thompson <unk> ( 1837 – 1908 ) was known for his quiet , calm water . Sylvester Phelps <unk> ( 1830 – 1906 ) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch . John White Allen Scott ( 1815 – 1907 ) frequently painted passing storm clouds in his skies . Frank Henry Shapleigh had his own primitive style and used the same " props " over and over again in his paintings . He is known for painting landscapes as seen from the inside of a house or barn looking out through an open door or window . Inside the room would be such props as a ladder back chair , a cat , a basket , a straw hat , a broom , and / or a tall clock . 
 Characteristics are illustrated for these representative artists in the image gallery below . 
 = = End of an era = = 
 The scenes these artists painted became American icons , certainly to the people of New England . As tourists took these White Mountain paintings home , they were widely dispensed throughout the country . Today , these paintings are discovered as far away as California . 
 By the latter part of the 19th century , landscape images , such as Mount Washington , had lost their appeal with the public . Newer images , such as those of the Rocky Mountains , were outweighing interest in the White Mountains . Also , landscapes in the Hudson River style were " usurped both by new artistic ideas and by the social and technological changes that were rapidly occurring in the region and throughout the country . " By the end of the 19th century , these factors , and the advent of photography , led to the gradual decline of White Mountain landscape painting . Many of these paintings , however , are preserved in both private collections and public institutions . Some of these paintings can be seen in New Hampshire at the New Hampshire Historical Society in Concord , the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester , and at the Hood Museum of Art in Hanover .

 = Michael Dawson ( Lost ) = 
 Michael Dawson is a fictional character played by Harold Perrineau on the ABC television series Lost . Michael served as the secondary antagonist of the second season . After losing a custody battle with Susan Lloyd ( Tamara Taylor ) , Michael does not see his son Walt ( Malcolm David Kelley ) for almost ten years . They reunite when she dies , but on their journey home , their plane crashes on a mysterious island in the South Pacific . Here Walt is kidnapped by the Island 's previous inhabitants , the Others , and Michael spends his time trying to retrieve him . He is eventually successful , and they leave the Island together , but the guilt over the murders he had to commit to achieve this leads him to an estrangement with his son and a suicide attempt . He returns to the Island on a freighter , but is killed when a bomb on it explodes . Michael reappears as a ghost , and apologizes to Hurley for killing Libby ( Cynthia Watros ) . 
 Although initially skeptical about the role , Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it . Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten ; he was originally going to be part of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun ( Yunjin Kim ) and Jin ( Daniel Dae Kim ) , but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped . After Michael leaves the Island in season two , Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point ; he felt there was more to tell of Michael 's story . Reception for the character was mixed . However , Perrineau 's acting was praised . 
 = = Arc = = 
 Much of Michael 's life before the plane crash is shown in flashbacks during " Special " . Susan Lloyd leaves Michael after their son Walt is born , and travels to Amsterdam with Walt . Two years later , Susan tells him that she intends to get married . Michael becomes enraged , and is hit by a car , leaving him hospitalized for months . Susan tracks him down at the hospital and tries to convince him to give up his parental rights , so that her new husband can adopt Walt . Michael refuses , but in the resulting custody battle Susan convinces him that it is the best decision for Walt . Several years later , Susan dies , and her husband asks Michael to take custody of Walt , who is now living in Australia . Michael agrees , but just before the return flight , calls his mother and asks if she can take Walt instead . 
 Their plane crashes on an island in the South Pacific ; Michael , Walt and Walt 's dog Vincent are among the survivors . After Vincent runs into the jungle , Michael searches for him , but to no avail ; it is later that Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) returns Vincent to Michael . Despite this gesture , Michael is skeptical about Locke , and does not want Walt spending time with him . After Michael is attacked by a Korean survivor , Jin , over a gold watch Michael has started wearing , Jin 's wife Sun approaches him to explain that it is her father 's watch , and in doing so reveals that she speaks English . Michael begins constructing a raft , in hope that he and Walt can escape the Island . After witnessing his completed raft burned down , Michael blames Jin , but later Walt confesses that it was him . Although Walt did not want to leave the Island , he has now changed his mind . Michael and Jin bond after Sun reveals her ability to speak English , and the two men begin work on a second raft . They offer the final space on board to Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) . In the season finale " Exodus " , Michael sets sail with Jin , Sawyer and Walt , and not far from the Island , they encounter a small fishing boat . The occupants of the fishing boat are the Others , who have long inhabited the Island . They kidnap Walt and destroy the raft . 
 At the beginning of season two , Michael and Sawyer are stranded in the middle of the ocean , with Jin missing . They wash ashore and discover Jin , then are knocked unconscious by one of the survivors from the tail section of the plane . After convincing the tail section survivors that they were on the same plane , they all return to the beach camp of the fuselage survivors . Later , Michael offers to take a shift in the hatch that the survivors have found . Here , he begins receiving computer messages from someone who he thinks is Walt , who gives him directions to where he is being held . Michael ventures off in search for him , but moments after leaving the camp , two of the Others kidnap him and hold him hostage . Michael is told to retrieve their leader , who is held prisoner in the hatch , then bring Sawyer , Kate ( Evangeline Lilly ) , Jack ( Matthew Fox ) and Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) to them , and they will return Walt and let them leave the Island . In order to free their leader , Ben ( Michael Emerson ) , Michael convinces Ana Lucia ( Michelle Rodriguez ) , who is guarding Ben , that he will kill Ben on her behalf , but instead kills her when she hands over the gun and the combination to the armory . When Libby ( Cynthia Watros ) walks in on them , Michael , startled , shoots her twice . He succeeds in bringing the four requested survivors to the Others , so Ben reunites him with Walt . Michael and Walt are given a boat and coordinates to freedom , and they sail away from the Island . 
 A flashback during " Meet Kevin Johnson " reveals that they manage to return to New York City , where Michael hands Walt over to Walt 's grandmother . Michael then attempts suicide , unable to cope with the guilt of his murders . Tom ( M. C. Gainey ) , one of the Others , arrives , and tells Michael he can redeem himself by saving the other survivors from an imminent threat . Tom gives Michael a passport with the new name of " Kevin Johnson " in order to infiltrate a freighter that is trying to find the Island . On the freighter he receives a call from Ben , who instructs him to send him information on all the crew , then to sabotage the radio room and the boat engines . In his first season four appearance , Michael meets Sayid ( Naveen Andrews ) and Desmond ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , who have managed to get from the Island to the freighter . They tell the freighter 's captain of Michael 's true identity , who orders him to repair the engines . During the season finale , Michael and Jin attempt to disarm a bomb planted on the freighter . Michael slows the bomb 's detonation with liquid nitrogen , then tells Jin to leave , when he is almost out of nitrogen . When the supply of nitrogen runs out , Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) appears to Michael and tells him he can go now . The bomb detonates , and Michael is killed in the explosion , having achieved the redemption he had been seeking . Michael reappears halfway through the sixth season as a ghost that only Hurley can see . He explains that the whispers on the island are the voices of those who have died on the island . As Hurley turns to depart , Michael stops him and apologizes for the pain he caused for both him and Libby .

 During season two , Perrineau stated " [ Michael ] ' s nicer than I expected him to be . Or , he is nicer so far than I expected him to be ... I try to take characters that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate . I think Michael is all those things . He seems to have a lot of bad luck . " He defends Michael 's behavior in season two , saying " [ Michael ] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for " . Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as " one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815 @-@ ers : flawed , tortured , hard to read , volatile , fighting his innate talents , his own worst enemy , at times , and at others , a totally stand @-@ up guy . " IGN 's Chris Carabott calls Michael a " natural " father . Michael is known for frequently shouting " Walt ! " , " Where 's my son ! " and " Have you seen my boy ? " . 
 = = Development = = 
 When the producers were auditioning actors for roles in Lost , Harold Perrineau was in the area . The producers called it a " natural move " to have him audition . Although initially skeptical about the show , he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it . Perrineau was attracted to the role because " [ Michael ] ' s a guy that 's in a lot of conflict and we 're not exactly sure why " . In season one , Michael was going to be part of a love triangle with Sun and Jin , however this was dropped after positive fan reaction to Sun and Jin 's relationship . The storyline is revisited in the Missing Pieces mobisode " Buried Secrets " , which shows Michael and Sun almost kissing . Michael and Jin were going to be enemies throughout all of the season , but the producers felt Perrineau and Daniel Dae Kim had good chemistry , so the storyline was changed to them becoming friends . Perrineau called filming the first season " one of [ his ] best years as a working actor " . 
 Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff explained that Michael 's storyline in season two is about " what a father will do to save his son " ; she noted " there 's nothing worse than what he does " . The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric , however this was rewritten " at the proverbial last minute " and changed to a Michael centric episode . Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode . Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael was going to kill Ana Lucia and Libby . Perrineau described shooting the scenes in " Two for the Road " where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a " tough day " . The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island . As it was a long camera shot , Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier , that by the time he returned , all the equipment had already been packed away . He said , " It felt fitting , actually . Like ; that 's it " . Perrineau knew he would be back one day , but as the producers did not reveal any details to him , he did not know when . He was the first actor that left the show as " part of a grander design to come back " , and the only one until Emilie de Ravin . 
 After leaving the Island in the second season finale " Live Together , Die Alone " , Michael was supposed to return in the season three finale , but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons , so was unable to return . Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four , " Ji Yeon " . His return was meant to be announced during Lost 's slot at the 2007 Comic @-@ Con International , however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC 's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that " some big announcements " would be made at the Lost panel . Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting , rather than at a fan convention . After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced , Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted , and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost . At Comic @-@ Con , Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member , not just for a flashback . Lost producer Carlton Cuse said " Michael 's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here 's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island , and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him , what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael 's story will be a really compelling part of the season . " Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed , and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son , Walt , saying , " there are all these questions about how [ the writers ] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child . It plays into a really big , weird stereotype and , being a black person myself , that wasn 't so interesting . " Cuse responded " We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast . It 's painful when any actor 's storyline ends on the show . Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost " . Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment , and although he felt like that , he never discussed the matter with the producers . Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost , he would have to know what the storyline would be . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Michael 's first centric episode , " Special " , was well received by critics . Chris Carabott of IGN said " Michael 's flashback is a heart wrenching look at the relationship , or lack @-@ there @-@ of , between him and his son Walt . " He added " As Michael 's life crumble around him , it 's Harold Perrineau 's brilliant performance that really shines through . " Kirthana Ramisetti from Entertainment Weekly called it the best episode since " Walkabout " because of Michael 's character development . She said " One of my favorite scenes of the entire season ... was Michael and Walt bonding over the letters and the drawing of the sunburned penguin . It was moving to see these two finally relating to each other as father and son after everything they 've been through . " 
 Michael 's first centric episode in season two was less well received . Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said " it wasn 't all that interesting " . Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks " among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we 've seen so far " , as he felt nothing new was learned . He did not like Michael 's on @-@ Island storyline either , noting he " got the sense that the actors and directors weren 't quite sure what to make of these scenes " . Three episodes later , Jensen thought Michael 's " whiny dad act " became " increasingly tedious " . When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in " Two for the Road " , Slocum called it the " single biggest shocker in Lost history " . C. K. Sample of AOL 's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby were going to die , he thought what " was amazing was who shot them " . Zap2it 's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as " a brilliant move " , because " one of their own [ became ] one of them " . She added it was " one of [ the second ] season 's most jaw @-@ dropping moments " . According to Perrineau , it made fans " pissed off " with Michael . Jensen praised Perrineau 's acting , saying " Michael 's bloody betrayal is hard to swallow , but Harold Perrineau sells it " . Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts " Walt ! " , such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger , Erin Martell of AOL 's TV Squad , and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly . Perrineau co @-@ won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for " Best Ensemble - Drama Series . 
 Joshua Rich from Entertainment Weekly had mixed views on the prospect of Michael returning in season four , because although Perrineau was one of his " favorite " actors , he liked how peaceful the series had become without Michael constantly screaming " Walt ! " . IGN 's Chris Carabott called Michael 's return " the worst kept secret in Lost history " , but still found his reveal " exciting " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger found " a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau " in " Meet Kevin Johnson " . Sepinwall wrote that Michael 's " struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that 's happened before . " Cynthia Littleton of Variety was " really happy " to see Michael again , and wrote " Perrineau plays it just right most of the time — no hysterics or scenery @-@ chewing , just a man trying to do the right thing , most of the time . " Digital Spy 's Ben Rawson @-@ Jones commented that " [ Michael 's ] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way " . Before the fourth season finale aired , Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season , but did add " This story line didn 't match the hype " . Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael 's death " the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc " . 
 = Cyrus Cylinder = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder ( Persian : <unk> <unk> ) or Cyrus Charter ( Persian : <unk> <unk> ) is an ancient clay cylinder , now broken into several fragments , on which is written a declaration in Akkadian cuneiform script in the name of Persia 's Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great . It dates from the 6th century BCE and was discovered in the ruins of Babylon in Mesopotamia ( modern Iraq ) in 1879 . It is currently possessed by the British Museum , which sponsored the expedition that discovered the cylinder . It was created and used as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BC , when the Neo @-@ Babylonian Empire was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his Persian Empire . 
 The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus , sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings . The Babylonian king Nabonidus , who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus , is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low @-@ born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus 's kingly heritage . The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god Marduk to restore peace and order to the Babylonians . The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace . It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son Cambyses . It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives , repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the region . It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king . 
 The Cylinder 's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus ' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity ( an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus ) , as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples . This interpretation has been disputed , as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries , and makes no mention of Jews , Jerusalem , or Judea . The Cylinder has also been called the oldest known charter or symbol of universal human rights , a view rejected by others as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor , Director of the British Museum , has stated that the cylinder was " the first attempt we know about running a society , a state with different nationalities and faiths — a new kind of statecraft . " It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2 @,@ 500 years of the Iranian monarchy .

 The <unk> @-@ British archaeologist <unk> Rassam discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in March 1879 during a lengthy programme of excavations in Mesopotamia carried out for the British Museum . It had been placed as a foundation deposit in the foundations of the <unk> , the city 's main temple . Rassam 's expedition followed on from an earlier dig carried out in 1850 by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard , who excavated three mounds in the same area but found little of importance . In 1877 , Layard became Britain 's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , which ruled Mesopotamia at the time . He helped Rassam , who had been his assistant in the 1850 dig , to obtain a firman ( decree ) from the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to continue the earlier excavations . The firman was only valid for a year but a second firman , with much more liberal terms , was issued in 1878 . It was granted for two years ( through to 15 October 1880 ) with the promise of an extension to 1882 if required . The Sultan 's decree authorised Rassam to " pack and dispatch to England any antiquities [ he ] found … provided , however , there were no duplicates . " A representative of the Sultan was instructed to be present at the dig to examine the objects as they were uncovered . 
 With permission secured , Rassam initiated a large @-@ scale excavation at Babylon and other sites on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum . He undertook the excavations in four distinct phases . In between each phase , he returned to England to bring back his finds and raise more funds for further work . The Cyrus Cylinder was found on the second of his four expeditions to Mesopotamia , which began with his departure from London on 8 October 1878 . He arrived in his home town of Mosul on 16 November and travelled down the Tigris to Baghdad , which he reached on 30 January 1879 . During February and March , he supervised excavations on a number of Babylonian sites , including Babylon itself . 
 He soon uncovered a number of important buildings including the <unk> temple . This was a major shrine to the chief Babylonian god Marduk , although its identity was not fully confirmed until the German archaeologist Robert <unk> 's excavation of 1900 . The excavators found a large number of business documents written on clay tablets buried in the temple 's foundations where they discovered the Cyrus Cylinder . Rassam gave conflicting accounts of where his discoveries were made . He wrote in his memoirs , <unk> and the land of Nimrod , that the Cylinder had been found in a mound at the southern end of Babylon near the village of <unk> or <unk> . However , in a letter sent on 20 November 1879 to Samuel Birch , the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum , he wrote , " The Cylinder of Cyrus was found at <unk> [ Tell <unk> @-@ ibn @-@ Ali ] with about six hundred pieces of inscribed <unk> before I left Baghdad . " He left Baghdad on 2 April , returning to Mosul and departing from there on 2 May for a journey to London which lasted until 19 June . 
 The discovery was announced to the public by Sir Henry Rawlinson , the President of the Royal Asiatic Society , at a meeting of the Society on 17 November 1879 . He described it as " one of the most interesting historical records in the cuneiform character that has yet been brought to light , " though he erroneously described it as coming from the ancient city of <unk> rather than Babylon . Rawlinson 's " Notes on a newly @-@ discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great " were published in the society 's journal the following year , including the first partial translation of the text . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder is a barrel @-@ shaped cylinder of baked clay measuring 22 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) by 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) at its maximum diameter . It was created in several stages around a cone @-@ shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions . It was built up with extra layers of clay to give it a cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay was added to the outer layer , on which the text is inscribed . It was excavated in several fragments , having apparently broken apart in antiquity . Today it exists in two main fragments , known as " A " and " B " , which were reunited in 1972 . 
 The main body of the Cylinder , discovered by Rassam in 1879 , is fragment " A " . It underwent restoration in 1961 , when it was re @-@ fired and plaster filling was added . The smaller fragment , " B " , is a section measuring 8 @.@ 6 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) by 5 @.@ 6 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) . The latter fragment was acquired by J.B. <unk> of Yale University from an antiquities dealer . <unk> published the text in 1920 . The fragment was apparently broken off the main body of the Cylinder during the original excavations in 1879 and was either removed from the excavations or was retrieved from one of Rassam 's waste dumps . It was not confirmed as part of the Cylinder until Paul @-@ Richard Berger of the University of Münster definitively identified it in 1970 . Yale University lent the fragment to the British Museum temporarily ( but , in practice , indefinitely ) in exchange for " a suitable cuneiform tablet " from the British Museum collection . 
 Although the Cylinder clearly post @-@ dates Cyrus the Great 's conquest of Babylon in 539 BC , the date of its creation is unclear . It is commonly said to date to the early part of Cyrus 's reign over Babylon , some time after 539 BC . The British Museum puts the Cylinder 's date of origin at between 539 – 530 BC . 
 = = = The text = = = 
 The surviving inscription on the Cyrus Cylinder consists of 45 lines of text written in Akkadian cuneiform script . The first 35 lines are on fragment " A " and the remainder are on fragment " B. " A number of lines at the start and end of the text are too badly damaged for more than a few words to be legible . 
 The text is written in an extremely formulaic style that can be divided into six distinct parts : 
 Lines 1 – 19 : an introduction <unk> Nabonidus , the previous king of Babylon , and associating Cyrus with the god Marduk ; 
 Lines 20 – 22 : detailing Cyrus 's royal titles and genealogy , and his peaceful entry to Babylon ; 
 Lines 22 – 34 : a commendation of Cyrus 's policy of restoring Babylon ; 
 Lines 34 – 35 : a prayer to Marduk on behalf of Cyrus and his son Cambyses ; 
 Lines 36 – 37 : a declaration that Cyrus has enabled the people to live in peace and has increased the offerings made to the gods ; 
 Lines 38 – 45 : details of the building activities ordered by Cyrus in Babylon . 
 The beginning of the text is partly broken ; the surviving content reprimands the character of the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus . It lists his alleged crimes , charging him with the desecration of the temples of the gods and the imposition of forced labor upon the populace . According to the proclamation , as a result of these offenses , the god Marduk abandoned Babylon and sought a more righteous king . Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and become its new ruler . 
 In [ Nabonidus 's ] mind , reverential fear of Marduk , king of the gods , came to an end . He did yet more evil to his city every day ; … his [ people <unk> … ] , he brought ruin on them all by a yoke without relief … [ Marduk ] inspected and checked all the countries , seeking for the upright king of his choice . He took the hand of Cyrus , king of the city of Anshan , and called him by his name , proclaiming him aloud for the kingship over all of everything . 
 Midway through the text , the writer switches to a first @-@ person narrative in the voice of Cyrus , addressing the reader directly . A list of his titles is given ( in a Mesopotamian rather than Persian style ) : " I am Cyrus , king of the world , great king , powerful king , king of Babylon , king of Sumer and Akkad , king of the four quarters [ of the earth ] , son of Cambyses , great king , king of Anshan , descendent of <unk> , great king , king of Anshan , the perpetual seed of kingship , whose reign Bel [ Marduk ] and Nebo love , and with whose kingship , to their joy , they concern themselves . " He describes the pious deeds he performed after his conquest : he restored peace to Babylon and the other cities sacred to Marduk , freeing their inhabitants from their " yoke , " and he " brought relief to their dilapidated housing ( thus ) putting an end to their ( main ) complaints . " He repaired the ruined temples in the cities he conquered , restored their cults , and returned their sacred images as well as their former inhabitants which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon . Near the end of the inscription Cyrus highlights his restoration of Babylon 's city wall , saying : " I saw within it an inscription of Ashurbanipal , a king who preceded me . " The remainder is missing but presumably describes Cyrus 's rededication of the gateway mentioned . 
 A partial transcription by F.H. <unk> in 1911 was supplanted by a much more complete transcription after the identification of the " B " fragment ; this is now available in German and in English . Several editions of the full text of the Cyrus Cylinder are available online , incorporating both " A " and " B " fragments . 
 A false translation of the text – affirming , among other things , the abolition of slavery and the right to self @-@ determination , a minimum wage and asylum – has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere . As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder , it refers to the Zoroastrian divinity Ahura Mazda rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk . The false translation has been widely circulated ; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that " Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership . " Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin <unk> in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as " the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2 @,@ 500 years ago that … he would not reign over the people if they did not wish it " . Similarly , in a 2006 speech , United States President George W. Bush referred to Cyrus , declaring that his people had " the right to worship God in freedom " – a statement made nowhere in the text of the Cylinder . 
 = = = Associated fragments = = = 
 The British Museum announced in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments , which had been in the Museum 's collection since 1881 , had been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder . The fragments had come from the small site of <unk> near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor Wilfred Lambert , formerly of the University of Birmingham , and Irving Finkel , curator in charge of the Museum 's Department of the Middle East . 
 A horse bone bearing cuneiform inscriptions apparently derived from the Cyrus Cylinder has also been discovered in China along with a second bone inscribed with an as yet unknown text . The bones were acquired by the Beijing Palace Museum in 1985 . Their origin is unclear , but Irving Finkel has hypothesized that they may reflect a proclamation in another format ( perhaps leather or clay ) , derived from the Cyrus Cylinder 's text , though for some reason only one in twenty of the original cuneiform symbols were copied . Finkel suggests that this may indicate that the text ( or even the original cylinder itself ) was sent around the Persian Empire and was copied to make the bone 's inscription at some point . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 = = = Mesopotamian and Persian tradition and propaganda = = = 
 According to the British Museum , the Cyrus Cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where , from as early as the third millennium BC , kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms . Cyrus 's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king , and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon . The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda . 
 The text is a royal building inscription , a genre which had no equivalent in Old Persian literature . It illustrates how Cyrus co @-@ opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon . Many elements of the text were drawn from long @-@ standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia : the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness ; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods ; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor , addressing the welfare of the people ; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored , offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought ; and repairs are made to the whole city , in the manner of earlier rightful kings . 
 Both continuity and discontinuity are emphasized in the text of the Cylinder . It asserts the virtue of Cyrus as a gods @-@ fearing king of a traditional Mesopotamian type . On the other hand , it constantly discredits Nabonidus , <unk> the deposed king 's deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people . As Fowler and <unk> note , this " creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating the ' symbolic capital ' of his predecessors . " The Cylinder 's reprimand of Nabonidus also discredits Babylonian royal authority by association . It is perhaps for this reason that the Achaemenid rulers made greater use of Assyrian rather than Babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations ; the Cylinder refers to the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal as " my predecessor " , rather than any native Babylonian ruler . 
 The Cylinder itself is part of a continuous Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items , including animal sacrifices , stone tablets , terracotta cones , cylinders and figures . Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns , often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings . Some contained messages , while others did not , and they had a number of purposes : elaboration of a building 's value , commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building , through the invocation of divine protection . 
 The cylinder was not intended to be seen again after its burial , but the text inscribed on it would have been used for public purposes . Archive copies were kept of important inscriptions and the Cylinder 's text may likewise have been copied . In January 2010 , the British Museum announced that two cuneiform tablets in its collection had been found to be inscribed with the same text as that on the Cyrus Cylinder , which , according to the Museum , " show that the text of the Cylinder was probably a proclamation that was widely distributed across the Persian Empire . " 
 = = = = Similarities with other royal inscriptions = = = = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder bears striking similarities to older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions . Two notable examples are the Cylinder of Marduk @-@ apla @-@ iddina II , who seized the Babylonian throne in 722 / 1 BC , and the annals of Sargon II of Assyria , who conquered Babylon twelve years later . As a conqueror , Marduk @-@ apla @-@ iddina faced many of the same problems of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon . He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk , who ensured his victory . When he took power , he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines . He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king , which he left undisturbed and honored . All of these claims also appear in Cyrus 's Cylinder . Twelve years later , the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk @-@ apla @-@ iddina , taking up the kingship of Babylonia . Sargon 's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign , honouring the gods , maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite . Again , Cyrus 's Cylinder makes exactly the same points . Nabonidus , Cyrus 's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon , commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus , also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula . 
 The text of the Cylinder thus indicates a strong continuity with centuries of Babylonian tradition , as part of an established rhetoric advanced by conquerors . As Kuhrt puts it : 
 [ The Cylinder ] reflects the pressure that Babylonian citizens were able to bring to bear on the new royal claimant … In this context , the reign of the defeated predecessor was automatically described as bad and against the divine will – how else could he have been defeated ? By implication , of course , all his acts became , inevitably and retrospectively , tainted . 
 The familiarity with long @-@ established Babylonian tropes suggests that the Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk , working at the behest of Cyrus . It can be compared with another work of around the same time , the Verse Account of Nabonidus , in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon . Both works make a point of stressing Cyrus 's qualifications as a king from a line of kings , in contrast to the non @-@ royal ancestry of Nabonidus , who is described by the Cylinder as merely <unk> , " insignificant " . 
 The Verse Account is so similar to the Cyrus Cylinder inscription that the two texts have been dubbed an example of " literary dependence " – not the direct dependence of one upon the other , but mutual dependence upon a common source . This is characterised by the historian Morton Smith as " the propaganda put out in Babylonia by Cyrus 's agents , shortly before Cyrus 's conquest , to prepare the way of their lord . " This viewpoint has been disputed ; as Simon J. Sherwin of the University of Cambridge puts it , the Cyrus Cylinder and the Verse Account are " after the event " compositions which reuse existing Mesopotamian literary themes and do not need to be explained as the product of pre @-@ conquest Persian propaganda . 
 The German historian <unk> <unk> has identified a line on the Cylinder ( " He [ i.e. Marduk ] saved his city Babylon from its oppression " ) with a line from tablet VI of the Babylonian " Epic of Creation " , Enûma Eliš , in which Marduk builds Babylon . Johannes <unk> suggests that reference represents Cyrus 's takeover as a moment of ultimate restoration not just of political and religious institutions , but of the cosmic order underpinning the universe . 
 = = = = Analysis of the Cylinder 's claims = = = = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder 's vilification of Nabonidus is consistent with other Persian propaganda regarding the deposed king 's rule . In contrast to the Cylinder 's depiction of Nabonidus as an illegitimate ruler who ruined his country , the reign of Nabonidus was largely peaceful , he was recognised as a legitimate king and he undertook a variety of building projects and military campaigns commensurate with his claim to be " the king of Babylon , the universe , and the four corners [ of the Earth ] . " 
 The Assyriologist Paul @-@ Alain Beaulieu has interpreted Nabonidus 's exaltation of the moon god Sin as " an outright usurpation of Marduk 's prerogatives by the moon god . " Although the Babylonian king continued to make rich offerings to Marduk , his greater devotion to Sin was unacceptable to the Babylonian priestly elite . Nabonidus came from the unfashionable north of Babylonia , introduced foreign gods and went into a lengthy self @-@ imposed exile which was said to have prevented the celebration of the vital New Year festival . Cyrus 's conquest of Babylonia was resisted by Nabonidus and his supporters , as the Battle of Opis demonstrated . <unk> Pierre Briant comments that " it is doubtful that even before the fall of [ Babylon ] Cyrus was impatiently awaited by a population desperate for a ' liberator ' . " However , Cyrus 's takeover as king does appear to have been welcomed by some of the Babylonian population . The Judaic historian Lisbeth S. Fried says that there is little evidence that the high @-@ ranking priests of Babylonia during the Achaemenid period were Persians and characterises them as Babylonian collaborators . 
 The inscription goes on to describe Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion . This restored the normal cultic order to the satisfaction of the priesthood . It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire @-@ wide programme of restoration . Instead , it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia , including sites that had been devastated by earlier Babylonian military campaigns . The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction , the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations . However , it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground ; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus 's reign . 
 The text presents Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully and being welcomed by the population as a liberator . This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors , notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti @-@ Ninurta I , who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC , and Sennacherib , who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region . The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements . The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message ; Johannes <unk> notes that it portrays Cyrus 's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history , not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia . 
 However , the Cylinder 's account of Cyrus 's conquest clearly does not tell the whole story , as it suppresses any mention of the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians ; Max Mallowan describes it as a " skilled work of tendentious history " . The text omits the Battle of Opis , in which Cyrus 's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus 's army . Nor does it explain a two @-@ week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the <unk> temple . Lisbeth S. Fried suggests that there may have been a siege or stand @-@ off between the Persians and the temple 's defenders and priests , about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention . She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro @-@ Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite . As Walton and Hill put it , the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is " standard conqueror 's rhetoric and may obscure other facts . " Describing the claim of one 's own armies being welcomed as liberators as " one of the great imperial fantasies " , Bruce Lincoln , Professor of Divinity at the University of Chicago , notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( though not against Cyrus or his son <unk> ) . The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests . 
 The Persians ' policy towards their subject people , as described by the Cylinder , was traditionally viewed as an expression of tolerance , moderation and generosity " on a scale previously unknown . " The policies of Cyrus toward subjugated nations have been contrasted to those of the Assyrians and Babylonians , who had treated subject peoples harshly ; he permitted the resettling of those who had been previously deported and sponsored the reconstruction of religious buildings . Cyrus was often depicted positively in Western tradition by sources such as the Old Testament of the Bible and the Greek writers Herodotus and Xenophon . The <unk> of Xenophon was particularly influential during the Renaissance when Cyrus was romanticised as an exemplary model of a virtuous and successful ruler . 
 Modern historians argue that while Cyrus 's behavior was indeed conciliatory , it was driven by the needs of the Persian Empire , and was not an expression of personal tolerance per se . The empire was too large to be centrally directed ; Cyrus followed a policy of using existing territorial units to implement a decentralized system of government . The magnanimity shown by Cyrus won him praise and gratitude from those he spared . The policy of toleration described by the Cylinder was thus , as biblical historian Rainer <unk> puts it , " an expression of conservative support for local regions to serve the political interests of the whole [ empire ] . " Another biblical historian , Alberto <unk> , comments that it was more " a matter of practicality and economy … [ as ] it was simpler , and indeed cost less , to obtain the spontaneous collaboration of their subjects at a local level than to have to impose their sovereignty by force . " 
 = = = Biblical interpretations = = = 
 The Bible records that some Jews ( who were exiled by the Babylonians ) , returned to their homeland from Babylon , where they had been settled by Nebuchadnezzar , to rebuild the temple following an edict from Cyrus . The Book of Ezra ( 1 – 4 : 5 ) provides a narrative account of the rebuilding project . Scholars have linked one particular passage from the Cylinder to the Old Testament account : 
 From [ ? ] to <unk> and [ from ] Susa , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Me @-@ Turnu , Der , as far as the region of <unk> , the sacred centers on the other side of the Tigris , whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time , I returned the images of the gods , who had resided there [ i.e. , in Babylon ] , to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes . I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings . 
 This passage has often been interpreted as a reference to the benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples , such as the Jews , to return to their original homelands The Cylinder 's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem . The two edicts ( one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic ) are substantially different in content and tone , leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication . The question of their authenticity remains unresolved , though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy , albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts . 
 The dispute over the authenticity of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder , specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a general policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries . The text of the Cylinder is very specific , listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions . It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities . It emphasises the re @-@ establishment of local religious norms , reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as " a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus . " She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such . Lester L. <unk> , a historian of early Judaism , has written that " the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them " in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults , other than their own gods . 
 Cyrus may have seen Jerusalem , situated in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt , as worth patronising for political reasons . His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers , thereby <unk> favour with the cults ' devotees . Conversely , the Persian kings could , and did , destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them , as happened at <unk> in 494 BC following the Ionian Revolt . Historian Ernst <unk> has noted regarding the Ionian revolt " [ that ] Harpagus ' devastated ' all of lower Asia ( 1 @.@ 177 ) is obviously an exaggeration , for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities . " The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction , which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction . However , the Cylinder 's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia ; the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that " it has nothing to do with Judeans , Jews or Jerusalem . " Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder " is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire . " Kuhrt comments that " the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof " of the historicity of Cyrus 's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts – an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance . 
 The German scholar Josef Wiesehöfer summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that " Many scholars have read into [ … ] sentences [ from the text of Cylinder ] a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the <unk> " and this interpretation was , according to Wiesehöfer , for some scholars a strict belief " that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder . "

 The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last Shah of Iran called it " the world 's first charter of human rights " . The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah 's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights , despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars . 
 = = = = Pahlavi Iranian government 's view = = = = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the " first declaration of human rights " by the pre @-@ 1979 Iranian government , a reading prominently advanced by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , in a 1967 book , The White Revolution of Iran . The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids . He wrote that " the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus , which , for its advocacy of humane principles , justice and liberty , must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind . " The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects " freedom of opinion and other basic rights " . In 1968 , the Shah opened the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Tehran by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
 In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2 @,@ 500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as " a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create . " 
 The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration , and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history . The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities ; it was put on display at the <unk> Monument ( now the Azadi Tower ) in Tehran . The 2 @,@ 500 year celebrations commenced on October 12 , 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae . On October 14 , the shah 's sister , Princess Ashraf Pahlavi , presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder . The princess asserted that " the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding , tolerance , courage , compassion and , above all , human liberty " . The Secretary General accepted the gift , linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly to address " the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict " . Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on the second floor hallway . The United Nations continues to promote the cylinder as " an ancient declaration of human rights . " 
 = = = = Scholarly views = = = = 
 The interpretation of the Cylinder as a " charter of human rights " has been described by some historians as " rather anachronistic " and tendentious . It has been dismissed as a " misunderstanding " and characterized as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime . The German historian Josef Wiesehöfer comments that the portrayal of Cyrus as a champion of human rights is as illusory as the image of the " humane and enlightened Shah of Persia . " D. Fairchild Ruggles and Helaine Silverman describe the Shah 's aim as being to legitimise the Iranian nation and his own regime , and to counter the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism by creating an alternative narrative rooted in the ancient Persian past . 
 Writing in the immediate aftermath of the Shah 's anniversary commemorations , the British Museum 's <unk> Walker comments that the " essential character of the Cyrus Cylinder [ is not ] a general declaration of human rights or religious toleration but simply a building inscription , in the Babylonian and Assyrian tradition , commemorating Cyrus 's restoration of the city of Babylon and the worship of Marduk previously neglected by Nabonidus . " Two professors with specialisms in the history of the ancient Near East , Bill T. Arnold and Piotr <unk> , comment : " <unk> , it belongs with other foundation deposit inscriptions ; it is not an edict of any kind , nor does it provide any unusual human rights declaration as is sometimes claimed . " Lloyd Llewellyn @-@ Jones of the University of Edinburgh notes that " there is nothing in the text " that suggests the concept of human rights . Neil MacGregor comments : 
 Comparison by scholars in the British Museum with other similar texts , however , showed that rulers in ancient Iraq had been making comparable declarations upon succeeding to the [ Babylonian ] throne for two millennia before Cyrus [ … ] it is one of the museum 's tasks to resist the narrowing of the object 's meaning and its appropriation to one political agenda . 
 He cautions that while the Cylinder is " clearly linked with the history of Iran , " it is " in no real sense an Iranian document : it is part of a much larger history of the ancient Near East , of Mesopotamian kingship , and of the Jewish diaspora . " 
 Some historians , as well as writers on human rights , have supported the interpretation of the Cyrus Cylinder as a human rights charter . W.J. Talbott , an American philosopher , believes the concept of human rights is a 20th @-@ century concept but describes Cyrus as " perhaps the earliest known advocate of religious tolerance " and suggests that " ideas that led to the development of human rights are not limited to one cultural tradition . " The Iranian lawyer <unk> Abtahi argues that viewing the Cylinder as merely " an instrument of legitimizing royal rule " is unjustified , as Cyrus issued the document and granted those rights when he was at the height of his power , with neither popular opposition nor visible external threat to force his hand . A former Iranian prime minister , Hassan <unk> , writing in the early 20th century , characterizes the Cylinder as " discuss [ ing ] human rights in a way unique for the era , dealing with ways to protect the honor , prestige , and religious beliefs of all the nations dependent to Iran in those days . " 
 = = Exhibition history = = 
 The Cyrus Cylinder has been displayed in the British Museum since its formal acquisition in 1880 . It has been loaned four times – twice to Iran , between 7 – 22 October 1971 in conjunction with the 2 @,@ 500 year commemorations of the Persian monarchy and again from September – December 2010 , once to Spain from March – June 2006 , and once to the United States in a travelling exhibition from March – October 2013 . Many replicas have been made . Some were distributed by the Shah following the 1971 commemorations , while the British Museum and National Museum of Iran have sold them commercially . 
 The British Museum 's ownership of the Cyrus Cylinder has been the cause of some controversy in Iran , although the artifact was obtained legally and was not excavated on Iranian soil but on former Ottoman territory ( modern Iraq ) . When it was loaned in 1971 , the Iranian press campaigned for its transfer to Iranian ownership . The Cylinder was brought back to London without difficulty , but the British Museum 's Board of Trustees subsequently decided that it would be " undesirable to make a further loan of the Cylinder to Iran . " 
 In 2005 – 2006 the British Museum mounted a major exhibition on the Persian Empire , Forgotten Empire : the World of Ancient Persia . It was held in collaboration with the Iranian government , which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return . 
 The planned loan of the Cylinder was postponed in October 2009 following the June 2009 Iranian presidential election so that the British Museum could be " assured that the situation in the country was suitable . " In response , the Iranian government threatened to end cooperation with the British Museum if the Cylinder was not loaned within the following two months . This deadline was postponed despite appeals by the Iranian government but the Cylinder did eventually go on display in Tehran in September 2010 for a four @-@ month period . The exhibition was very popular , attracting 48 @,@ 000 people within the first ten days and about 500 @,@ 000 people by the time it closed in January 2011 . However , at its opening , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad mingled Islamic Republican and ancient Persian symbology which commentators inside and outside Iran criticised as an overt appeal to religious nationalism . 
 On November 28 , 2012 , the BBC announced the first United States tour of the Cylinder . Under the headline “ British Museum lends ancient ' bill of rights ' cylinder to US ” , Museum director Neil MacGregor declared that “ The cylinder , often referred to as the first bill of human rights , ‘ must be shared as widely as possible ’ " . The British Museum itself announced the news in its press release , saying " First declaration of human rights ’ to tour five cities in the United States " . According to the British Museum 's website for the Cylinder 's US exhibition " <unk> " , the tour started in March 2013 and included Washington DC ’ s Smithsonian 's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery , the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and culminated at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles , in October 2013 . 
 The cylinder , along with thirty two other associated objects from the British Museum collection , including a pair of gold armlets from the Oxus Treasure and the Darius Seal , were part of an exhibition titled ' The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia – A New Beginning ' at the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai , India , from December 21 , 2013 to February 25 , 2014 . It was organised by the British Museum and the Prince of Wales Museum in partnership with Sir Dorabji Tata Trust , Sir Ratan Tata Trust and <unk> Ratan Tata Trust , all set up by luminaries from the Parsi community , who are descendants of Persian Zoroastrians , who hold Cyrus in great regard , as many scholars consider him as a follower of Zoroastrianism .

 Muncy Creek ( also known as Big Muncy Creek ) is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Sullivan County and Lycoming County , in Pennsylvania , in the United States . It is approximately 34 @.@ 5 miles ( 55 @.@ 5 km ) long . The watershed of the creek has an area of 216 square miles ( 560 km2 ) . The creek 's discharge averages 49 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 4 m3 / s ) at Sonestown , but can be up to a thousand times higher at Muncy . The headwaters of the creek are on the Allegheny Plateau . Rock formations in the watershed include the Chemung Formation and the Catskill Formation . 
 There are a number of lakes in the watershed of Muncy Creek , including Eagles Mere Lake , Highland Lake , and Beaver Lake . The creek was known as <unk> to Native Americans . The area in its vicinity was settled in 1783 . Various other industries and mills were constructed in the creek 's vicinity from the late 18th century to the early 20th century . Wild trout naturally reproduce in part of Muncy Creek . Part of the creek is navigable by canoe .

 Muncy Creek begins in southeastern Laporte Township , Sullivan County , near its border with Davidson Township , Sullivan County . The creek flows southwest and then west for a short distance before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township . It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border . Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and begins to flow into a valley , then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides . Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch . After picking up Peters Creek , one such tributary , Muncy Creek turns southwest and passes the community of Nordmont , where the tributary <unk> Run flows into it . The creek then turns southwest and later west . Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek , which heads south away from the Laporte Township / Davidson Township border . Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township / Davidson Township border , the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west @-@ southwest , passing a gauging station . After several miles , it reaches the community of Sonestown , where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north . Muncy Creek then makes a sharp bend south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220 . After a few miles , it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south , exiting Davidson Township . 
 Upon exiting Davidson Township , Sullivan County , Muncy Creek enters Lycoming County and flows along the border between Shrewsbury Township and Penn Township for several miles . It continues following U.S. Route 220 during this time , picking up a few tributaries , including Lick Run . The creek also passes by Glen Mawr and Tivoli during this stretch . Beyond the stretch , in Picture Rocks , the creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 864 . Beyond the community , the creek continues south into Wolf Township , leaving its valley passing by the eastern edge of Hughesville . Some distance further on , the creek receives the tributary Sugar Run and some miles later leaves Wolf Township in a southwesterly direction . Upon exiting Wolf Township , the creek enters Muncy Creek Township , where Little Muncy Creek flows into it . Muncy Creek then turns northeast , crossing Pennsylvania Route 405 and turns southwest , crossing Interstate 180 . The creek then receives the tributary Wolf Run and immediately afterwards empties into the West Branch Susquehanna River .

 Muncy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on March 1 , 1990 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . The creek has also been known as Muncey Creek . 
 Muncy Creek was known to the Native Americans as <unk> . Historically , Native Americans painted on Picture Rock , a cliff on the creek . Additionally , six Native American lance heads made of stone were found near the creek by Joseph <unk> in the autumn of 1872 . 
 Muncy Creek was settled in 1783 by John <unk> . In 1797 , the Willow Grove Mill was built on Muncy Creek in 1797 by Isaac Walton and by the late 1800s , there was a sawmill on the creek in Shrewsbury Township , Lycoming County . A woolen mill was also built on the creek in Wolf Township , Lycoming County in 1842 . An aqueduct carrying the West Branch Canal once crossed Muncy Creek . 
 Historically , railroads ran parallel to Muncy Creek 26 miles ( 42 km ) upstream from its mouth , as far as the community of Nordmont . There were also numerous railroad stations on the creek upstream of the community of Picture Rocks The Reading Railroad also had a bridge over the creek in the past . The creek experienced severe flooding in 1889 . 
 In the early 1900s , many of the sewers in the community of Eagles Mere discharged into tributaries of Muncy Creek , such as Outlet Run . Sewage was also discharged into Muncy Creek in Hugesville . Additionally , in the early 1900s , the waters of Muncy Creek were contaminated with tannery waste products from Muncy Valley and also chemicals . For this reason , the creek was only used for power during this time . Additionally , a methyl alcohol plant , the Nordmont Chemical Works , discharged chemicals into the creek at <unk> . Other major industries in the watershed in the early part of the 1900s included clay mines and furniture factories .

 = St Lawrence 's Church , Mereworth = 
 St. Lawrence 's Church is an Anglican parish church at Mereworth , Kent , United Kingdom . It is in the deanery of West Malling , the Diocese of Rochester and Province of Canterbury . The church was built in the mid @-@ 1740s by John Fane , the 7th Earl of Westmorland following his removal of the village 's 12th century place of worship to allow for the enlargement of Mereworth Castle . 
 The Palladian @-@ style stone structure has been described as " the outstanding 18th @-@ century church in the county , in scale , ambition and architectural interest " . The architect is unknown , but prominent Palladian @-@ era figures such as Henry Flitcroft , James Gibbs and Roger Morris have been suggested . 
 Many internal fixtures survive from the medieval church , including heraldic stained glass and a series of high @-@ quality brass and stone memorials . Alterations were made several times in the 19th and 20th centuries , including repairs to wartime bomb damage , and restoration work undertaken in 2009 . The church has been awarded Grade I listed status in view of its architectural and historical importance .

 There was already a church dedicated to St. Lawrence in Mereworth during the reign of Henry II ( 1154 – 89 ) , when its advowson belonged to Roger de Mereworth . The original church was said to have been built by the de Clares and was appropriated by the Knights Hospitallers on its foundation . During the reign of Henry II , there was a dispute between de Mereworth and Leeds Priory concerning the patronage of the church . Gilbert , Bishop of Rochester was asked to adjudicate on the dispute . He found in favour of de Mereworth , but the parson of the church was to pay the sum of 40s per annum to the priory as a perpetual benefice . Shortly after the settlement of the dispute the church was granted to Tonbridge Priory , in whose possession it remained until the priory was dissolved in 1525 . The church then passed into the possession of Cardinal Wolsey , but was amongst the properties forfeited to the Crown in 1529 . 
 The advowson was then granted to Sir George Nevill , passing on his death to his son Henry Nevill and on Henry 's death to his daughter Mary , thus coming into the possession of her husband Thomas Fane . In 1589 , Leeds Priory abandoned their right to the benefice granted by Gilbert of Rochester . In 1634 , the church possessed lands amounting to some 352 acres ( 142 ha ) in Mereworth . 
 In the 1720s Mereworth Castle was rebuilt as Palladian villa to a design by Colen Campbell and in the 1740s two flanking pavilions and a stable block were added , necessitating the removal of the church ; in 1744 John Fane , the 7th Earl of Westmorland , obtained a faculty for the demolition of the " ancient and most inconvenient " church . 
 = = = Present church = = = 
 Fane built the new church on a site in the centre of the village , ⅝ mile ( 1 km ) northwest of its predecessor . Construction began in 1744 and was completed two years later , with consecration by Joseph <unk> , the Bishop of Rochester , on 26 August 1746 . Coffins and memorials from the old church were moved to the new building . John Grinsted , the son of John and Mary Grinsted was the first person to be baptised in the church on 23 September 1746 . There had been no burials or marriages in the village in 1745 due to the lack of a church . 
 In 1752 , Horace Walpole visited the church . He said that it seemed designed for Cheapside and that the spire was so tall that the poor church curtsied beneath it . Thomas <unk> Burr in his History of Tunbridge Wells ( 1766 ) said that the church " will bear , and indeed richly deserves , the attentive inspection of the curious traveller " . 
 In 1770 , the church was " repaired and beautified " , possibly by Nicholas Revett , who went on to design Mereworth Rectory in 1780 . In 1798 , the advowson of the church was in the ownership of Francis , Lord de Despencer . The annual income of the church was then valued at £ 14 2s 6d . 
 The spire was rebuilt in 1870 , and in 1875 a new round @-@ arched window was cut into the east wall of the church . It is flanked on either side by blind windows . The bells were repaired in 1885 and a clock was installed in the base of the lantern at the top of the tower in 1894 , in memory of Eliot Stapleton , rector of Mereworth from 1874 – 92 . A plan by the architect George <unk> , dated 1896 , to extend the church eastwards by building an apse of the same proportions as the west portico was not carried out . 
 Major repairs were carried out to the spire in 1946 – 47 under the supervision of architect Kenneth <unk> , following damage sustained during the Second World War . In 1957 , the bells were again repaired . On 25 August 1959 , the church was added to the register of listed buildings . It is Grade I listed . The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice , rector of Mereworth from 1966 – 70 . A new fibreglass clock face was fitted at this time and the winding mechanism converted to electric power . In 2005 , an inspection revealed that the church needed major repairs . English Heritage made a grant that covered 95 % of the £ 500 @,@ 000 cost of restoration . The work was carried out under the supervision of architects Thomas Ford & Partners , and won the 2009 Georgian Group award for best restoration of a Georgian church . 
 The church is still actively used as a place of worship - you can find details on the church website .

 St. Lawrence 's is a Palladian @-@ style building by an unknown architect . Colen Campbell worked in a similar style , although he died in 1722 , so the design may have been executed by one of his followers . The second @-@ generation Palladian architect Henry Flitcroft has been suggested ; by 1746 he was the master carpenter at three London palaces , and his St Giles in the Fields at Holborn was London 's first Palladian @-@ style church . James Gibbs has also been suggested , as the spire of St Lawrence 's is similar to that of St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields in the City of Westminster , London . Sir Howard Colvin tentatively attributes the church to Roger Morris . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The church is of blocks of Kentish ragstone with dressed ashlar Wealden sandstone used for the porch columns , quoins and tower . The sandstone has <unk> joints . It has a simple rectangular form in the 18th @-@ century " temple church " style . St Paul 's , Covent Garden in London , an early Palladian church by Inigo Jones , was the model for the design , which was then " purified by neo @-@ Palladian theory " . The roof is covered in slate and has prominent eaves and pedimented ends . 
 Rising above the roof at the west end of the church is a tall tower topped with a steeple flanked by decorative urns . The stone structure , with its square base supporting octagonal upper stages with columned sides and a balustrade , is so similar to the steeple at St Giles in the Fields that the Buildings of England series says that it was " copied almost directly " from that church . Projecting from the west end below the pedimented end of the roof is a semicircular open porch with Tuscan columns topped by a cornice . Its design is based on that of the Baroque church of St. Paul 's , Deptford ; St Mary le Strand in central London has also been cited as a model . The tower has a peal of six bells , cast in 1746 by Joseph <unk> of St. Neots , Huntingdonshire . They are in the Key of G. 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior is in a Neoclassical style . Entrance to the church is through a porch at the west end , which leads into a circular chamber in the base of the tower . Rooms to the sides of this vestibule house monuments from the original church . On the north side is the <unk> Court Chapel , where the brass of William Shosmyth and his wife Julian can be found . Shosmyth was the warden of the religious guild of the Worshipful Company of Skinners in 1461 , and the brass has the earliest known representation of the Skinners ' coat of arms . As of 2011 , this chapel serves as a vestry . On the south side is the Despencer or Lady Chapel . It contains the brasses to Sir John de Mereworth and Thomas Nevill , and monuments to either Edward Neville , 3rd Baron Bergavenny or his son George Nevill , 4th Baron Bergavenny . Another memorial contains the heart of George Nevill , 5th Baron Bergavenny . The tomb of Sir Thomas Fane and his wife Mary . Their sons Francis and George are depicted kneeling at the base of the tomb . 
 Beyond the vestibule is a wide aisled nave , seven bays long , its barrel @-@ vaulted ceiling painted with trompe @-@ l 'œil coffering ( " not very convincingly " according to the Buildings of England guide ) , a chancel and a side chapel . The nave and aisles are separated by painted marble @-@ effect stone Doric columns , which were originally partly panelled , They support a horizontal entablature rather than the more usual arches . The strict geometry of the interior – each bay of the aisles is a square , and the nave is three times wider than each aisle – gives it an " austere Neoclassical appearance " not normally associated with the Georgian era in which it was built . 
 At the east end is a grandiose lunette or " Diocletian window " , in imitation of the type used at Roman baths , filling the space left clear by the arch of the barrel vault . Below this is the round @-@ headed window added in 1875 . 
 Fixtures include a marble font which is contemporary with the church . There is much stained glass : the oldest , in the form of heraldic emblems in cartouches , dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall and in another window on the southwest side . The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton , rector of Mereworth 1832 – 74 . Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries . Another , depicting the Raising of Lazarus , was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton , Butler and Bayne firm in 1889 . 
 The organ is by Gray and Davison . It was installed in 1882 by Lord Falmouth at a cost of £ 200 . In 1892 , the rector , E H Stapleton extended the range of the organ in memory of his wife .

 = <unk> hammerhead = 
 The smalleye hammerhead or golden hammerhead ( Sphyrna tudes ) , is a small species of hammerhead shark , belonging to the family Sphyrnidae . This species is common in the shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean , from Venezuela to Uruguay . It favors muddy habitats with poor visibility , reflected by its relatively small eyes . Adult males and juveniles are schooling and generally found apart from the solitary adult females . Typically reaching 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 3 ft ) in length , this shark has a unique , bright golden color on its head , sides , and fins , which was only scientifically documented in the 1980s . As in all hammerheads , its head is flattened and laterally expanded into a hammer @-@ shaped structure called the " cephalofoil " , which in this species is wide and long with an arched front margin bearing central and lateral indentations . 
 The yellow @-@ orange pigments of the smalleye hammerhead seem to have been acquired from the penaeid shrimp <unk> <unk> , the main food of juvenile sharks , and from sea catfish and their eggs , the main food of adults . The golden color may serve to conceal it from predators such as larger sharks . This species is viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac . Females bear litters of 5 – 19 pups every year following a gestation period of 10 months . Reproductive seasonality , litter size , and size at maturity vary between geographical regions . Because of its abundance , the smalleye hammerhead is an economically important bycatch of artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout its range and is utilized as food . In recent years , overfishing has caused marked declines in its numbers off Trinidad , northern Brazil , and probably elsewhere . Coupled with its low reproductive rate , this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to list it under Vulnerable . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Despite being one of the most easily recognizable sharks , the smalleye hammerhead has had a long history of taxonomic confusion that still remains to be fully resolved . Its scientific name originated in 1822 , with French zoologist Achille Valenciennes ' description of Zygaena tudes in the scientific journal Memoires du Museum National d 'Histoire Naturelle ; the specific epithet tudes is Latin for " hammer " . Valenciennes made reference to three specimens : one from Nice in France , one from Cayenne in French Guyana , and one from the Coromandel Coast of India . However , for over two centuries taxonomists believed Valenciennes ' account matched the great hammerhead , which thus became known as Zygaena ( later Sphyrna ) tudes . The smalleye hammerhead was known by a different name , Sphyrna bigelowi , coined by Stewart Springer in a 1944 issue of Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences . 
 In 1950 , Enrico Tortonese examined the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes ( the Coromandel specimen having been lost in the interim ) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads but rather the same species as S. bigelowi . Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks , noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead , none of the existing material belonged to that species . Thus , Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead , taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier , and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran . Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes , having priority over the Cayenne specimen ( the paralectotype ) . This was meant to stabilize the name but had the opposite effect . 
 In 1981 , Jean <unk> and Jacques <unk> revisited the type specimens of S. tudes and found that the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead ( S. <unk> , likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead , S. lewini ) . This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen , as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas . By the rules of binomial nomenclature , <unk> tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead , taking precedence over S. <unk> , and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi . Taxonomists though have been reluctant to change the names again , preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes . For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place . The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth . 
 Until the first detailed study of the smalleye hammerhead was carried out in 1985 – 86 by José Castro of Clemson University for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , its distinctive golden coloration was unknown to science . The color fades after death and the pigments leech into the preservative , resulting in the " yellowish cast " of museum specimens being regarded as an artifact of preservation . The names " yellow hammerhead " or " golden hammerhead " are used by fishermen in Trinidad for this shark , and the latter was promoted for wider usage by Castro . Another common name for this species is the curry shark . Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have found that the hammerheads with the smallest cephalofoils are the most derived members of their lineage . The closest relative of the smalleye hammerhead appears to be the <unk> ( S. media ) , and the two of them in turn form a clade with the sister species pair of the scalloped bonnethead ( S. corona ) and the bonnethead ( S. tiburo ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 One of the smaller members of its family , the smalleye hammerhead can reach a length of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) , though 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 3 ft ) is more typical , and a weight of 9 kg ( 20 lb ) . The body is streamlined and fairly slender . The mallet @-@ shaped cephalofoil is wide and long , with a span measuring 28 – 32 % of the body length ; the leading margin forms a broad arch with indentations in the middle and on either side . The cephalofoil of newborns are longer , more arched , and less indented in front than those of adults . The eyes , placed at the ends of the cephalofoil , are proportionately smaller than in other hammerheads and equipped with nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . The nostrils are positioned just inside of the eyes , each with a well @-@ developed groove running towards the center of the cephalofoil . The mouth is strongly curved , containing on either side 15 – 16 upper tooth rows and 15 – 17 lower tooth rows . The teeth have single narrow cusps with smooth or weakly serrated edges , that are angled in the upper jaw and upright in the lower jaw . 
 The first dorsal fin is tall and slightly falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) , originating behind the pectoral fin bases ; its free rear tip lies over the origin of the pelvic fins . The second dorsal fin is smaller than the first but still rather large , with a concave trailing margin . The pelvic fins have nearly straight trailing margins . The anal fin is taller and longer than the second dorsal fin . The caudal fin has a well @-@ developed lower lobe and a notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The dermal denticles are oval with five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . The most distinctive trait of this species is its coloration : the back and dorsal fins are gray to yellowish gray , and the cephalofoil margins , flanks , underside , pectoral fins , pelvic fins , and anal fin are bright yellow to orange with a metallic or iridescent sheen . Newborn sharks are gray above , darkening on the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe , and whitish below . They gain a bright yellow cast on their undersides by a length of 45 cm ( 18 in ) , which turns to orange by a length of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . The golden color is brightest in sharks 55 – 70 cm ( 22 – 28 in ) long , and tends to fade with the onset of sexual maturity . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The smalleye hammerhead is found along the eastern coast of South America from Uruguay to Venezuela , though it seldom occurs further west than the Orinoco Delta southeast of Trinidad . There are unconfirmed reports of this species from off Panama , Mexico , and western Florida ; records from other parts of the world are most likely erroneous , resulting from its tangled taxonomic history . It is among the most abundant sharks within its range . This species inhabits inshore murky waters 5 – 40 m ( 16 – 131 ft ) deep , over muddy bottoms . There is segregation by sex and age : newborns and juveniles under 40 cm ( 16 in ) long are found in the shallowest waters , moving deeper after a few months of life . Adult females are mostly found at depths of 9 – 18 m ( 30 – 59 ft ) , while larger juveniles and adult males are mostly found at depths of 27 – 36 m ( 89 – 118 ft ) . This species is tolerant of brackish water and can be found over a salinity range of 20 – 34 ppt . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Four other species of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead : the small @-@ sized <unk> and bonnethead , and the large @-@ sized scalloped hammerhead and great hammerhead . There is little competition between these species because of their differing habitat and dietary preferences . The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow muddy areas , where high turbidity limits the utility of vision ( hence its smaller eyes ) . Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size ; these schools do not appear to relate to reproduction or migration . Adult females are apparently solitary . 
 Young smalleye hammerheads under 67 cm ( 26 in ) long feed predominantly on penaeid shrimp , mostly <unk> <unk> . Larger sharks feed mainly on bony fishes , especially <unk> sea catfish and their eggs . The shrimp and the surface mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments that appear to be the source of the sharks ' golden color ; it is uncertain whether the pigments in the catfish also ultimately come from the shrimp . Another shark species in the region , the yellow smooth @-@ hound ( Mustelus <unk> ) , also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish color , albeit not nearly as bright . This species has also been known to consume swimming crabs , squid , grunts , and newborn scalloped hammerheads . The smalleye hammerhead may fall prey to larger sharks such as the bull shark ( Carcharhinus leucas ) , while smaller individuals may also be taken by bony fishes . Its coloration may provide camouflage . A known parasite of this species is the <unk> monogenean <unk> <unk> ; it may also serve as a host to common copepod ectoparasites such as Echthrogaleus <unk> , Pandarus satyrus and P. cranchii . 
 Like all hammerhead sharks , the smalleye hammerhead is viviparous : when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , the depleted yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment . Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteruses . Ovulation occurs at the same time as gestation , allowing females to bear young every year . The details of the smalleye hammerhead 's life history vary across its range . Off Trinidad , reproduction occurs on a well @-@ defined annual cycle with mating in August and September , and birthing in late May and June of the following year . The females carry between 5 and 12 pups for 10 months , and make use of food @-@ rich , shallow coastal bays as nursery areas . The newborns measure around 30 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 ft ) long , and males and females attain sexual maturity at 80 cm ( 31 in ) and 98 cm ( 39 in ) long respectively . By contrast , smalleye hammerheads off the northern Brazilian state of Maranhão are substantially larger , with males maturing at over 92 cm ( 36 in ) long and females at over 101 cm ( 40 in ) long . As the litter size increases with female size , Maranhão sharks have been recorded carrying up to 19 pups . The seasonality of breeding also differs , with pregnant females found from June to October and January to April , and males in apparent reproductive condition from May to November and in March .

 Timid and harmless to humans , the smalleye hammerhead is caught incidentally by inshore artisanal multi @-@ species fisheries throughout its range , and marketed as food . It is the most or second @-@ most important shark caught by such fisheries off Trinidad , Guyana , and Brazil . Because of its head shape , individuals of all ages are readily caught in gillnets ; small numbers are also caught on line gear and in bottom trawls . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Vulnerable , as it is subjected to intense fishing pressure and its low reproductive rate renders it susceptible to population depletion . Anecdotal evidence suggests that smalleye hammerhead catches have declined significantly off Trinidad and northern Brazil , which are likely indicative of population trends in the rest of its range . It is not the target of any conservation or management schemes . 
 = Visions of Johanna = 
 " Visions of Johanna " is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan on his 1966 album Blonde on Blonde . Dylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965 , under the working title of " Freeze Out " , but was dissatisfied with the results . When the Blonde on Blonde recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966 , Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians , and decided to release this performance . All the alternate versions of the song have been officially released , but some only on a limited edition collectors set : many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio outtakes , and two others live performances from his 1966 world tour . 
 Several critics have acclaimed " Visions of Johanna " as one of Dylan 's highest achievements in writing , praising the <unk> and subtlety of the language . Rolling Stone included " Visions of Johanna " on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . In 1999 , Sir Andrew Motion , poet laureate of the UK , listed it as his candidate for the greatest song lyric ever written . Numerous artists have recorded cover versions of the song , including the Grateful Dead , Marianne Faithfull and Robyn Hitchcock .

 Clinton Heylin places the writing of " Visions of Johanna " in the fall of 1965 , when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his pregnant wife Sara . Heylin notes that " in this déclassé hotel … the heat pipes still cough " , referring to a line from the song . Greil Marcus reports that when the song was first released , " the story was that the song had been written during the great east coast blackout of November 9 , 1965 . " 
 Dylan first recorded this song , backed by The Hawks , in the CBS New York recording studio , on November 30 , 1965 , announcing his new composition with the words : " This is called ' Freeze Out ' . " Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the " air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched ... full of whispering and muttering . " According to Marcus , Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words , " Seems like a freeze @-@ out . " 
 Some of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line " He examines the nightingale 's code " . Historian Sean Wilentz , for his book Dylan In America , listened closely to full studio tapes of the Blonde on Blonde sessions , and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes , trying to explain how he wanted " Visions of Johanna " played . At one point , Dylan says : " It 's not hard rock , The only thing in it that 's hard is Robbie . " Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session , Wilentz writes that Dylan " quiets things down , inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde — and it is still not right . " Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30 , including one with an uptempo rock beat , containing harpsichord accompaniment , and another with a march @-@ like tempo , which was released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 7 : No Direction Home : The Soundtrack in 2005 . 
 " Visions of Johanna " fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer , Bob Johnston , to move the recording sessions to Nashville , Tennessee . During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio , on February 14 , 1966 , the Blonde on Blonde version of the song was recorded . In an interview with Andy Gill , Al Kooper has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan 's vocal . Kooper added that " it 's very important what Joe South 's bass is doing in that " ; Kooper described it as " this throbbing ... rhythmically amazing bass part " . Other backing musicians were Charlie McCoy , guitar , Wayne Moss , guitar , and Kenneth Buttrey on drums . 
 The " Visions of Johanna " recording sessions were released in their entirety on the 18 @-@ disc Collector 's Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol . 12 : The Cutting Edge 1965 – 1966 on November 6 , 2015 , with highlights from the November 30 , 1965 outtakes appearing on the 6 @-@ disc and 2 @-@ disc versions of that album . 
 = = Live performances and recordings = = 
 Dylan first performed " Visions of Johanna " in public on December 4 , 1965 , at the Berkeley Community Theatre . Present at this concert was Joan Baez , who believed the lyrics referred to her . She said , " He 'd just written ' Visions of Johanna ' , which sounded very suspicious to me ... he 'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I was there that night and he performed it . " Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg , who was also present . Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture , and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet . 
 Two live versions of the song recorded during Dylan 's 1966 tour of England have been released . His performance of the song at London 's Royal Albert Hall on May 26 , 1966 appeared on Biograph , released in 1985 . Asked by Cameron Crowe , for the liner notes for Biograph , how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance , Dylan responded , " I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual . " A performance of the song recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17 , 1966 was released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 4 : Bob Dylan Live 1966 in 1998 . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Noting how popular " Visions of Johanna " remains among " hardcore <unk> " , Andy Gill suggests it is the enigmatic quality of the song that is responsible for its popularity — " forever teetering on the brink of lucidity , yet remaining impervious to strict decipherment " . Gill writes the song begins by contrasting two lovers , the carnal Louise , and " the more spiritual but unattainable " Johanna . Ultimately , for Gill , the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection . 
 Clinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song . Written around the time of Dylan 's marriage to Sara Lownds , Heylin describes it as " one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city " . Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover , Heylin speculates that " it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse " who , in the song , is " not here " . For Heylin , the triumph of the song lies in " the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid , immediate way " . 
 Dylan critic Michael Gray also praises the subtlety of the song . Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is " about " , since it is at once indefinable and precise . For Gray , its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories , using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant , delicate and coarse , and mixing up " abstract neo @-@ philosophy and figurative phraseology " . 
 Robert Shelton called " Visions of Johanna " one of Dylan 's major works . He writes that Dylan 's technique of throwing out " skittering images " evokes " a mind floating downstream " ; these " non @-@ sequential visions " are the record of a fractured consciousness . Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal , the visions of Johanna , and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless . He suggests that the same paradox is explored by Keats in his " Ode on a Grecian Urn " . 
 Mike Marqusee situates the song in New York City , " a flickering , electric , ghostly , cityscape " . Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven , and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity : an unmediated response that is " too concise and too clear " . For Marqusee , Dylan describes his predicament , suspended between freedom and slavery , yet hungry for an authentic experience . Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning . " It is their elusiveness and unreality that 's the point . " 
 Guitarist and critic Bill Janovitz also emphasizes the urban , unreal quality of " Visions of Johanna " , calling it a " sprawling epic " . " The journey takes Dylan through lofts , the D train , a museum , empty lots , and through snippets of overheard conversation , as well as a discussion with some ' little boy lost ' , who ' takes himself so seriously ' , and who is ' so useless and all / muttering small talk at the wall ' . " For Janovitz , this could " possibly be a swipe at a critic " . 
 Literary critic Christopher Ricks , in his study of Dylan 's work , pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines : 
 He ’ s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all 
 <unk> small talk at the wall while I ’ m in the hall 
 Ricks writes that the phrase " and all " turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of " aggression and baffled anger " . 
 Trying to unravel the mystery of the song , Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions , rather than external ones : " Line by line , ' Blowin ' in the Wind ' is pious , or falsely innocent — isn 't it obvious that whoever wrote " Yes , ' n ' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand ? " already knows the answer , assuming he , or anyone , can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question ? But ' Visions of Johanna ' is asking different sorts of questions . Such as : Where are you ? Who are you ? What are you doing here ? " Evoking the drugged , urban milieu of the song , Marcus writes of " People wandering from one corner of a loft to another , doped , drunk , half @-@ awake , fast asleep , no point to the next breath , let alone the next step . " For Marcus , " ' Visions of Johanna ' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere . "

 The song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece . In 2004 , Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No. 404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time , commenting that Dylan " never sounded lonelier than in this seven @-@ minute ballad , cut in a single take on Valentine 's Day 1966 . " ( When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010 , the song dropped to No. 413 . ) In 1999 , Britain 's Poet Laureate , Andrew Motion , chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written . Motion praised " the concentration and surprise " of Dylan 's lyrics , and said that , although he distanced himself from some of the singer 's views about women , the " rasp of his anger " was a part of his greatness . Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview , Dylan said , " I still sing that song every once in a while . It still stands up now as it did then , maybe even more in some kind of weird way . "

 = Caligula = 
 Caligula ( / <unk> / ) was the popular nickname of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus ( 31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41 ) , Roman emperor ( AD 37 – 41 ) . Born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus ( not to be confused with Julius Caesar ) , Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Caligula 's biological father was Germanicus , and he was the nephew and adopted son of Emperor Tiberius . The young Gaius earned the nickname " Caligula " ( meaning " little soldier 's boot " , the diminutive form of <unk> , hob @-@ nailed military boot ) from his father 's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in Germania . 
 When Germanicus died at Antioch in AD 19 , his wife Agrippina the Elder returned with her six children to Rome , where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius . The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family , with Caligula as the sole male survivor . Untouched by the deadly intrigues , Caligula accepted the invitation to join the Emperor in AD 31 on the island of Capri , where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier . With the death of Tiberius in AD 37 , Caligula succeeded his grand uncle and adoptive grandfather as emperor . 
 There are few surviving sources about the reign of Emperor Caligula , although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first six months of his reign . After this , the sources focus upon his cruelty , sadism , extravagance , and sexual perversity , presenting him as an insane tyrant . While the reliability of these sources is questionable , it is known that during his brief reign , Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor , as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate . He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself , and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome : the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus . During his reign , the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province . 
 In early AD 41 , Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard , senators , and courtiers . The conspirators ' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted : on the day of the assassination of Caligula , the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula 's uncle , Claudius , the next Roman emperor .

 See Julio @-@ Claudian family tree . 
 Gaius Julius Caesar ( named in honor of his famous relative ) was born in <unk> ( modern Anzio and Nettuno ) on 31 August 12 AD , the third of six surviving children born to Germanicus and his second cousin Agrippina the Elder . Gaius had two older brothers , Nero and Drusus , as well as three younger sisters , Agrippina the Younger , Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla . He was also a nephew of Claudius , Germanicus ' younger brother and future emperor . 
 Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder . She was a granddaughter of Augustus and Scribonia on her mother 's side . Through Agrippina , Augustus was the maternal great @-@ grandfather of Gaius . 
 = = = Youth and early career = = = 
 As a boy of just two or three , Gaius accompanied his father , Germanicus , on campaigns in the north of Germania . The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier 's outfit , including boots and armour . He was soon given his nickname Caligula , meaning " little ( soldier 's ) boot " in Latin , after the small boots he wore . Gaius , though , reportedly grew to dislike this nickname . 
 Suetonius claims that Germanicus was poisoned in Syria by an agent of Tiberius , who viewed Germanicus as a political rival . 
 After the death of his father , Caligula lived with his mother until her relations with Tiberius deteriorated . Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival . Agrippina and Caligula 's brother , Nero , were banished in 29 AD on charges of treason . 
 The adolescent Caligula was then sent to live with his great @-@ grandmother ( and Tiberius 's mother ) Livia . After her death , he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia . In 30 AD , his brother , Drusus Caesar , was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide . Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers , Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers . 
 In 31 AD , Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius on Capri , where he lived for six years . To the surprise of many , Caligula was spared by Tiberius . According to historians , Caligula was an excellent natural actor and , recognizing danger , hid all his resentment towards Tiberius . An observer said of Caligula , " Never was there a better servant or a worse master ! " 
 Caligula claimed to have planned to kill Tiberius with a dagger in order to avenge his mother and brother : however , having brought the weapon into Tiberius 's bedroom he did not kill the Emperor but instead threw the dagger down on the floor . Supposedly Tiberius knew of this but never dared to do anything about it . Suetonius claims that Caligula was already cruel and vicious : he writes that , when Tiberius brought Caligula to Capri , his purpose was to allow Caligula to live in order that he " ... prove the ruin of himself and of all men , and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world . " 
 In 33 AD , Tiberius gave Caligula an honorary <unk> , a position he held until his rise to emperor . Meanwhile , both Caligula 's mother and his brother Drusus died in prison . Caligula was briefly married to Junia <unk> , in 33 , though she died in childbirth the following year . Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect , Naevius Sutorius Macro , an important ally . Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius , attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula . 
 In 35 AD , Caligula was named joint heir to Tiberius 's estate along with Tiberius Gemellus .

 When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD , his estate and the titles of the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius 's own grandson , Gemellus , who were to serve as joint heirs . Although Tiberius was 78 and on his death bed , some ancient historians still conjecture that he was murdered . Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect , Macro , smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula 's accession , much to the joy of the Roman people , while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing , though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian . Seneca the elder and Philo , who both wrote during Tiberius 's reign , as well as Josephus record Tiberius as dying a natural death . Backed by Macro , Caligula had Tiberius 's will nullified with regards to Gemellus on grounds of insanity , but otherwise carried out Tiberius 's wishes .
