 By April 1918 , 35 infantry and two pioneer battalions were being prepared to move to Palestine . Some of these battalions , numbered from 150 upwards , were formed by removing complete company 's from experienced regiments then serving in Mesopotamia and forming new battalions . The 2 / 151st Indian Infantry , was one such battalion formed from one company each from the 56th Punjabi Rifles , the 51st , 52nd and 53rd Sikhs . One regiment the 101st Grenadiers formed a second battalion by dividing itself into two with two experienced and two new companies in each battalion . The parent battalions also supplied first line transport and experienced officers with war time service . The 3 / 151st Indian Infantry , had the commanding officer , two other British and four Indian officers included in the 198 men transferred from the 38th Dogras . The sepoys transferred were also very experienced , in September 1918 the 2 / 151st Indian Infantry had to provide an honour guard for Allenby , among the men on parade , were some who had served on five different fronts since 1914 , and on eight pre war campaigns . 
 Of the 54 Indian battalions deployed to Palestine , 22 had recent experience of combat , but had each lost an experienced company , which had been replaced by recruits . Ten battalions were formed from experienced troops who had never fought or trained together . The other 22 had not seen any prior service in the war , in total almost a third of the troops were recruits . Within 44 Indian battalions , the " junior British officers were green , and most could not speak Hindustani . In one battalion only one Indian officer spoke English and only two British officers could communicate with their men . " Not all of the Indian battalions served in the infantry divisions , some were employed in defence of the lines of communication . 
 = = = Front line = = = 
 In September 1918 , the front line began near sea level on the Mediterranean coast about 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Jaffa and Arsuf , extending about 15 miles ( 24 km ) south @-@ eastward across the Plain of Sharon , then eastward over the Judean Hills for about 15 miles ( 24 km ) , rising to 1 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 460 – 610 m ) above sea level along the way . From the Judean Hills , the front line dropped down to 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) below sea level , to cross the Jordan Valley for approximately 18 miles ( 29 km ) , ending in the foothills of the Mountains of Gilead / Moab . 
 = = = Railway = = = 
 The Ottoman railway from Istanbul travelled south to Deraa where it branched into two lines . One line continued east of the Jordan River in a southerly direction to supply the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters and the garrisons and forces scattered along the southern Hedjaz railway several hundred miles to the south . The second railway line turned westward to supply the Ottoman Seventh and the Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills . This second line crossed the Jordan at Jisr Mejamie , ran southwards down the west bank of the Jordan River to Beisan , then turned westward to run parallel to the front line in the Judean Hills , across the Esdraelon Plain to Afulah . From Afulah the railway forked again into two lines : a branch line running north – westerly to Haifa , while the main line turned south to Jenin . From Jenin the railway wound through a narrow pass in the foothills to climb to Messudieh Junction in the Judean Hills where it again branched into two lines . One line ran westward to Tulkarm and the Eighth Army headquarters before turning south to reach railhead behind the Eighth Army ' front line on the coastal plain , while the second line continued south – eastward to Nablus . Here , the headquarters of the Seventh Army was located , north of Jerusalem on the main road to Nazareth and Damascus .

 " Concentration , surprise , and speed were key elements in the blitzkrieg warfare planned by Allenby . " Victory at the Battle of Megiddo depended on the success of an intense British Empire artillery barrage to cover the front line infantry attack and drive a gap in the line so the cavalry could advance to quickly reach the Esdraelon Plain 50 miles ( 80 km ) away during the first day of battle . Control of the skies was achieved and maintained by destroying or dominating German aircraft activity and reconnaissances , and constant bombing raids by the Royal Flying Corps ( RAF ) and Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) on Afulah and the Seventh and Eighth Army headquarters at Tulkarm and Nablus respectively and cutting communications with their commander , Liman von Sanders at Nazareth . 
 During the first 36 hours of the Battle of Megiddo 's Battle of Sharon , between 04 : 30 on 19 September and 17 : 00 on 20 September , the German and Ottoman front line had been cut by infantry , and the cavalry had passed through the gap to reach their objectives at Afulah , Nazareth , and Beisan . Without communications , no combined action could be organized by the Ottoman forces . The continuing British Empire infantry attack from the south forced the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills to withdraw northwards towards Damascus , along the main roads and railways from Tulkarm and Nablus which ran through the Dothan Pass northwards to Jenin . Having captured the town , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade were to wait for them .

 The XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Phillip Chetwode consisting of the 10th and 53rd Divisions , was deployed on both sides of the road from Jerusalem to Nablus , in the Judean Hills . 
 Chetwode was to capture Nablus by launching attacks on both Ottoman flanks , with the aim of converging about 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the north . The 10th Division on the left was to attack the inter @-@ army boundary with the XXI Corps 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) east of Furkhah , heading for Nablus along a spur parallel with the 53rd Division on the right , which was to move east following the watershed to the Wadi el Fara . Between these two divisions was a 7 miles ( 11 km ) gap lightly held by Watson 's Force ; a detachment improvised from Corps Troops ' 1 / 1st Worcestershire Yeomanry , two Pioneer battalions , and details from the Corps Reinforcement Camp .

 On 5 September 1918 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade took over the left sector of the valley defences , continuing active patrolling . And on " the 16th September the General Officer Commanding Anzac Mounted Division took over command of the whole of the Jordan Valley defences as well as Desert Mounted Corps camps at Talaat ed Dumm and Kilo 17 Jericho Jerusalem Road and Desert Mounted Corps Reinforcement Camp , Jerusalem , the force being designated ' Chaytor 's Force . ' " 
 Chaytor 's Force commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor , consisted of the Anzac Mounted Division , 20th Indian Brigade , 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment , 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers ( Jewish Volunteers ) , A / 263 Battery Royal Field Artillery ( RFA ) , 195th Heavy Battery Royal Garrison Artillery ( RGA ) , 29th and 32nd Indian Artillery Mountain Batteries , No. 6 ( Medium ) Trench Mortar Battery , three anti – aircraft sections Royal Artillery ( RA ) , two sections of captured 75 mm Ottoman guns , one section of captured 5 @.@ 9 Ottoman guns and No. 35 Army Troops Company Royal Engineers ( RE ) . 
 On establishment , the force consisted of one mounted division , one infantry brigade and four infantry battalions ( equivalent to a second infantry brigade without brigade support troops or a command structure ) , five batteries , six sections of artillery and transport consisting of 20 lorries , 17 tractors , 34 trucks , 300 donkeys , 11 @,@ 000 horses and mules . Eight days later an additional 70 donkeys , 65 lorries in the 1040 Motor Transport Company , 110 camels in ' M ' Company Camel Transport Corps , were added . 
 Chaytor 's Force was detached from the Desert Mounted Corps for independent operations . Primary responsibilities included the continuing occupation of the Jordan Valley and the protection of the eastern flank of the EEF 's front line . Further , Chaytor 's Force was to exploit any withdrawal by the Ottoman Fourth Army from their positions at Shunet Nimrin , Es Salt and their headquarters at Amman .

 On 18 September , the Royal Air Force 's 5th ( Corps ) Wing and the 40th ( Army ) Wing , both headquartered at Ramle , were deployed to the area and responsible for cooperation with artillery and contact patrols , tactical and strategic reconnaissance , photography , escorts , offensive patrols and bombing operations . No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) , No. 111 Squadron RAF and a flight of No. 145 Squadron RAF were based at Ramle , while No. 144 Squadron RAF was based at Junction Station . 
 Tactical reconnaissance up to 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) in advance of the XXI Corps , XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force , was provided by corps squadrons ; No. 14 Squadron RAF operating out of Junction Station was assigned to XX Corps . Operating out of Sarona was No. 113 Squadron RAF , along with No. 21 Balloon Company , both assigned to XXI Corps . No. 142 Squadron RAF , also operating out of Sarona , had orders to move forward to Jenin aerodrome as soon as it was captured and was assigned to Desert Mounted Corps . One flight from No. 142 Squadron was attached to Chaytor 's Force and operated out of Jerusalem . 
 No. 1 Squadron ( AFC ) , consisting of Bristol Fighters , was to carry out bombing and strategic reconnaissance , as well as provide general oversight of the battlefield and report developments . Nos. 111 and 145 Squadrons of S.E.5a aircraft were to patrol over the main Jenin aerodrome all day , bombing and machine gunning targets in the area to prevent any aircraft leaving the aerodrome . No. 144 Squadron , consisting of D.H. 9 aircraft , was to bomb the Afulah telephone exchange and railway station , the Messudieh Junction railway lines , as well as the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters and telephone exchange at Nablus . The newly arrived Handley – Page O @-@ 400 bomber ( armed with 16 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) bombs ) and piloted by the Australian , Ross Smith , was to support No. 144 Squadron 's bombing of Afulah .

 = = = British Empire plan = = = 
 The timing of the attacks by the XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force were dependent on the progress made by the XXI Corps during 19 September . 
 Chetwode 's XX Corps would continue holding more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) of front in the Judean Hills , until the XXI Corps had succeeded in breaking through the Ottoman defences and was advancing north to its secondary objectives . Then , the 10th and the 53rd Divisions would launch their attacks on both sides of the road from Jerusalem to Nablus . In particular , the XX Corps right flank was to swing towards the north and north east of Nablus to capture all remaining escape routes eastwards from the Judean Hills to the Jordan River . 
 In the Jordan Valley , Chaytor 's Force would hold the occupied area and the right flank against attack by the Ottoman Fourth Army and prevent that force from withdrawing troops , which could be sent to reinforce the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills . When the Ottoman force began its withdrawal , they were to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge . 
 Allenby 's plan was focused on capturing the Ottoman line of communication and retreat between the Fourth Army east of the Jordan river and the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills west of the Jordan – 
 I am very anxious to make a move in September , on the lines which I have already indicated to you ... Nablus and Tulkeram are the Headquarters of the VII and VIII Armies , joined by a lateral line of railway . The possession by the Turks of the road Nablus – Jisr ed <unk> – Es Salt is of great advantage to them ; and , until I get it , I can 't occupy Es Salt with my troops or the Arabs . Another reason for moving to this line is that it will encourage both my own new Indian troops and my Arab Allies . 
 Chaytor 's Force would then attack and pursue the Fourth Army , intercept and capture the 4 @,@ 600 strong garrison from Maan and capture Amman . 
 = = = Yildirim Army Group = = = 
 In August 1918 , the Yildirim Army Group commanded by von Sanders consisted of 40 @,@ 598 front line infantrymen , organised into twelve divisions and deployed along 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) of front line . They were armed with 19 @,@ 819 rifles , 273 light and 696 heavy machine guns ; the high number of machine guns reflecting the Ottoman Army 's new tables of organization and the high machine gun component of the German Asia Corps . 
 The Ottoman front line in the Judean Hills was well entrenched south of Nablus in terrain which favoured defence . The area consisted of " very difficult and broken ground " in a rugged area of the Judean Hills . The defenders were supplied by two railways , one from Haifa and the main railway via Beisan across the Jordan to Deraa , Damascus and on to Istanbul as well as good roads from Haifa and Damascus , via Nazareth . 
 = = = = Eighth Army = = = = 
 The Eighth Army of 10 @,@ 000 soldiers supported by 157 artillery guns , with its headquarters at Tulkarm and commanded by Cevat <unk> , held a line from the Mediterranean coast just north of Arsuf to Furkhah in the Judean Hills . Its XXII Corps consisted of the 7th , 20th and 46th Infantry Divisions . The Asia Corps , also known as the " Left Wing Group " , consisted of the 16th and 19th Infantry Divisions , three German battalion groups from the German Pasha II Brigade and the 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division , which was held in reserve . This corps – sized German formation was commanded by German Colonel von Oppen . 
 These divisions holding the front line from the Mediterranean Sea where they faced the XXI Corps , and into the Judean Hills where they faced the XX Corps , were highly regarded veteran formations in the Ottoman Army . In particular , the 7th and 19th Infantry Divisions , had fought with distinction in the Gallipoli Campaign as part of Esat Pasa 's III Corps .

The Fourth Army was made up of two corps ; the VIII Corps ' 48th Infantry Division , a composite division which included a German battalion group , the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade and the division sized <unk> Group , while the II Corps ( known as the Seria Group or Jordan Group ) consisted of the 24th and the 62nd Infantry Divisions , with the 3rd Cavalry Division in reserve .

 An English language assessment describes the Fourth , Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies fighting strength as 26 @,@ 000 infantry , 2 @,@ 000 mounted troops and 372 guns . Another states the 45 miles ( 72 km ) of front line in the Judean Hills , was defended by 24 @,@ 000 Ottoman soldiers with 270 guns against the British Empire 's 22 @,@ 000 infantry , 3 @,@ 000 cavalry and 157 guns . 
 The nine infantry battalions of the 16th Infantry Division , had effective strengths equal to a British infantry company of between 100 and 250 men , while 150 to 200 men were " assigned " to the 19th Infantry Division battalions which had had between 500 and 600 men at Beersheba . 
 Claims have been made that the Ottoman armies were under strength , overstretched , " haemorrhaging " deserters , suffering greatly from a strained supply system and overwhelmingly outnumbered by two to one by the EEF . It is claimed the Ottoman supply system was so bad in February 1918 , that the normal daily ration for the Yildirim Army Group in Palestine , consisted of 125 grains ( 0 @.@ 29 oz ) of bread and boiled beans three times a day , without oil or any other condiment .

 On 18 September , the 53rd Division attempted to seize the Samieh basin overlooking the Ottoman road system behind their front lines . From this watershed , the Wadi Samieh flowed gradually to the west into the Judean Hills and the Wadi el Auja flowed down steeply to the east into the Jordan River . The area was required for the construction of a road to link the British road system with the newly captured Ottoman road system . Some objectives were captured but a position known to the British as " Nairn Ridge " was held by the Ottomans until late on 19 September . 
 The 53rd Division 's attack began shortly after 18 : 30 on the evening of 18 September when three battalions of the 160th Brigade , with the 21st Punjabis as vanguard , moved down into Wadi es Samieh in a wide flanking manoeuvre across rocky terrain towards the rear of the Ottoman positions . After cresting the wadi , they turned to the left and attacked a series of Ottoman positions from the east capturing small posts until an artillery bombardment between 21 : 52 and 22 : 20 enabled them to continue their advance . At 22 : 30 , the 159th Brigade began its advance but almost immediately encountered strong Ottoman defences and the only five Hindustani @-@ speaking British officers were wounded . Despite the casualties , the brigade captured its objectives under the command of an Adjutant Captain . The 159th Brigade advanced again and captured the Hindhead position at 04 : 40 after a red rocket , from the 160th Brigade indicating it had captured most of their objectives , was sighted . Meanwhile , the 160th Brigade had met increasing machine gun and artillery fire until a five @-@ minute artillery bombardment at 04 : 45 enabled the capture of the Square Hill position . The southern end of Nairn Ridge was not captured , having " withstood three assaults " . 
 At 04 : 30 , intense bombardment by artillery , trench mortars and machine guns , targeted the German and Ottoman front and second line trenches ahead of XXI Corps towards the Mediterranean coast . Additional fire support came from three siege batteries , which provided counter @-@ battery fire , and the destroyers HMS Druid and HMS Forester , which fired on Ottoman trenches north of the Nahr el Faliq ; beginning the Battle of Sharon . 
 Nairn Ridge remained in Ottoman hands until about 19 : 00 on 19 September , when it was finally captured and the road works could begin , and the 53rd Division could start their attempt to block the line of retreat , to the Jordan River at Mafid Jozele .

 Instead of attempting a frontal assault on the strongly entrenched Ottoman positions , the two divisions of the XX Corps were to carry out a converging movement . The 10th Division on the left of the main road was to capture Nablus , while the 53rd Division on the right was to move east of Nablus along a watershed to cut the lines of retreat from the Judean Hills to the Jisr ed Damieh and converge on Nablus . 
 At 12 : 00 on 19 September , Chetwode received orders from GHQ to launch the XX Corps ' attack that night on both sides of the road to Nablus . At 19 : 45 after a 15 @-@ minute bombardment , the 10th Division was to begin the attack on the inter army boundary between the Asia Corps ( Eighth Ottoman Army ) and the Seventh Ottoman Army , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) east of Furkhah at the " western end of the <unk> spur . " The 53rd Division 's attack , which would not begin until after they had captured Nairn Ridge , was to move eastwards following the watershed to the Wadi el Fara to block the Roman road to the Jordan River at Mafid Jozele . 
 Mustafa Kemal the commander of the Seventh Army reported to Liman that his army had repulsed practically all attacks on its front , but was about to withdraw to its second @-@ line position between Kefar Haris and <unk> , to conform with von Oppen 's Asia Corps ( Eighth Army ) retirement . 
 The XX Corps artillery bombardment began at 19 : 30 and fifteen minutes later two battalions of the 29th Brigade ( 10th Division ) began to advance on either side of the Wadi Rashid against strongly entrenched Ottoman positions . After being reinforced and supported by a further artillery barrage , Furkhah village was captured and the advance continued towards Selfit , which was occupied in the " early hours of the morning " of 20 September . 
 Meanwhile , in the Jordan Valley , Chaytor 's Force faced stiff opposition from the Ottoman front line troops . As a consequence of progress made by the 160th Brigade during the afternoon of 19 September , one of the brigade 's mountain batteries was able to get in a position to fire on Bakr Ridge . At 14 : 25 , supported by the 160th Brigade 's battery , three companies of the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment ( Chaytor 's Force ) destroyed Ottoman outposts and captured a ridge to the south of Bakr Ridge , despite intense artillery and machine gun fire . Under heavy fire , they dug in and held their position while two regiments of 2nd Light Horse Brigade were able to advance towards Shunet Nimrin . 
 = = = 20 September = = = 
 The 10th Division advanced 7 miles ( 11 km ) before dawn on 20 September , before encountering " solid resistance " which required artillery support , to defeat . Artillery support was delayed for some time due to the lack of a track to transport the guns . Meanwhile , the attack by the 53rd Division along the " ridge proved difficult to negotiate and progress was relatively slow . " 
 By 04 : 30 , the left column of the 10th Division was near <unk> Haris , while the right column was at Selfit , but further advances were slowed by effective Ottoman rearguards . On the right , the 29th Brigade launched an attack at 06 : 45 but met strong resistance from German machine gunners a mile north of Selfit . The 31st Brigade began their advance at 08 : 45 but were held up in the woods east of Haris and south of Kefar Haris . At 15 : 00 , the 29th and 31st Brigades renewed their attacks supported by artillery from the LXVII and LXVIII Brigades RFA . Haris was subsequently captured by an infantry charge into the village . 
 In the centre between the 10th and 53rd Divisions , Watson 's Force sent the 1 / 1st Worcestershire Yeomanry ( XX Corps Troops ) forward at 05 : 30 , to advance northwards up the Jerusalem to Nablus road . The road was found to be heavily mined ; two battalions of pioneers cleared 78 unexploded devices before the yeomanry advanced 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) where they were fired on . By the evening they had advanced 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) to Es <unk> , encountering only small rearguards which were captured . The 10th Heavy Battery and 205th Siege Battery , pulled by four @-@ wheel @-@ drive lorries with ammunition and detachments in lorries , advanced as far up the road as possible , at a rate of 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) per hour to be in action by evening near El Lubban , south of Es <unk> . 
 Strong Ottoman rearguards were encountered by the 53rd Division throughout the day which substantially slowed progress . At 04 : 40 , after a ten @-@ minute bombardment the 160th Brigade attacked Kh . <unk> , but was counter @-@ attacked at 08 : 00 by a battalion of the Ottoman 109th Regiment , which drove them back with heavy losses . By 11 : 00 , the 158th Brigade was half way towards its objective 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) south of Kh . Birket el <unk> , but could not breach the defences without artillery support . However , between 12 : 25 and 12 : 45 the 160th Brigade succeeded in recapturing Kh . <unk> and at 15 : 00 the 159th Brigade captured Ras et Tawil . 
 On the western bank of the Jordan River , the gains made on the previous day were consolidated and Bakr Ridge captured at dawn by the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment . The 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers faced heavy rifle and machine gun fire from Mellaha , which was still strongly held by Ottoman forces and in the late morning a large Ottoman force was seen south of Kh . Fusail . Jericho was shelled again in mid afternoon and at 19 : 00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade began their advance towards Tel sh edh <unk> . Meanwhile , on the eastern bank of the Jordan River , the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments ( 2nd Light Horse Brigade , Chaytor 's Force ) with a company of Patiala Infantry attacked well @-@ defended positions on the Ottoman left flank , but patrols towards Shunet Nimrin and <unk> were shelled by guns from El Haud .

 More than 40 hours after the fighting began , the EEF XXI Corps had forced the Ottoman Eighth Army from the coastal Plain of Sharon , and the Desert Mounted Corps had cut the Ottoman Seventh and remnants of the Eighth Armies main lines of communication and retreat at Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain . 
 By 17 : 00 20 September , about 25 @,@ 000 prisoners had been captured and the Eighth Ottoman Army had ceased to exist excepting von Oppen 's Asia Corps which , together with the Seventh Ottoman Army , withdrew north eastwards through the Judean Hills between Nablus and Beisan ( See Capture of Afulah and Beisan ) towards the Jordan River losing most of their guns and transport . The Desert Mounted Corps had already captured Lejjun , Afulah , Beisan and , at about 17 : 30 , Jenin , while Nazareth would be captured the following morning . The coastal Plain of Sharon had been " cleared " by the XXI Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps controlled all the main Ottoman lines of retreat . A group of 100 soldiers retreating from Mount Ephraim to Beisan were captured in the afternoon of 20 September , and 700 soldiers were captured in the evening , attempting to cross the line of piquets established in the Esdrealon Plain by the 4th Cavalry Division from Afulah to Beisan . 
 My Battle is a big one ; and , so far , very successful . I think I have taken some 10 @,@ 000 prisoners and 80 or 90 guns ... This morning my cavalry occupied Afuleh , and pushed thence rapidly south – eastwards , entered Beisan this evening , thus closing to the enemy his last line of escape . 
 My infantry yesterday captured Tulkeram , and are now pursuing the enemy eastwards to Nablus ... I was at <unk> today , and went along the Nablus road . It is strewn with broken lorries , wagons , dead Turks , horses and oxen ; mostly killed and smashed by our bombing aeroplanes . 
 The same bombing of fugitives , on crowded roads , continues today . I think I ought to capture all the Turks ' guns and the bulk of his Army ... My losses are not heavy , in proportion to the results gained . I hope to motor out , tomorrow , to see the Cavalry in Esdraelon . The Cavalry Headquarters are at Armageddon , at the present moment .

 Chetwode ordered the continuation of the XX Corps ' attacks ; the 10th Division was to capture Nablus , the 53rd Division was to advance towards the high ground north and north east of Nablus , in the direction of the Wadi el Fara road , to capture and control this line of retreat to the Jordan Valley . 
 At 23 : 30 20 September , the 29th and 31st Brigades of the 10th Division resumed their advance ; the 29th Brigade supported by the Hong Kong Battery with the LXVII and LXVIII Brigades RFA on the left . The 30th Brigade concentrated west of Selfit in preparation of a follow @-@ up advance through the 29th Brigade when it reached <unk> on the Damascus road . 
 A strong Ottoman rearguard at <unk> , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of Nablus , delayed the infantry attack for " no more than an hour " after which the defenders were outflanked from the east and the rearguard position captured at 11 : 00 . Most of the garrison had already retreated from <unk> when the 1 / 1st Worcestershire Yeomanry , the Corps Cavalry Regiment , galloped in and captured several hundred prisoners . 
 The Worcester Yeomanry continued their advance north east of Nablus to Askar where they were stalled by machine gun fire . The 31st Brigade advanced to the hills south of Nablus , while the 29th and 30th Brigades went on to Balata where they captured some prisoners , but by this time , fighting had already ceased and the Seventh Army was in full retreat . 
 Meanwhile , at Tabsor the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division ( XXI Corps ) continued a flanking advance to reach Rafidia at 05 : 00 , 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) west of Nablus on 21 September where they occupied a 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) long line , which stretched to 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of Burqa .

 After cutting the railway north of Nablus , the 5th Light Horse Brigade ( attached to the 60th Division ) camped near Tulkarm for the night of 20 September . The brigade , consisting of the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments and the Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie , was ordered to assist in the capture of Nablus on the morning of 21 September . To reach Nablus , they had to negotiate around and through the wreckage caused by aerial bombing on the road from Tulkarm to Nablus . ( See Battle of Sharon ( 1918 ) and Battle of Tabsor ( 1918 ) for movements of this light horse brigade . ) 
 Dead men and animals , torn about with ruthless bombs , swollen and distorted , stank fearfully . Many of the animals still lived in speechless agony , and some of the wretched wounded were in many cases pinned down by carrion , but there was no time to stop and help them . That was for others who came behind . War is hell , and looks well only in a picture show . 
 The 5th Light Horse Brigade with the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery , had advanced quickly along the Tulkarm @-@ to @-@ Nablus road to attack the last resistance outside Nablus and capture the town , between 800 and 900 prisoners and two field guns . The Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie , with two armoured cars , entered Nablus while the 14th Light Horse Regiment linked with the 29th and 30th Brigades ( 10th Division , XX Corps ) at Balata . 
 " [ T ] he 10th Division reached Nablus by noon , where they were met by the Fifth Australian Light Horse Brigade which had entered the town from the west at about the same time . " The light horse rode through the streets of Nablus ( the ancient Shechem ) and camped on the plain beyond the town , where they received orders to rejoin the Australian Mounted Division at Jenin . 
 <unk> , Nablus fell to the French regiment , to the usual demonstrations of allegiance to the conquerors – of whatever side . The Turkish troops had abandoned it for the surrounding country and the civic leaders formally surrendered to Onslow . The 5th then collected about 900 of the former garrison in the hinterland . 
 Before advancing on Nablus and Balata , the 10th Division fought and marched for two days through the hills and gulleys of Mount Ephraim , suffering about 800 casualties but capturing 1 @,@ 223 prisoners .

 The 53rd Division maintained pressure during the day in an attempt to capture the high ground north and north east of Nablus to seal the lines of retreat to the Jordan River crossing at Jisr ed Damieh .

 By early afternoon of 21 September , organised Yildirim Army Group resistance in the Judean Hills had ceased , most of the Ottoman Eighth Army had surrendered while the Seventh Army was retreating east down the Wadi el Fara road hoping to cross the Jordan River by the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh .

 Liman von Sanders had no units available to stop the cavalry advance up the coast and across the Esdrealon Plain , Allenby 's attack having forced the Yildirim Army Group to retreat . In the early hours of 20 September , Liman fled from Nazareth to Damascus , via Tiberias , Samakh to Deraa . When he arrived in Deraa on the morning of 21 September he ordered the Fourth Army to withdraw to the Deraa @-@ to @-@ Irbid line without waiting for the southern Hedjaz troops .

 During the night of 20 / 21 September , the 16th and the 19th Divisions marched to the west of Nablus , under Liman von Sanders orders , where they linked up with von Oppen 's Asia Corps . The next morning , von Oppen reorganised the Asia Corps by amalgamating the remnants of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions into one , with a rifle company , a machine gun company and a trench mortar detachment , while the 701st Battalion with its machine gun company , six guns , a troop of cavalry , an infantry @-@ artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron , remained intact . 
 At 10 : 00 , von Oppen was informed that the EEF was approaching Nablus and the Wadi el Fara road was blocked . Consequently , he decided to retreat via Beit Dejan 7 miles ( 11 km ) east south east of Nablus and cross the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh , but this route was cut shortly afterwards . Von Oppen then ordered a retreat without guns or baggage via Mount Ebal during 21 September , which was largely successful although they suffered some casualties when fired on by British Empire <unk> von Oppen bivouaced at Tammun , with the 16th and the 19th Divisions at Tubas , unaware that Desert Mounted Corps had already occupied Beisan . 
 On 22 September , with about 700 German and 1 @,@ 300 Ottoman soldiers of the 16th and 19th Divisions , von Oppen was moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan when he learned it had already been captured . He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action ; however , Jevad , the commander of the Eighth Army , ordered him to cross the Jordan instead . Von Oppen successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River , before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked , capturing those who failed to cross the river .

 The Seventh Army retreated down the Wadi el Fara road towards the Jordan River abandoning its guns and transports . This large column of Ottoman soldiers was seen about 8 miles ( 13 km ) north of Nablus moving down the road towards Beisan and was heavily bombed and machine gunned by British and Australian aircraft . When the defile became blocked , the Ottoman forces were subjected to four hours of sustained attack , which destroyed at least 90 guns , 50 motor lorries and more than 1 @,@ 000 other vehicles . The remnants of the Army then turned north at ' Ain Shible , still moving towards Beisan , except for the Ottoman 53rd Division which managed to escape before the defile was blocked but were later captured by Chaytor 's Force in the Jordan Valley on 22 September . On 23 and 24 September , 1 @,@ 500 prisoners were captured by Chetwode 's XX Corps in the Judean Hills .

 On 21 September , the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment advanced on the western bank of the Jordan River to capture Kh . Fasail on the road to Jisr ed Damieh . An Ottoman defensive line covering the Jisr ed Damieh bridge , was subsequently discovered and the Seventh Army was seen moving along the Wadi el Fara towards Jisr ed Damieh . At 23 : 30 , Meldrum 's force of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , mobile detachments of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the British West Indies Regiment , the 29th Indian Mountain Battery and Ayrshire ( or Inverness ) Battery RHA , arrived at Kh . Fusail . Early in the morning of 22 September , Meldrum 's force captured the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh and the fords at Umm esh Shert and Mafid Jozele , cutting that line of retreat . 
 The Fourth Ottoman Army began to retreat towards Deraa during the night of 22 September , while Chaytor 's Force was advancing towards Es Salt . The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade advanced up the Jisr ed Damieh track , the 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced up the Umm esh Shert track and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved round the southern flank of the Shunet Nimrin position , which had been evacuated . The three brigades converging on Es Salt , which was occupied during the evening of 23 September . The next day , Chaytor 's Force began their advance from Es Salt to attack Amman , which was captured on 25 September . The Southern Hedjaz II Corps of the Fourth Army was captured near Ziza on 29 September 1918 .

 The Royal Air Force provided Allenby with timely aerial reconnaissance reports , and its attacks with bombs and machine guns spread " destruction , death , and terror behind the enemy 's lines . All the nerve @-@ centres had been paralysed by constant bombing . " 
 On 18 September the Royal Air Force 's 5th ( Corps ) Wing headquartered at Ramle was deployed to provide support with No. 14 Squadron attached to the XX Corps stationed at Junction Station and one flight of No. 142 Squadron being attached to Chaytor 's Force operating from Jerusalem . These aircraft were responsible for cooperation with artillery , contact patrols and tactical reconnaissance up to 10 @,@ 000 yards in advance of XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force . 
 One of the seven squadrons of the Palestine Brigade RAF , the Australian squadron had been allotted the Handley @-@ Page bomber three weeks before the offensive began . This squadron carried out bombing , offensive patrols and strategic reconnaissances , while the Handley – Page bomber piloted by Ross Smith bombed the central telephone exchange at Afulah , before the artillery bombardment signalled the beginning of battle . 
 Although aircraft flying over the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road , the Jisr ed Damieh bridge , Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas , reported all quiet at dawn on the morning of 20 September , RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus , blocking the road , causing many horses to bolt over a precipice on one side of the road while men scattered into the hills on the other side . The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed , three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps , while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan . 
 Dawn aerial scouting on 21 September returned reports of the previous day 's attacks on roads leading towards the Jordan River , which was only a precursor to the follow up attacks that day . From midday on 22 September , and in particular from 15 : 00 to 18 : 00 , aerial reconnaissance found Ottoman troops at Es Salt and in the surrounding areas withdrawing towards Amman . 
 On 23 September , the first bombing formation attacked , expending large amounts of munitions on the retreating columns on the Es Salt to Amman road , returning about 07 : 00 when a rout resulted . Amman was attacked from the air during the day and retreating columns from Amman and another column moving from Es Salt to Amman were attacked . An Australian aircraft saw columns retreating from Deraa and Samakh , where trains appeared ready to leave for Damascus . By the afternoon of 24 September , virtually all the area west of Amman was clear of Ottoman soldiers but on 25 September a column moving from Amman was seen at Mafrak . The column was attacked between 6 : 00 and 08 : 00 by ten Australian aircraft , with attacks continuing throughout the day expending four tons of bombs and almost 20 @,@ 000 machine gun rounds .

 SM UB @-@ 9 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. UB @-@ 9 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November . UB @-@ 9 was a little under 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 141 tonnes ( 125 and 139 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . She was launched and commissioned as SM UB @-@ 9 in February 1915 . 
 UB @-@ 9 's commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week . Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war , so it 's not clear if the submarine remained in commission . UB @-@ 9 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915 . The U @-@ boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war , which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role . At the end of the war , UB @-@ 9 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany 's U @-@ boat fleet . She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Dräger at Lübeck in 1919 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . 
 UB @-@ 9 was the first of the initial allotment of seven submarines — numbered up to UB @-@ 15 — ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . UB @-@ 9 was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 6 November . As built , UB @-@ 9 was 27 @.@ 88 metres ( 91 ft 6 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) .

At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 9 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 9 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck .

 = George Meyer = 
 George A. Meyer ( born 1956 ) is an American producer and writer . Meyer is best known for his work on The Simpsons , where he led the group script rewrite sessions . He has been publicly credited with " thoroughly shap [ ing ] ... the comedic sensibility " of the show . 
 Raised in Tucson , Meyer attended Harvard University . There , after becoming president of the Harvard Lampoon , he graduated in 1978 with a degree in biochemistry . Abandoning plans to attend medical school , Meyer attempted to make money through dog racing but failed after two months . After a series of short @-@ term jobs he was hired in 1981 by David Letterman , on the advice of two of Meyer 's Harvard Lampoon <unk> , to join the writing team of his show Late Night with David Letterman . 
 Meyer left after two seasons and went on to write for The New Show , Not Necessarily the News and Saturday Night Live . Tired of life in New York , Meyer moved to Boulder , Colorado where he wrote a screenplay for a film for Letterman to star in . The project fell through and Meyer then founded the humor zine Army Man which garnered a strong following , although Meyer ended it after three issues . The producer Sam Simon was a fan and he hired Meyer to write for the animated sitcom The Simpsons in 1989 . He has held a number of positions on the show and also cowrote The Simpsons Movie . Meyer is in a relationship with the writer Maria Semple and the two have a daughter . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in Pennsylvania , United States in 1956 , Meyer grew up in Tucson , Arizona . He is the eldest of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of German ancestry . His parents both worked in the real estate business . Meyer has made jokes about his somewhat unhappy childhood , stating that one common argument in his household was " which family member ruined a holiday " , while his sister noted Meyer was frequently blamed for the family 's problems . Due to its size , family activities were limited so Meyer watched lots of television and read Mad magazine . He was an Eagle Scout and an altar boy and wrote for the student newspaper . He grew up hoping to one day become either a priest or ballplayer . He was disinterested in television , only finding humor in Get Smart and Batman , where he appreciated its " loopy , irreverent humor . " 
 Meyer attended Harvard University where he served as president of the Harvard Lampoon . The fact that people took humor " very seriously " at the Lampoon " changed [ Meyer 's ] life " . In 1977 , he and several other Lampoon staffers wrote The Harvard Lampoon Big Book of College Life ( ISBN <unk> ) , a volume commissioned by Doubleday . Aside from the Lampoon , his grades at Harvard were average and he suffered several bouts of depression . He graduated in 1978 with a degree in biochemistry and was accepted into medical school , but decided not to enroll . 
 Meyer commented on his Roman Catholic upbringing in a 2000 New Yorker profile : 
 " People talk about how horrible it is to be brought up Catholic , and it 's all true . The main thing was that there was no sense of proportion . I would chew a piece of gum at school , and the nun would say , ' Jesus is very angry with you about that , ' and on the wall behind her would be a dying , bleeding guy on a cross . That 's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid . You really could almost think that your talking in line , say , was on a par with killing Jesus . " 
 = = Career = = 
 After college , Meyer moved to Denver , Colorado , planning to " scientifically " win a fortune through dog racing . However , he ran out of money after two weeks . He then worked in a variety of jobs including as a substitute teacher , and a salesman in a clothing store , and also won $ 2 @,@ 000 on the game show Jeopardy ! . He at one point worked in a research lab as an assistant , studying glycoproteins " in the hope that they would prove the key to cell @-@ cell recognition . " Meanwhile , fellow Lampoon writers Tom Gammill and Max Pross suggested Meyer to comedian David Letterman who , along with head writer Merrill <unk> , hired him as a member of the writing staff on Letterman 's new late night show . Letterman noted : " Everything in his submission , down to the last little detail , was so beautifully honed . " Meyer wrote several recurring gags for the show , including " Crushing Things With A Steamroller " . His ambitions for the show were grandiose ; " I wanted to challenge the audience every night , stagger them with brilliance , blast them into a higher plane of existence , " he later explained . 
 Meyer left to write for The New Show in late 1983 , a short @-@ lived variety series from Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels . He shared an office with writer Jack <unk> , who he credited with giving him comedy advice . Following this , he joined the writing teams at Not Necessarily the News , and Saturday Night Live beginning in 1985 . He later called working on SNL an " exhilarating , frustrating , stressful , and indelible experience . " Meyer 's work was not well regarded among the SNL writers and producers . He said : " My stuff wasn 't very popular at Saturday Night . It was regarded as really <unk> , and a lot of times my sketches would get cut . Sometimes they would get cut after dress rehearsal , and I would have the horrible experience of looking out and seeing a painter carefully touching up my set and getting it all ready to be smashed to pieces and sent to a landfill in Brooklyn . It was just a mismatch , although I didn 't realize it at the time . " He left the show in 1987 . 
 Meyer moved to Boulder , Colorado because he " just wanted to get as far from the New York environment as [ he ] could . " There , he wrote a film script for Letterman ; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman 's show , although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found . He spent time " skiing , going to poetry readings , and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado . " He founded the humor zine Army Man ; he wrote the eight @-@ page first issue almost wholly by himself , publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends . Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny . By starting Army Man he " tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh . " He claimed that " [ he ] didn 't know what [ he ] was doing , " and reprinted material without obtaining permission , including a review of Cannonball Run II . He added : " I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible , lawbreaking zine . " Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stone 's " Hot List " in 1989 . Meyer noted : " The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short . To me , the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder 's : ' They can kill the Kennedys . Why can 't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good ? ' It 's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal @-@ and yet there 's a kind of logic to it . It 's illuminating because it 's kind of how Americans see things : Life 's a big jumble , but somehow it leads to something I can consume . I love that . " Meyer suspended publication with the third issue , after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities . According to The Believer : " In comedy circles , [ Army Man has ] taken on almost mythological proportions . " This was met with varying reactions from Meyer , who felt " embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy . It was just a silly little escapade , never meant to be enshrined . " 
 One reader was Sam Simon , a producer of the animated sitcom The Simpsons . He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded the development of the series . Meyer turned down the job initially , but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989 , which he accepted . Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti . Meyer often played an active role in the show 's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the " rewrite room " a role he performed more than solo script work ; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes . A. O. Scott described him as the " guru " of the room . In the room , according to Mike Reiss , writers would " involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own " . By 1995 , Meyer became tired of the show 's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script . He soon returned , however , as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer . In 2004 he noted : " It 's hard to leave The Simpsons . Every once in a while I get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean . Something like Army Man , or maybe guerrilla filmmaking . " He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up . He left the show in 2006 , and received his final credits in season 17 . Meyer returned to co @-@ write the 2007 film adaptation of the show , The Simpsons Movie , which he later had mixed feelings about : " We worked so hard , and people liked it , but it still feels slapdash to me . ” 
 Meyer has been publicly credited with " thoroughly shap [ ing ] ... the comedic sensibility " of The Simpsons ; in 2000 , Mike Scully , the show runner for the series at the time , called him " the best comedy writer in Hollywood . " Scully said he was " the main reason " why The Simpsons [ was ] still so good after all these years . " Vitti has said Meyer 's " fingerprints are on nearly every script " and he " exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without being one of the creators , " while recounting how " a show that you have the writer 's credit for will run , and the next day people will come up to you and tell you how great it was . Then they 'll mention their two favorite lines , and both of them will be George 's . " Bill Oakley noted Meyer has " he 's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists , etc . , that everyone considers classic and brilliant . 
 Meyer has a " deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general , " which has affected the writing of his own episodes of The Simpsons such as " Homer the Heretic " , " Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington " and " Bart vs. Thanksgiving " . For his work on The Simpsons , Saturday Night Live and Late Night with David Letterman , Meyer has won and received multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations , including the award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety Or Music Program in 1989 . 
 In addition to his work on The Simpsons , Meyer wrote , directed , and starred in his own play , Up Your <unk> , which ran for two weeks at a West Hollywood theater in 2002 . In 2005 , Meyer cowrote the TBS special Earth to America . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Meyer is in a relationship with the writer Maria Semple . They lived together during the 1990s and broke up in 1999 , but later got back together . Their child , named Poppy Valentina after Valentina Tereshkova , was born in 2003 ; being a father gave Meyer a " sense of hopefulness " . They live in Seattle . Although raised a Catholic , Meyer hated it and later became agnostic . While working at The Simpsons he became an atheist , taking the advice of fellow writer Mike Reiss . He is a vegetarian , gambler , collector of space program memorabilia and practices yoga . Meyer is a fan of the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia being the " closest thing in Meyer 's life to a spiritual figure . " His sister Ann is married to Jon Vitti . 
 Meyer has a strong interest in the environment and notes that " the only organization that I really care about these days " is Conservation International . In 2005 , a newly discovered species of moss frogs from Sri Lanka was named Philautus <unk> after Meyer 's daughter Poppy , a tribute to Meyer 's and Semple 's dedication to the Global Amphibian Assessment . 
 In 2006 he wrote a comic , cautionary opinion piece about the environment for BBC News . It begins : 
 " Are you a hypocrite ? Because I certainly am . I 'm an animal lover who wears leather shoes ; a vegetarian who can 't resist smoked salmon . I badger my friends to see the Al Gore movie , but I also fly on fuel @-@ gulping jets . Great clouds of hypocrisy swirl around me . But even a fraud has feelings . And this summer , I 'm feeling uneasy ; I 'm starting to think that our culture 's frenzied and mindless assault on the last shreds of nature may not be the wisest course . "

 An antimetric electrical network is an electrical network that exhibits anti @-@ symmetrical electrical properties . The term is often encountered in filter theory , but it applies to general electrical network analysis . <unk> is the <unk> opposite of symmetric ; it does not merely mean " asymmetric " ( i.e. , " lacking symmetry " ) . It is possible for networks to be symmetric or antimetric in their electrical properties without being physically or topologically symmetric or antimetric . 
 = = Definition = = 
 References to symmetry and antimetry of a network usually refer to the input impedances of a two @-@ port network when correctly terminated . A symmetric network will have two equal input impedances , <unk> and <unk> . For an antimetric network , the two impedances must be the dual of each other with respect to some nominal impedance R0 . That is , 
 <formula> 
 or equivalently 
 <formula> 
 It is necessary for antimetry that the terminating impedances are also the dual of each other , but in many practical cases the two terminating impedances are resistors and are both equal to the nominal impedance R0 . Hence , they are both symmetric and antimetric at the same time . 
 = = Physical and electrical antimetry = = 
 Symmetric and antimetric networks are often also topologically symmetric and antimetric , respectively . The physical arrangement of their components and values are symmetric or antimetric as in the ladder example above . However , it is not a necessary condition for electrical antimetry . For example , if the example networks of figure 1 have an additional identical T @-@ section added to the left @-@ hand side as shown in figure 2 , then the networks remain topologically symmetric and antimetric . However , the network resulting from the application of Bartlett 's bisection theorem applied to the first T @-@ section in each network , as shown in figure 3 , are neither physically symmetric nor antimetric but retain their electrical symmetric ( in the first case ) and antimetric ( in the second case ) properties . 
 = = Two @-@ port parameters = = 
 The conditions for symmetry and antimetry can be stated in terms of two @-@ port parameters . For a two @-@ port network described by impedance parameters ( z @-@ parameters ) , 
 <formula> 
 if the network is symmetric , and 
 <formula> 
 if the network is antimetric . Passive networks of the kind illustrated in this article are also reciprocal , which requires that 
 <formula>

 = Wormshill = 
 Wormshill ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ HILL ) , historically Wormsell , is a small village and civil parish within the Borough of Maidstone , Kent , England . The parish is approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of the Swale and 8 miles ( 13 km ) east of Maidstone . The village of Frinsted lies 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 km ) to the east and Bicknor 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the north @-@ west ; while Hollingbourne is 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the south @-@ west . The village lies on an exposed high point of the North Downs , within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . 
 Archaeological and toponymic evidence of Wormshill 's existence predates its appearance in the Domesday survey of 1086 . The village contains a number of heritage @-@ listed buildings , which include a Norman church , a public house and one of the oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom . The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed little in the past 500 years , and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average . The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns .

 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Wormshill was listed under the name <unk> in the Domesday Book of 1086 . The village is thought to be much older , its name deriving from the Anglo @-@ Saxon god Wōden ( a cognate with the Norse god , Odin ) and meaning " Woden 's Hill " . The area was also described in a paper in Archaeologia Cantiana , 1961 , as " Wormshill , an ancient possession of the Kings of Kent , the hill where they worshipped the heathen Woden " . The University of Nottingham 's Institute for Name @-@ Studies has offered the suggestion that the name means " shelter for a herd of pigs " . 
 The Latinised form , <unk> , appears in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274 – 75 and in a mediaeval will recorded in September 1409 . A corruption of the name , Wormsell , is mentioned as the birthplace of a Cistercian Abbot at the nearby Boxley Abbey in 1474 ; a further variant , <unk> , is found in a will of 1487 , and court papers concerning a land dispute in 1534 use the name <unk> . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 A 1994 landscape survey identified woodland to the north of the village as having contained ancient flint tools and what appeared to be flint boundary markers , the latter apparently gathered from loose @-@ lying surface flints . The area around the village features ancient <unk> , or agricultural chalk mines , some of which are pre @-@ Roman . These holes , which may be up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) deep , were often dug at the edges of fields , onto which the chalk marl would be spread . A Lower Palaeolithic ( <unk> ) hand axe was unearthed in the garden of Blacksmiths cottage in the village . In 1966 , the remains of a U @-@ shaped mediaeval pastoral enclosure for controlling the movement of stock were recorded in woodland to the north of the village . The extensive woodland in the parish also meant that it was one of several sources of wooden planking for the piers of Rochester Bridge ( 16 miles ( 26 km ) away ) from the early 11th century ( and theoretically was still liable to do so until the passing of the Rochester Bridge Act in 1908 ) . 
 The parish of Wormshill was originally appended to the village and parish of Boughton Malherbe , since both had the same patron ; the patron of a parish was the land @-@ owner who often built the church on the estate and who had the right ( known as advowson ) to appoint the parish priest . The first recorded patron of Wormshill was Robert de Gatton , who owned the Manor of Wormsell during the reign of Henry III ( 1207 – 72 ) . From the Gatton family , the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood , whose family crest appears in the stained glass of St Giles , the village 's only church , and whose name ( Norwood ) is given to the farm at the north of the village . 
 Patronage of the parish subsequently transferred through a number of landholding families , vesting by the 17th century with the prominent Kent family of Sir Charles Sedley , which at times held the barony of Aylesford . During this period the Tylden ( or Tilden ) family , believed to have had links to the Crusades of Richard I , were also significant landholders in the area in the early 17th century ; a memorial to William Tylden , who died in 1613 , rests in the north chancel of St Giles church . Around the same time in the late 16th century , recruits of Sir Francis Drake 's navy may have used a track , now known as Drake Lane , in the south west of the parish or camped nearby as they marched from the Weald of Kent to the dockyards at Sheerness . 
 Patronage is believed to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the Archbishop of Canterbury and then to Sir Joseph <unk> before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the charity of the president and governors of Christ 's Hospital in London in gratitude for a University of Cambridge scholarship he had received . As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle @-@ guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron ; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle . 
 Little ( if any ) information exists about the village 's population or demographics before 1801 ; however evidence from the first census indicates that the village grew steadily , reaching a peak in 1871 . A possible indication of the growth in the agricultural output of the village is the construction of two windmills ( possibly used for the production of oil from linseed or rapeseed ) marked at " Beddington " ( present @-@ day <unk> ) on Ordnance Survey drawings dated 1797 and an Ordnance Survey map published between 1819 and 1843 . The mills stood north and south of each other and were approximately 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 800 m ) to the north @-@ west of the church . House building continued during the mid @-@ to @-@ late 19th century , together with a post office and school . Like much of rural Kent during the time of the Swing Riots ( 1830 ) , Wormshill experienced a degree of civil unrest and Home Office records indicate that " a large body of men , numbering 50 @-@ 100 " assembled at Wormshill with the purpose of " intimidation and to enforce demands on farmers ... inducing other labourers to join them " . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Records indicate that at least one former resident of the village fought as part of the Australian contingent in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War . Private Frederick George Kite , born at Wormshill on 16 February 1894 , and educated at Wormshill and Milstead , enlisted on 8 September 1915 . Originally employed as a fireman , after training at Blackboy and Broadmeadows camps in Victoria , he sailed from Melbourne as part of the Australian Imperial Force , 16th Infantry Battalion aboard HMAT Ceramic A40 on 23 December 1914 . He participated in the landing at Gallipoli and was wounded in the left arm and shoulder , ending his active service . 
 During the Second World War , Wormshill joined a number of similar settlements in the region to form part of the anti @-@ invasion network . On the outskirts of the village , near the hamlet of Ringlestone , there are the remains of a zero station ( or Operational Base ) , a secret underground communications relay post operated by Auxiliary Units of the British Home Guard . In the event of a German invasion the zero station was to be used by defending forces to receive and transmit coded messages between a series of similar stations in the area as well as to the operational command headquarters at Hannington Hall in Wiltshire . A concealed underground concrete bunker , it was designed to be invisible from the surface and is located in woodland about 140 metres ( 150 yd ) from the road . Although its primary purpose was a communications post , the zero station was also designed to hold ammunition and explosives and provide living quarters for the radio equipment operators . Anecdotal evidence also indicates that anti @-@ aircraft guns were sited near the village and that a Bren gun emplacement was installed in the valley between Wormshill and Frinsted . A Diver Battery was located to the south west of the village . Forming part of the Kentish Gun Belt , designed to provide a defence to attacks by V @-@ 1 flying bombs or " <unk> " , it was armed with eight mobile 3 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns , and manned by 424 Battery of 138 Regiment of the 40th Anti Aircraft Brigade . It was initially equipped with Predictor AA No.10 and No.3 Mark V radar , and was manned by 57 Brigade in July 1944 . There are records of a V @-@ 1 being shot down by a Supermarine Spitfire to the west of the village . Flt Lt A. R. Cruikshank is reported as having " Sited a Diver north of Ashford and attacked from astern at 100 yards range . Saw strikes and Diver fell and exploded in a field " . Villagers resident during the war also recall a V @-@ 1 being shot down in orchards near Norwood Farm and a fighter aircraft crashing in fields to the south of Yew Tree Farm . Roadside checkpoints were set up on the main routes into the village to the north and south and allied forces moving through the region camped overnight in the area , including a detachment of New Zealand troops in fields near Home Farm . 
 Following an initial decline in the population at the turn of the 20th century , more houses were constructed between the Great War and the Second World War and again in the 1950s and 1960s , adding to the cluster of cottages from the 19th century and earlier . 
 = = Governance = = 
 At the time of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275 , Wormshill was in the Hundred of <unk> , a regional sub @-@ division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities . Although the Hundred of <unk> ( including Wormshill ) still exists , it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance . In the 19th century , the village was within the lathe of Aylesford , the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District . The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union ( a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area ) . The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide , a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary for the purposes of the law courts ' Quarter Sessions . According to Edward Hasted ( writing in 1798 ) : " northward of the church , including the borough of <unk> , is in the division of East Kent , but the rest of it , including the church and village , is in that of West Kent " . This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men , which are separated by the River Medway , accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent . 
 Since 1975 , Wormshill has been administered within the North Downs ward and , together with surrounding communities , elects a representative councillor for the ward in the Borough of Maidstone . The incumbent councillor for the North Downs ward is Daphne Parvin . The village forms the central focus of the civil and church parishes of Wormshill . The parish chairman is Simon Bass . Wormshill is part of the parliamentary constituency of Faversham and Mid Kent , whose Member of Parliament is Hugh Robertson of the Conservative Party . It is also in the South East England constituency in the European Parliament . 
 = = Geography = = 
 At 51 ° 17 ′ 4 @.@ 2 ″ N 0 ° 41 ′ 44 @.@ 2 ″ E , the village is in central Kent , approximately 38 miles ( 61 km ) south @-@ east of London . The nearest town is Sittingbourne , 4 miles ( 6 km ) to the north . Wormshill is surrounded by villages and hamlets of a similar size , including Frinsted , Bicknor , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The village is on a high point of the North Downs . The nearby road intersection of Black Post is recorded on the Ordnance Survey maps at 191 metres ( 627 ft ) above sea level . The landscape is primarily characterised by undulating calcareous grassland and ancient deciduous woodland over chalk downland . The settlement itself ( as opposed to the wider parish ) is on a downland ridge between two shallow dip slope valleys that separate it from Bicknor to the north @-@ west and Frinsted to the east . 
 Wormshill 's elevated and exposed position on the North Downs means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 11 – 14 January 1987 , March 2005 , February 2009 and January 2010 . In the late 18th century Hasted commented : " Being exposed to the northern aspect , it lies very bleak and cold . " 
 Much of the local woodland was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987 , which in October swept across south @-@ east England with hurricane @-@ force winds . A significant part of the exposed woodland to the north @-@ east of Wormshill was felled and , after replanting , has only recently shown signs of maturing . An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long @-@ standing trees . However , some 25 years later , the village displays few obvious signs of the damage . 
 The countryside around the village has been described as " an area where the whole landscape is a piece of history — a valley where time has stood still and the pattern of woods and fields is much as it was 500 years ago " . A designated ancient woodland lies to the north @-@ west of the village . Predominantly centred on Barrows Wood but also including High Wood and Trundle Wood , this is likely a remnant of the woodland described by Hasted : " ... at the northern boundary of the parish there is a considerable quantity of wood , consisting mostly of hazel and oak , with numbers of trees of the latter , interspersed among them , which are but small , never here growing to any size . " An ancient track that passes through the remnants of this woodland has been damaged by the use of off @-@ road vehicles leading to attempts by local landowners to block Drake Lane , a byway that runs through Drake Lane Wood in the south @-@ west of the parish and which may have been used by recruits of Sir Francis Drake 's navy . Deep water @-@ logged ruts in the track have resulted in the partial resurfacing of the route . 
 The village stretches primarily along a single carriageway road known as The Street . The north @-@ eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area . The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest , which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing . All development is subject to a high level of scrutiny ; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted , and large @-@ scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment . The last major development was that of the residential cul @-@ de @-@ sac <unk> . 
 = = Demography = = 
 The record in the Domesday Book does not give the population in 1086 , though several people are named . By the late 19th century the village and parish were described as : 
 <unk> , a parish in <unk> [ sic ] district , Kent ; 5 miles S by W of Sittingbourne r. station . It has a post @-@ office under Sittingbourne . Acres , 1 @,@ 467 . Real property , £ 1 @,@ 295 . Pop . , 253 . Houses , 46 . The property is divided among a few . The living is a rectory in the diocese of Canterbury . Value , £ 260 . * Patron , Christ 's Hospital , London . The church is plain . Charities , £ 12 . 
 Wormshill 's location remains rural . Because of geography and restrictions on development , building in the village has been scant since the 1960s and 1970s . In 1821 , the parish contained only 26 dwellings : by 2001 , the total number of houses had risen to 82 . 
 The rural nature of the area is indicated by a population density of approximately 0 @.@ 4 persons per hectare ( 1 person for every 6 @.@ 9 acres ) , compared to the average for the south @-@ east of England of 4 @.@ 2 persons per hectare ( 1 person for every 0 @.@ 6 acres ) . 
 The village has been recorded as a distinct parish unit for the purpose of census statistics since the first United Kingdom census in 1801 . The majority of the official population of 198 ( per United Kingdom Census 2001 ) is aged 45 or over and lives in homes comprising married family units . The total population has increased by around 40 people since 1801 however , during the past 200 years , it has fluctuated more widely within that range . In 1801 the population was 157 before peaking at 253 in 1861 . In 1901 census records indicate a parish population of either 163 or 169 . 
 Data for the ethnicity of the wider Maidstone area show that the population is around 97 percent white and that the remainder is of mixed , black , and Asian descent . Specific figures for Wormshill held by Kent County Council indicated in 2001 that all the villagers were of white ethnicity . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Wormshill includes two farms : Yew Tree Farm ( dairy farming ) at the south end of the village , and Norwood Farm ( fruit and other crops ) at the north end . A third farm , Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village . This farm is no longer in use , but some outbuildings remain . Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith 's shop , which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898 . According to the 1831 Census , 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector . Census records from the mid @-@ to @-@ late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes , representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years ; however , the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as " labourers and servants " . The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity . Although the farms continue to employ from the village , as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village , with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London . The socio @-@ economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were " lower managerial and professional occupations " ( 21 @.@ 9 percent ) and " small employers and own account workers " ( 15 @.@ 2 percent ) .

 Until the end of the 20th century , the village had a post office and general stores along with a public house , The Blacksmiths Arms , a Grade II listed building , in part of 17th century origin . 
 The original post office opened in 1847 and was run by church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory . The building , which now forms part of a Grade II * listed private dwelling , is thought to be the second @-@ oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847 . The post office briefly moved to another location in The Street under the stewardship of local schoolmistress Fanny Harris ( who operated the service from 1926 ) ; however , it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub @-@ postmistress Irene <unk> and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976 . Fanny Harris ( then 92 years old and the village 's oldest inhabitant ) and Robin Leigh @-@ Pemberton were passengers on the first postbus service on 4 March 1974 . A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20 years until it was closed in the 1990s . Today , the village retains only the Blacksmiths Arms and a traditional red post box . 
 In the 19th century , an additional public house existed at the northern edge of the village near Norwood Farm and was known as The Woodman 's Arms ( and possibly also as The Norwood Arms ) . The pub was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps of the village between 1870 and 1946 , but as of May 2012 , the building is a Grade II listed private dwelling . Other listed buildings in the village include the timber @-@ framed houses Norwood Manor and Blacksmiths Cottage . A large country house now known as Wormshill Court and bordered to the north and east by a brick wall includes the outbuildings of Manor Farm . The property is part of a large estate which has for several generations belonged to the Nightingale family . The house and farm is also shown on a map of 1636 and at that time appears to represent the only building in the village other than the church and the rectory . In 1858 a further map of the manor named the property Court Lodge Farm and included an inset plan showing the exchange of land between the governors of Christ 's Hospital and a Mr. Henry Hudson . 
 Wormshill retained its own telephone exchange until the 1990s , when it became part of the Maidstone exchange . A red telephone box remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the telephony was disconnected ( and the box sealed ) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use . An informal village <unk> is on the side of an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former Home Farm . The post box and telephone box are at the same location . The telephone box is a listed building . 
 The Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway attracts tourists and railway enthusiasts throughout the summer season . The railway is a narrow gauge light railway run between two small stations on about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) of track built in woodland between Bredgar and Wormshill . 
 = = Transport = = 
 A number of ancient trackways including the Pilgrims ' Way and the North Downs Way ( now designated as footpaths or byways ) pass within a few miles of the village . Wormshill is not on any major roadways and has no rail service . No standard public transport facilities or taxicab operations exist in the village . A daily <unk> service , incorporated into the village postal delivery and collection timetable and which ran for 35 years , stopped on 14 November 2009 . It was one of the last remaining postbus services in the United Kingdom . The service , run by the Royal Mail and subsidised by the county council , began in March 1974 and collected residents from Wormshill and other villages en route to Sittingbourne . The closure of the only means of public transport to and from the village was controversial and , following a campaign by local councillors and journalists , the postbus was replaced by a temporary minibus service , funded by the county council . Royal Mail postal deliveries continue to be made to the village . The village lies between the M2 and M20 motorways , and the nearest railway station is at Harrietsham on the Maidstone Line , 3 @.@ 8 miles ( 6 km ) to the south by road . 
 = = Education = = 
 A small one @-@ roomed National school ( a school established by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education ) was built in the village in 1872 for about 30 children . However some evidence exists that it had " accommodation for forty @-@ two children and an average attendance of twenty @-@ eight " . The school was recorded on maps of the village until 1909 , although it was dissolved in 1930 ( school mistresses Miss Fanny Harris and Miss Pepper later ran the post office and general store from an outhouse at Flint Cottage ) . The building that housed the school has since been converted to a private dwelling . The school 's small playground was lined by lime trees planted in memory of a general at the end of the Boer Wars . As of November 2011 the lime trees are still there . The nearest primary school to the village is the Milstead and Frinsted Church of England School at Milstead . Secondary school pupils are educated in the towns of Sittingbourne or Maidstone . 
 = = Religion = = 
 The church , parts of which date back to the Norman era , is dedicated to Saint Giles and forms part of the united benefice of Bredgar , Milstead , Bicknor and Frinsted . The ecclesiastical parish of Wormshill is in the Diocese of Canterbury and the Sittingbourne deanery ( within the archdeaconry of Maidstone ) . As of December 2008 , the vicar was the Reverend John Smith . In 1995 , the church received a new ring of six bells after a campaign by villagers begun in 1944 by Michael Nightingale of Cromarty , who at age 16 opened a savings account with 10 shillings for the restoration of the church 's bells . Fifty years later , he completed the full peal of six bells : one of the six was original , and the other five were rescued from abandoned churches . The last major renovations of the church occurred in 1789 and 1901 . Of note within the church are a Norman font and Tudor pulpit . The church also contains a 13th century chest , first discovered in the early 20th century . The former rectory is now a private dwelling .

 A vicar at the Rectory of Wormshill in the 19th century , Reverend Josiah <unk> , was the subject of a debate about exceptional human longevity ; it was claimed that he lived to age 107 . References to the rector 's memorial stone in the church ultimately provided evidence that his actual age of death was " either 91 or 93 " . Sir Henry Rew , a leading authority on agricultural economics , a former assistant secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food and president of the Royal Statistical Society ( 1920 – 1922 ) died at his home in the village on 7 April 1929 .

 The village holds typical English rural festivals during the year . The spring and harvest festivals are horticultural shows that include the surrounding villages . The country fair ( or fête ) in the summer previously included traditional country games , stalls and attractions such as hay bale throwing , tug of war and a coconut shy , although the village has not held a fête since 2009 . Wormshill contains a community village hall and recreation ground , including a small playground . The 9th Sittingbourne ( Tunstall and Wormshill ) Scout Group are associated with the village and group meetings are occasionally held at the village hall . Wormshill , together with the united benefice villages of Bredgar , Milstead , Bicknor and Frinsted , also produces a free monthly Parish Magazine including village news , announcements and occasional articles . In common with a number of rural communities in the county , Wormshill also receives a weekly mobile library service run by Kent County Council . 
 = Closing Time ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Closing Time " is the twelfth and penultimate episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , and was first broadcast on BBC One on 24 September 2011 . It was written by Gareth Roberts and directed by Steve Hughs . It is a sequel to " The Lodger " , an episode Roberts wrote for the previous series . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) is going on a " farewell tour " before his impending death and visits his friend Craig ( James Corden ) , who has a new baby son , Alfie . Though not initially intending to stay , the Doctor becomes intrigued by a Cybermen invasion at a local department store . 
 Roberts and showrunner Steven Moffat wanted to bring Craig back , having enjoyed " The Lodger " and Corden 's performance . Though " Closing Time " was designed to be fun , with comedy built around the double act of Smith and Corden , it contains themes and an epilogue that lead into the finale . The episode marks the first appearance of the Cybermats in the revival of Doctor Who , and they were appropriately redesigned . Much of the episode was filmed in a department store and a private home in Cardiff at night , with shooting going early into the morning . " Closing Time " was watched by 6 @.@ 93 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics ; while the performances , comedy , and emotional moments were praised , many critics were not pleased with the usage of the Cybermen .

 Nearly two hundred years have passed for the Doctor since he left Amy and Rory in " The God Complex " and he is on a farewell tour of his friends as he knows he has only one day to go before his death ( depicted in " The Impossible Astronaut " ) . He stops by Craig ( " The Lodger " ) , who is living with his girlfriend Sophie in a new home and is raising their baby , Alfie . Craig , struggling to care for Alfie alone while Sophie is away for the weekend , suspects the Doctor is investigating something alien . The Doctor prepares to leave , but he notices a strange electrical disturbance in the area and decides to investigate . 
 Craig , while at a new department store with Alfie , discovers the Doctor working in the toy area . The Doctor reveals that he has traced the electrical disturbances to the store and is using the job to allow him to investigate further , hearing rumours of the disappearance of several shop assistants and the sightings of a " silver rat " . The Doctor and Craig enter a lift and find themselves teleported to a Cyberman spacecraft . A Cyberman emerges from the darkness and comes towards them but the Doctor manages to reverse the teleporter and disable it . As Craig returns home , the Doctor sees Amy and Rory shopping but stays out of their sight . 
 With Craig 's help , the Doctor enters the store after hours and catches a Cybermat , which has been siphoning small amounts of energy to the spacecraft . The Doctor also encounters a malfunctioning Cyberman in the building 's basement , and is curious how it arrived in the store . At Craig 's house , while the two are distracted , the <unk> reactivates , but they are able to stop it , and the Doctor reprograms the unit to track down the Cybermen signal . 
 The Doctor leaves on his own to locate the Cybermen at the store but Craig shortly follows , bringing Alfie along . The Doctor finds the spaceship actually sits below the store , underground , accessed by a tunnel from a changing room . The ship has been slowly siphoning energy from the store 's power lines , reactivating its crew . The Doctor is captured by the Cybermen , who tell him that their ship crashed long ago but , with this new energy , will soon have enough power to convert the human race . 
 Craig , leaving Alfie with a store clerk , follows the Doctor into the tunnel , and is also captured and placed into a conversion machine . The Doctor reveals his own impending death and urges Craig to fight , but the conversion appears to be complete . Alfie 's cries over the closed @-@ circuit television echo in the ship . Craig , encouraged by the Doctor telling him that this is his chance to be a father , fights and reverses the conversion . The rest of the Cybermen painfully experience the emotions they have repressed from Craig 's struggle , and their circuits start to overload . The Doctor and Craig escape via the teleporter as the ship explodes , the blast contained by the cavern . Craig reunites with Alfie , while the Doctor slips away unseen . Craig returns home to find the Doctor already there , having used time travel to clean the house . The Doctor tells Craig that Alfie now has a much higher opinion of his dad . The Doctor leaves just before Sophie returns . 
 Nearby , the Doctor tells the TARDIS he knows this is his last trip in her and offers some parting words to a small group of children . In the far future , River Song , recently made a Doctor of Archaeology , reviews eyewitness accounts made by those children when they were adults , and also notes the date and location of the Doctor 's death . She is interrupted by Madame Kovarian and agents of the Silence . Kovarian tells River that she is still theirs , and will be the one to kill the Doctor . Against River 's will , they place her in an augmented astronaut 's suit and submerge her in Lake Silencio to await the Doctor .

 Two hundred years have passed for the Doctor since the events of " The God Complex " , taking him to the age his older self was in " The Impossible Astronaut " . He spent this time " waving through time " at Amy and Rory , which is seen at the beginning of " The Impossible Astronaut " . The Doctor takes the blue envelopes he uses to summon his companions from Craig 's flat and Craig gives him the Stetson he wears at the start of " The Impossible Astronaut " . From River Song 's perspective , the final scene takes place immediately before the picnic in " The Impossible Astronaut " , and she is confirmed to have been that episode 's eponymous astronaut . 
 Cybermats are shown for the first time in the revived series . In the classic series , they appeared in The Tomb of the Cybermen ( 1967 ) , The Wheel in Space ( 1968 ) , and Revenge of the Cybermen ( 1975 ) . The Doctor examines a toy and remarks , " Robot dog ; not as much fun as I remember , " alluding to K @-@ 9 , a robot dog who accompanied the Fourth Doctor . The Doctor claims to be able to " speak ' baby ' " , as he did in " A Good Man Goes to War " . The Doctor expresses his dislike for Craig 's " redecorated " house by using a line from the Second Doctor ( Patrick Troughton ) in The Three Doctors ( 1973 ) and The Five Doctors ( 1983 ) . The Doctor recites the mini @-@ poem " Not a rat , a <unk> " from the novelization of Revenge of the Cybermen . 
 Amy has become a minor celebrity , appearing in an ad for <unk> perfume , with the tagline , " For the girl who 's tired of waiting . " The concept of <unk> was used as a psychic password in " The Doctor 's Wife " and means " the smell of dust after rain " . The Doctor frequently refers to Amy as " the girl who waited " . The perfume and tagline imply that the episode takes place after " The God Complex " . This conflicts with the date on Craig 's newspaper , 19 April 2011 , which is three days before the Doctor 's death at Lake Silencio .

 Writer Gareth Roberts said in an interview that he was considering bringing the character of Craig back when he saw James Corden 's performance in " The Lodger " , saying that " it already felt like he was one of the Who family " . Showrunner Steven Moffat was pleased with " The Lodger " , an episode he called " quite close to my heart " , and wanted to bring Craig back . He commented that it was a change of pace for Corden , who usually was cast as " the funny one " ; as Craig he is " the straight man to the wacky Doctor " . Director Steve Hughs compared the Doctor and Craig to famous comedic duos such as Laurel and Hardy , Abbott and Costello , and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost . Though most of the episode is intended to be fun , it also sets the stage for the finale and the Doctor 's upcoming death . The " serious " final scene , written by Moffat , concluded events in River 's life that had been hinted since " Flesh and Stone " . Other episode titles suggested by Roberts included " Everything Must Go " , " The Last Adventure " , and " Cyberman and a Baby " . A prequel , entitled " Up All Night " , is included as part of the Night and the Doctor series of mini @-@ episodes in the Series 6 DVD package . 
 It was also Roberts ' idea to bring back the Cybermen , because there were no other returning monsters in the series and he thought " there should be a sense of history about the Doctor 's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death " . He felt that this was consistent with the theme of " death and lingering darkness " that had run throughout the sixth series . Roberts wanted the audience to think that maybe Craig would really be converted . Moffat felt the " blowing the Cybermen up with love " conclusion was the Doctor Who version of a father bonding with his son . Roberts felt that the episode 's depiction of the Cybermen put it on the " silly / terrifying axis " that was common in Doctor Who . 
 Daisy Haggard 's reduced role as Sophie in the episode was due to her role in the play Becky Shaw at Almeida Theatre in London . This episode marks Lynda Baron 's third involvement with Doctor Who , having provided vocals for the " Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon " , heard in The Gunfighters ( 1966 ) , and the role of Wrack in Enlightenment ( 1983 ) . The accompanying Doctor Who Confidential to " Closing Time " is entitled " Open All Hours " in honour of Baron 's role in the sitcom of the same name . Radio 1 DJ Greg James appears in a non @-@ speaking cameo role , as a man shopping for lingerie . His character was nicknamed " Carlos " . Alfie was portrayed by seven different babies , usually paired in twins , because of strict rules about baby hours . Several dummies were used as well . Corden , who was about to become a father , learned tips from the mothers . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 Much of " Closing Time " was filmed in a department store in Cardiff . As the store had to be closed , they filmed over four or five nights , sometimes going until 6 : 00 in the morning . Hughs said it was a " drain " on the production team , while Corden recalled it made the cast and crew " <unk> " and " hysterical " . Reportedly , the department store scenes were shot in March 2011 . The rest of the episode was filmed in a private home in Cardiff ; the couple who owned the house allowed the filming to take place in order for it to be an experience for their two young boys . Production at the house also went into the early hours of the morning . The window of the sliding door in the house that the Doctor jumps through to save Craig from the Cybermat was too small , so the production team built another one . The new door was too big for <unk> ; instead , glass that breaks into chunks was used , wired with a small explosive that would crack the glass when Smith 's stuntman jumped through it . Hughs wanted it to look as if the audience was crashing through the window with the Doctor ; he spliced together shots of Smith filmed running up to the door , the stuntman jumping through it , and Smith landing with shards of glass thrown over him . 
 The <unk> Industries logo , which had been used on the Cybermen since their redesign for the revived series in " Rise of the Cybermen " / " The Age of Steel " ( 2006 ) , was covered up for the Cybermen in this episode as well as the ones which had previously appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " . This is because the Cybermen from " Rise of the Cybermen " originated from a parallel universe , while the prime universe has its own Cybermen from the planet <unk> , as seen in the classic series . As the Cybermen that feature in " Closing Time " were barely surviving , the production team made them look broken down and as if they had been cannibalizing parts to survive . The suits were already worn to an extent , as they had been used so often in the five years since they were made . The Cyber Controller conversion equipment was built around Corden . 
 The Cybermats , which had not been seen on screen since 1975 's Revenge of the Cybermen , were redesigned to appear more high @-@ tech . The top was designed to recall the head of a Cyberman , and piranha @-@ like teeth were added to suggest that they were converted animals , just as Cybermen were converted humans . Three versions of the Cybermat were made . The first was simply a " stunt double " which did not have teeth and was meant for being thrown around or laid still . The second was a cable @-@ controlled " close @-@ up " version that had teeth and thrashed , and was used for when the characters handled it . Smith broke this one when he hit it with a frying pan in the scene where Craig is being attacked , and it was subsequently repaired with tape . The third was radio @-@ controlled to dash along the floor . The post @-@ production special effects team The Mill created a computer @-@ generated Cybermat that leapt up to attack Craig .

 " Closing Time " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 24 September 2011 , and in the United States on BBC America . It achieved overnight ratings of 5 @.@ 3 million viewers , coming in second for its time slot behind All @-@ Star Family Fortunes .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The episode received generally positive reviews , with critics praising the comic interplay between Smith and Corden . Dan Martin of The Guardian questioned the decision to air a standalone episode as the penultimate show of the series , calling " Closing Time " " something of a curiosity " as well as writing positively about Smith and Corden 's " Laurel and Hardy act " . However , he felt that the Cybermen had been deprived of their menace . Martin later rated it the eighth best episode of the series , though the finale was not included in the list . Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode three out of five stars , comparing Smith 's performance favourably to that of Patrick Troughton . Neela Debnath of The Independent said it was an " intriguing change of pace " and succeeded with " great comedic moments " and the " brilliant chemistry between the Doctor and Craig " . She praised Corden for excelling after his " average " performance in " The Lodger " . 
 Patrick Mulkern , writing for Radio Times , thought that the ending was an " emotional overload ... but what better way to deal with the emotionally deprived Cybermen ? " He was pleased with the " sweet cameo " from Amy and Rory and the " tense coda " with River Song and Kovarian . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave " Closing Time " a grade of " B + " , feeling that the episode was more about small character moments than the Cybermen plot . Though he wrote it was not as strong as " The Lodger " , he praised the way it gave a break before the season finale to bring out the softer side of the Doctor . Digital Spy 's Morgan Jeffery praised Smith , Corden , and Lynda Baron as Val , and felt that it was a " relief " to have a fun episode after two emotional heavy ones . However , he did not think it was as good as " The Lodger " and thought the Cybermen were " wasted " , citing the conclusion of Craig blowing them up with love as " unsatisfactory " . Andrew Blair of Den of Geek defended the Cybermen in the episode , opining that the episode brought out the tragedy of them barely surviving and having to convert people mechanically without any emotional understanding of the situation . 
 IGN 's Matt Risley rated the episode 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , praising the chemistry between Smith and Corden as well as Smith 's interaction with the baby , but was disappointed with the Cybermen , who he said " never really delivered on the threat or horror fans know they 're capable of " . SFX magazine reviewer Rob Power gave the episode three and a half out of five stars , saying it " [ worked ] wonders " as a light @-@ hearted episode before the finale and with " properly bad " Cybermen . Though he thought the Cyberman lacked " real menace " and Craig escaped in a " cheesy way " , he considered the main focus to be on the Doctor 's " farewell tour " and praised Smith 's performance . He thought that the moments of " sad @-@ eyed loneliness and resignation " added weight to " what would otherwise have been a paper @-@ thin episode " . Power also praised the ending for bringing things together for the finale , though he thought the final scene with River Song felt " a little tacked @-@ on " . Charlie Jane Anders writing for io9 described it as a " worthy sequel " and " welcome shot of comedy " and was positive towards the " sweet " exploration of the Doctor 's self @-@ loathing that proved the universe needed him . However , Anders was bothered by the running joke of the Doctor and Craig being mistaken for a gay couple and the stereotypes the episode relied on , such as the " clueless dad " and the ignorant shop girls . Christopher Hooton of Metro found the episode to be " soppy " and " sickly sweet " , criticising Corden for his " whooping " , " annoying " performance , the reliance on " slapstick capers " that " lurched a bit too close to the CBBC end of the spectrum " and the " jaunty [ and ] smug " soundtrack .

 Highway 5 is a major highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan . It begins in downtown Saskatoon and runs eastward to the Manitoba border near Togo , where it becomes Provincial Road 363 . The highway is approximately 393 kilometres ( 244 mi ) long . Between the early 1900s ( decade ) and 1976 , Provincial Highway 5 was a trans @-@ provincial highway travelling approximately 630 kilometres ( 390 mi ) in length . At this time it started at the Alberta border in Lloydminster and traveled east to the Manitoba border . 
 In the summer of 1970 , the section of highway between Lloydminster and Saskatoon was designated to be a portion of the Yellowhead Highway . This section of highway maintained the Highway 5 designation until 1976 , when it was redesignated as Highway 16 to maintain the same number through the four western provinces ( Manitoba followed suit the following year , redesignating its section of the Yellowhead Highway from PTH 4 to PTH 16 ) . This redesignation shortened the length of Highway 5 to its current length of 393 kilometres ( 244 mi ) . 
 Along the route are several heritage sites , an international bird watching area , saline lakes , as well as regional and provincial parks . Museums and historical markers commemorate the region 's history along the highway .

 The early Red River cart trail traversed the North West Territory prairies between Portage la Prairie and Edmonton via Humboldt and Battleford , intersecting the future location of Highway 5 at Humboldt . The Dominion Government Telegraph Line was constructed in 1875 , which was parallel to the future Highway 5 . 
 Both Red River Cart trail and telegraph line were abandoned in the 1920s . In 1925 , Provincial Highway 5 , the Evergreen Route , followed the surveyed rail line route of the Canadian Northern Railway , later the Canadian National Railway . Provincial Highway 5 had a western terminus at Lloydminster located on the Alberta - Saskatchewan border . When the province was surveyed , the road evolved from a dirt road to a gravel road . This was finally improved to an all weather road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta – Saskatchewan border bypassing Saskatoon to the north , and continuing on to the Manitoba – Saskatchewan border . Just as the rail line went through Aberdeen , Warman , and Langham , so too did Provincial Highway 5 . 
 In 1925 , access from Saskatoon to Provincial Highway 5 was via Provincial Highway 12 which was a route due north of the city . The other connection was Provincial Highway 27 which traveled east and north from Saskatoon connecting to Provincial Highway 5 at the junction located at the town of Aberdeen . In the late 1950s and 1960s , the highway was straightened and widened . During this process , the current Saskatchewan Highway 5 connected Humboldt and Saskatoon in a more direct west and east highway . The old place names of Warman , Aberdeen , Vonda , Prudhomme , Dana , Bruno , and Carmel located on Provincial Highway 5 were no longer place names along Saskatchewan Highway 5 . Now the Highway 17 concurrency was the only north @-@ south stretch between Humboldt and Saskatoon and Meacham the only place name . On August 15 , 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans @-@ Canada route and the north western half of Provincial Highway 5 between Saskatoon and Lloydminster was designated as Saskatchewan Highway 16 , the Yellowhead route . 
 Travel along the Provincial Highway 5 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances , barbed wire fencing and rail lines . As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel , the first highway was designed on 90 @-@ degree , right @-@ angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads . 1926 Saskatchewan map 
 Highway 5 was constructed through Englefeld in 1961 . John Koenig was one of the first residents of Englefeld to own a car , a Ford touring car purchased in the 1920s .

 Canadian Pacific Railway crossing lights were installed on Highway 5 at the east end of Humboldt . At the junction of Highway 20 and Highway 5 , there were traffic lights installed in 1973 . West Humboldt properties announced in the fall of 2008 that The Quill Centre will be opened in the fall of 2009 along Highway 5 . 
 Jan 3 , 1910 , was the first meeting of the RM of Blucher 343 . In 1911 , early homesteaders could choose to pay taxes at $ 9 @.@ 00 per quarter section of land or working off $ 4 @.@ 00 of this expense by constructing roads . A labourer and two horse team could earn 50 cents an hour and a four horse team with a driver was allotted 70 cents an hour . 
 A resurfacing improvement project was undertaken for an 11 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) stretch between Mikado and Canora . The $ 1 million project was completed the summer of 2001 . In the summer of 2000 , 13 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) received resurfacing improvements between Verigin and Mikado . In February 2003 , the Department of Highways awarded a tender to resurface 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from Quill Lake and eastward . " We are maintaining our focus on building better highways . Work on this $ 940 @,@ 000 resurfacing project ... should be complete within two weeks " , said Highways and Transportation Minister Mark Wartman .

 George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip ( December 6 , 1841 – May 11 , 1907 ) was a minor American @-@ English chess master and writer . He competed in chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895 , playing against most of the world 's leading players , but with only modest success . The writer G. H. Diggle calls him " the King of Wooden <unk> " because he usually finished last in strong tournaments . Gossip was also a noted writer . His treatise The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual — A Complete Guide to Chess , a 900 @-@ page tome published in 1874 after several years of work , was harshly received by the critics , largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had ( atypically ) won against stronger players . As a result , Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics , whom he often attacked ferociously in his books . However , his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received . Wilhelm Steinitz , the first World Chess Champion , wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual was one of the best available books on the game . Thanks in part to a 122 @-@ page appendix by S. Lipschütz , it became one of the standard opening works of the time . 
 Gossip made his living primarily as a journalist , author , and translator . He wrote for publications in England , France , Australia , and the United States . At various times he resided in each of those countries , as well as in Germany and Canada . In 1898 and 1899 , two publishers issued Gossip 's sole book about a subject other than chess , The Jew of Chamant . Published under the pseudonym " Ivan <unk> " , it was virulently antisemitic . 
 Chess writers have often mocked Gossip 's play , calling him a " <unk> " and the like . However , Kenneth Whyld , one of his previous critics , suggests that history may have judged him unfairly .

 Gossip was born in New York City on December 6 , 1841 , to George Hatfeild Gossip , an Englishman , and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip , of New York . When he was sixteen months old , his mother died ; about two years later , he and his father moved to England . His aunt , Mrs. <unk> Rodes , raised him , apparently with little involvement by his father . Gossip grew up at <unk> Hall , Derbyshire ( the Rodes family seat ) and at Hatfield , in Yorkshire . Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke 's Landed Gentry . He was educated at Windermere College , Westmorland , and won a scholarship to Oxford University , but was unable to attend as his father , uncle , and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially . As a result , Gossip had to support himself through his own labors .

 Gossip made his living primarily as a writer and translator , writing for newspapers and magazines on three continents . His profession is described in the 1871 , 1881 , and 1891 United Kingdom censuses , respectively , as a " translator of languages " , an " author of work on chess " , and a member of the " literary profession " . He lived for over five years in Paris , contributing to French publications . From 1879 to 1880 he was " employed occasionally as translator and otherwise " in The Times of London 's office in Paris . He also lived in Germany . 
 Gossip married Alicia ( the name is sometimes given as " Alice " ) , a music teacher from Dublin , in Jersey in 1868 . As of 1871 , they were living in London with their 11 @-@ month @-@ old son George and two servants . By 1881 , Gossip and his wife had moved to Ipswich , and had three more children : Helen ( born c . 1872 ) , Harold ( c . 1874 ) , and Mabel ( c . 1879 ) . After Gossip 's father died in 1882 , the Gossips and their four children emigrated to Australia , arriving in January 1883 . While in that country , Gossip wrote articles for the Sydney Star , Sydney Globe , Sydney Evening News , Town and Country Journal , The Advertiser ( Adelaide ) , and other publications . He contributed literary articles to Once a Month magazine ( Melbourne ) and the Sydney Quarterly Magazine . 
 Gossip moved to the United States in 1888 , departing in April from Sydney on the steamship Alameda . In May , the ship arrived in San Francisco , where , Gossip wrote , " I first set foot on my native soil after an absence of over forty years . " He wrote articles for the San Francisco Examiner on the " Chinese Question in Australia " and the San Francisco Chronicle on " Protection and Free Trade in New South Wales " . 
 His family apparently remained in Australia , where Alicia died of cancer in October 1888 . In 1894 , Gossip 's children Helen and Harold both married , in Victoria and Melbourne , respectively . Gossip 's grandson , George Hatfield Dingley Gossip , born in Sydney in 1897 , was a World War I flying ace for Australia , " shooting down six enemy aircraft while flying his Sopwith Camel along the Belgian coast " . 
 In 1889 , Gossip returned to Europe . By 1891 , he was living as a tenant in a London boarding house . In 1894 , he moved to Montreal , Canada . While living there , Gossip contributed articles to a newspaper in Manchester , England . The June 1895 British Chess Magazine ( BCM ) and June 1897 American Chess Magazine reported that he was living in Buffalo , New York . 
 Under the pseudonym " Ivan <unk> " , Gossip wrote a book , The Jew of Chamant , which was published by <unk> ( Buffalo ) in 1898 , and by F.T. Neely ( London and New York ) in 1899 . The two versions are subtitled , respectively , " or , the modern Monte Cristo " and " a romance of crime " . The book is intensely antisemitic . The author explains in its preface : 
 My object in the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors , as the enemy of society ; to show that the Jew who steals millions , can , in Europe , at any rate , defy the laws with impunity , and that he almost invariably escapes punishment owing to improper occult influences , and the mighty power of <unk> gold . 
 The chess literature is silent about the last decade of Gossip 's life . He died of heart disease on May 11 , 1907 , at the Railway Hotel in <unk> , England .

 By 1864 , Gossip was appearing in London chess circles , drawing a game against Joseph Henry Blackburne at a simultaneous exhibition in April . He played in a number of chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895 , usually with unimpressive results . At London 1870 , the Third British Chess Association Congress ( won by John <unk> after a playoff against Amos Burn ) , Gossip scored two of six possible points , finishing in a tie for fifth – sixth out of seven players . He had the consolation of handing Burn his only loss . At London 1872 ( won by Steinitz ahead of Johannes Zukertort and Blackburne ) , he scored just one out of seven , finishing seventh out of eight players . 
 Gossip won the 1873 – 74 correspondence chess tournament of the Chess @-@ Players Chronicle , after which he " was thought by some to be the strongest correspondence player known " . However , playing first board for England in an 1879 correspondence chess match against the United States , he lost all four of his games to Ellen Gilbert of Hartford , Connecticut . She " caused a sensation in the chess world " by announcing mate in 21 moves in one game , and mate in 35 moves in another . Gossip responded gallantly , dedicating his book Theory of the Chess Openings to her . 
 In 1874 , Gossip lost a match for the Championship Cup of the Provinces to Rev. John Owen , retiring because of illness after one win , two draws , and two losses . He won a local tournament at the Café de la Régence in Paris in 1880 . In 1882 , he beat Wordsworth Donisthorpe in a match held at Simpson 's Divan in London . 
 Gossip 's first significant success at over @-@ the @-@ board chess came at the 1883 London <unk> minor tournament . He scored 17 ½ out of 25 , tying for fifth – sixth place out of 26 players with Charles Ranken , who later co @-@ authored the treatise Chess Openings Ancient and Modern ( 1889 ) . Curt von Bardeleben won with 21 ½ points ; Isidor Gunsberg , who would narrowly lose an 1890 – 91 World Championship match to Steinitz , finished fourth with 19 points . 
 In 1885 Gossip , a year after emigrating to Australia , issued a challenge to any player in the Australian colonies to play a match with him for 20 pounds a side and the title of Australian champion . Frederick Karl Esling , a leading Melbourne player , accepted the challenge . Esling won the first game , and the second was adjourned in a position favorable to him . Gossip then pleaded illness and forfeited the match . Kenneth Whyld writes that the Australians probably considered Gossip a " whingeing Pom " . 
 An Australian commentator observes , " Gossip may not have been the most popular itinerant to venture to these shores in the nineteenth century , but when he announced his challenge ... he at least brought the question of an official Chess Champion of Australia before the chess playing fraternity " . In 1950 , when Esling was 90 , the Australian Chess Federation formally declared , belatedly , that he had become the first Australian Chess Champion by winning his 1885 match against Gossip . The Second Australian Chess Championship , a tournament , was held at Adelaide in 1887 . Gossip finished third with 6 ½ out of 9 , behind Henry <unk> ( 7 ½ points ) and Esling ( 7 points ) . 
 After returning to America in 1888 , Gossip obtained an appointment at the Columbia Chess Club . The following year , he represented England at the Sixth American Chess Congress ( New York 1889 ) , one of the greatest tournaments of the 19th century . The Congress , a double round robin that was one of the longest tournaments in history , was intended to select a challenger for the world championship title . There , Gossip had what G. H. Diggle calls " perhaps the best performance of his career " . He scored 13 ½ out of 38 ( 11 wins , 5 draws , 22 losses ) , finishing 17th – 18th out of 20 players . He won games from S. Lipschütz , Max Judd , Eugene Delmar , Jackson Showalter , William Pollock ( twice ) , Henry Bird ( twice ) , David Graham Baird , James Moore Hanham , and John Washington Baird . Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first with 29 points , edging out Gunsberg ( 28 ½ points ) . 
 Gossip was unable to repeat even this modest level of success in his final tournaments . He finished last in five consecutive strong events : the Master Section at London 1889 ( scoring 1 ½ out of 10 ; Bird won on tiebreak over Gunsberg ) ; the <unk> ( Master Tournament ) at Breslau 1889 ( scoring three out of ten ; Siegbert Tarrasch won ) ; the Master Section of Manchester 1890 ( scoring four out of nineteen ; Tarrasch won ) ; the Master Tournament at London 1892 ( scoring 2 ½ out of 11 ; future World Champion Emanuel Lasker won ) ; and New York 1893 ( scoring 2 ½ out of 13 ; Lasker won with a perfect score ) . Gossip 's run of last @-@ place finishes moved Diggle to dub him " the King of Wooden <unk> " . Gossip 's last event was a minor tournament in Skaneateles , New York in July – August 1895 , where he scored three out of six , finishing in a tie for third – fifth of seven players . 
 A report in the BCM in 1889 observed that Gossip suffered from great nervousness that prevented him from fully displaying his abilities at chess tournaments , where he had to stop his ears " to keep out the low hum inseparable from a large concourse of people " . Bird likewise wrote that minor distractions that he would not even notice would " drive ... Gossip to despair " . The BCM commentator accordingly believed that Gossip " would make a good stand in a single encounter with men who are much higher in the tournament than he is " . 
 Following his move to Montreal , Gossip in a letter to a friend dated October 20 , 1894 complained , " The French Canadian Chessplayers here are the poorest , meanest <unk> I ever met – all Jesuits . " He and Pollock played a match at the Montreal Chess Club in December 1894 and January 1895 ; each won six games , with five draws . This was an impressive result for Gossip " in view of Pollock 's undoubted strength " . Later in 1895 , Pollock finished 19th out of 22 players , scoring 8 out of 21 ( including wins over Tarrasch and Steinitz ) , at Hastings 1895 , arguably at that time the strongest tournament in history . Diggle writes that Gossip 's drawn match with Pollock vindicates the BCM 's 1889 observation that Gossip would be more at home in a match than a tournament . 
 Gossip was only a minor master , " a mediocre player who figured at or near the bottom of every better than average tourney in which he participated " . However , during his career he played tournament games against most of the world 's leading players , including World Champions Lasker and Steinitz ; World Championship challengers Zukertort , Tarrasch , Chigorin , and Gunsberg ; Louis Paulsen , Harry Nelson Pillsbury , and James Mason , all at some point ranked number 1 in the world by Chessmetrics ; Burn , Blackburne , Bird , and Cecil de Vere ( all ranked number 2 ) ; and Weiss and <unk> ( both ranked number 3 ) .

 As of 1874 , Gossip was the chess editor of The Hornet . In that year , after several years ' work , he published his magnum opus , The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual — A Complete Guide to Chess . It was " a handsomely produced work with more than 800 of its 900 pages devoted to openings and illustrative games " . The book became the subject of biting criticism , largely because Gossip had included 27 illustrative games that he had won against leading players of the day , and only 12 games that he had lost . Steinitz later wrote : 
 Mr Gossip had practiced the unfair ruse of carefully preserving stray skittles games which he had happened to win or draw , generally after many defeats , against masters whose public records stood far above his own , ... thus leading the public to believe that the author stood on a par with them , or was even their superior . 
 According to Diggle , this edition of the book " failed utterly " . The harsh reception accorded it embittered Gossip against chess critics for the rest of his life . 
 In 1879 , Gossip published Theory of the Chess Openings , a shorter work more in the style of Modern Chess Openings , which sold out within six months . The preface and the concluding chapter of the book bitterly attacked the critics who had savaged his earlier treatise . This time the critics , " while deploring ' the outside slices of Mr. Gossip 's sandwich ' " , praised the main body of the work . William Wayte in the Chess Players Chronicle called the book " fairly in possession of the field among English elementary treatises " . Unfortunately for Gossip , he " was the victim of an act of gross piracy , as many copies forming no part of the edition printed by his orders were circulated in America and the ' pirates ' never brought to justice . " 
 While in Australia , Gossip wrote a chess column that appeared in Once a Month magazine from February to October 1885 . 
 A new edition of The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual was published in 1888 , this one with a 122 @-@ page appendix by Lipschütz . Steinitz wrote that " Mr Gossip has produced a useful work , which in some respects must be regarded even superior to that of Staunton or any other previous writers on the chess openings . ... But the most meritorious distinguishing feature of the Manual is the large collection of illustrative games by various first @-@ class masters , and in that respect Mr Gossip 's work stands second only to Signor <unk> 's <unk> e Pratica among the analytical works in any language . " The following year , Steinitz cited it in The Modern Chess Instructor as one of the 12 principal authorities he had relied on in writing that treatise . 
 An anonymous reviewer in The New York Times called the new edition of The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual " probably the most convenient , trustworthy , and satisfactory chess book accessible in the English language " . The reviewer concluded that the games and problems in the volume would " afford great entertainment " to the casual enthusiast , " while for real students of chess ... it is very nearly indispensable " . He also praised " Mr. Lipschütz 's appendix , which brings the development of the openings almost down to date " . David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write in The Oxford Companion to Chess that Lipschütz 's appendix " helped to make this one of the standard opening books of the time " . World Champion Bobby Fischer had a copy of The Chess @-@ Player 's Manual in his personal library , and cited it in his famous 1961 article " A Bust to the King 's Gambit " . 
 The June 1888 issue of Steinitz 's International Chess Magazine contained an article by Gossip that Robert John McCrary calls " a very illuminating , important , and detailed account of the state of San Francisco chess " . For the last few months of 1888 Gossip was listed as being on the " Editorial Staff " of the Columbia Chess Chronicle . Its December 29 , 1888 issue contained a lengthy article by him entitled " Chess in the Present Day " , which offered a broad sweep of chess history and the advances made by chess in the United States . Gossip called Paul Morphy and Steinitz " the two greatest chessplayers that have ever lived " and remarked that " no Englishman has yet attained , or probably ever will attain , to the eminence of chess champion of the world . ... The deep @-@ thinking German , the brilliant Frenchman and the versatile American have always been too much for sober , stolid John Bull . " 
 Gossip in 1891 published a second revised edition of his Theory of the Chess Openings , which Diggle calls " a handsome volume with an appendix of sixty @-@ one pages " . Characteristically , he devoted much of the appendix to criticizing his detractors and anticipating their further attacks . 
 Gossip also wrote the lesser @-@ known chess books The Chess Players ' Text Book ( 1889 ) , The Chess @-@ player 's Vade <unk> and Pocket Guide to the Openings ( 1891 ) , Modern Chess <unk> ( 1892 ) , The Chess Player 's Pocket Guide to Games at Odds ( 1893 ) , The Chess Pocket Manual ( 1894 ) , The Chess Player 's Mentor ( with Francis Joseph Lee , 1895 ) , The Complete Chess @-@ Guide ( with Lee , 1903 ) , Gossip 's Vest @-@ Pocket Chess Manual ( date unknown ; pictured at above left ) , and a collection of his own games , Games : G. H. D. Gossip versus <unk> , Clerc , Donisthorpe , <unk> , Gunsberg , Hoffer , Owen , Sanders , Vines Played During the Last 10 Years in England & France ( 1882 , with Gunsberg and Steinitz ) .

 Burn 's biographer Richard Forster notes that Gossip " was well @-@ known for his exaggerated self @-@ esteem " . Philip Sergeant in his book A Century of British Chess remarks that his " play was never quite up to his own estimate of it " . The New York Times portrays him at the Sixth American Chess Congress ( 1889 ) as follows : 
 Gossip , with his long , flowing beard , looks like one of the old @-@ time monks . He has a good @-@ shaped cranium , bald at the top , and is a little above the medium height . ... He believes himself to be one of the greatest chessplayers in the world , and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament . He is a deliberate player , but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table . He complained that his chair was too low , and he once attributed a defeat to that . Finally , he got a large ledger and sat upon it . He did , in fact , seem to derive some inspiration from its contents , for he played two or three excellent games afterward . 
 Diggle observes that Gossip " developed ' a happy knack of treading on other people 's <unk> ' by rushing into print " his occasional wins in offhand games against such leading players as Bird and Zukertort . He also vehemently denounced his critics and those with whom he disagreed . For example , in 1888 the Columbia Chess Chronicle quoted a lecture he had given two days before on the Steinitz Gambit . After condemning as " utterly worthless " the analysis of that opening published in two English periodicals , Gossip declaimed : 
 In order , therefore , to establish an important point of theory , and at the same time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors , whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor , whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self @-@ conceit , I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named . 
 Hooper and Whyld note Gossip 's " unusual talent for making enemies " and attribute the critical reception of his books to this , since in their opinion " his books were not significantly worse than the general run of the time , and they were better than , for example , those by Bird , who was popular " . They remark on his travels that , " Disliked in England , he travelled to Australia , the United States , and Canada , where he also became unpopular . " Some measure of his talent for stirring up controversy is provided by a letter Pollock wrote during their 1894 – 95 match : 
 I and Gossip are six each and may draw the match . He has proved a terrible crank and has had several games by forfeit , and one " cancelled " . He now has a libel suit against the chess column of the Herald . ... We have just agreed , per the committee , to call the match a draw . <unk> all parties are relieved . 
 Chess historian Edward Winter observes that " Gossip has always been a soft target for mockery " . He notes that Hooper and Whyld in the first edition ( 1984 ) of The Oxford Companion to Chess " treated him essentially as light relief " ; the second edition ( 1992 ) treated him more equitably , but like the first omitted any mention of his performance at New York 1889 . Yakov <unk> in The Batsford Book of Chess Records ( 2005 ) , addressing the question of which player " achieved the greatest negative distinction " on the international level , opines that Gossip " can probably feel safe from competition " . Mike Fox and Richard James in their book The Even More Complete Chess Addict ( 1993 ) write that , " Of players who 've entered chess history , perhaps the strongest claimant for the all @-@ time <unk> title is George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip ( 1841 – 1907 ) . George had a worse record in major tournaments than anyone in history ( last at Breslau 1889 , London 1889 , Manchester 1890 , London 1892 , and New York 1893 : a total of just four wins , 52 losses and 21 draws ) . " Like Hooper and Whyld , they overlook his result at New York 1889 , a major tournament where he won 11 games and finished above the bottom . In a 2001 article , Whyld himself takes notice of Gossip 's result at New York 1889 and suggests that " history has perhaps given him an unfair verdict " . 
 By Arpad Elo 's calculation , Gossip 's strength during his five @-@ year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of <unk> . Today FIDE , the World Chess Federation , often awards the Grandmaster title to players with Elo ratings of 2500 and above , and the lesser International Master and FIDE Master titles to players rated at least 2400 and 2300 , respectively . 
 Another assessment system , Chessmetrics , calculates that Gossip 's highest rating was 2470 ( number 50 in the world ) in April 1889 . By comparison , the world 's three highest @-@ rated players at that time had Chessmetrics ratings over 2700 . Chessmetrics also ranks Gossip number 17 in the world during four one @-@ month periods between February and July 1873 , when opportunities for high @-@ level competition were much rarer . Like Diggle , Chessmetrics considers New York 1889 Gossip 's best individual performance , concluding that he scored 39 % against opponents with an average rating of <unk> , giving him a performance rating of <unk> for that tournament . In 1904 , the Deutsche Schachzeitung , on the basis of its tabulation of players ' percentage scores in all major international tournaments from London 1851 to Cambridge Springs 1904 , ranked Gossip the number 62 living player in the world . 
 Diggle writes that despite his faults , Gossip was " a man of dauntless courage and infinite capacity for hard work " , which enabled him to become a recognized author despite the disastrous reception that the first edition of his Chess @-@ Player 's Manual received . His literary style was vigorous , and shows him to be an educated and well @-@ read man .

 = USS Ajax ( 1864 ) = 
 Originally named USS <unk> , after a town in Pennsylvania , USS Ajax was a single @-@ turreted Canonicus @-@ class monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . Completed after the end of the war , Ajax was laid up until 1871 , although she received her new name in 1869 . The ship was briefly activated in 1871 before a much longer commission began in 1874 – 75 . She was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron during this time . Ajax was again placed in reserve in 1891 . The ship was on militia duty when the Spanish – American War began and she was recommissioned in 1898 to defend Baltimore , Maryland , although she was decommissioned later in the year before the necessary refit could be completed . Ajax was sold for scrap in 1899 . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 The ship was 224 feet 6 inches ( 68 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , had a beam of 43 feet 8 inches ( 13 @.@ 3 m ) and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) . Ajax had a tonnage of 1 @,@ 034 tons burthen and displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men . 
 Ajax was powered by a two @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Ajax 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . 
 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) wrought iron plates , backed by wood . The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one @-@ inch plates . The ship 's deck was protected by armor 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A 5 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel ( ship ) was protected to a height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of armor . A " rifle screen " of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) armor 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protected the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh . The only known modification after the ship 's completion was the addition of a hurricane deck between the turret and the funnel sometime after the end of the Civil War . 
 The contract for construction of Ajax was signed by Snowden & Mason on 15 September 1862 , and the keel of the ship was laid down later in the year in their new shipyard at Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . She was ready to be launched in April 1864 , but the very low level of the Ohio River rendered that impossible . She was finally launched on 18 December . While fitting out , Ajax was ripped loose from her moorings on 5 March 1865 and she had to be towed back to her berth . The following day she was towed to Mound City , Illinois where she arrived on 11 March . Snowden & Mason had to pay $ 7 @,@ 000 for the tow as well as ship 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of material needed to finish the ship . 
 The monitor joined her sisters Oneota and Catawba in ordinary opposite Cairo , Illinois when she was completed on 27 September 1865 , although they drew enough water that they had to be anchored in the main channel where they were often struck by debris , drifting ice , and were vulnerable to accidents . This was a persistent problem and the Navy finally decided to move the ships down to New Orleans in May 1866 . The ship was renamed Ajax on 15 June 1869 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The monitor was briefly commissioned on 1 January 1871 , under the command of Lieutenant Commander Charles Love Franklin , and transferred to Key West , Florida to participate with the North Atlantic Squadron on coast defense maneuvers . She was decommissioned on 1 July 1871 and laid up at the Philadelphia Navy Yard . After a thorough overhaul , Ajax was recommissioned on 13 January 1874 , with Commander Joseph N. Miller in command . The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron and was based at Key West until she was decommissioned again on 27 July 1875 and laid up at Port Royal , South Carolina . Recommissioned on 5 November 1875 , the ship remained at Port Royal until moved to the James River . She was moored at Brandon , Virginia and at City Point , Virginia , before being placed in ordinary at Richmond , Virginia on 30 June 1891 . 
 On 26 September 1895 , Ajax was loaned to the New Jersey Naval Militia and moored at Camden , New Jersey . She was recommissioned for local defense duties on 9 July 1898 during the Spanish – American War in response to pressure from local politicians . The ship was intended for service at Baltimore , but she was decommissioned on 1 September 1898 before the necessary refit had been completed . Ajax was sold at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 10 October 1899 . 
 = Earth structure = 
 An earth structure is a building or other structure made largely from soil . Since soil is a widely available material , it has been used in construction since prehistoric times . It may be combined with other materials , compressed and / or baked to add strength . Soil is still an economical material for many applications , and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction . 
 Earth structure materials may be as simple as mud , or mud mixed with straw to make cob . Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf . Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement , and may be compacted into rammed earth . Construction is faster with pre @-@ formed adobe or <unk> , compressed earth blocks , <unk> or fired clay bricks . 
 Types of earth structure include earth shelters , where a dwelling is wholly or partly embedded in the ground or encased in soil . Native American earth lodges are examples . Wattle and daub houses use a " wattle " of poles interwoven with sticks to provide stability for mud walls . Sod houses were built on the northwest coast of Europe , and later by European settlers on the North American prairies . Adobe or mud @-@ brick buildings are built around the world and include houses , apartment buildings , mosques and churches . Fujian <unk> are large fortified rammed earth buildings in southeastern China that shelter as many as 80 families . Other types of earth structure include mounds and pyramids used for religious purposes , levees , mechanically stabilized earth retaining walls , forts , trenches and embankment dams . 
 = = Soil = = 
 Soil is created from rock that has been chemically or physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated . Soil particles include sand , silt and clay . Sand particles are the largest at 2 to 0 @.@ 05 millimetres ( 0 @.@ <unk> to 0 @.@ 0020 in ) in diameter and clay the smallest at less than 0 @.@ 002 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 × 10 − 5 in ) in diameter . Both sand and silt are mostly inert rock particles , including quartz , calcite , feldspar and mica . 
 Clays typically are phyllosilicate minerals with a sheet @-@ like structure . The very small clay particles interact with each other physically and chemically . Even a small proportion of clay affects the physical properties of the soil much more than might be expected . Clays such as kaolinite do not expand or contract when wetted or dried , and are useful for brick @-@ making . Others , such as <unk> , expand or contract considerably when wet or dry , and are not suitable for building . 
 Loam is a mix of sand , silt and clay in which none predominates . Soils are given different names depending on the relative proportions of sand , silt and clay such as " Silt Loam " , " Clay Loam " and " <unk> Clay " . Loam construction , the subject of this article , referred to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks , is an ancient building technology . It was used in the early civilizations of the Mediterranean , Egypt and Mesopotamia , in the Indus , Ganges and Yellow river valleys , in Central and South America . As of 2005 about 1 @.@ 5 billion people lived in houses built of loam . 
 In recent years , interest in loam construction has revived in the developed world . It is seen as a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution , particularly carbon dioxide , during manufacture , and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material . The two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth , clay or loam , called <unk> de terre in French , and adobe , typically using sun @-@ dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture . 
 = = Materials = = 
 Earth usually requires some sort of processing for use in construction . It may be combined with water to make mud , straw may be added , some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement may be used to harden the earth , and the earth may be compacted to increase strength . 
 = = = Mud = = = 
 <unk> mud construction is one of the oldest approaches to building walls . Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall , and allowed to dry . More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete . With puddled mud , a hand @-@ made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry . In Iran , puddled mud walls are called chine construction . Each course is about 18 to 24 inches ( 460 to 610 mm ) thick , and about 18 to 24 inches ( 460 to 610 mm ) high . Typically the technique is used for garden walls but not for house construction , presumably because of concern about the strength of walls made in this way . A drawback to the approach is that a lot of time can be spent waiting for each course to dry . Another technique , used in areas where wood is plentiful , is to build a wood frame house and to infill it with mud , primarily to provide insulation . In parts of England a similar technique was used with cob . 
 = = = Cob = = = 
 Cob , sometimes referred to as " monolithic adobe " , is a natural building material made from soil that includes clay , sand or small stones and an organic material such as straw . Cob walls are usually built up in courses , have no mortar joints and need 30 % or more clay in the soil . Cob can be used as in @-@ fill in post @-@ and @-@ beam buildings , but is often used for load bearing walls , and can bear up to two stories . A cob wall should be at least 16 inches ( 410 mm ) thick , and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten . It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime , soil and sand . Cob is fireproof , and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures . Tests have shown that cob has some resistance to seismic activity . However , building codes in the developed world may not recognize cob as an approved material . 
 = = = Sod or turf = = = 
 Cut sod bricks , called <unk> in Spanish , can be used to make tough and durable walls . The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots , which may be found in river bottom lands . It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction . European settlers on the North American Prairies found that the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs . Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland , Scotland and Iceland , where some turf houses may still be found . A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well @-@ maintained in a cold climate . The Icelanders find that the best quality turf is the <unk> , the top 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of the grass turf . 
 = = = Stabilized earth = = = 
 Clay is usually hard and strong when dry , but becomes very soft when it absorbs water . The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together , but if the wall is directly exposed to rain , or to water leaking down from the roof , it may become saturated and collapse . Earth may be " stabilized " to make it more weather resistant . The practice of stabilizing earth by adding burnt lime is centuries old . Portland cement or bitumen may also be added to earth intended for construction which adds strength , although the stabilized earth is not as strong as fired clay or concrete . Mixtures of cement and lime , or pozzolana and lime , may also be used for stabilization . 
 Preferably the sand content of the soil will be 65 % – 75 % . Soils with low clay content , or with no more than 15 % non @-@ expansive clay , are suitable for stabilized earth . The clay percentage may be reduced by adding sand , if available . If there is more than 15 % clay it may take more than 10 % cement to stabilize the soil , which adds to the cost . If earth contains little clay and holds 10 % or more cement , it is in effect concrete . Cement is not particularly environmentally friendly , since the manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide . Low @-@ density stabilized earth will be porous and weak . The earth must therefore be compacted either by a machine that makes blocks or within the wall using the " rammed earth " technique . 
 = = = Rammed earth = = = 
 Rammed earth is a technique for building walls using natural raw materials such as earth , chalk , lime or gravel . A rammed earth wall is built by placing damp soil in a temporary form . The soil is manually or mechanically compacted and then the form is removed . Rammed earth is generally made without much water , and so does not need much time to dry as the building rises . It is susceptible to moisture , so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness , must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above , and may need protection through some sort of plaster , paint or sheathing . 
 In China , rammed earth walls were built by the Longshan people in 2600 – 1900 BC , during the period when cities first appeared in the region . Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as Sikkim . The technique spread to the Middle East , and to North Africa , and the city of Carthage was built of rammed earth . From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans . Rammed earth structures may be long lasting . Most of the Great Wall of China was made from rammed earth , as was the Alhambra in the Kingdom of Granada . In Northern Europe there are rammed earth buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old . 
 = = = Concrete = = = 
 The Romans made durable concrete strong enough for load @-@ bearing walls . Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar . The mortar included lime and pozzolana , a volcanic material that contributed significantly to its strength . Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum , completed in 80 AD , still stand . Their longevity may be explained by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets . Although derived from earth products , concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures . 
 = = Building units = = 
 = = = Mud brick or adobe brick = = = 
 <unk> or Adobe bricks are preformed modular masonry units of sun @-@ dried mud that were invented at different times in different parts of the world as civilization developed . Construction with bricks avoids the delays while each course of puddled mud dries . Wall murals show that adobe production techniques were highly advanced in Egypt by 2500 BC . Adobe construction is common throughout much of Africa today . Adobe bricks are traditionally made from sand and clay mixed with water to a plastic consistency , with straw or grass as a binder . The mud is prepared , placed in wooden forms , tamped and leveled , and then turned out of the mold to dry for several days . The bricks are then stood on end to air @-@ cure for a month or more . 
 In the southwest United States and Mexico adobe buildings had massive walls and were rarely more than two stories high . Adobe mission churches were never more than about 35 feet ( 11 m ) . Since adobe surfaces are fragile , coatings are used to protect them . These coatings , periodically renewed , have included mud plaster , lime plaster , whitewash or stucco . Adobe walls were historically made by laying the bricks with mud mortar , which swells and shrinks at the same rate as the bricks when wetted or dried , heated or cooled . Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars , but cement mortars will cause <unk> adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction . 
 = = = Compressed earth block = = = 
 Compressed earth blocks ( CEB ) were traditionally made by using a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold . Today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a hand @-@ operated or powered machine . In the developing world , manual machines can be a cost @-@ effective solution for making uniform building blocks , while the more complex and expensive motorized machines are less likely to be appropriate . Although labor @-@ intensive , CEB construction avoids the cost of buying and transporting materials . Block @-@ making machines may form blocks that have interlocking shapes to reduce the requirement for mortar . The block may have holes or grooves so rods such as bamboo can be inserted to improve earthquake resistance . 
 Suitable earth must be used , with enough clay to hold the block together and resist erosion , but not too much expansive clay . When the block has been made from stabilized earth , which contains cement , the concrete must be given perhaps three weeks to cure . During this time the blocks should be stacked and kept from drying out by sprinkling water over them . This may be a problem in hot , dry climates where water is scarce . Closely stacking the blocks and covering them with a polythene sheet may help reduce water loss . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> construction is a natural building technique that has evolved from historic military construction techniques for bunkers . Local subsoil of almost any composition can be used , although an adobe mix would be preferable . The soil is moistened so it will compact into a stable structure and packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks . <unk> sacks are better than burlap since they are both cheaper and more durable . The bags are laid in courses , with barbed wire between each course to prevent slipping . Each course is tamped after it is laid . The structure is thus similar to a rammed earth structure , and may be extremely strong . <unk> may be used to make dome @-@ shaped buildings , and may also be used for retaining walls . 
 = = = Fired clay brick = = = 
 The technique of firing clay bricks in a kiln dates to about 3500 BC . Fired bricks were being used to build durable masonry across Europe , Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still remain an important building material . Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales , shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8 – 12 hours at a temperature of 900 – 1150 ° C. The result is a ceramic that is mainly composed of silica and alumina , with other ingredients such as quartz sand . The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration . The bricks may vary in color depending on the amount of iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used , and the amount of oxygen in the kiln . Bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on the brick or in its pores , from frost action and from acidic gases . 
 Bricks are laid in courses bonded with mortar , a combination of Portland cement , lime and sand . A wall that is two bricks thick will include stretcher bricks with their long , narrow side exposed and header bricks crossing from side to side . There are various brickwork " bonds " , or patterns of stretchers and headers , including the English , Dutch and Flemish bonds .

 = = = Earth sheltering = = = 
 Earth sheltering has been used for thousands of years to make energy @-@ efficient dwellings . There are various configurations . At one extreme , an earth sheltered dwelling is completely underground , with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light . An earth house may be set into a slope , with windows or door openings in one or more of its sides , or the building may be on ground level , but with earth mounded against the walls , and perhaps with an earth roof . 
 Pit houses made by Hohokam farmers between 100 and 900 AD , in what is now the southwest of the USA , were <unk> structures , partially embedded in south @-@ facing slopes . Their successful design was used for hundreds of years . At Matmata , Tunisia , most of the ancient homes were built 12 metres ( 39 ft ) below ground level , and surrounded courtyards about 12 metres ( 39 ft ) square . The homes were reached through tunnels . Other examples of subterranean , semi @-@ subterranean or cliff @-@ based dwellings in both hot and cold climates are found in Turkey , northern China and the Himalayas , and the southwest USA . A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet , Bhutan , Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed . Starting in the 1970s , interest in the technique has revived in developed countries . By setting an earth house into the ground , the house will be cooler in the warm season and warmer in the cool season . 
 = = = Native American earth lodge = = = 
 An earth lodge is a circular building made by some of the Native Americans of North America . They have wood post and beam construction and are dome @-@ shaped . A typical structure would have four or more central posts planted in the ground and connected at the top by cross beams . The smoke hole would be left open in the center . Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts , also connected by cross beams . Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams , and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls . The structure was covered by sticks and brush or grass , covered in turn by a heavy layer of earth or sod . Some groups plastered the whole structure with mud , which dried to form a shell . 
 = = = Wattle and daub = = = 
 Wattle and daub is an old building technique in which vines or smaller sticks are interwoven between upright poles , and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over the wall . The technique is found around the world , from the Nile Delta to Japan , where bamboo was used to make the wattle . In Cahokia , now in Illinois , USA , wattle and daub houses were built with the floor lowered by 1 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) below the ground . A variant of the technique is called <unk> in Colombia . In prehistoric Britain simple circular wattle and daub shelters were built wherever adequate clay was available . Wattle and daub is still found as the panels in timber @-@ framed buildings . Generally the walls are not structural , and in interior use the technique in the developed world was replaced by lath and plaster , and then by gypsum wallboard . 
 = = = Prairie sod house = = = 
 European pioneer farmers in the prairies of North America , where there is no wood for construction , often made their first home in a dug @-@ out cave in the side of a hill or ravine , with a covering over the entrance . When they had time , they would build a sod house . The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks 1 by 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 by 0 @.@ 61 m ) , which were then piled up to form the walls . The sod strips were piled grass @-@ side down , staggered in the same way as brickwork , in three side @-@ by @-@ side rows , resulting in a wall over 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick . The sod wall was built around door and window frames , and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them . The roof was made with poles or brush , covered with prairie grass , and then sealed with a layer of sod . Sod houses were strong and often lasted many years , but they were damp and dirty unless the interior walls were plastered . The roofs tended to leak , and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm . 
 = = = Mud brick buildings = = = 
 There are innumerable examples of mud brick or adobe building around the world . The walled city of Shibam in Yemen , designated a World Heritage Site in 1982 , is known for its ten @-@ story unreinforced mud @-@ brick buildings . The <unk> Mosque of Timbuktu , Mali , was first built at the start of the 14th century AD ( 8th century AH ) from round mud bricks and a stone @-@ mud <unk> , and was rebuilt several times afterwards , steadily growing in size . Further south in Mali , the Great Mosque of <unk> , a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick <unk> was built in 1907 , based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280 . <unk> requires maintenance , and the fundamentalist ruler <unk> <unk> had let the previous mosque collapse . 
 The Casa Grande Ruins , now a national monument in Arizona protected by a modern roof , is a massive four @-@ story adobe structure built by Hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 AD . The first European to record the great house was a Jesuit priest , Father Eusebio Kino , who visited the site in 1694 . At that time it had long been abandoned . By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years . 
 <unk> de la Luna in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the Moche people . The building went through a series of construction phases , growing eventually to a height of about 32 metres ( 105 ft ) , with three main platforms , four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures . The walls were covered by striking multi @-@ colored murals and <unk> ; those visible today date from about 400 – 610 AD . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A Fujian <unk> is a type of rural dwelling of the Hakka people in the mountainous areas in southeastern Fujian , China . They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries . A <unk> is a large , enclosed and fortified earth building , rectangular or circular , with very thick load @-@ bearing rammed earth walls between three and five stories high . A <unk> might house up to 80 families . Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls , storehouses , wells and living areas . The structure resembles a small fortified city . The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone , bamboo , wood and other readily available materials , and are to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) thick . The result is a well @-@ lit , well @-@ ventilated , <unk> and earthquake @-@ proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer . 
 = = = Mounds and pyramids = = = 
 <unk> were elevated temples constructed by the Sumerians between the end of the 4th millennium BC and the 2nd millennium BC , rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to 200 feet ( 61 m ) above ground level . The Ziggurat of Ur contained about three million bricks , none more than 15 inches ( 380 mm ) in length , so construction would have been a huge project . The largest ziggurat was in Babylon , and is thought by some to be the Tower of Babel mentioned in the Bible . It was destroyed by Alexander the Great and only the foundations remain , but originally it stood 300 feet ( 91 m ) high on a base about 660 feet ( 200 m ) square . Sun @-@ dried bricks were used for the interior and kiln @-@ fired bricks for the facing . The bricks were held together by clay or bitumen . 
 Many pre @-@ Columbian Native American societies of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds . Among the largest and best @-@ known of these structures is Monks Mound at the site of Cahokia in what became Illinois , completed around 1100 AD , which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza . Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals , some becoming quite large . They are believed to have played a central role in the mound @-@ building peoples ' religious life and documented uses include semi @-@ public chief 's house platforms , public temple platforms , mortuary platforms , charnel house platforms , earth lodge / town house platforms , residence platforms , square ground and rotunda platforms , and dance platforms . 
 The 207 feet ( 63 m ) Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan , Mexico , was started in 100 AD . The stone @-@ faced structure contains two million tons of rammed earth . 
 = = = Earthworks = = = 
 Earthworks are engineering works created through moving or processing quantities of soil or unformed rock . The material may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose . Levees , embankments and dams are types of earthwork . A levee , floodbank or <unk> is an elongated natural ridge or artificially constructed dirt fill wall that regulates water levels . It is usually earthen and often runs parallel to the course of a river in its floodplain or along low @-@ lying coastlines . 
 Mechanically stabilized earth ( MSE ) retaining walls may be used for embankments . MSE walls combine a concrete leveling pad , wall facing panels , coping , soil reinforcement and select backfill . A variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used . After the leveling pad has been laid and the first row of panels has been placed and braced , the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted . The first set of reinforcements is then laid over the earth . The reinforcements , which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids , are attached to the facing panels . This process is repeated with successive layers of panels , earth and reinforcements . The panels are thus tied into the earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses . 
 Although construction using the basic principles of MSE has a long history , MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s . The reinforcing elements used can vary but include steel and <unk> . The term MSE is usually used in the USA to distinguish it from " Reinforced Earth " , a trade name of the Reinforced Earth Company , but elsewhere Reinforced Soil is the generally accepted term . MSE construction is relatively fast and inexpensive , and although labor @-@ intensive , it does not demand high levels of skill . It is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries . 
 = = = Forts and trenches = = = 
 Earth has been used to construct fortifications for thousands of years , including strongholds and walls , often protected by ditches . Aerial photography in Europe has revealed traces of earth fortifications from the Roman era , and later medieval times . Offa 's Dyke is a huge earthwork that stretches along the disputed border between England and Wales . Little is known about the period or the builder , King Offa of Mercia , who died in 796 AD . An early timber and earth fortification might later be succeeded by a brick or stone structure on the same site . 
 Trenches were used by besieging forces to approach a fortification while protected from missiles . Sappers would build " saps " , or trenches , that zig @-@ zagged towards the fortress being attacked . They piled the excavated dirt to make a protective wall or gabion . The combined trench depth and gabion height might be 8 to 10 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 0 m ) . Sometimes the sap was a tunnel , dug several feet below the surface . Sappers were highly skilled and highly paid due to the extreme danger of their work . 
 In the American Civil War ( 1861 − 1865 ) trenches were used for defensive positions throughout the struggle , but played an increasingly important role in the campaigns of the last two years . Military earthworks perhaps culminated in the vast network of trenches built during World War I ( 1914 − 1918 ) that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea by the end of 1914 . The two lines of trenches faced each other , manned by soldiers living in appalling conditions of cold , damp and filth . Conditions were worst in the Allied trenches . The Germans were more willing to accept the trenches as long @-@ term positions , and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground , often with electrical lighting and heating . 
 = = = Embankment dams = = = 
 An embankment dam is a massive artificial water barrier . It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi @-@ plastic mound of various compositions of soil , sand , clay and / or rock . It has a semi @-@ permanent waterproof natural covering for its surface , and a dense , waterproof core . This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion . The force of the impoundment creates a downward thrust upon the mass of the dam , greatly increasing the weight of the dam on its foundation . This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the underlying foundation of the dam , at the interface between the dam and its stream bed . Such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles . The friction and interaction of particles binds the particles together into a stable mass rather than by the use of a cementing substance . 
 The Syncrude Mildred Lake <unk> Dyke in Alberta , Canada , is an embankment dam about 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) long and from 40 to 88 metres ( 131 to 289 ft ) high . By volume of fill , as of 2001 it was believed to be the largest earth structure in the world . 
 = The Frontline ( Irish TV series ) = 
 The Frontline is a topical debate television series in Ireland , which aired for 60 minutes every Monday night on RTÉ One at 22 : 30 . It debuted on Monday , 21 September 2009 . The Frontline replaced a similar political analysis show Questions and Answers . The programme features around an invited audience and featured guests . 
 Many public figures politicians have appeared on the series . Some incidents on the programme have attracted a large amount of media coverage . The programme has generally received positive reviews . The programme is broadcast from Studio 4 in RTÉ . The first programme received an audience share of 43 @.@ 4 % , with a viewing audience of 464 @,@ 000 . Later into the series 100 @,@ 000 fewer people watched it , watching The Apprentice instead . It won " Best Current Affairs programme " at the 7th Irish Film and Television Awards in February 2010 . 
 The show returned in September 2012 . However , RTÉ announced in October 2012 that the show would be revamped in early 2013 . In November 2012 , media reports indicated that this revamp would involve The Frontline being axed and replaced with Prime Time : Debate , and that the new show would be similar to The Frontline but under the Prime Time branding . The Frontline aired for the final time on 28 January 2013 . 
 = = Format = = 
 The Frontline was hosted by former The Late Late Show presenter and RTÉ Radio 1 presenter Pat Kenny . The programme runs for 60 minutes on Monday nights on RTÉ One . It was directed by David Donaghy and produced by Dave <unk> . Studio 4 in the RTÉ Television Centre was the venue of the programme . That was also used for The Late Late Show . 
 The show differed from its predecessor Questions and Answers in that the show does not entirely focus on a panel . The show regularly featured one @-@ on @-@ one interviews with key political and social figures , such as the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Labour Party , as well as specially themed shows . Other formats include a panel from various social and political backgrounds discussing political issues affecting Ireland and the wider world . The programme debates " the most important news stories of the week " . The programme also features debate on " major political , economic and social issues " . The programme also features some satire . 
 Steve Carson , head of programming in RTÉ Television , said the programme wouldn 't be a replica of the old format . An audience also features as part of the discussion similar to Questions and Answers . 
 For the beginning of the programme , Kenny " zips around the studio , microphone in hand " . 
 = = History = = 
 The first indication that Pat Kenny would present another television programme , was on the night he announced his departure from presenting The Late Late Show . By the time of presenting his last programme , it was announced a new current affairs programme would begin in autumn 2009 . It was later announced that it would be 21 September 2009 . 
 There was a high demand for tickets , which RTÉ described as phenomenal . 4 @,@ 000 applications were received for a capacity of 120 seats ( originally 60 for Questions and Answers , which was subsequently doubled ) . A public invitation for comments and ideas on topics was issued by the makers of the show . 
 The first programme had guests such as Eamon Dunphy , Fintan O 'Toole , Pat Farrell , Tom <unk> and Brian Lenihan , Minister for Finance . Audience members included small business people and mortgage holders . Lenihan talked about the proposed National Asset Management Agency and the purchase of € 28 billion in loans from Anglo Irish Bank . 
 As a result of cutbacks , RTÉ could only afford to spend € 2 on sandwiches per audience member . 
 The programme won " Best Current Affairs programme " at the 7th Irish Film and Television Awards on 20 February 2010 . Kenny accepted the award . 
 A special programme about the aftermath of sudden recession aired in May 2010 . 
 The programme returned to RTÉ One on 20 September 2010 . 
 = = = Ratings = = = 
 For the first two programmes , viewing figures were above the programme 's predecessor Questions and Answers . The first programme had an initial audience of 464 @,@ 000 viewers . Overall , the second programme reached an audience of 653 @,@ 000 . In November 2009 , the viewership was reduced to 333 @,@ 000 , less than the 493 @,@ 000 received by The Apprentice on TV3 When George Lee appeared on the programme explaining his resignation from politics on 8 February 2010 , the viewing figures were at 627 @,@ 000 . 
 The Frontline gained nearly 70 @,@ 000 viewers when TV3 temporarily replaced its rival Tonight with Vincent Browne with UK celebrity torture show I 'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! in November 2011 .

 On 2 November 2009 , Jack O 'Connor of <unk> suggested that in the 2010 budget , " a reasonable level of tax " should be placed on " Trophy Houses " . Kenny responded by asking what is a trophy house . To this O 'Connor responded with " A house like yours , probably . " After some hesitation , Kenny quoted : 
 I built my house in 1988 . Like , why is that a trophy house ? I don ’ t want this kind of crap coming at me . 
 O 'Connor then apologised instantly . 
 The following week ( 9 November 2009 ) , during an interview with Mary <unk> , Alan O 'Brien ( who has a conviction from 2006 for incitement to hatred ) , a member of the audience , spent three minutes accusing Kenny of " pontificating and moralising " people on social welfare , despite being in receipt of a € 600 @,@ 000 salary . Then referring to a previous court case involving Kenny , he concluded by saying , " Now I am going to sue an old woman for a field because I feel I might make a million or more . " After being removed by security , the programme continued . 
 Days before the 2011 presidential election , a debate was held between the candidates on The Frontline . A tweet was read out by Pat Kenny which caused Seán Gallagher , ahead on opinion polling , to falter on live television . Michael D. Higgins subsequently won the election . A member of Gallagher 's campaign team described it as an " earth shattering " moment for Seán Gallagher . Gallagher later took RTÉ to court over its role in the sabotage of his election campaign . 
 During the debate held on 21 May 2012 concerning the Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum , Pat Kenny got down on his hands and knees and shouted at a farmer in the audience to shut up . He also promised a debate on the CAP " in January " — scheduling of which would have occurred two months after it was announced that The Frontline had been axed . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The programme generally received a " big thumbs up " . Patrick <unk> of the Sunday Tribune described the programme , in his television review column , as " the People versus A Bunch of Bastards " . He also called it " slick , pacy and well @-@ researched " . Hilary Fannin writing in The Irish Times , predicted that the programme , in relation to the economy , " will [ not ] be allowed to debate much else in the months to come " . She also rated it as one of the best current affairs programmes in 2009 . The two reviewers said that , compared to The Late Late Show , Kenny was more " in his comfort zone " . Sarah Carey , also in The Irish Times , was disappointed by the tone of the programme even though Kenny was " thoroughly enjoying himself " . She said it was a televised version of <unk> .

 Abu Hatim al @-@ Harith ibn Surayj ibn Yazid ibn Sawa ibn Ward ibn Murra ibn Sufyan ibn <unk> ( Arabic : أبو <unk> الحارث بن <unk> ) was an Arab leader of a large @-@ scale social rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate in Khurasan and Transoxiana . Harith 's rebellion began in 734 and represented the grievances of both the local Arab settlers as well as the native Iranian converts ( mawali ) , who were not recognized as equal to the Arab Muslims , against the Umayyad regime . Harith based his revolt on religious grounds and won over a large part of both the Arab settlers and the native population , but failed twice to capture the provincial capital of Marw . The rebellion was finally suppressed by Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri in 736 . Along with a few supporters , Harith managed to escape capture and allied himself with the heathen Turgesh . Harith accompanied the Turgesh khagan Suluk in his invasion deep into Arab territory , which was decisively beaten back in the Battle of Kharistan in 737 . With Turgesh power collapsing thereafter , Harith remained in Transoxiana supported by the native princes . Asad 's successor , Nasr ibn Sayyar , campaigned against Harith and his native supporters , but eventually , hoping to use him to bolster his position in the Arab intertribal rivalries , Nasr secured for Harith a pardon from the Caliph . Harith returned to Marw in 745 . Soon however he raised a sizeable armed force and challenged Nasr 's authority , until he was killed in a clash with his ally Juday ' al @-@ Kirmani in 746 . His revolt weakened Arab power in Central Asia and facilitated the beginning of the Abbasid Revolution that would overthrow the Umayyads . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and start of the rebellion = = = 
 Harith was from the Tamim tribe belonging to the north Arab ( Mudari ) tribal supergroup , and hailed from Basra , where his father , Surayj , lived . He is first mentioned in 729 , when he distinguished himself for his bravery and self @-@ sacrifice against the Turgesh , saving the Arab army from annihilation at Baykand near Bukhara . Harith is next mentioned in 733 , when he led a protest in Lower Tokharistan against the commandeering of supplies from the province , already plagued by drought and famine , to feed the capital of Khurasan at Marw , by the governor Junayd ibn Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Murri . Junayd had Harith flogged , but after Junayd died in early 734 , the discontent erupted into an open rebellion , with Harith at its head . 
 The motives and nature of Harith 's rebellion are debated . His public demands were phrased in religious terms , demanding the end of injustice through the " application of the Book and the sunna " by the government . Harith himself is said to have been a member of the obscure pietistic group known as <unk> 'a , and to have led an ascetic life . In the words of the Arabist Meir J. Kister , he apparently had " a feeling of mission " and aimed to establish a " just government resembling that of the Prophet and the first Caliphs " . His movement shared many ideological and symbolic elements with contemporary Shi 'ite and Kharijite agitation directed against the Umayyad regime , including the use of black flags hearkening back to the banner of the Prophet and even the demand for theocratic rule by a member of the Prophet 's family . Harith 's movement was marked by an unusual idealism , however , and it is recorded that his adherents tried to persuade their opponents to join them through moral and religious invocations even during battles . 
 Harith advocated various reforms , the most prominent being the full legal equality of the native non @-@ Arab converts ( mawali ) with the Arab Muslims , echoing a long @-@ standing demand of the former , in conformity with the precepts of Islam . This had been attempted twice before , by the Caliph Umar II ( r . 717 – 720 ) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al @-@ Sulami , but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue ( as the numerous mawali would not have to pay the poll tax ) put an end to this , leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al @-@ <unk> ' Salih ibn <unk> . Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith 's movement . Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the <unk> ( non @-@ Arabs , especially Iranians ) , many of whom flocked to his banner , but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves , especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd . <unk> was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731 , as well as the dissemination of anti @-@ Umayyad propaganda by proto @-@ Shi 'ite groups . This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20 @,@ 000 Iraqi troops into the province in the aftermath of the Defile , and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al @-@ Malik ( r . 723 – 743 ) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh . 
 Thus it was that when the news of Junayd 's death reached the small town of <unk> in Guzgan , one of the remotest Arab outposts , the local Arab garrison followed Harith in rebellion . Junayd 's successor , Asim ibn Abdallah al @-@ Hilali , who had just arrived at Marw , tried to placate the rebels and sent emissaries to them , but Harith simply imprisoned them . As the revolt spread through the surrounding countryside , Harith , with a force of 4 @,@ 000 men , marched on Balkh , the chief city of Tokharistan , held by Nasr ibn Sayyar with 10 @,@ 000 troops . Although Nasr did not support Harith 's movement , such was the level of disaffection among the Khurasanis that he and his men offered little opposition . Balkh was captured by Harith 's men with ease , while Nasr and his troops withdrew from the scene and gave their support to neither Harith nor Asim . Soon after that , the Arab garrison at Marw al @-@ Rudh also joined with Harith 's forces . The autonomous native Hephthalite princes of Guzgan , <unk> and <unk> also seized the opportunity to join the revolt with their forces , hoping to re @-@ establish their independence and perhaps reduce the Arab power in Khurasan to a dependent principality around Marw . 
 Harith now turned his sights on Marw and set out for the capital , where also he had sympathizers . However , Asim managed to cement the loyalty of the wavering Khurasanis by threatening to abandon the city for Naysabur on the western fringes of Khurasan . There he would rely on the Qaysi tribesmen whose loyalty to the Umayyad regime was known , and ask for reinforcements from Syria . Coupled with the presence of the numerous natives in Harith 's army , which lent it the appearance of a foreign army , the local Arab elites chose to rally behind Asim . As it neared Marw , Harith 's army had swelled to some 60 @,@ 000 men as the mawali flocked to his banner , according to the report of al @-@ Tabari . Asim 's force was considerably smaller , and less eager : he had to pay them extra money in order to induce them to fight . Nevertheless , he marched out of Marw and took up positions behind a canal at <unk> , destroying its bridges . As Harith 's army approached and repaired the bridges , more than 2 @,@ 000 Arabs from his ranks deserted to Asim , evidently mistrusting the intentions of the native troops of Harith 's army . In the subsequent battle , Asim gained a major victory , as many of Harith 's troops drowned in the canal . As a result of this failure , most of the mawali and native princes abandoned Harith , whose army was reduced to a loyal core of some 3 @,@ 000 men . This forced Harith to accept a peace offer from Asim — who likewise could not count on the continued support of the Khurasani Arabs now that the danger from the natives had passed — and retired to <unk> . However , in the next year Harith renewed his revolt and marched again on Marw . Asim could not persuade the Khurasanis to fight for him , and was left with only some 1 @,@ 000 Syrians and <unk> from his personal guard . Harith 's forces were not much larger either , being reduced to the garrison of Marw al @-@ Rudh . In the ensuing battle at the village of al @-@ <unk> near Marw , Asim again emerged victorious , forcing Harith to flee to Marw al @-@ Rudh . 
 Despite his victories , Asim 's position was still perilous . He was essentially reduced to Marw and the western , Qaysi regions of Khurasan around Naysabur . In addition , as he explained in a letter to the Caliph , as a Syrian , he faced difficulty in persuading the Khurasanis and even the Iraqi troops to fight under him against one of their own . Asim further requested that Khurasan be placed under the governor of Iraq , Khalid ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri , and that Syrian troops be dispatched into the province . In response , Khalid 's brother Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri , who had already served before as governor of Khurasan , was sent to replace him . News of this , combined probably with pressure from the Khurasanis of Marw , led Asim to again conclude a truce with Harith . According to some accounts , he even agreed to join Harith in demanding from the Caliph the " application of the Book and the sunna " , and revolt should the Caliph refuse . Shaban rejects this story altogether , but Blankinship regards it as reliable , although he too considers it a mere tactical ploy to gain time by Asim . 
 = = = End of the rebellion , the Turgesh intervention and exile = = = 
 Asad arrived in Khurasan with 20 @,@ 000 Syrian troops , and immediately took the offensive against Harith . Asad 's campaign was costly , but after his first successes the Khurasani Arabs began to flock to him . Asad 's success was aided by his long @-@ standing personal relations with the local Arab tribal leaders , as well as by the continuing tribal rivalries : as a Yamani opposed to the Mudari Harith , he could count on the support of his fellow tribesmen — thus most of the Rabi 'ah , the traditional enemies of Harith 's Tamim tribe , son defected to him . Asad divided his forces , sending the Kufan and Syrian troops under Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Na <unk> towards Marw Rudh , where Harith 's main army was located , while he himself with the Basrans and remaining Khurasanis marched on the fortresses of Amul and Zamm . The rebel forces at Amul surrendered and were pardoned , and the garrison of Balkh followed soon after . Harith himself abandoned Marw Rudh and retreated across the Oxus before Abd al @-@ Rahman , finding refuge with the princes of Tokharistan . With their aid , he laid siege to the major crossing point over the Oxus at Tirmidh . In the face of Harith 's forces , Asad 's troops dared not cross the Oxus but retreated to Balkh . However , the Tirmidh garrison managed to defeat Harith , who was weakened after a quarrel with the king of Khuttal , and who now retired eastwards to the mountains of Badakhshan . Asad followed up this success by persuading the garrison of Zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay , and by an unsuccessful expedition to recover <unk> , which had been lost in the aftermath of the Defile . 
 In the next year , 736 , Asad 's forces cleared the mountains of Upper Tokharistan from the remnants of Harith 's supporters . The fortress of <unk> , where many of Harith 's followers and relatives had found refuge , was besieged by Juday ' al @-@ Kirmani . After they surrendered , most of the men were executed , while the rest were sold into slavery . Harith himself on the other hand continued to escape capture . In 737 , Asad led his troops again north of the Oxus in a retaliatory campaign against Khuttal , whose ruler had allied himself with both Harith and the Turgesh . While the Arab troops were dispersed ravaging the countryside , the Turgesh khagan Suluk , responding to the pleas for help by the Khuttalan king , launched an attack that precipitated a headlong flight back by Asad 's army across the Oxus . The Turgesh followed after them and attacked and captured the Arab baggage train on 1 October , before both sides settled for winter quarters . Harith now emerged from hiding and joined the khagan . 
 Harith now counselled the khagan to take advantage of the dispersal of the Arab army to its winter quarters , and resume his advance . Following Harith 's advice , in early December the khagan led the Turgesh army , 30 @,@ 000 strong and comprising contingents from virtually every native ruler of Transoxiana and Upper Tokharistan , south , bypassing Balkh , into Guzgan , hoping to raise the Hephthalite princes of Lower Tokharistan in revolt as well . In this he failed , as the king of Guzgan joined Asad , who was approaching with what forces he could muster . Asad 's advance caught the khagan and Harith off guard : Asad came upon them near Kharistan when they were accompanied by only 4 @,@ 000 men , the rest having scattered to plunder and forage . In the ensuing Battle of Kharistan , Asad routed the Turgesh . Harith , who fought with distinction , and the khagan barely escaped themselves and fled north over the Oxus . Asad 's victory at Kharistan saved Arab rule in Central Asia . The Turgesh detachments south of the Oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by Juday ' al @-@ Kirmani , ending the threat to Khurasan , and the loyalty of the native rulers of Tokharistan was cemented . The khagan ′ s prestige took a serious hit , which encouraged his domestic rivals , who were backed secretly by the Chinese . In early 738 , the tarkhan Kursul assassinated Suluk , whereupon the Turgesh realm collapsed in civil war . Asad too died soon after , and was succeeded by Nasr ibn Sayyar in July 738 . 
 Nothing is known of Harith 's activities during the next two years , but he evidently remained in northern Transoxiana , based at al @-@ Shash ( Tashkent ) and in close contact with the Turgesh . In 740 or 741 , after having consolidated his authority in Khurasan and carried out tax reforms that eased the social unrest , Nasr ibn Sayyar advanced into the middle Jaxartes valley , making for Shash . His campaign was part of Nasr 's efforts to re @-@ establish Arab control over Transoxiana , but , according to H.A.R. Gibb and Kister , the main objective was the expulsion of Harith from Shash , who might still unite the Turgesh and the native princes against the Arabs . In the event , Nasr was prevented from crossing the Jaxartes by an army composed of Turgesh , troops from Shash and Harith 's followers , and was forced to withdraw after a negotiated settlement , which among other terms stipulated the removal of Harith and his adherents to the remote town of <unk> . 
 = = = Return to Khurasan , second rebellion and death = = = 
 Nasr 's campaigns and reforms consolidated Muslim rule over Khurasan and much of Transoxiana , but his success was fragile : the native princes resented their loss of autonomy and the increasing assimilation of their people by their Arab conquerors and sent embassies to the Chinese court for aid , while the rivalry between the Mudari and Yamani tribal groups , evident across the Muslim world , still divided the Arabs themselves . On the accession of the pro @-@ Yemenite caliph Yazid III in 744 , the Khurasani <unk> supported Juday ' al @-@ Kirmani 's candidature as governor , and when this did not come about , they rebelled . Consequently , Nasr felt it necessary to bring Harith and his adherents back , to both strengthen his own position — Harith and his followers had a long history of enmity towards al @-@ Kirmani — and remove a potential source for another foreign invasion . Nasr secured a full pardon for Harith and his supporters from Yazid . Their confiscated property was returned , and the Caliph even promised to rule " according to the Book and the sunna " . 
 When Harith arrived at Marw in early July 745 , however , the situation had changed : Yazid was dead , a full @-@ blown civil war had erupted in Syria , and Nasr ibn Sayyar , although still occupying the position of governor , lacked authority . Although he recognized Marwan II ( r . 744 – 750 ) , most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph . Harith was quick to distance himself from Nasr : he refused the offer of a district governorship , and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters . Harith vocally denounced Marwan II , and was soon joined by 3 @,@ 000 of his fellow <unk> , while his secretary , <unk> ibn Safwan , drummed up further support . Within a short time , he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al @-@ Kirmani . After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless , Nasr attacked Harith 's forces in March 746 , and scored a first victory over them , in which <unk> ibn Safwan fell . At this point , al @-@ Kirmani joined forces with Harith , and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur . The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan , but within days fell out and began fighting each other . In these clashes , Harith was killed , leaving al @-@ Kirmani the master of the city . The conflict between Nasr and al @-@ Kirmani continued , but was soon overtaken by events : exploiting the conditions of civil war , the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti @-@ Umayyad revolt in Khurasan . Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al @-@ Kirmani , but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith 's sons in revenge . Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage , and in early 748 , his men entered Marw , the first step in a war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later . 
 = 1971 Scottish soldiers ' killings = 
 The three Scottish soldiers ' killings was an incident that took place in Northern Ireland during the Troubles . It happened on 10 March 1971 , when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion , Royal Highland Fusiliers . Two of the three were teenage brothers ; all three were from Scotland . They were killed off @-@ duty and in civilian clothes having been lured from a city @-@ centre bar in Belfast , driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside . Whilst three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event , all three had been on @-@ duty and killed during rioting . 
 The deaths led to public mourning and protests against the Provisional IRA . Pressure to act precipitated a political crisis for the government of Northern Ireland , which led to the resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester @-@ Clark . The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to this incident . In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast . 
 = = Events = = 
 British troops had been deployed to Northern Ireland in 1969 for Operation Banner in response to a deteriorating security situation following the 1969 Northern Ireland riots . The British Army had become involved in the disturbances culminating in the Falls Curfew of July 1970 . The Provisional Irish Republican Army was created in December 1969 after a split from the Official Irish Republican Army . After the split , the Provisional IRA planned for an " all @-@ out offensive action against the British occupation " . Provisional IRA Chief of Staff Seán Mac <unk> decided they would " escalate , escalate and escalate " until the British agreed to go . The IRA Army Council sanctioned offensive operations against the British Army at the beginning of 1971 . In this year , Robert Curtis was the first British soldier shot and killed by the Provisional IRA , on 6 February 1971 , and two more soldiers were killed prior to 10 March . 
 Brothers John and Joseph McCaig from Ayr and Dougald McCaughey from Glasgow in Scotland ( ages 17 , 18 and 23 ) were privates serving with the 1st Battalion , The Royal Highland Fusiliers , stationed at Girdwood barracks in Belfast . The shootings occurred on 10 March 1971 after the three soldiers had been granted an afternoon pass which allowed them to leave their base . McCaughey 's younger brother was serving in the same unit but was on duty and unable to join them . The three soldiers were off @-@ duty , unarmed and in civilian clothes . They were drinking in " Mooney 's " , a Belfast city centre bar in Cornmarket , one of the safer areas of the city for soldiers at this stage in " the Troubles " . The three previous shootings that year had occurred in different circumstances , during rioting . One report said that the three Scottish soldiers were enticed into a car by Republican women who promised them a party . The three were taken to the White Brae , Squire 's Hill , off the <unk> Road in North Belfast . There they were murdered by Provisional IRA members ; two were shot in the back of the head and the other in the chest . 
 The inquest in August 1971 was not able to establish the exact sequence of events . It was established that all three were shot at very close range , probably in a line . All had been drinking , and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated . The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road . The coroner commented : " You may think that this was not only murder , but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory " . The bodies were heaped on top of each other with two beer glasses lying near to them . After failing to return to their barracks by 18 : 30 the three were listed as AWOL . Their bodies were found by children at 21 : 30 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The day after the killings , British Home Secretary Reginald Maudling made a statement in the House of Commons in which he informed the house that security arrangements for off @-@ duty soldiers were being reviewed and suggested that the aim of the killers was to provoke the security forces into reprisals . He said that : 
 The battle now joined against the terrorists will be fought with the utmost vigour and determination . It is a battle against a small minority of armed and ruthless men whose strength lies not so much in their numbers as in their wickedness . 
 The funerals were held in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr . Their older brother , serving with the Royal Marines in Singapore , was flown home for the service . That day , 20 @,@ 000 people attended rallies in Belfast and Carrickfergus . In Belfast , the cenotaph at the City Hall was the focus of the mourning with 10 @,@ 000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre . Many wept openly . The Reverend Ian Paisley led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths . The crowd observed a two @-@ minute silence and sang a hymn and the national anthem . 
 The deaths lead to a crisis for the government of Northern Ireland with calls for increased security measures . Ian Paisley demanded the Stormont Government 's resignation , saying " We can no longer tolerate your weakness . You must go before the whole land is deluged with the blood of innocent men and women . " On 12 March , 4 @,@ 000 shipyard workers took to the streets of Belfast to demand internment . The Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester @-@ Clark flew to London to request more troops , and when the numbers were not what he wanted , he resigned . On 23 March 1971 , Brian Faulkner was elected Ulster Unionist Party leader and was appointed Prime Minister the same day . 
 The British Army raised the minimum age for serving in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to the death of 17 @-@ year @-@ old John McCaig . 
 No one has been convicted of the killings . The Daily Mirror reported in November 2007 that three Provisional IRA men were responsible for the deaths : Martin Meehan ( died 2007 ) , Patrick <unk> , and a third unnamed man . Meehan was questioned over the killings but was never charged . <unk> was shot and killed in August 1971 during a gun battle in the Ardoyne area of Belfast . He was also suspected of the fatal shooting , hours before his own death , of Private Malcolm Hatton of the Green Howards . The case of the three soldiers is one of those being re @-@ examined by the Police Service of Northern Ireland 's Historical Enquiries Team .

 The mother of the two McCaig brothers visited the site of their deaths in May 1972 . She expressed a wish to leave a monument to her sons but was advised that it might well be damaged by vandals . She later said that she was touched by the wreaths and flowers that had been left at the spot . 
 In 2010 the Royal British Legion <unk> / <unk> branch in Belfast raised money from the sale of badges to erect a memorial to the men . On 28 May 2010 , a memorial stone was placed at the site of the killings on Squire 's Hill by the families and former regimental colleagues of the three soldiers . The next day a 15 @-@ foot obelisk incorporating carved images of the deceased was dedicated to the soldiers at nearby <unk> Avenue . A service of remembrance with regimental drums and colours was then held at <unk> leisure centre attended by around 1000 people including Lord Mayor of Belfast Naomi Long and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds .

 The memorial at White Brae , <unk> , that marks the place of the killings was vandalised in July 2011 . Sectarian graffiti was daubed on the memorial and the stones surrounding the memorial were scattered across the road . The ceremonial ropes were ripped off and the poppy wreaths that had been laid at a recent ceremony on 29 May 2011 to mark the first anniversary of the memorial 's opening were scattered across nearby fields . The memorial has been attacked on numerous occasions since , costing thousands to repair . Memorial vandalised again in hate crime . Since the erection of the memorial , there have been 23 attacks of vandalism . 
 = Othnielosaurus = 
 Othnielosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur that lived about 155 to 148 million years ago , during the Late Jurassic @-@ age Morrison Formation of the western United States . It is named in honor of famed paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh , and was formerly assigned to the genus Laosaurus . This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in Othnielia , which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name ; as such , it is part of decades of research to untangle the taxonomy left behind by Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker Cope from the Bone Wars . Othnielosaurus has usually been classified as a hypsilophodont , a type of generalized small bipedal herbivore or omnivore , although recent research has called this and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question . 
 = = Description = = 
 Othnielosaurus is known from material from all parts of the body , including two good skeletons , although the skull is still poorly known ( note that earlier references use a multitude of names for this material , with most of them since 1977 using Othnielia rex ) . Othnielosaurus was a small animal , 2 meters ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) or less in length and 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) or less in weight . It was a bipedal dinosaur with short forelimbs and long hindlimbs with large processes for muscle attachments . The hands were short and broad with short fingers . From the partial type skull and the skull on the possible specimen " Barbara " , the head was small . It had small leaf @-@ shaped cheek teeth ( triangular and with small ridges and denticles lining the front and back edges ) , and premaxillary teeth with less ornamentation . Like several hypsilophodont or iguanodont @-@ grade ornithopods such as Hypsilophodon , Thescelosaurus , and <unk> , Othnielosaurus had thin plates lying along the ribs . Called intercostal plates , these structures were cartilaginous in origin . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Othnielosaurus ( previously under the names Laosaurus , Nanosaurus , and Othnielia ) has typically been regarded as a hypsilophodont ornithopod , a member of a nebulous and poorly defined group of small , running herbivorous dinosaurs . This was challenged by Robert Bakker et al. in 1990 . In their description of the new taxon Drinker nisti , they split Othnielia into two species ( O. rex and O. consors ) and placed " <unk> " as more basal than hypsilophodontids . With recent analyses suggesting a paraphyletic Hypsilophodontidae , the general idea of " <unk> " as basal to other hypsilophodonts has been supported , although Drinker has been controversial because virtually nothing new has been published on it since its description . Other basal ornithopods have sometimes been linked to Othnielosaurus , particularly <unk> , considered by at least one author to be a species of " Othnielia " , O. <unk> . New studies concur with the hypothesis that Othnielosaurus is more basal than other traditional hypsilophodonts , but go even farther and remove the genus from Ornithopoda and the larger group <unk> , which also includes horned dinosaurs and <unk> dinosaurs . 
 = = History and taxonomy = = 
 O.C. Marsh named several species and genera in the late 19th century that have come to be recognized as hypsilophodonts or hypsilophodont @-@ like animals , including Nanosaurus agilis ( possibly ) , " N. " rex , Laosaurus celer , L. consors , and L. gracilis . This taxonomy has become very complicated , with numerous attempts at revision in the years since . 
 In 1877 , Marsh named two species of Nanosaurus in separate publications , based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park , Colorado . One paper described N. agilis , based on YPM 1913 , with remains including impressions of a dentary , and postcranial bits including an ilium , thigh bones , shin bones , and a fibula . The other paper named N. rex , a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 ( also called 1925 in Galton , 2007 ) , a complete thigh bone . He regarded both species as small ( " fox @-@ sized " ) animals . He assigned this genus to the now @-@ abandoned family <unk> . 
 The next year , he named the new genus Laosaurus on material collected by Samuel Wendell Williston from Como Bluff , Wyoming . Two species were named : the type species L. celer , based on parts of eleven vertebrae ( YPM 1875 ) ; and the " smaller " L. gracilis , originally based on a back vertebra 's centrum , a caudal centrum , and part of an ulna ( review by Peter Galton in 1983 finds the specimen to now consist of thirteen back and eight caudal centra , and portions of both hindlimbs ) . 
 A third species , L. consors , was established by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882 , which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part of at least one other individual . The skull was only partially preserved , and the fact that the vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual . Galton ( 1983 ) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster , or had paint applied . 
 These animals attracted little professional attention until the 1970s and 1980s , when Peter Galton reviewed many the " hypsilophodonts " in a series of papers . In 1973 , he and Jim Jensen described a partial skeleton ( BYU ESM 163 as of Galton , 2007 ) missing the head , hands , and tail as Nanosaurus ( ? ) rex , which had been damaged by other collectors prior to description . By 1977 , he had determined that Nanosaurus agilis was quite different from N. rex and the new skeleton , and coined Othnielia for N. rex . The 1977 reference , somewhat buried in a paper concerning the transcontinental species of Dryosaurus , did not elaborate , but did assign Laosaurus consors and L. gracilis to the new genus , and considered L. celer a nomen nudum . The publication of Drinker further complicated matters . 
 Most recently , in 2007 Galton reevaluated Morrison Formation ornithischians and concluded that the femur on which " Nanosaurus " rex ( and by extension Othnielia ) is based is not diagnostic , and reassigned the BYU skeleton to Laosaurus consors , which is based on more diagnostic material . As the genus Laosaurus is also based on nondiagnostic material , he gave the species L. consors its own genus , Othnielosaurus . As a result , in practical terms , what had been thought of as Othnielia is now known as Othnielosaurus consors . Othnielia is not a synonym of Othnielosaurus , because they are based on different specimens ; however , the skeletons that had been used to describe and depict Othnielia were reassigned to Othnielosaurus , leaving the older name with only the original femur . The current status for the various species is as follows : Nanosaurus agilis is a possible basal ornithopod , " N. " rex ( Othnielia ) is a dubious basal ornithopod , Drinker nisti is its own tentatively valid taxon , L. consors is the type species for Othnielosaurus , and L. celer and L. gracilis are still considered dubious . 
 = = Paleobiology and paleoecology = = 
 Othnielosaurus was one of the smaller members of the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna , diminutive in comparison to the giant sauropods . The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons , and flat floodplains . Vegetation varied from river @-@ lining gallery forests of conifers , tree ferns , and ferns , to fern savannas with rare trees . It has been a rich fossil hunting ground , holding fossils of green algae , fungi , mosses , horsetails , ferns , cycads , ginkgoes , and several families of conifers . Other fossils discovered include bivalves , snails , ray @-@ finned fishes , frogs , salamanders , turtles , sphenodonts , lizards , terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans , several species of pterosaur , numerous dinosaur species , and early mammals such as docodonts , multituberculates , symmetrodonts , and triconodonts . Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus , Allosaurus , Ornitholestes , and Torvosaurus , the sauropods Apatosaurus , Brachiosaurus , Camarasaurus , and Diplodocus , and the ornithischians Camptosaurus , Dryosaurus , and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison . Othnielosaurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2 @-@ 5 . 
 Typically , Othnielosaurus has been interpreted like other hypsilophodonts as a small , swift herbivore , although Bakker ( 1986 ) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an omnivore . This idea has had some unofficial support , but little in the formal literature ; description of more complete skull remains will be needed to test this hypothesis .

 = Tropical Storm Edouard ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Edouard brought coastal and minor inland flooding to Louisiana and Texas in August 2008 . The fifth tropical cyclone and fifth named storm of the hurricane season , Edouard developed from a trough in the northern Gulf of Mexico on August 3 . After developing into a tropical depression , it gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Edouard on August 4 . However , northerly wind shear initially halted any further significant intensification and also caused the storm to struggle to maintain deep convection over the center . Edouard eventually intensified further and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on August 5 . Shortly thereafter , the storm made landfall near Gilchrist , Texas later that day . Edouard quickly weakened and was downgraded to tropical depression by early on August 6 , six hours before degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . 
 Due to the relatively weak nature of the storm , impact was generally minor . Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities . The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana . Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state , especially in Cameron Parish . Relatively strong winds left more than 2 @,@ 000 without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes . Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas , particularly in the Gilchrist area . At least 25 homes sustained damage , while portions of a few major roads , such as Interstate 10 , were closed . Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall , with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown . Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes , downed trees , and left about 300 @,@ 000 people without electricity . Overall , damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $ 550 @,@ 000 ( 2008 USD ) .

 On August 2 , 2008 , a trough entered the northern Gulf of Mexico , with a low pressure area developing near Apalachicola , Florida . The system maintained scattered deep convection across offshore waters and environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis . The system tracked generally west @-@ southwestward , due to its position south of a subtropical ridge extending from Texas through Florida . On the afternoon of August 3 , a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the development of a well @-@ defined center of circulation , slightly exposed from a disorganized area of thunderstorms . As a result , the system developed into Tropical Depression Five at 1200 UTC on August 3 , while located about 85 miles ( 140 km ) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River . Because the depression was initially located in an area of northerly wind shear and dry air , the National Hurricane Center forecast it to slowly intensify . 
 After a burst in deep convection late on August 3 , Hurricane Hunter data indicated flight level winds of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . At 0000 UTC on August 4 , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edouard . Later that day , convection temporarily decreased around the center , though a brief convective flare up on its east side occurred early on August 5 . Due to decreasing westerly wind shear , the center was nearly surrounded by convection that afternoon . Further organization continued and at 1200 UTC on August 5 , Edouard attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . Simultaneously , the storm made landfall at the <unk> and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges near Gilchrist , Texas at the same intensity . It weakened rapidly after moving inland and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on August 5 . Edouard then re @-@ curved northwest over eastern Texas , before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area at 0600 UTC on August 6 . The remnant low continued northwestward until dissipating over northern Texas early on August 7 .

 Several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in association with Tropical Storm Edouard . At 2100 UTC on August 3 , a tropical storm watch was posted from Intracoastal City , Louisiana to Port O 'Connor , Texas . Simultaneously , a tropical storm warning was issued from Intracoastal City to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana . The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane watch early on August 4 . Around that time , the tropical storm warning was extended from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Cameron , Louisiana . At 0900 UTC on August 4 , the tropical storm warning was revised to reach San Luis Pass , Texas . The hurricane watch was modified from Grand Isle , Louisiana to Sargent , Texas . The tropical storm warning was extended to include the mouth of the Mississippi River to Port O 'Connor at 1500 UTC on August 5 . At that time , the tropical storm warning was modified again to stretch from San Luis Pass to Cameron . Late on August 5 , all tropical cyclones were discontinued . 
 In the Gulf of Mexico , Shell Oil evacuated about 40 workers from drilling operations . BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms in the western and central Gulf , though neither predicted substantial effects on production . A few oil refineries on land were closed , such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City , Texas . Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17 Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard . Perry activated up to 1 @,@ 200 National Guard troops , a 70 member rescue team , six helicopters , and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas . Under the order , about 200 buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations . Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte . The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston @-@ Houston area by late on August 4 . Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency . In Cameron Parish , Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation , where Sheriff 's deputies also erected roadblocks .

Along the coast , storm surge in Louisiana generally ran 4 to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal , although a slightly higher tide was reported near Intracoastal City . Due to the storm surge , part of Louisiana Highway 82 was closed between Holly Beach and Johnson Bayou . Additionally , Interstate 10 was also flooded by storm surge . Minor flooding from the surge traveled up the Calcasieu River to Lake Charles , where water flooded a local yacht club . Low @-@ lying areas of Intracoastal City were flooded , disrupting marine industries . A man fell overboard from a shrimp boat in rough seas from Edouard near the mouth of the Mississippi River . 
 Three locations reported tropical storm force winds , including 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) on Timbalier Island , 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) in Calcasieu Pass , and 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) on Marsh Island . In Cameron , Vermilion , and Calcasieu Parishes , wind gusts were mainly between 40 and 60 mph ( 64 and 97 km / h ) , though a gust of 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) was observed at Calcasieu Pass .

 = Italian cruiser Dogali = 
 Dogali was a unique protected cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1880s . Notably , she was the first warship equipped with triple @-@ expansion engines . The ship was originally ordered by the Greek Navy and named Salamis , but she was sold to the Regia Marina before she was completed and renamed for the Battle of Dogali . She was armed with a main battery of six 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns and reached a speed of 19 @.@ 66 knots ( 36 @.@ 41 km / h ; 22 @.@ 62 mph ) on her sea trials , making her one of the fastest cruisers at the time . 
 Dogali 's career was uneventful ; she served with the main Italian fleet for the first few years of her career and visited the United States in 1893 for the start of the World 's Columbian Exposition . In January 1908 , the ship was sold to Uruguay and renamed 25 de Agosto and later Montevideo . In 1914 , the cruiser was withdrawn from service , but she was not disposed of until 1932 when she was sold for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Dogali was designed by the British naval architect William Henry White and built at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard at Elswick . The ship was 76 @.@ 2 meters ( 250 ft ) long and had a beam of 11 @.@ 28 m ( 37 @.@ 0 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 42 m ( 14 @.@ 5 ft ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 050 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 020 long tons ; 2 @,@ 260 short tons ) . The ship was fitted with two pole masts , and originally , a sailing rig that was later removed . Revolving , armored spotting tops were mounted on the masts . She had a crew of 224 officers and enlisted men , though this was later increased to 247 . 
 Dogali was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion engines , the first set of this kind of machinery ever installed in a warship . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers that were trunked into two funnels on the centerline . The engines were rated at 5 @,@ 012 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 737 kW ) and could produce a top speed of 17 @.@ 68 knots ( 32 @.@ 74 km / h ; 20 @.@ 35 mph ) , though on trials her engines reached 7 @,@ 179 ihp ( 5 @,@ 353 kW ) and 19 @.@ 66 knots ( 36 @.@ 41 km / h ; 22 @.@ 62 mph ) . Dogali had a cruising radius of 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . At the time of her commissioning , Dogali was among the fastest cruisers in the world . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of six 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns all mounted individually in sponsons , with two side by side forward , two astern , and one amidships on each broadside . These were Pattern M guns manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth , and they weighed 2 t ( 2 @.@ 0 long tons ; 2 @.@ 2 short tons ) apiece . Dogali was the only ship equipped with guns of this type . These were supplemented by a secondary battery of nine 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) L / 40 guns and six Gatling guns . She was also equipped with four 356 mm ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 50 mm ( 2 in ) thick , and the conning tower had the same thickness of armor plating on the sides . The main guns were protected by 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick gun shields . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for the new cruiser was laid down at Armstrong Whitworth on 13 February 1885 , and the completed hull was launched on 23 December that year . The ship was originally ordered by the Greek Navy and was to be named Salamis , but she was purchased by Italy during construction . She was first renamed Angelo Emo , and then Dogali before being commissioned on 28 April 1887 . In 1890 , Dogali participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron , along with the ironclad Lepanto , the protected cruiser Piemonte , and several torpedo boats . The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea , where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking " hostile " squadron . 
 Dogali and the protected cruisers Etna and Giovanni Bausan represented Italy at the international naval review in New York , held at the start of the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . The Exposition marked the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's arrival in North America . Contingents from France , Germany , Britain , Spain , and several other nations also participated in the celebration . Later that year , Dogali and Giovanni Bausan were present in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil during the Revolta da Armada ( Revolt of the Fleet ) , along with cruisers from Britain , France , Germany , Spain , and Argentina . The foreign warships were all tasked with protecting the interests of their respective nationals in the area . On 1 February 1897 , Dogali was assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main Italian fleet , along with the cruisers Marco Polo , Umbria and Liguria . 
 In 1906 , while cruising in North American waters , Dogali stopped at the Pensacola Navy Yard , where she had some maintenance done on her engines . Later that year she was present for a ceremony in Capitán <unk> , Chile , a town founded by Italian immigrants . In January 1908 , the Italian government sold Dogali to Uruguay . She was renamed 25 de Agosto for the date Uruguay declared its independence . At the time , she was the largest warship in the Uruguayan Navy . In 1910 , the ship was renamed Montevideo after the country 's capital city . She was decommissioned in 1914 , but remained in the Uruguayan Navy 's inventory until 1932 , when the old cruiser was finally sold to be broken up .

At Hollow Road , MD 615 has a ramp to eastbound I @-@ 70 and US 40 ; the ramp also provides access to a parking lot for the Western Maryland Rail Trail and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park . The highway continues west until it intersects the ramps to and from I @-@ 70 and US 40 in the direction of Hancock . MD 615 's name changes to Heavenly Acres Ridge Road and curves north to climb out of the narrow valley of the Potomac River onto Heavenly Acres Ridge .

 The Millstone Road portion of MD 615 follows a narrow corridor on the north side of the Potomac River that has carried multiple modes of transportation between Hancock and Licking Creek , where the river valley opens up . In the early 20th century , this corridor featured the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal , the Western Maryland Railway , and the National Pike , which ran between the canal and the railroad . When the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed the state road between Hancock and Licking Creek in 1915 , the highway was placed on a new alignment north of the railroad tracks to eliminate four grade crossings . This highway was designated US 40 in 1927 . The Heavenly Acres Ridge portion of MD 615 was paved from US 40 to the Pennsylvania state line in 1936 . By 1939 , White Oak Ridge Road was also marked as MD 615 . White Oak Ridge Road retained the state highway designation until 1956 . In 1960 , US 40 was constructed parallel to its existing alignment as a freeway from the east end of Main Street in Hancock to what is now the eastern end of MD 615 . This upgrade included the modern ramps between the freeway and Millstone Road . This freeway was marked as I @-@ 70 in addition to US 40 in 1962 and MD 615 was extended south and east from Heavenly Acres Ridge Road along its modern extent .

 = Soviet – Albanian split = 
 The Soviet – Albanian split refers to the worsening of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) and the People 's Republic of Albania , which occurred in the 1955 – 1961 period as a result of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev 's rapprochement with Yugoslavia along with his " Secret Speech " and subsequent de @-@ Stalinization policies , including efforts to extend these policies into Albania as was occurring in other Eastern Bloc states at the time . The Albanian leadership under Enver Hoxha perceived Khrushchev 's policies as contrary to Marxist – Leninist doctrine and his denunciation of Joseph Stalin as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize revisionism within the international communist movement . Occurring within the context of the larger split between China and the USSR , the Soviet – Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of relations in 1961 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The Communist Party of Albania ( known as the Party of Labour of Albania after 1948 ) was founded in November 1941 in the context of the foreign occupation of the country , with the majority of its members including its leader , Enver Hoxha , having no connection to the Comintern . Historian Jon Halliday has commented that " it was set up without any known direct contact with Moscow . It was not at all a ' Moscow creation ' ... the bulk of the founding leadership were middle @-@ class intellectuals on whom the strongest influences were Western intellectual traditions . " Albania furthermore was the only country in Eastern Europe which had liberated itself without the presence of the Red Army on its soil . A combination of these factors led Stalin to initially have been " both curious and suspicious about the only leader of a Communist regime in the Soviet bloc who escaped from any historical ties or contact with the Soviet Union . " This , Halliday continues , " was true not just of Hoxha as an individual , but of almost the entire leading group in Albania . " Despite this , however , Hoxha was " the quintessential Stalinist . Many of the descriptions Nikita Khrushchev used to denounce Josef Stalin ... could easily be applied to Enver Hoxha . " 
 Following Albania 's liberation on November 29 , 1944 the country 's economic and foreign policies were dominated by its neighbor Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito , and Albania became in the words of historian Miranda Vickers a " sub @-@ satellite . " During this period ties with the Soviet Union remained limited , though formal diplomatic relations were established in December 1945 . 
 = = = Soviet – Yugoslav split = = = 
 Within the leadership of the Communist Party of Albania tensions arose between pro- and anti @-@ Yugoslav factions and personalities , with the former increasingly coming under attack by <unk> Xoxe , the head of the pro @-@ Yugoslav faction . Hoxha was threatened on the basis of his opposition to the pro @-@ Yugoslav line , as Xoxe 's final goal was to overthrow Hoxha and to incorporate Albania into Yugoslavia as its Seventh Republic . The Soviet – Yugoslav split in 1948 , however , had allowed Albania to break from Yugoslav dominance , and it became the first state to side with the Information Bureau ( better known in the West as the Cominform ) with its resolution attacking the Yugoslav leadership for allegedly pursuing a road of nationalist deviation and capitalist restoration . From that point onwards relations between Albania and the Soviet Union " remained quite close until March 5 , 1953 , " when Stalin died . In the words of historian Nicholas C. Pano , " by the beginning of 1949 , Albania had progressed from the status of a sub @-@ satellite to that of a full @-@ fledged satellite of the Soviet Union . " Albania became a member of Comecon in 1949 and the Warsaw Treaty upon its founding in 1955 . In addition the Soviets built a submarine base at Vlora in 1952 . 
 = = = Stalin 's death = = = 
 In his memoirs Hoxha recounts the apprehension he and others had about the post @-@ Stalin leadership , just days after Stalin 's death . " The way in which the death of Stalin was announced and his funeral ceremony was organized created the impression ... that many members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had been awaiting his death impatiently . " A meeting with Soviet leaders held in June that year further raised his suspicions about the intentions of the new leadership , as did a reduction in Soviet and Eastern Bloc aid to Albania early in 1954 as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev " seemed to believe that the high cost of aid to support Albania was not worth the return in terms of Soviet strategic interests in the country . " Reacting to early post @-@ Stalin Soviet pressure on the East European countries to pursue economic and political reforms , Albania announced slight changes in planning priorities and some willingness to improve state relations with Yugoslavia as the Soviets were doing . There was also a reshuffling of political portfolios in line with the Soviet re @-@ emphasis on the principle of collective leadership . 
 Hoxha regarded Soviet pressure as acting in the service of ulterior , revisionist aims in an effort to unseat or otherwise undermine " Stalinist " leaders . Thus in a meeting with Khrushchev on the issue of collective leadership , he recalled that , " Khrushchev told us that the other sister parties had been told of the Soviet ' experience ' of who should be first secretary of the party and who prime minister in the countries of people 's democracy . ' We talked over these questions with the Polish comrades before the congress of their party , ' Khrushchev told us . ' We thrashed matters out thoroughly and thought that Comrade Bierut should remain chairman of the Council of Ministers and Comrade Ochab should be appointed first secretary of the party ... ' Hence , right from the start Khrushchev was for pushing Bierut aside in the leadership of the party ... [ the Soviets ] were giving the green light for all the revisionist elements , who , up till yesterday , were wriggling and keeping a low profile , awaiting the opportune moments . Now these moments were being created by Khrushchev who , with his actions , stands and ' new ideas ' , was becoming the inspirer and organizer of ' changes ' and ' reorganizations ' . " 
 = = Beginnings of the split = = 
 Jon Halliday has noted that , " On the surface , relations between Moscow and Tirana seemed good right up to the late 1950s " but that Khrushchev 's rapprochement with Yugoslavia in 1955 and his denunciation of Stalin in 1956 were the two main issues responsible for the deterioration of relations between the two states . In June 1954 Khrushchev sent a letter to the leaders of the parties of the Eastern Bloc in which the Cominform resolutions denouncing Yugoslavia in the 1948 – 49 period were criticized for allegedly forcing Tito and the rest of the Yugoslav leadership " into the arms of the United States and Great Britain and had led to Yugoslavia 's conclusion of a military pact with two NATO members . " Hoxha , however , disagreed with this view , later writing that " even if the Yugoslav leadership had been unjustly condemned in 1949 , as Khrushchev was claiming , nothing could permit or justify its falling into the lap of imperialism . " 
 In May 1955 Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade with the aim of rehabilitating Tito , a move which encouraged reformist and dissident trends in Eastern Europe . The Albanian government had received a letter two days before the Soviet delegation was to leave Moscow : in it , the Soviets requested that the Albanians approve a statement drawn up by Khrushchev in the name of the Information Bureau even though he had not convened it . The move was refused by the Albanians " on the grounds that there had been no change in the line of the Yugoslav leadership since it had been condemned by the 1948 resolution of communist and workers ' parties represented on the Bureau . " On May 25 the Central Committee of the Party of Labour sent a letter to its Soviet counterpart stating among other things that , " In our opinion such a hasty ( and ill @-@ considered ) decision on an issue of great importance and of principle " was conducted " without first making a profound analysis together with all the parties interested in this issue . " With only Albania among the Eastern Bloc states opposing Khrushchev 's move , the Soviets succeeded in unilaterally rehabilitating Tito 's standing within the international communist movement and apologized for past Soviet activities in relation to Yugoslavia . 
 = = = Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union = = = 
 At the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956 Khrushchev issued , in addition to his main report , his " Secret Speech " denouncing Stalin . Hoxha later remarked of the Congress that , in addition to its attack on Stalin , " All the distortions of the major issues of principle , such as those about the character of our epoch , the roads of transition to socialism , peaceful coexistence , war and peace , the stand towards modern revisionism and towards imperialism , etc . , etc . , which later became the basis of the great , open polemic with modern revisionism , have their official beginning in Khrushchev 's report to the 20th Congress ... we saw how the Khrushchevites , in order to consolidate their power , operated allegedly with ' a great party spirit ' , ' free from the fear of Stalin ' ... Every good thing of the past was distorted , allegedly in light of the ' new situations ' , ' new developments ' , ' new roads and possibilities ' , in order to go ahead . " 
 A notable event at the Congress was the promotion of the policy of " peaceful coexistence " by Khrushchev , which officially was a policy to increase East @-@ West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war , but which anti @-@ revisionists believed " was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy . " One anti @-@ revisionist author described Khrushchev 's policy as follows : " Khrushchev made it clear that he was prepared to give up international class struggle , renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising ' peaceful transition to socialism ' or the Parliamentary road ... " He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that " ' if any mad man wanted war , we [ the Soviet Union and the United States ] , the two strongest countries in the world , would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off . ' "

 One of Tito 's preconditions for improving relations with the Soviets was for a Soviet @-@ backed removal of " Stalinist " leaders in Eastern Europe , such as Mátyás Rákosi of Hungary and <unk> <unk> of Bulgaria ; Hoxha was also an obvious target for removal due to his intransigent position on Yugoslavia . The Soviets sought without success to force Hoxha to rehabilitate <unk> Xoxe . In April 1956 a party conference was held in Tirana : various delegates , inspired by Khrushchev 's actions , attacked the line of the Party of Labour , calling for a review of the case of Xoxe along with other political and economic policies and phenomena . However , Hoxha entered the conference and managed to defeat these proposals . The Third Congress of the Party of Labour was convened a month later , electing a Central Committee and Politburo " composed of staunch Hoxha loyalists " while also demonstrating " Hoxha 's first public defiance of the Soviet Union " by refusing to rehabilitate Xoxe and other persons linked with , or otherwise supportive of , rapprochement with Yugoslavia . 
 Although the Third Party Congress did not openly criticize the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU in part because " the real aims of [ the Soviets ] were still not fully recognized " and there was a perceived need to keep intact the unity of the international communist movement , it did declare that the line of the Party of Labour which had been " followed up to now has been correct " and thus tacitly rejected Khrushchev 's " de @-@ Stalinization " policies . 
 Following the Hungarian Uprising in November 1956 relations between Albania and the Soviet Union improved somewhat due to Yugoslavia 's part in the event , which caused friction in Yugoslav @-@ Soviet relations . On November 7 Hoxha wrote an article for Pravda denouncing Tito for encouraging the activity of the rebels , though the Soviets rebuked Hoxha for his harsh tone soon after . Soviet efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia resumed before long , prompting a further deterioration in Soviet – Albanian relations . 
 = = = 1957 plenum = = = 
 In a February 1957 speech to a plenum of the Central Committee of the Party subsequently published in the newspaper Zëri i Popullit , Hoxha defended Stalin 's legacy and attacked the Yugoslavs ( but not the Soviet leadership by name . ) He added that , " In blackening Stalin , the enemies are not concerned about him as a person , but their aim is to discredit the Soviet Union , the socialist system , and the international communist movement , consequently , to undermine the workers ' faith in socialism . " 
 As a result of the February plenum of 1957 , which was seen as directly rebuffing many post @-@ Stalin Soviet views , the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations . Instead , Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress ; Hoxha refused . In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being " hell @-@ bent on pursuing Stalinist policies . " Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows : Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia , to which Hoxha replied , " We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia , but to put it bluntly , we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders , because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism @-@ Leninism . In all their propaganda , they do not say one word against imperialism , on the contrary , [ they ] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us . " He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand " any of its grave mistakes and deviations , " to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism – Leninism though it had " slipped " from its positions . " According to you , " Khrushchev continued , " we ought to return to what Stalin did , which caused all these things we know about . " The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded , " You are like Stalin who killed people , " to which Hoxha replied , " Stalin killed traitors , and we kill them , too . "

 In an effort to persuade the Albanian leadership to reconcile itself with the Soviets , the USSR gave a credit of $ 160 million ruble loan to Albania in late 1957 for Albania 's Third Five @-@ Year Plan and among other things forgave $ 105 million in past debts Albania owed the Soviet Union . These efforts proved unsuccessful in persuading the Albanians to change their course . James S. O 'Donnell remarked that the Soviets , then in an early stage of the Sino @-@ Soviet split , may have also tried to demonstrate Soviet " generosity " in an effort to counteract the amount of trade Albania was conducting with the People 's Republic of China . Albania 's passive trade balance with China had grown from 4 @.@ 2 % in 1955 to 21 @.@ 6 % in 1957 .

 Relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia deteriorated further following Tito 's refusal to attend the 1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers ' Parties , the goal of which was to establish the general line and common positions of the international communist movement . As Hoxha later wrote , " Khrushchev and Co. made feverish efforts not only to ensure that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia would take part as a ' party of a socialist country ' , but if possible also , to ensure that Tito would reach agreement with Khrushchev over the platform ... Each side wanted to exploit the meeting for its own aims : Khrushchev , to declare ' unity ' , even with painful concessions to satisfy and draw in Tito , while the latter , to urge the others to openly and finally abandon Marxism @-@ Leninism , the struggle against modern revisionism and any principled stand . " The Albanian delegation led by Hoxha worked with the Chinese and other like @-@ minded delegations to the Conference in drafting a declaration alongside the CPSU and the pro @-@ Soviet parties , with the resulting document being described by some Western observers as a compromise ; historian William E. Griffith wrote that " the statement leaned strongly toward the Russian position but usually was sufficiently ambiguous so that the Chinese and Albanians could ( and did ) interpret it in their favor . " In a notable example , the Albanian and Chinese view that revisionism was the " principal danger in the communist world " existed alongside the Soviet view that the Twentieth Party Congress " opened a new stage in the international communist movement , " but despite this the declaration was considered overall by both Albania and China as an ideological victory . In Hoxha 's view , " The whole concern of the Soviet Khrushchevites was ' to preserve unity ' , to keep the socialist countries and the communist parties of different countries in check ... They retreated , held back temporarily , in order to gather strength and take their revisionist revenge in the future . " O 'Donnell states that after the Moscow Conference any trouble in Soviet – Albanian relations " was kept strictly private " until June 1960 . 
 = = The split deepens = = 
 At the end of 1958 Comecon had begun to push for what was later termed an " international socialist division of labor , " in which Albania was relegated to " the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials . " In May 1959 Khrushchev paid a visit to Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania 's leadership into building up Yugoslav – Albanian and Soviet – Albanian ties and also to , in the words of historian Miranda Vickers , " focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry ... Khrushchev 's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust , which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled . " According to Hoxha , Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in Butrint and said to Rodion Malinovsky , the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him , " Look , how marvelous this is ! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here . These old things [ reference to archaeological findings ] should be dug up and thrown into the sea ... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean . From here we can paralyze and attack everything . " He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country " into a flourishing garden , " suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists , and that rather than produce grain , Albania should focus on growing oranges for export . Khrushchev allegedly said , " The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat more than you can produce here . " 
 By the beginning of 1960 Albania and China had concurred " on such questions as Yugoslav revisionism , global strategy , and de @-@ Stalinization " and the Albanian leadership made " little secret of their sympathies for the Chinese stand . " With the Sino @-@ Soviet split also deepening the Soviet leadership began applying its first signs of economic pressure on Albania in March 1960 , stating its intention to alter a scholarship agreement for Albanians to study in the USSR in which the Soviets paid 60 % of tuition costs and upkeep for the students ; this threat was subsequently retracted on the eve of the Bucharest Conference in June that year , possibly in an attempt not to push Albania further into the Chinese orbit . 
 Early in June , however , Khrushchev met with Greek politician Sophocles Venizelos and reacted positively to the latter 's suggestion of greater autonomy for Greeks in Albania ; O 'Donnell comments that , " The obvious purpose of this discussion was to infuriate Enver Hoxha as Albanian @-@ Greek relations were strained at this time . It became known that Khrushchev had hinted to Venizelos that the Soviet Union would not be against territorial and / or political concessions to the Greeks by the Albanians ... It is likely that Khrushchev used the meeting with Venizelos as a way to pay back Hoxha for snubbing him during his visit to Albania . " Griffith comments that , " Hoxha viewed this move by Khrushchev as an implicit threat to partition Albania – the overwhelming traditional fear of all Albanian nationalists . " 
 = = = Bucharest Conference = = = 
 At the opening of the Bucharest Conference on June 21 , held on the occasion of the Third Congress of the Romanian Communist Party , Hoxha was not among the various heads of communist parties and states in attendance ; Politburo member Hysni Kapo took his place . The stated purpose of the Conference was to have " the character of a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers ' parties , mainly for the purpose of ' exchanging opinions ' and taking a joint decision on the date and place of a future meeting of the communist and workers ' parties of the world . " In his memoirs Hoxha describes the Conference as being " putsch " and adds , " The revisionist renegades needed another meeting of international communism to gain approval for their old plan for the final legitimization of modern revisionism , " he did not attend because " [ we ] suspected that the problem of the differences which had emerged between China and the Soviet Union would be discussed ... we had heard only of one side of the argument , the Soviet side , and were not acquainted with the objections of the Chinese ... They had to be thrashed out thoroughly , had to be studied carefully , and time was required for this . Therefore our Party sent Comrade Hysni Kapo to Bucharest to discuss only the date of the future meeting , " for decisions besides this date were not to be taken at the Conference itself . 
 In the words of Nicholas C. Pano , " Khrushchev attempted to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting for the purpose of securing the condemnation of the Chinese " with Kapo being the only representative of a European party " to refrain from criticizing Peking , to attack Yugoslav revisionism , and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure . Khrushchev 's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end . " During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram , stating for instance on June 24 , in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese , " When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare : ' I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties , as we have all agreed . ' ... We understand your difficult situation , but don 't worry at all , for we are on the right road . " 
 = = = Hostilities = = = 
 After the Conference ended Khrushchev stepped up economic pressure on Albania , delaying a reply concerning 50 @,@ 000 tons of requested grain to offset an acute food shortage caused by drought , and then issuing significant reductions in the amount of grain shipments . According to an Albanian account , the Soviet Union began to " cut systematically all economic aid to Albania . It delayed and in some cases ceased altogether the delivery of goods and industrial equipment to Albania , refused to ship the grain our people were in urgent need of ... sell [ ing it ] not through clearing but in free currency ... stopped all supplies for the Albanian People 's Army , from food and clothing to weapons and technical equipment whose delivery had been approved by the Joint Command of the Warsaw Treaty . The countries of Eastern Europe , too , set out on the course of aggravating relations with the PRA [ People 's Republic of Albania ] and created a difficult situation by setting up a blockade on Albania jointly with the Soviet government . " 
 The Soviets also attempted to threaten the Albanians with force ; Andrei Grechko , then Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Warsaw Treaty forces , remarked to an Albanian military delegation that they would not get military equipment agreed upon beforehand , saying , " You are only in the Warsaw Pact for the time being , anyway . " Attempts were made to inoculate anti @-@ government views in Albanian students studying abroad in the USSR and to convince the armed forces to go against the government . According to an Albanian account , the Soviet embassy in Albania also " carried out intensive <unk> activity in order to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and ideological confusion about the correct line of the PLA [ Party of Labour of Albania ] . " In July a military plot headed by Soviet @-@ trained Rear Admiral Teme <unk> was uncovered and the plotters executed . 
 = = = Pro @-@ Soviet faction in Albania = = = 
 Within the Party itself an effort was also made by pro @-@ Soviet elements to overthrow Hoxha . In June Politburo member Liri Belishova visited China , giving a speech on June 6 which , in the words of Griffith , " could hardly have made her pro @-@ Soviet sympathies clearer , " having been full of praise for the Soviet Union , with said praise being omitted when the text was published the day after in the Party newspaper Zëri i Popullit . While in China Belishova made contact with the Soviet embassy there , telling them what the Chinese had told her without authorization from the Albanian Politburo . Belishova and <unk> Tashko , Chairman of the Central Auditing Committee , shared leadership of the pro @-@ Soviet faction . Foreign journalist Harry Hamm was told by Albanian functionaries that " Belishova and Tashko had never made any secret of their pro @-@ Soviet leanings , and that they had maintained their attitude long after the decision had been made to move closer to Peking 's general line . Their stubborn attitude was bound to lead to their expulsion from the Party and to their being relieved of all their offices . " Tashko , asked to speak on his own behalf , had his text prepared beforehand by the Soviet embassy and , having gotten confused , accidentally read the punctuation mark for a full stop in Russian amid a burst of laughter from those present . Both Belishova and Tashko were expelled from the Party in September . 
 = = = International Conference of the Communist and Workers ' Parties = = = 
 In October a preparatory Commission for the upcoming International Conference of the Communist and Workers ' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 1 – 21 , with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and Ramiz Alia . Alia later recalled that " the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev , did not bring the fight out in the open , and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed . To this end , they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere , in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery . " Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram , writing to Kapo on October 13 that , " We are not of the same opinion as those who are trying to smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations ... We are for carrying the matter through to the end . If this is not understood , it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood . It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not , but it is essential that we , should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head , as they deserve ... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say : ' How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals ? ' We say : Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin , these ' rascals ' must be exposed , and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the <unk> . " 
 On October 22 , after the work of the Commission had ended , Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which , according to Alia , was used " to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November . " He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo , in which the former asked , " Are you Hysni Kapo ? ! I 've heard so much about you ... " Kapo replied , " For good or bad ? " to which Furtseva stated , " You have attacked the Soviet Union , but you are heading for trouble on that course , " getting " the reply she deserved " from Kapo , with Alia further writing that " her mission was just to transmit the signal . Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again . " 
 From November 3 – 25 Enver Hoxha headed the Albanian delegation which would present its case at the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers ' Parties together with Kapo , Alia , and others . Alia later noted , " The Soviets ' aim was to ensure that Comrade Enver did not speak openly in Moscow , that , at the most , he should restrict himself to general criticisms on a theoretical plane ... they brought all @-@ sided pressure to bear on our delegation ... even us [ ing ] the official reception for the celebration of November 7 against our delegation for these purposes . " On November 5 a 125 @-@ page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and " malign [ ing ] the Party of Labour of Albania . " Later noting this letter in regards to China , Hoxha wrote that , " They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting , in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties , and to intimidate the Chinese , to compel them to take a moderate stand , if they would not submit . This anti @-@ Chinese material did not surprise us , but it strengthened the conviction we had in the correctness of the line and the Marxist @-@ Leninist stands of our Party in defence of the Communist Party of China . " 
 On November 10 , 1960 the second International Conference of the Communist and Workers ' Parties was convened . As Hoxha recalled , " In his speech Khrushchev expressed the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania , as well as those who were going to follow these parties , but without mentioning any names ... wanted to keep all the communist and workers ' parties of the world under his conductor 's baton , under his dictate . " On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership , which " showed that no compromise between them was possible . " During the meeting Hoxha noted that " [ The Soviet ambassador to Albania ] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal . This question he addressed to our generals at the airport , in the presence of one of your generals . Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism @-@ Leninism , to the Party of Labour and socialism . " Khrushchev replied , " If our ambassador said such a thing , he was foolish . " Hoxha in turn replied , " He was no fool . He committed this ' foolishness ' following the Bucharest Meeting . " The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base , which was the subject of a Soviet – Albanian dispute to become acute months later . Khrushchev threatened Hoxha , saying , " We can dismantle the base if you like . " Hoxha replied , " If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake . We have fought empty @-@ bellied and bare @-@ footed , but have never kowtowed to anybody . " As the meeting 's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared , " You flare up in anger . You spat on me ; no one can talk to you . " The meeting ended after Kapo declared , " I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this . " 
 Hoxha delivered his speech to the Conference on November 16 ; he " spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting ... The only crime his régime had committed , the Albanian leader added , was that it did not agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned . For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby , anti @-@ Marxist and <unk> . Hoxha 's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering . " Amongst other things Hoxha said that , according to Khrushchev , the Party of Labour and Albania itself " should merely applaud and approve , but express no opinion of its own . But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable . Marxism @-@ Leninism has granted us the right to have our say , and no one can take this from us , either by means of political and economic pressure , or by means of threats and names they might call us . " According to Alia , Khrushchev " tried to appear calm " when first replying , reading his written text " almost mechanically " in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha 's speech " he lost his head and began to shout , scream and <unk> . " Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked , " Comrade Hoxha , you have poured a bucket of filth over me : you are going to have to wash it off again . " Jon Halliday states that , " On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map . His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage . " In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha " bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves . After his speech , comrade Dolores <unk> , an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement , got up indignantly and said , very much to the point , that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it . " 
 Alia relates that during the Conference a Soviet security officer had said to both him and Kapo that the Soviet leadership might have been contemplating Hoxha 's assassination . For this reason , as Hoxha relates in his memoirs , " The Khrushchevites were capable of anything and we took our own measures ... Hysni and Ramiz stayed on in Moscow , as they had to sign the declaration " while Hoxha left the Soviet Union by train and " arrived in Austria , went down by train through Italy and from Bari returned safe and sound to Tirana on our own aircraft and went directly to the reception organized on the occasion of the 28th and 29th of November . " 
 At the Conference itself the Albanian delegation played a leading role together with its Chinese counterpart in giving the draft declaration " Marxist @-@ Leninist content " and that , despite " serious flaws " ( in the view of these delegations ) " the Declaration eventually signed by the 81 parties was a repudiation of revisionist theses ... [ and ] condemned the Yugoslav form of ' international opportunism which is a concentrated expression of the theories of modern revisionism . ' ... the Soviet revisionists and the revisionists in other countries and parties demonstrated [ in the view of Albania and China ] their opportunistic character by completely disregarding the principles set forth in a document they had found it expedient to sign . " 
 On December 19 Hoxha delivered his report to a plenum of the Central Committee of the Party concerning the Moscow Conference , remarking on the mutual defenses Albania and China provided for each other at Bucharest and Moscow and adding , " In the future our Party will strengthen its ties and friendship with the Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people , always upholding the teachings of Marxism @-@ Leninism and the correct line always pursued by the Central Committee of our Party . " 
 = = Culmination = = 
 At the Fourth Congress of the Party of Labour held in February 1961 Hoxha declared — although still not mentioning the Soviets by name — that , " During the past few years , our Party and other Marxist @-@ Leninist parties have waged a successful struggle against the views of modern revisionists ... But in spite of all the crushing blows and defeats it has received , revisionism ... remains the main danger to the international communist movement ... a resolute and uncompromising struggle must be waged against revisionism until it is utterly destroyed . " According to an Albanian account , " Right after the 4th Congress of the PLA , when it became clear that its attempts at imposing its will on Albania were futile , the Soviet leadership cut off all the credits envisaged in the agreements between the two countries . " The Congress , which was the last one in which Soviet and East European representatives from other parties would attend , " confirmed that the rift with Russia was almost complete and the alliance between China and Albania an accomplished fact . " 
 On January 20 that year the Soviets announced that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten @-@ day period . The Albanians later claimed that the specialists had sabotaged Albania 's oil installations before departing . Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the Palace of Culture of Tirana on the occasion of his 1959 visit , all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961 . A shipment of materials for the Palace , which arrived in Durrës , was " withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials ' had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania . ' " On April 23 a Sino – Albanian trade agreement was concluded ; Soviet First Deputy Premier Alexei Kosygin sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet – Albanian trade agreements . Among other things it stated that " It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it as it has in the past , with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit . " On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana " and was never to return . " On August 26 , " only five days before the beginning of the fall semester , " the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR ; these students given a deadline to leave by October . An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that , " The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five @-@ year Plan in the industrial sector alone . Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid . Thus in the first years of the 3rd Five @-@ year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired . " 
 Military pressure was stepped up still further ; during summer " the training of all Albanian officers , cadets , and <unk> in the Soviet Union or the East European satellite countries was brought to a stop . Since then , there has been not a single Albanian studying at a military academy in the Eastern Bloc . It has been impossible , therefore , for the Tirana Government to keep its army up @-@ to @-@ date on military theory . " In March Albania had not been invited to attend a meeting of the Warsaw Treaty states . Hoxha later recalled that " When we returned from Moscow [ in November 1960 ] , the provocations at the [ Vlora submarine ] base were increased and in order to exert pressure on and impress us , the Soviet deputy foreign minister , <unk> , came to Tirana with two other ' deputies ' : the first deputy @-@ chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy , Antonov , and the deputy chief of the Supreme Staff of the Soviet Navy , Sergeyev . They came allegedly ' to reach agreement ' , but in fact they brought us an ultimatum : The Vlora base must be put completely and solely under Soviet command , which was to be subordinate to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty . " 
 An Albanian account describes the dispute as follows : " By violating the formal Albanian @-@ Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959 , the Soviet government did everything in its power to put under its control this Albanian base which at the same time served the defence of the socialist countries ... On April 5 , 1961 , in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East @-@ European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem : the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible . Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation on the part of the Soviet Union of the existing Albanian @-@ Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959 . " In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines , seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process . As the Albanian account describes it , " The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations , trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania ... On May 26 , 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines , the floating base ' <unk> ' , as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol . On June 5 , 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora , too . " Hoxha 's account is as follows : Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet " came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines ... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier . We told him bluntly : Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement , or within a short time ( we set the date ) you must withdraw immediately from the bay ... He did not hand over the submarines , but went to Vlora , boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation . We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships . Admiral Kasatonov , who had wanted to frighten us , was frightened himself . He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea . In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews , and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs . " 
 At the Twenty @-@ Second Congress of the CPSU in October that year Khrushchev openly attacked the Albanian leadership , proclaiming Hoxha a " leftist nationalist deviationist " and calling for his overthrow , declaring that , " We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian people will have their say , and then the Albanian leaders will have to answer for the harm they have done their country , their people and the cause of socialist construction in Albania . " He further stated that " The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks . " To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech , " the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be , but they will never sell themselves ' for 30 pieces of silver ' ... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees . " Nicholas C. Pano noted that " [ Khrushchev 's ] pronouncements [ at the Twenty @-@ Second Congress ] , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned , had made the policies of de @-@ Stalinization , peaceful coexistence , and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system . " Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries , the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew " the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA , while at the same time demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union . " " Thus , " the Albanian account continues , " the Khrushchev revisionist group , consistent in its line , cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world . " 
 In a December 10 Zëri i Popullit article , Hoxha wrote that , " The real cause " of the break in diplomatic relations " must be sought in the revisionist views of Khrushchev and in his anti @-@ Marxist efforts to impose them on the other parties by any means ... with a view to silencing our Party , to subjugating it and giving a lesson to anyone that would dare to oppose him , Khrushchev extended the ideological disagreements to the field of state relations and began to behave with the PRA as towards an enemy country ... he aims to intimidate and subjugate the PLA , to shift it from its revolutionary Marxist @-@ Leninist positions , to shake the confidence of our people in the PLA and its leadership , to upset the feelings of friendship of the Albanian people towards the Soviet Union ... But Khrushchev is trying in vain ...
