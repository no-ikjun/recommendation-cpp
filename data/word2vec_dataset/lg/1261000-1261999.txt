 = = = Morbidity = = = 
 Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions . These comorbidities are most commonly shown in metabolic syndrome , a combination of medical disorders which includes : diabetes mellitus type 2 , high blood pressure , high blood cholesterol , and high triglyceride levels . 
 Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle . The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies . One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes . Excess body fat underlies 64 % of cases of diabetes in men and 77 % of cases in women . 
 Health consequences fall into two broad categories : those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass ( such as osteoarthritis , obstructive sleep apnea , social stigmatization ) and those due to the increased number of fat cells ( diabetes , cancer , cardiovascular disease , non @-@ alcoholic fatty liver disease ) . Increases in body fat alter the body 's response to insulin , potentially leading to insulin resistance . Increased fat also creates a proinflammatory state , and a prothrombotic state . 
 = = = Survival paradox = = = 
 Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence , health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI , a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox . The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis , and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . 
 In people with heart failure , those with a BMI between 30 @.@ 0 and 34 @.@ 9 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight . This has been attributed to the fact that people often lose weight as they become progressively more ill . Similar findings have been made in other types of heart disease . People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease . In people with greater degrees of obesity , however , the risk of further cardiovascular events is increased . Even after cardiac bypass surgery , no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese . One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event . Another found that if one takes into account chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) in those with PAD , the benefit of obesity no longer exists . 
 = = Causes = = 
 At an individual level , a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity is thought to explain most cases of obesity . A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics , medical reasons , or psychiatric illness . In contrast , increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet , increased reliance on cars , and mechanized manufacturing . 
 A 2006 review identified ten other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity : ( 1 ) insufficient sleep , ( 2 ) endocrine <unk> ( environmental pollutants that interfere with lipid metabolism ) , ( 3 ) decreased variability in ambient temperature , ( 4 ) decreased rates of smoking , because smoking suppresses appetite , ( 5 ) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain ( e.g. , atypical antipsychotics ) , ( 6 ) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier , ( 7 ) pregnancy at a later age ( which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children ) , ( 8 ) epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally , ( 9 ) natural selection for higher BMI , and ( 10 ) <unk> mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors ( this would increase the number of obese people by increasing population variance in weight ) . While there is substantial evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity , the evidence is still inconclusive , and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Dietary energy supply per capita varies markedly between different regions and countries . It has also changed significantly over time . From the early 1970s to the late 1990s the average food energy available per person per day ( the amount of food bought ) increased in all parts of the world except Eastern Europe . The United States had the highest availability with 3 @,@ 654 calories ( 15 @,@ 290 kJ ) per person in 1996 . This increased further in 2003 to 3 @,@ 754 calories ( 15 @,@ 710 kJ ) . During the late 1990s Europeans had 3 @,@ 394 calories ( 14 @,@ 200 kJ ) per person , in the developing areas of Asia there were 2 @,@ 648 calories ( 11 @,@ 080 kJ ) per person , and in sub @-@ Saharan Africa people had 2 @,@ 176 calories ( 9 @,@ 100 kJ ) per person . Total food energy consumption has been found to be related to obesity . 
 The widespread availability of nutritional guidelines has done little to address the problems of overeating and poor dietary choice . From 1971 to 2000 , obesity rates in the United States increased from 14 @.@ 5 % to 30 @.@ 9 % . During the same period , an increase occurred in the average amount of food energy consumed . For women , the average increase was 335 calories ( 1 @,@ 400 kJ ) per day ( 1 @,@ 542 calories ( 6 @,@ 450 kJ ) in 1971 and 1 @,@ 877 calories ( 7 @,@ 850 kJ ) in 2004 ) , while for men the average increase was 168 calories ( 700 kJ ) per day ( 2 @,@ 450 calories ( 10 @,@ 300 kJ ) in 1971 and 2 @,@ 618 calories ( 10 @,@ 950 kJ ) in 2004 ) . Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption . The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages , which now account for almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America , and potato chips . Consumption of sweetened drinks such as soft drinks , fruit drinks , iced tea , and energy and vitamin water drinks is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . 
 As societies become increasingly reliant on energy @-@ dense , big @-@ portions , and fast @-@ food meals , the association between fast @-@ food consumption and obesity becomes more concerning . In the United States consumption of fast @-@ food meals tripled and food energy intake from these meals quadrupled between 1977 and 1995 . 
 Agricultural policy and techniques in the United States and Europe have led to lower food prices . In the United States , subsidization of corn , soy , wheat , and rice through the U.S. farm bill has made the main sources of processed food cheap compared to fruits and vegetables . <unk> count laws and nutrition facts labels attempt to steer people toward making healthier food choices , including awareness of how much food energy is being consumed . 
 Obese people consistently under @-@ report their food consumption as compared to people of normal weight . This is supported both by tests of people carried out in a calorimeter room and by direct observation . 
 = = = Sedentary lifestyle = = = 
 A sedentary lifestyle plays a significant role in obesity . Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work , and currently at least 30 % of the world 's population gets insufficient exercise . This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of labor @-@ saving technology in the home . In children , there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity due to less walking and physical education . World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear . The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits , while a study from Finland found an increase and a study from the United States found leisure @-@ time physical activity has not changed significantly . 
 In both children and adults , there is an association between television viewing time and the risk of obesity . A review found 63 of 73 studies ( 86 % ) showed an increased rate of childhood obesity with increased media exposure , with rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Like many other medical conditions , obesity is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors . Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism predispose to obesity when sufficient food energy is present . As of 2006 , more than 41 of these sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present . People with two copies of the <unk> gene ( fat mass and obesity associated gene ) have been found on average to weigh 3 – 4 kg more and have a 1 @.@ 67 @-@ fold greater risk of obesity compared with those without the risk allele . The differences in BMI between people that are due to genetics varies depending on the population examined from 6 % to 85 % . 
 Obesity is a major feature in several syndromes , such as Prader – Willi syndrome , Bardet – <unk> syndrome , Cohen syndrome , and <unk> syndrome . ( The term " non @-@ <unk> obesity " is sometimes used to exclude these conditions . ) In people with early @-@ onset severe obesity ( defined by an onset before 10 years of age and body mass index over three standard deviations above normal ) , 7 % harbor a single point DNA mutation . 
 Studies that have focused on inheritance patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80 % of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese , in contrast to less than 10 % of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight . Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics . 
 The thrifty gene hypothesis postulates that , due to dietary scarcity during human evolution , people are prone to obesity . Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability , and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely to survive famine . This tendency to store fat , however , would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies . This theory has received various criticisms , and other evolutionarily @-@ based theories such as the <unk> gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed . 
 = = = Other illnesses = = = 
 Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity . Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes ( listed above ) as well as some congenital or acquired conditions : hypothyroidism , Cushing 's syndrome , growth hormone deficiency , and the eating disorders : binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome . However , obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder , and therefore is not listed in the DSM @-@ <unk> as a psychiatric illness . The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders . 
 Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in body composition ; these include insulin , sulfonylureas , <unk> , atypical antipsychotics , antidepressants , steroids , certain anticonvulsants ( phenytoin and valproate ) , <unk> , and some forms of hormonal contraception . 
 = = = Social determinants = = = 
 While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity , they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally . Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis , the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated . There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors . 
 The correlation between social class and BMI varies globally . A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese . No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes . In the developing world , women , men , and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity . An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships , but they were weaker . The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of globalization . Among developed countries , levels of adult obesity , and percentage of teenage children who are overweight , are correlated with income inequality . A similar relationship is seen among US states : more adults , even in higher social classes , are obese in more unequal states . 
 Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class . It is thought that in developed countries , the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food , they are under greater social pressure to remain slim , and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for physical fitness . In undeveloped countries the ability to afford food , high energy expenditure with physical labor , and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns . Attitudes toward body weight held by people in one 's life may also play a role in obesity . A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends , siblings , and spouses . Stress and perceived low social status appear to increase risk of obesity . 
 Smoking has a significant effect on an individual 's weight . Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 9 @.@ 7 lb ) for men and 5 @.@ 0 kilograms ( 11 @.@ 0 lb ) for women over ten years . However , changing rates of smoking have had little effect on the overall rates of obesity . 
 In the United States the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity . A woman 's risk increases by 7 % per child , while a man 's risk increases by 4 % per child . This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents . 
 In the developing world urbanization is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity . In China overall rates of obesity are below 5 % ; however , in some cities rates of obesity are greater than 20 % . 
 Malnutrition in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the developing world . Endocrine changes that occur during periods of malnutrition may promote the storage of fat once more food energy becomes available . 
 Consistent with cognitive epidemiological data , numerous studies confirm that obesity is associated with cognitive deficits . Whether obesity causes cognitive deficits , or vice versa is unclear at present . 
 = = = Infectious agents = = = 
 The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages . Gut flora has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans . There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential . This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity . Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally . 
 An association between viruses and obesity has been found in humans and several different animal species . The amount that these associations may have contributed to the rising rate of obesity is yet to be determined . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 There are many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity . This field of research had been almost <unk> until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman 's laboratory . These investigators postulated that leptin was a satiety factor . In the ob / ob mouse , mutations in the leptin gene resulted in the obese phenotype opening the possibility of leptin therapy for human obesity . However , soon thereafter J. F. Caro 's laboratory could not detect any mutations in the leptin gene in humans with obesity . On the contrary Leptin expression was increased proposing the possibility of Leptin @-@ resistance in human obesity . Since this discovery , many other hormonal mechanisms have been elucidated that participate in the regulation of appetite and food intake , storage patterns of adipose tissue , and development of insulin resistance . Since leptin 's discovery , ghrelin , insulin , <unk> , <unk> 3 @-@ 36 , <unk> , <unk> , as well as many other mediators have been studied . The <unk> are mediators produced by adipose tissue ; their action is thought to modify many obesity @-@ related diseases . 
 Leptin and ghrelin are considered to be complementary in their influence on appetite , with ghrelin produced by the stomach modulating short @-@ term appetitive control ( i.e. to eat when the stomach is empty and to stop when the stomach is stretched ) . Leptin is produced by adipose tissue to signal fat storage reserves in the body , and mediates long @-@ term appetitive controls ( i.e. to eat more when fat storages are low and less when fat storages are high ) . Although administration of leptin may be effective in a small subset of obese individuals who are leptin deficient , most obese individuals are thought to be leptin resistant and have been found to have high levels of leptin . This resistance is thought to explain in part why administration of leptin has not been shown to be effective in suppressing appetite in most obese people . 
 While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally , they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system . In particular , they and other appetite @-@ related hormones act on the hypothalamus , a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure . There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite , the <unk> pathway being the most well understood . The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus , the arcuate nucleus , that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus ( LH ) and ventromedial hypothalamus ( VMH ) , the brain 's feeding and satiety centers , respectively . 
 The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of neurons . The first group <unk> neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) and agouti @-@ related peptide ( AgRP ) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH . The second group <unk> pro @-@ <unk> ( POMC ) and <unk> and amphetamine @-@ regulated transcript ( CART ) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH . Consequently , NPY / AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety , while POMC / CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding . Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin . Leptin inhibits the NPY / AgRP group while stimulating the POMC / CART group . Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling , either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance , leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity . 
 = = Public health = = 
 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) predicts that overweight and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as <unk> and infectious diseases as the most significant cause of poor health . Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence , costs , and health effects . The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese . Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population . Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity . Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools , limiting direct junk food marketing to children , and decreasing access to sugar @-@ sweetened beverages in schools . When constructing urban environments , efforts have been made to increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes . 
 Many countries and groups have published reports pertaining to obesity . In 1998 , the first US Federal guidelines were published , titled " Clinical Guidelines on the Identification , Evaluation , and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults : The Evidence Report " . In 2006 the Canadian Obesity Network published the " Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) on the Management and Prevention of Obesity in Adults and Children " . This is a comprehensive evidence @-@ based guideline to address the management and prevention of overweight and obesity in adults and children . 
 In 2004 , the United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians , the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal College of <unk> and Child Health released the report " <unk> up Problems " , which highlighted the growing problem of obesity in the UK . The same year , the House of Commons Health Select Committee published its " most comprehensive inquiry [ ... ] ever undertaken " into the impact of obesity on health and society in the UK and possible approaches to the problem . In 2006 , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) issued a guideline on the diagnosis and management of obesity , as well as policy implications for non @-@ healthcare organizations such as local councils . A 2007 report produced by Sir Derek Wanless for the King 's Fund warned that unless further action was taken , obesity had the capacity to cripple the National Health Service financially . 
 Comprehensive approaches are being looked at to address the rising rates of obesity . The Obesity Policy Action ( OPA ) framework divides measure into ' upstream ' policies , ' midstream ' policies , ' downstream ' policies . ' Upstream ' policies look at changing society , ' midstream ' policies try to alter individuals ' behavior to prevent obesity , and ' downstream ' policies try to treat currently afflicted people . 
 = = Management = = 
 The main treatment for obesity consists of dieting and physical exercise . Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short term , but maintaining this weight loss is frequently difficult and often requires making exercise and a lower food energy diet a permanent part of a person 's lifestyle . 
 In the short @-@ term low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss . In the long term ; however , all types of low @-@ carbohydrate and low @-@ fat diets appear equally beneficial . A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar . Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the risk of heart disease . Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight @-@ loss . Success rates of long @-@ term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low , ranging from 2 – 20 % . Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child . Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease . 
 Three medications , orlistat , <unk> and a combination of <unk> and topiramate are currently available and have evidence for long term use . Weight loss with orlistat is modest , an average of 2 @.@ 9 kg ( 6 @.@ 4 lb ) at 1 to 4 years . Its use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys . The other two medications are available in the United States but not Europe . <unk> results in an average 3 @.@ 1 kg weight loss ( 3 % of body weight ) greater than placebo over a year ; however , it may increase heart valve problems . A combination of <unk> and topiramate is also somewhat effective ; however , it may be associated with heart problems . There is no information on how these drugs affect longer @-@ term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death . 
 The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery . Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long @-@ term weight loss , improvement in obesity related conditions , and decreased overall mortality . One study found a weight loss of between 14 % and 25 % ( depending on the type of procedure performed ) at 10 years , and a 29 % reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures . Complications occur in about 17 % of cases and <unk> is needed in 7 % of cases . Due to its cost and risks , researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 In earlier historical periods obesity was rare , and achievable only by a small elite , although already recognised as a problem for health . But as prosperity increased in the Early Modern period , it affected increasingly larger groups of the population . In 1997 the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic . As of 2008 the WHO estimates that at least 500 million adults ( greater than 10 % ) are obese , with higher rates among women than men . The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60 years old and severe obesity in the United States , Australia , and Canada is increasing faster than the overall rate of obesity . 
 Once considered a problem only of high @-@ income countries , obesity rates are rising worldwide and affecting both the developed and developing world . These increases have been felt most dramatically in urban settings . The only remaining region of the world where obesity is not common is sub @-@ Saharan Africa . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Obesity is from the Latin <unk> , which means " stout , fat , or plump " . <unk> is the past participle of <unk> ( to eat ) , with ob ( over ) added to it . The Oxford English Dictionary documents its first usage in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave . 
 = = = Historical attitudes = = = 
 Ancient Greek medicine recognizes obesity as a medical disorder , and records that the Ancient Egyptians saw it in the same way . Hippocrates wrote that " <unk> is not only a disease itself , but the harbinger of others " . The Indian surgeon Sushruta ( 6th century BCE ) related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders . He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects . For most of human history mankind struggled with food scarcity . Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity . It was common among high officials in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations . In the 17th century , English medical author Tobias Venner is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book . 
 With the onset of the industrial revolution it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers . Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies . Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th century in the developed world . During the 20th century , as populations reached their genetic potential for height , weight began increasing much more than height , resulting in obesity . In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality , but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common . During this time period insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese . 
 Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw . The obesus or fat character in Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery . During Christian times food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust . In modern Western culture , excess weight is often regarded as unattractive , and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes . People of all ages can face social stigmatization , and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers . 
 Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal – and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century . The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s . This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2 % from 1922 to 1999 , while their average weight decreased by 12 % . On the other hand , people 's views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction . In Britain the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999 . These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of <unk> leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal . 
 Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well @-@ being in many parts of Africa . This has become particularly common since the HIV epidemic began . 
 = = = The arts = = = 
 The first sculptural representations of the human body 20 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 years ago depict obese females . Some attribute the Venus figurines to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent " fatness " in the people of the time . <unk> is , however , absent in both Greek and Roman art , probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation . This continued through much of Christian European history , with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese . 
 During the Renaissance some of the upper class began flaunting their large size , as can be seen in portraits of Henry VIII of England and Alessandro del <unk> . Rubens ( 1577 – 1640 ) regularly depicted full @-@ bodied women in his pictures , from which derives the term <unk> . These women , however , still maintained the " hourglass " shape with its relationship to fertility . During the 19th century , views on obesity changed in the Western world . After centuries of obesity being synonymous with wealth and social status , <unk> began to be seen as the desirable standard . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Economic impact = = = 
 In addition to its health impacts , obesity leads to many problems including disadvantages in employment and increased business costs . These effects are felt by all levels of society from individuals , to corporations , to governments . 
 In 2005 , the medical costs attributable to obesity in the US were an estimated $ 190 @.@ 2 billion or 20 @.@ 6 % of all medical expenditures , while the cost of obesity in Canada was estimated at CA $ 2 billion in 1997 ( 2 @.@ 4 % of total health costs ) . The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A $ 21 billion . Overweight and obese Australians also received A $ 35 @.@ 6 billion in government subsidies . The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion in the US alone . 
 Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesity @-@ related disease . However , the longer people live , the more medical costs they incur . Researchers therefore conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public 's health , but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending . 
 Obesity can lead to social stigmatization and disadvantages in employment . When compared to their normal weight counterparts , obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave , thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity . A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40 kg / m2 filed twice as many workers ' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18 @.@ 5 – 24 @.@ 9 kg / m2 . They also had more than 12 times as many lost work days . The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting , thus affecting the lower extremities , wrists or hands , and backs . The Alabama State Employees ' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $ 25 a month for health insurance that would otherwise be free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health . These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35 kg / m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year . 
 Some research shows that obese people are less likely to be hired for a job and are less likely to be promoted . Obese people are also paid less than their non @-@ obese counterparts for an equivalent job ; obese women on average make 6 % less and obese men make 3 % less . 
 Specific industries , such as the airline , healthcare and food industries , have special concerns . Due to rising rates of obesity , airlines face higher fuel costs and pressures to increase seating width . In 2000 , the extra weight of obese passengers cost airlines US $ 275 million . The healthcare industry has had to invest in special facilities for handling severely obese patients , including special lifting equipment and bariatric ambulances . Costs for restaurants are increased by litigation accusing them of causing obesity . In 2005 the US Congress discussed legislation to prevent civil lawsuits against the food industry in relation to obesity ; however , it did not become law . 
 With the American Medical Association 's 2013 classification of obesity as a chronic disease , it is thought that health insurance companies will more likely pay for obesity treatment , counseling and surgery , and the cost of research and development of fat treatment pills or gene therapy treatments should be more affordable if insurers help to subsidize their cost . The AMA classification is not legally binding , however , so health insurers still have the right to reject coverage for a treatment or procedure . 
 In 2014 , The European Court of Justice ruled that morbid obesity is a disability . The Court argued that if an employee 's obesity prevents him from " full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers " , then it shall be considered a disability and that firing someone on such grounds is discriminatory . 
 = = = Size acceptance = = = 
 The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese . However , some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes . 
 A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity . They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th century . The US @-@ based National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance ( <unk> ) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination . 
 The International Size Acceptance Association ( <unk> ) is a non @-@ governmental organization ( NGO ) which was founded in 1997 . It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight @-@ based discrimination . These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act ( ADA ) . The American legal system , however , has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti @-@ discrimination law to cover obesity . 
 = = Childhood obesity = = 
 The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child . Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th percentile . The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity . Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century , with rising rates in both the developed and developing world . Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11 % in the 1980s to over 30 % in the 1990s , while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14 % in Brazilian children . 
 As with obesity in adults , many factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity . Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity . Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses , children who are obese are often tested for hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , and fatty liver . Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques , although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success . In the United States , medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Obesity in pets is common in many countries . In the United States , 23 – 41 % of dogs are overweight , and about 5 @.@ 1 % are obese . The rate of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 6 @.@ 4 % . In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 7 @.@ 6 % . The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese ; however , there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners . 
 = Botanical garden = 
 A botanical garden or botanic garden is a garden dedicated to the collection , cultivation and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names . It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants , herb gardens , plants from particular parts of the world , and so on ; there may be greenhouses , <unk> , again with special collections such as tropical plants , alpine plants , or other exotic plants . Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours , educational displays , art exhibitions , book rooms , open @-@ air theatrical and musical performances , and other entertainment . 
 Botanical gardens are often run by universities or other scientific research organizations , and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy or some other aspect of botanical science . In principle , their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants for the purposes of scientific research , conservation , display , and education , although this will depend on the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden . 
 The origin of modern botanical gardens can be traced to European medieval medicinal gardens known as physic gardens , the first of these being founded during the Italian Renaissance in the 16th century . This early concern with medicinal plants changed in the 17th century to an interest in the new plant imports from explorations outside Europe as botany gradually established its independence from medicine . In the 18th century , systems of nomenclature and classification were devised by botanists working in the herbaria and universities associated with the gardens , these systems often being displayed in the gardens as educational " order beds " . With the rapid rise of European imperialism in the late 18th century , botanic gardens were established in the tropics , and economic botany became a focus with the hub at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , near London . 
 Over the years , botanical gardens , as cultural and scientific organisations , have responded to the interests of botany and horticulture . Nowadays , most botanical gardens display a mix of the themes mentioned and more ; having a strong connection with the general public , there is the opportunity to provide visitors with information relating to the environmental issues being faced at the start of the 21st century , especially those relating to plant conservation and sustainability . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 The role of major botanical gardens worldwide has been considered so broadly similar as to fall within textbook definitions . The following definition was produced by staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey <unk> of Cornell University in 1976 . It covers in some detail the many functions and activities generally associated with botanical gardens : 
 A botanical garden is a controlled and staffed institution for the maintenance of a living collection of plants under scientific management for purposes of education and research , together with such libraries , herbaria , laboratories , and museums as are essential to its particular undertakings . Each botanical garden naturally develops its own special fields of interests depending on its personnel , location , extent , available funds , and the terms of its charter . It may include greenhouses , test grounds , an herbarium , an arboretum , and other departments . It maintains a scientific as well as a plant @-@ growing staff , and publication is one of its major modes of expression . 
 This broad outline is then expanded : 
 The botanic garden may be an independent institution , a governmental operation , or affiliated to a college or university . If a department of an educational institution , it may be related to a teaching program . In any case , it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands . It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden , although it may be artistic , nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants . The essential element is the intention of the enterprise , which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge . 
 A contemporary botanic garden is a strictly protected natural urban green area , where a managing organization creates landscaped gardens and holds documented collections of living plants and / or preserved plant accessions containing functional units of heredity of actual or potential value for purposes such as scientific research , education , public display , conservation , sustainable use , tourism and recreational activities , production of marketable plant @-@ based products and services for improvement of human well @-@ being . 
 The " New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening " ( 1999 ) points out that among the various kinds of organisations now known as botanical gardens are many public gardens with little scientific activity , and it cites a more abbreviated definition that was published by the World Wildlife Fund and IUCN when launching the ’ ’ Botanic Gardens Conservation Strategy ’ ’ in 1989 : " A botanic garden is a garden containing scientifically ordered and maintained collections of plants , usually documented and labelled , and open to the public for the purposes of recreation , education and research . " This has been further reduced by Botanic Gardens Conservation International to the following definition which " encompasses the spirit of a true botanic garden " : " A botanic garden is an institution holding documented collections of living plants for the purposes of scientific research , conservation , display and education . " 
 = = = The botanical gardens network = = = 
 Worldwide , there are now about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 countries ( mostly in temperate regions ) of which about 550 are in Europe ( 150 of which are in Russia ) , 200 in North America , and an increasing number in East Asia . These gardens attract about 150 million visitors a year , so it is hardly surprising that many people gained their first exciting introduction to the wonders of the plant world in a botanical garden . 
 Historically , botanical gardens exchanged plants through the publication of seed lists ( these were called Latin : Indices <unk> in the 18th century ) . This was a means of transferring both plants and information between botanical gardens . This system continues today , although the possibility of genetic piracy and the transmission of invasive species has received greater attention in recent times . 
 The International Association of Botanic Gardens was formed in 1954 as a worldwide organisation affiliated to the International Union of Biological Sciences . More recently , coordination has also been provided by Botanic Gardens Conservation International ( <unk> ) , which has the mission " To mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well @-@ being of people and the planet " . <unk> has over 700 members – mostly botanic gardens – in 118 countries , and strongly supports the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation by producing a range resources and publications , and by organizing international conferences and conservation programs . 
 Communication also happens regionally . In the United States , there is the American Public Gardens Association ( formerly the American Association of Botanic Gardens and <unk> ) , and in Australasia there is the Botanic Gardens of Australia and New Zealand ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Historical development = = 
 The history of botanical gardens is closely linked to the history of botany itself . The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were medicinal gardens , but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful , strange , new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands . Later , in the 18th century , they became more educational in function , demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures . Then , in the 19th and 20th centuries , the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany . 
 = = = Precursors = = = 
 The idea of " scientific " gardens used specifically for the study of plants dates back to antiquity . 
 = = = = Grand gardens of ancient history = = = = 
 Near @-@ eastern royal gardens set aside for economic use or display and containing at least some plants gained by special collecting trips or military campaigns abroad , are known from the second millennium BCE in ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , Crete , Mexico and China . In about 2800 BCE , the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung sent collectors to distant regions searching for plants with economic or medicinal value . It has also been suggested that the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica influenced the history of the botanical garden as gardens in Tenochtitlan established by king <unk> , also gardens in Chalco ( <unk> ) and elsewhere , greatly impressed the Spanish invaders , not only with their appearance , but also because the indigenous Aztecs employed many more medicinal plants than did the classical world of Europe . 
 Early medieval gardens in Islamic Spain resembled botanic gardens of the future , an example being the 11th @-@ century Huerta del Ray garden of physician and author Ibn <unk> ( 999 – 1075 CE ) in Toledo . This was later taken over by garden chronicler Ibn Bassal ( fl . 1085 CE ) until the Christian conquest in 1085 CE . Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville , most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included Morocco , Persia , Sicily , and Egypt . The medical school of Montpelier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians , and by 1250 CE , it included a physic garden , but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593 . 
 = = = = Physic gardens = = = = 
 Botanical gardens , in the modern sense , developed from physic gardens , whose main purpose was to cultivate herbs for medical use as well as research and experimentation . Such gardens have a long history . In Europe , for example , Aristotle ( 384 BCE – 322 BCE ) is said to have had a physic garden in the Lyceum at Athens , which was used for educational purposes and for the study of botany , and this was inherited , or possibly set up , by his pupil Theophrastus , the " Father of Botany " . There is some debate among science historians whether this garden was ordered and scientific enough to be considered " botanical " , and suggest it more appropriate to attribute the earliest known botanical garden in Europe to the botanist and pharmacologist Antonius Castor , mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century . 
 Though these ancient gardens shared some of the characteristics of present @-@ day botanical gardens , the forerunners of modern botanical gardens are generally regarded as being the medieval monastic physic gardens that originated after the decline of the Roman Empire at the time of Emperor Charlemagne ( 742 – 789 CE ) . These contained a hortus , a garden used mostly for vegetables , and another section set aside for specially labelled medicinal plants and this was called the <unk> or hortus medicus — more generally known as a physic garden , and a <unk> or orchard . These gardens were probably given impetus when Charlemagne issued a <unk> , the <unk> de <unk> , which listed 73 herbs to be used in the physic gardens of his dominions . Many of these were found in British gardens even though they only occurred naturally in continental Europe , demonstrating earlier plant introduction . Pope Nicholas V set aside part of the Vatican grounds in 1447 , for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote the teaching of botany , and this was a forerunner to the University gardens at Padua and Pisa established in the 1540s . Certainly the founding of many early botanic gardens was instigated by members of the medical profession . 
 = = = 16th- and 17th @-@ century European gardens = = = 
 In the 17th century , botanical gardens began their contribution to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants . If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection , then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning that occurred in the European Renaissance . These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools , used as resources for teaching and research . The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations , a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine . 
 = = = = Origins in the Italian Renaissance = = = = 
 The botanical gardens of Southern Europe were associated with university faculties of medicine and were founded in Northern Italy at Orto botanico di Pisa ( 1544 ) , Orto botanico di Padova ( 1545 ) , Orto Botanico di Firenze ( 1545 ) , Orto Botanico dell 'Università di Pavia ( 1558 ) and Orto Botanico dell 'Università di Bologna ( 1568 ) . Here the physicians ( referred to in English as apothecaries ) delivered lectures on the Mediterranean " simples " or " officinals " that were being cultivated in the grounds . Student education was no doubt stimulated by the relatively recent advent of printing and the publication of the first herbals . All of these botanical gardens still exist , mostly in their original locations . 
 = = = = Northern Europe = = = = 
 The tradition of these Italian gardens passed into Spain ( Botanical Garden of Valencia , 1567 ) and Northern Europe , where similar gardens were established in the Netherlands ( Hortus Botanicus Leiden , 1587 ; Hortus Botanicus ( Amsterdam ) , 1638 ) , Germany ( Alter Botanischer Garten Tübingen , 1535 ; Leipzig Botanical Garden , 1580 ; Botanischer Garten Jena , 1586 ; Botanischer Garten Heidelberg , 1593 ; <unk> <unk> , Hanover , 1666 ; Botanischer Garten der Christian @-@ <unk> @-@ Universität zu Kiel , 1669 ; Botanical Garden in Berlin , 1672 ) , Switzerland ( Old Botanical Garden , Zürich , 1560 ; Basel , 1589 ) ; England ( University of Oxford Botanic Garden , 1621 ; Chelsea Physic Garden , 1673 ) ; Scotland ( Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh , 1670 ) ; and in France ( Jardin des plantes de Montpellier , 1593 ; Faculty of Medicine Garden , Paris , 1597 ; Jardin des Plantes , Paris , 1635 ) , Denmark ( University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden , 1600 ) ; Sweden ( Uppsala University , 1655 ) . 
 = = = = Beginnings of botanical science = = = = 
 During the 16th and 17th centuries , the first plants were being imported to these major Western European gardens from Eastern Europe and nearby Asia ( which provided many bulbs ) , and these found a place in the new gardens , where they could be conveniently studied by the plant experts of the day . For example , Asian introductions were described by Carolus Clusius ( 1526 – 1609 ) , who was director , in turn , of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna and Hortus Botanicus Leiden . Many plants were being collected from the Near East , especially bulbous plants from Turkey . Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry , and he helped create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe at Leyden where his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate this garden near its original site . The hortus medicus of Leyden in 1601 was a perfect square divided into quarters for the four continents , but by 1720 , though , it was a rambling system of beds , struggling to contain the novelties rushing in , and it became better known as the hortus <unk> . His <unk> libri <unk> ( 1605 ) is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted today . The inclusion of new plant introductions in botanic gardens meant their scientific role was now widening , as botany gradually asserted its independence from medicine . 
 In the mid to late 17th century , the Paris Jardin des Plantes was a centre of interest with the greatest number of new introductions to attract the public . In England , the Chelsea Physic Garden was founded in 1673 as the " Garden of the Society of Apothecaries " . The Chelsea garden had heated greenhouses , and in 1723 appointed Philip Miller ( 1691 – 1771 ) as head gardener . He had a wide influence on both botany and horticulture , as plants poured into it from around the world . The garden 's golden age came in the 18th century , when it became the world 's most richly stocked botanical garden . Its seed @-@ exchange programme was established in 1682 and still continues today . 
 = = = 18th century = = = 
 With the increase in maritime trade , ever more plants were being brought back to Europe as trophies from distant lands , and these were triumphantly displayed in the private estates of the wealthy , in commercial nurseries , and in the public botanical gardens . Heated conservatories called " <unk> " , such as the one at Kew , became a feature of many botanical gardens . Industrial expansion in Europe and North America resulted in new building skills , so plants sensitive to cold were kept over winter in progressively elaborate and expensive heated conservatories and glasshouses . 
 = = = = The Cape , Dutch East Indies = = = = 
 The 18th century was marked by introductions from the Cape of South Africa – including <unk> , geraniums , <unk> , succulents , and <unk> plants – while the Dutch trade with the Dutch East Indies resulted in a golden era for the Leiden and Amsterdam botanical gardens and a boom in the construction of conservatories . 
 = = = = Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew = = = = 
 The Royal Gardens at Kew were founded in 1759 , initially as part of the Royal Garden set aside as a physic garden . William Aiton ( 1741 – 1793 ) , the first curator , was taught by garden chronicler Philip Miller of the Chelsea Physic Garden whose son Charles became first curator of the original Cambridge Botanic Garden ( 1762 ) . In 1759 , the " <unk> Garden " was planted , and by 1767 , it was claimed that " the <unk> Garden is by far the richest in Europe " . Gardens such as the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew ( 1759 ) and <unk> Acclimatization Garden ( Spanish ) , Tenerife ( 1788 ) and the Real Jardín <unk> de Madrid ( 1755 ) were set up to cultivate new species returned from expeditions to the tropics ; they also helped found new tropical botanical gardens . From the 1770s , following the example of the French and Spanish , amateur collectors were supplemented by official horticultural and botanical plant hunters . This was the great era of European , and especially British , imperialism which was " the means by which ideas , knowledge , styles of economy , politics and goods were given international reach " and justified as the spreading of " civilisation " through " development " and " improvement " . 
 At this time , England was importing many woody plants from North America , and the popularity of horticulture had increased enormously , encouraged by the horticultural and botanical collecting expeditions overseas fostered by the directorship of Sir William Hooker and his keen interest in economic botany . At the end of the 18th century , Kew , under the directorship of Sir Joseph Banks , enjoyed a golden age of plant hunting , sending out collectors to the Southern African Cape , Australia , Chile , China , Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) , Brazil , and elsewhere , and acting as " the great botanical exchange house of the British Empire " . From its earliest days to the present , Kew has in many ways exemplified botanic garden ideals , and is respected worldwide for the published work of its scientists , the education of horticultural students , its public programmes , and the scientific underpinning of its horticulture . 
 = = = = Plant classification = = = = 
 The large number of plants needing description were often listed in garden catalogues ; and at this time Carl Linnaeus established the system of binomial nomenclature which greatly facilitated the listing process . Names of plants were authenticated by dried plant specimens mounted on card ( a hortus siccus or garden of dried plants ) that were stored in buildings called herbaria , these taxonomic research institutions being frequently associated with the botanical gardens , many of which by then had " order beds " to display the classification systems being developed by botanists in the gardens ' museums and herbaria . Botanical gardens had now become scientific collections , as botanists published their descriptions of the new exotic plants , and these were also recorded for posterity in detail by superb botanical illustrations . In this century , botanical gardens effectively dropped their medicinal function in favour of scientific and aesthetic priorities , and the term " botanic garden " came to be more closely associated with the herbarium , library ( and later laboratories ) housed there than with the living collections – on which little research was undertaken . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 The late 18th and early 19th centuries were marked by the establishment of tropical botanical gardens as a tool of colonial expansion ( for trade and commerce and , secondarily , science ) mainly by the British and Dutch , in India , South @-@ east Asia and the Caribbean . This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks 's botanical collections during Captain James Cook 's circumnavigations of the planet and his explorations of Oceania , which formed the last phase of plant introduction on a grand scale . 
 = = = = Tropical botanical gardens = = = = 
 There are currently about 230 tropical botanical gardens with a concentration in southern and south @-@ eastern Asia . The first botanical garden founded in the tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius , established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port , but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance . This was followed by the West Indies ( Botanic Gardens St. Vincent , 1764 ) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta , India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company . Other gardens were constructed in Brazil ( Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden , 1808 ) , Sri Lanka ( Botanical Garden of Peradeniya , 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371 ) , Indonesia ( Bogor Botanical Gardens , 1817 and <unk> Raya Cibodas , 1852 ) , and Singapore ( Singapore Botanical Gardens , 1822 ) . These had a profound effect on the economy of the countries , especially in relation to the foods and medicines introduced . The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important rubber industry of the Malay Peninsula . At this time also , teak and tea were introduced to India and breadfruit , pepper and <unk> to the Caribbean . 
 Included in the charter of these gardens was the investigation of the local flora for its economic potential to both the colonists and the local people . Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardens – often in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdam – and included cloves , tea , coffee , breadfruit , cinchona , sugar , cotton , palm oil and Theobroma cacao ( for chocolate ) . During these times , the rubber plant was introduced to Singapore . Especially in the tropics , the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy . The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the Para rubber tree ( Hevea brasiliensis ) was introduced from Kew , which had itself imported the plant from South America . Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden . The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics .

In 1859 , the Missouri Botanical Garden was founded at St Louis ; it is now one of the world ’ s leading gardens specializing in tropical plants . This was one of several popular American gardens , including Longwood Gardens ( 1798 ) , Arnold Arboretum ( 1872 ) , New York Botanical Garden ( 1891 ) , Huntington Botanical Gardens ( 1906 ) , Brooklyn Botanic Garden ( 1910 ) , International Peace Garden ( 1932 ) , and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden ( 1938 ) .

 A large number of civic or municipal botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries .

They were botanical gardens in the sense of building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world , although their collection policies were determined by those in day @-@ to @-@ day charge of them . They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were , indeed , often under general parks administrations .

 The second half of the 20th century saw increasingly sophisticated educational , visitor service , and interpretation services .

Specialised gardens like the <unk> in Frankfurt , Germany ( 1869 ) , one of the world 's leading orchid and succulent plant collections , have been very popular . There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to natural vegetation . 
 With decreasing financial support from governments , revenue @-@ raising public entertainment increased , including music , art exhibitions , special botanical exhibitions , theatre and film , this being supplemented by the advent of " Friends " organisations and the use of volunteer guides . 
 = = = = Plant conservation = = = = 
 Plant conservation and the heritage value of exceptional historic landscapes were treated with a growing sense of urgency . Specialist gardens were sometimes given a separate or adjoining site , to display native and indigenous plants . 
 In the 1970s , gardens became focused on the plant conservation . The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was established by the IUCN , and the World Conservation Union in 1987 with the aim of coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world . It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens ' living collections . Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation . These may be held as : seeds dried and stored at low temperature , or in tissue culture ( such as the Kew Millennium <unk> ) ; as living plants , including those that are of special horticultural , historical or scientific interest ( such as those held by the <unk> in the United Kingdom ) ; or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation . Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats . The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis , Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species . 
 = = Role and functions = = 
 Many of the functions of botanical gardens have already been discussed in the sections above , which emphasise the scientific underpinning of botanical gardens with their focus on research , education and conservation . However , as multifaceted organisations , all sites have their own special interests . In a remarkable paper on the role of botanical gardens , Ferdinand Mueller ( 1825 – 1896 ) , the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Melbourne ( 1852 – 1873 ) , stated , " in all cases the objects [ of a botanical garden ] must be mainly scientific and predominantly instructive " . He then detailed many of the objectives being pursued by the world 's botanical gardens in the middle of the 19th century , when European gardens were at their height . Many of these are listed below to give a sense of the scope of botanical gardens ' activities at that time , and the ways in which they differed from parks or what he called " public pleasure gardens " : 
 Botanical gardens must find a compromise between the need for peace and seclusion , while at the same time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants , information centres and sales areas that bring with them rubbish , noise , and hyperactivity . Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interests — with science now often taking second place . Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management . 
 Many gardens now have plant shops selling flowers , herbs , and vegetable seedlings suitable for transplanting ; many , like the UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research and the Chicago Botanic Garden , have plant @-@ breeding programs and introduce new plants to the horticultural trade . 
 = = Future = = 
 Botanical gardens are still being built , such as the first botanical garden in Oman , which will be one of the largest gardens in the world . Once completed , it will house the first large @-@ scale cloud forest in a huge glasshouse . Development of botanical gardens in China over recent years has been a remarkable , including the Hainan Botanical Garden of Tropical Economic Plants South China Botanical Garden at Guangzhou , the <unk> Botanical Garden of Tropical Plants and the Xiamen Botanic Garden , but in developed countries , many have closed for lack of financial support , this being especially true of botanical gardens attached to universities . 
 Botanical gardens have always responded to the interests and values of the day . If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens , it would be their scientific endeavour and , flowing from this , their instructional value . In their formative years , botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists , but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public . The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities , not by its living collections . The interest in economic plants now has less relevance , and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared , while a fascination with the curious , beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish . 
 In recent times , the focus has been on creating an awareness of the threat to the Earth 's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources . Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public . Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability .

 = Grand Western Canal = 
 The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom . The canal had its origins in various plans , going back to 1796 , to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal , bypassing Lands End . An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal to lime kilns along with the removal of the resulting quicklime , which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses . This intended canal @-@ link was never completed as planned , as the coming of the railways removed the need for its existence . 
 Construction was in two phases . A level section from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon / Somerset border , opened in 1814 , and was capable of carrying broad @-@ beam barges , carrying up to 40 tons . The Somerset section , suitable for tub @-@ boats , which were about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long and capable of carrying eight tons , opened in 1839 . It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts , the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK . The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years . 
 The 11 miles of Devon section remains open , despite various threats to its future , and is now a designated country park and local nature reserve , and allows navigation . The Somerset section was closed in 1867 , and is gradually disappearing from the landscape , although sections are now used as a footpath . It maintains a historical interest and has been subject to some archaeological excavations . 
 = = History = = 
 The Grand Western Canal was conceived as one of several competing schemes to alleviate the hazards and delays of coastal sailing ships making a passage around Land 's End to get between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel . A canal from the mouth of the River Exe to Exeter had been opened in 1566 ; and eight miles of the River Tone had been made navigable in 1638 . Navigation of the River Tone had been extended to Taunton in 1717 , by the construction of locks on the upper section . 
 Against this background , in 1768 a committee of men commissioned James Brindley to survey a route , in the form of a canal , between Taunton and Exeter ; and the survey was duly carried out by Robert Whitworth in 1769 . This was to have been called the Exeter to Uphill Canal ; as it involved a route from Topsham or Exeter to Taunton , then the use of the River Tone and a second canal from Burrow Bridge , via Bridgwater , Glastonbury , Wells and Axbridge , to Uphill . Nothing further came of the plan until the 1790s , when various canal engineers were consulted , and in 1794 John Rennie was asked by a different committee , the Grand Western Canal Committee , to make another survey , which was adopted , and formed the basis for a planned Act of Parliament . Opposition from the City of Exeter , who feared it would compete with the Exeter Canal for transportation of coal , was eventually softened ; and the Act was passed on 24 March 1796 . 
 The Act authorised a canal from Taunton to Topsham with branches to Tiverton and Cullompton . Water supply would be derived from proposed reservoirs , one on the River Tone and two on the River Culm , and from any other available sources within 2000 yd ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) of the line of the canal . The canal company was also authorised to improve the River Tone near Taunton , and to raise £ 220 @,@ 000 , plus an additional £ 110 @,@ 000 if required . Navigation onwards from Taunton was via the River Tone and the River Parrett . Construction did not start immediately . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Finally in 1810 , work started under the direction of John Thomas . Surprisingly , the decision was taken to start in the middle , with a 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) section of the main line and the 9 miles ( 14 km ) branch to Tiverton . The logic for this was that there was a large potential trade in limestone between quarries at <unk> and Tiverton , and this would generate income . The summit level was cut 16 feet ( 5 m ) lower than the original plans , so that no locks would be required , but this greatly increased the amount of earthworks required . A further Act was obtained in 1811 to sanction this , and to re @-@ route the canal near Halberton , where Rock Bridge was constructed to carry the road over the canal . The same engineers that built the canal also built a substantial country house , turnpike house and cottages at the site . Several other bridges , including Batten 's Bridge , <unk> Bridge , Greenway Bridge and Sellick Bridge were also constructed at Halberton to carry minor roads over the canal . 
 With costs much higher than anticipated , work ceased in June 1811 . After much deliberation , it was decided to continue construction , and to obtain a third Act of Parliament to authorise increased charges for carriage of goods . By 1812 , progress was being made , but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe <unk> . Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with puddle clay . Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials , which can still be seen beside the canal , close to the <unk> Tunnel . <unk> Bridge and <unk> Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe , where culverts were also needed to manage the streams . At a total cost of £ 244 @,@ 505 , the canal was opened on 25 August 1814 , when the first boat travelled from Lowdwells to Tiverton , laden with coal . 
 At Sampford Peverell two <unk> were built in 1836 , at the expense of the Grand Western Canal Company , in compensation for cutting through the grounds and demolishing the south wing of the Old Rectory . Two road bridges were also needed in the village . 
 = = = Second Phase = = = 
 Traffic on the opened section was much lower than anticipated , and the prospects of building the rest of the canal dwindled , as profits were minimal . However , in 1829 James Green turned his attention to the link to Taunton . He had been the architect of the Bude Canal , which was built for tub @-@ boats and used inclined planes to change levels , and proposed a similar solution here . The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827 , making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone . In a report of 1830 , Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes , and estimated the cost of the canal at £ 65 @,@ 000 . 
 Work started in 1831 , and progressed quickly , including the construction of a bridge at Bradford on Tone and <unk> Bridge at Langford <unk> , where a new warehouse was also built . In addition to the boat lift in Nynehead two aqueducts were required within the village . 
 The route in Taunton was altered to connect to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal directly , rather than using a short stretch of the River Tone . Seven lifts and one inclined plane were to be built , and it was these features that caused the subsequent delay in the completion of the canal . <unk> problems with the design of the lifts gradually came to light , and although the cost of rectifying these was borne by Green , the canal could not be opened . There were also problems with the inclined plane . The canal was partially opened to Wellington , in 1835 ; but in January 1836 , Green was dismissed . 
 = = = Completion = = = 
 The engineer W A <unk> was asked to survey the works , and to report on the lifts and the causes of the failure of the plane . His clear report is an important source of information on the canal at the time of its construction . Some remedial work was instigated , following the report , including the provision of a steam engine to power the Wellisford incline . The 14 miles ( 22 @.@ 5 km ) extension was fully opened on 28 June 1838 , at a cost of about £ 80 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Boat lifts = = 
 Green 's use of boat lifts was innovative . The idea was not new , as he acknowledged in an article describing the lifts which he published in Transactions in 1838 , having been suggested in principle by a Dr James Anderson of Edinburgh in 1796 . Robert Weldon had tried to build one on the Somersetshire Coal Canal in 1798 , which was replaced by an inclined plane after persistent failures . One was built at Ruabon on the Ellesmere Canal in 1796 , but was replaced as it was not robust enough for regular use . James Fussell built one on the abortive Dorset and Somerset Canal , but the works were abandoned before it was ever used regularly . The lift at Tardebigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced by locks in 1815 as it was " too complex and delicate " , according to Rennie . Finally , another lift at Camden Town on the Regent 's Canal was replaced by locks in 1815 because it could not be made to work . 
 = = = Principles = = = 
 With no working prototypes , Green set about building seven lifts . The principle was simple . Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of 16 feet ( 5 m ) diameter , by wrought iron chains . The caisson at the bottom was jacked against the front wall of the lift to seal it , and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in . The caisson at the top was jacked against the back wall in a similar manner . When both boats were in , the doors on the caissons and lift were closed , and the jacks released . Because a boat displaces its own weight in water , the system should be balanced , and a small amount of energy is required to start the boats moving . When the top caisson reaches the bottom , the jacks are applied , the doors are opened , and the boats can continue . 
 In order to maintain the balance , a second chain was fixed to the bottom of the caisson , so that the total length of chain on each side of the lift remained the same . As a caisson descended , the chain coiled up at the bottom of the lift . The small amount of energy was created by ensuring that the ascending caisson was a little too low by the time the descending one reached the bottom . Thus it would hold a greater depth of water by the time it was ready to descend again . In practice , about 2 inches ( 5 cm ) of water , weighing about a ton , was found to be sufficient . 
 = = = Problems = = = 
 The difficulty was that Anderson had suggested that the water in the caisson chambers should be at a lower level than that in the canal . This had not been implemented , and so the lower caisson would not sink deep enough for either boat to be floated out . Attempts to fit gates and to let the water in the chamber drain to waste had proved ineffective . Ultimately , lock chambers were built at the foot of the each lift . These were filled with water from the upper level , so that the boat could float out , and it then descended the final 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) as it would in a conventional lock . Only the lift at Greenham used Anderson 's principle , and included a proper drain to lower the level in the chambers . 
 With the inclined plane , the problems stemmed from a mis @-@ calculation . Power was provided by a large tank , filled with water , which descended in a shaft , raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so . When the tank reached the bottom of the shaft , the water discharged , and the second tank was used to reverse the process . Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal , where this design had been used successfully , but the size of the tanks at Wellisford were much too small . On the Bude Canal , a tank holding 15 tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons . The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons , but the tanks only held ten tons of water , whereas tests indicated that about 25 tons was needed . It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power .

 The Somerset section of the canal was suitable for tub @-@ boats , which were about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long and capable of carrying eight tons . The Devon section was suitable for larger broad @-@ beam barges , carrying up to 40 tons . Income from tolls increased steadily from £ 971 in 1835 , rising to £ <unk> in 1838 and £ <unk> in 1844 . At this point , competition from the railways started . The Bristol and Exeter Railway reached Taunton in 1842 and Exeter in 1844 . A branch to Tiverton was opened in 1848 , and although the canal company received £ 1200 for loss of trade while an aqueduct was constructed over the line of the railway , deficits started to mount up almost immediately . 
 In 1853 , with income no longer meeting operational costs , the canal was leased to the Bristol and Exeter Railway . From 1854 , the company started to pay a dividend to its shareholders of 0 @.@ 2 % . Just ten years later , an Act of Parliament was obtained to sell the canal to the railway company and to abandon the Somerset section of the canal . The transfer took place on 13 April 1865 , and the tub @-@ boat canal was closed in 1867 . The lifts were dismantled , and most of the route sold back to the original landowners . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Limestone traffic continued on the Tiverton section . Only two boats were working the canal by 1904 , and the last commercial traffic was <unk> from <unk> quarry to Tiverton , where there was a crushing plant . Around 7 @,@ 000 tons per year were transported up to 1925 . After this the only income was from the washing of sheep , for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep , and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal . In the 1930s , dams were built at both ends of a section near Halberton , where persistent leakage could not be cured . 
 Having passed into the ownership of the Great Western Railway in 1888 , the canal became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission when the railways were nationalised in 1948 , and was formally closed in 1962 . The responsibility for it passed to the British Waterways Board in 1964 . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 With various plans for using the route of the canal for landfill and for a bypass , some local interest was aroused regarding its future . The Tiverton Canal Preservation Committee was formed in 1962 . This committee was stirred to action by plans in 1966 to infill parts of the canal so that housing could be built over it . Tiverton Borough Council gave the committee the power to negotiate with the British Waterways Board in March 1967 , but the Board were unwilling to offer financial assistance . 
 Changes in legislation aided the cause . From 1968 , county councils could set up country parks , under the Countryside Act 1968 , and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways . By 1969 , BWB had stated that they were prepared to hand over the canal to Devon County Council , together with some money for maintenance . With some representatives within the council wavering , the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969 . Around 400 walkers set off , with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun , and by the time Tiverton was reached , the party totalled about 1200 people . 
 = = = Handover = = = 
 By April 1970 , the British Waterways Board had agreed to give the canal to Devon County Council , with £ 30 @,@ 000 for maintenance . The actual contract was signed on 5 May 1971 at Tiverton Town Hall , when General Sir Hugh Stockwell of the BWB also handed over a cheque for £ 38 @,@ 750 to Colonel Eric Palmer , chairman of Devon County Council . The transfer of the canal was effective from 24 June 1971 . 
 The new owners set to work immediately . The dry section was excavated and lined with a butyl liner to prevent leakage . The canal was reopened in 1971 . Navigation was restricted to unpowered boats , with the exception of a maintenance boat that was used for cutting weed , while the final section from <unk> to Lowdwells , which would have been part of the original main line to Exeter , is designated as a nature reserve , and so all navigation and angling is discouraged . The canal is now a designated country park , and a horse @-@ drawn tourist narrowboat runs from Tiverton . Since 2003 powered boats have been allowed on the Canal , subject to Licence from Devon County Council . The Canal is also a very popular Coarse Fishing spot and angling rights on the Canal are leased to the Tiverton and District Angling Club . In addition to holding a valid Environment Agency Rod Licence , a permit must be purchased in advance . 
 The Somerset section is largely dry and is gradually disappearing into the landscape , as a result of roads improvements and ploughing , but a footpath has been established along much of its route , and archaeological excavations of the lift at Nynehead , the only one where there are still substantial remains , were carried out between 1998 and 2003 by the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society . 
 = = 2012 breach and repair = = 
 Exceptionally heavy rainfall in November 2012 caused a major break in the Grand Western Canal 's banks , near Halberton , necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated . Two temporary dams were installed which allowed the rest of the canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013 . Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike , eels , perch , bream , tench and roach were lost . About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish . The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3 @,@ 000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing . 
 Devon County Council agreed to pay for repairs to the canal , in time for its 200th anniversary and on 7 July 2013 , a 3 million pound project to repair the breach , began with an official turf cutting . The repairs included rebuilding the failed embankment and raising the level to reduce the risk of overtopping in the future , and further improvements to water <unk> canal was lined with an impermeable material along the length of the embankment . In addition a water level monitoring and alarm system has been installed . This system has sensors in Tiverton and Burlescombe and alerts the canal rangers and Devon County Council if the levels become exceptionally high . <unk> of the breached section began on 4 March 2014 using a sluice gate at Rock Bridge which gradually filled the empty section and the canal was officially re @-@ opened on 19 March 2014 by chairman of Devon County Council Councillor Bernard Hughes . Six narrow boats , led by Chairmen of Halberton Parish Council , Councillor Ken Browse , were the first to travel on the new section .

 Nobuo Uematsu ( <unk> <unk> , Uematsu Nobuo , born March 21 , 1959 ) is a Japanese video game composer , best known for scoring the majority of titles in the Final Fantasy series . He is considered to be one of the most famous and respected composers in the video game community . Sometimes referred to as the " Beethoven of video games music " , he appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame . 
 Uematsu , a self @-@ taught musician , began playing the piano at the age of twelve , with English songwriter Elton John as his biggest influence . Uematsu joined Square in 1986 , where he met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi . They have worked together on many video game titles , most notably the games in the Final Fantasy series . After 18 years with Square , he left in 2004 to found his own company called Smile Please , and the music label Dog Ear Records . He has since composed music as a freelancer for many other video games , including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi 's development studio Mistwalker . 
 Many soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu 's game scores have been released . Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various Final Fantasy concerts , where he has worked with Grammy Award @-@ winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these performances . From 2002 to 2010 , he was in a hard rock band with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages , in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards . The band played arranged rock versions of Uematsu 's Final Fantasy compositions . He has since performed with Earthbound Papas , which he formed in 2011 as the successor to The Black Mages .

 Uematsu was born in Kōchi , Kōchi Prefecture , Japan . A self @-@ taught musician , he began to play the piano when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old , and he did not take any formal piano lessons . He has an older sister who also played the piano . After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English , Uematsu played the keyboard in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials . When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo , a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on . Although he agreed , Uematsu at the time considered it a side job , and he did not think it would become a full @-@ time career . He said it was a way to make some money on the side , while also keeping his part @-@ time job at the music rental shop . 
 = = = Career with Square = = = 
 Uematsu joined Square in 1985 , and composed the soundtrack to Cruise Chaser <unk> in 1986 , his first . While working at Square , he met Hironobu Sakaguchi , who asked him if he wanted to create music for some of his games , which Uematsu agreed to . For the next year , he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success , including titles like Genesis and Alpha . In 1987 , Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi 's last contribution for Square , Final Fantasy , a game that turned out to be a huge success . 
 Final Fantasy 's popularity sparked Uematsu 's career in video game music , and he would go on to compose music for over 30 titles , most prominently the subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series . He scored the first installment in the SaGa series , The Final Fantasy Legend , in 1989 . For the second game in the series , Final Fantasy Legend II he was assisted by Kenji Ito . In late 1994 , Uematsu signed on to finish the soundtrack for the critically acclaimed title Chrono Trigger after the game 's composer , Yasunori Mitsuda , contracted peptic ulcers . In 1996 , he co @-@ composed the soundtrack to Front Mission : Gun Hazard , and created the entire score for <unk> . He also created music for three of the games in the Hanjuku Hero series . 
 Outside video games , he has composed the main theme for the 2000 animated film Ah ! My Goddess : The Movie and co @-@ composed the anime Final Fantasy : Unlimited ( 2001 ) with Final Fantasy orchestrator Shirō Hamaguchi . He also inspired the Ten Plants concept albums , and released a solo album in 1994 , entitled Phantasmagoria . Feeling gradually more dissatisfied and uninspired , Uematsu requested the assistance of composers Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano for the score to Final Fantasy X in 2001 . This marked the first time that Uematsu did not compose an entire main @-@ series Final Fantasy soundtrack . For Final Fantasy XI from 2002 , he was joined by Naoshi Mizuta , who composed the majority of the soundtrack , and Kumi Tanioka ; Uematsu was responsible for only eleven tracks . In 2003 , he assisted Hitoshi Sakimoto in scoring Final Fantasy Tactics Advance by providing the main theme . 
 In 2002 , fellow Square colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito asked Uematsu to join them in forming a rock band that focused on reinterpreting and expanding on Uematsu 's compositions . He declined their offer at first because he was too busy with work ; however , after agreeing to perform with Fukui and Sekito in a live performance as a keyboardist , he decided to join them in making a band . Another employee at Square , Mr. Matsushita , chose the name The Black Mages for their band . In 2003 , Keiji Kawamori , Arata Hanyuda , and Michio Okamiya also joined the band . The Black Mages released three studio albums , and appeared at several concerts to promote their albums . 
 = = = Current freelancer career = = = 
 Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 and formed his own company called Smile Please ; he also created the music production company Dog Ear Records in 2006 . The reason for Uematsu 's departure was that the company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku , Tokyo , and he was not comfortable with the new location . Also , he cites the fact that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands . He does , however , continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix . In 2005 , Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children . Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII ( 2006 ) ; he was originally offered the job of creating the full score , but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead . Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII ( 2010 ) . However , after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV , Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer , Hamauzu . 
 Uematsu also works closely with Sakaguchi 's development studio Mistwalker , and has composed for Blue Dragon ( 2006 ) , Lost Odyssey ( 2007 ) , Away : Shuffle Dungeon ( 2008 ) ; The Last Story ( 2011 ) ; and Terra Battle ( 2014 ) . He also wrote music for the cancelled game Cry On . 
 Uematsu created the main theme for the multi @-@ composer game Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008 . He then composed the music for the 2009 anime Guin Saga ; this marked the first time he provided a full score for an animated series . Uematsu recently contributed music and storyline to an e @-@ book titled called " <unk> @-@ 0 1946 " . He is currently working on soundtracks for multiple games , including Project Phoenix . 
 Uematsu appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame . In 2012 , " Aerith 's Theme " , written by Uematsu for Final Fantasy VII , was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM ( UK ) " Hall of Fame " top 300 chart . It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart . In 2013 , music from the Final Fantasy series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame . Uematsu and his Final Fantasy music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014 , number nine in 2015 , and number 17 in 2016 .

 Uematsu 's video game compositions have been performed in numerous concerts , and various Final Fantasy concerts have also been held . Outside Japan , Uematsu 's Final Fantasy music was performed live for the first time at the first event of the 2003 Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig , Germany . Other events of the Symphonic Game Music Concerts featuring Final Fantasy music were held in 2004 , 2006 , and 2007 . The concert in 2004 featured a world premiere of Those Who Fight from Final Fantasy VII . Japanese pianist Seiji Honda was invited to perform the arrangement together with the orchestra . Another world premiere was " Dancing Mad " from Final Fantasy VI , performed by orchestra , choir , and pipe organ . The event in 2007 included " Distant Worlds " from Final Fantasy XI , performed by Japanese opera soprano Izumi Masuda . 
 A series of successful concert performances were held in Japan , including a Final Fantasy concert series titled Tour de Japon . The first stateside concert , Dear Friends - Music from Final Fantasy , took place on May 10 , 2004 , at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles , California , and was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale . It was conducted by Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra director Miguel Harth @-@ Bedoya . Due to a positive reception , a concert series for North America followed . On May 16 , 2005 , a follow @-@ up concert called More Friends : Music from Final Fantasy was performed in Los Angeles at the Gibson Amphitheatre ; the concert was conducted by Grammy Award @-@ winning Arnie Roth . 
 Uematsu also made a guest appearance at A Night in Fantasia 2004 performed by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra 's debut concert in October 2004 which coincided with his last day as a staff at Square Enix . 
 Uematsu 's Final Fantasy music was presented in the concert Voices - Music from Final Fantasy , which took place on February 18 , 2006 at the Pacifico Yokohama convention center . Star guests included Emiko Shiratori , Rikki , Izumi Masuda , and Angela Aki . The concert focused on the songs from the Final Fantasy series and was conducted by Arnie Roth . Uematsu and several of his fellow composers were in attendance at the world premiere of Play ! A Video Game Symphony in Chicago , Illinois on May 27 , 2006 ; he composed the opening fanfare for the concert . He also attended the European debut in Stockholm , Sweden on June 14 , 2006 , the performance in Toronto , Canada on September 30 , 2006 , and in Florence , Italy , on October 10 , 2007 . The world tour Distant Worlds : Music from Final Fantasy was held in Stockholm , and was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Arnie Roth on December 4 , 2007 . The second concert of the tour was held at the Rosemont Theatre near Chicago on March 1 , 2008 . The tour has continued , with a recent concert in Houston , Texas on July 24 , 2010 . Music from Final Fantasy made up one fourth of the music in the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Cologne in September 2009 which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth . 
 In February 2010 , it was announced that Uematsu would appear at Anime Boston , one of the largest anime conventions on the East Coast . Uematsu did not only show up at Anime Boston , he made a surprise appearance and played with the Video Game Orchestra for the track One Winged Angel . On top of this , he made a short visit to the prestigious Berklee College of Music for a brief Q & A session at the request of VGO founder and Berklee alumni Shota Nakama . In January 2012 , Uematsu performed with his band Earthbound Papas at <unk> X in National Harbor , MD . On November 24 , 2012 , Uematsu performed in a Final Fantasy Distant Worlds concert with Arnie Roth conducting the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra , Adelaide Philharmonia Chorus and soloists at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre . On June 14 and 15 , 2013 , Uematsu performed in a Final Fantasy Distant Worlds concert with Arnie Roth conducting the Vienna Volksoper Orchestra and Vienna Chamber Chorus at Konzerthaus , Vienna . 
 On August 18 , 2013 , while headlining the Fantasy Rock Festival in Kawasaki , Japan with the Earthbound Papas , he revealed to the audience that he had originally intended to name their second album " Dancing Mad " after the Final Fantasy VI track which also appears on the album . However , referring to Square Enix indirectly , he told the audience that " a certain company ' S ' " had phoned and informed him that he " could not use the name " . Consequently , instead of backing down he decided to name the album " Dancing Dad " , as a nod to the band 's name . He also told the audience that he wanted to make an album of wholly original songs , but lamented that " it 's just that if there are no game songs on it , it probably wouldn 't sell ! " . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 The style of Uematsu 's compositions is diverse , ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new @-@ age and hyper @-@ percussive techno @-@ electronica . For example , in Lost Odyssey , the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks . Uematsu has stated that he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music , and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles . Uematsu 's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat , to dark and angry , to melancholic in nature . For instance , the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy , while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat . His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene ; an example is " Aerith 's Theme " from Final Fantasy VII . In an interview with the <unk> Bei Times , Uematsu said " I don 't really self @-@ consciously compose music for Japan or for the world , but I do think there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality . " He has been named one of the " Innovators " in Time Magazine 's " Time 100 : The Next Wave — Music " feature . He has also been called the " John Williams of the video game world " and been credited for " increasing the appreciation and awareness " of video game music . 
 Many of Uematsu 's musical influences come from the United Kingdom and the United States . He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence , and he has stated that he wanted to be like him . Other major inspirations include The Beatles , Emerson , Lake & Palmer , Simon & Garfunkel , and progressive rock bands . In the classical genre , he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence . Uematsu has said that 1970s bands , such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson , had an impact on his Final Fantasy compositions . The intro to the piece " One @-@ Winged Angel " from Final Fantasy VII was inspired by the Jimi Hendrix song " Purple Haze " ; the lyrics were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata Carmina Burana , specifically the songs " Estuans Interius " , " O Fortuna " , " Veni , Veni , Venias " and " Ave Formosissima " . In turn , Nobuo Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video games industry as well . For example , " Liberi Fatali " from Final Fantasy VIII was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women 's synchronized swimming event . From the same game , " Eyes on Me " , featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong , sold a record 400 @,@ 000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards , where it won " Song of the Year ( International ) " in 2000 .

 = Indre Wijdefjorden National Park = 
 Indre Wijdefjorden National Park ( Norwegian : Indre Wijdefjorden <unk> ) is located in a steep fjord landscape in northern Spitsbergen in Svalbard , Norway . It covers the inner part of Wijdefjorden — the longest fjord on Svalbard . The national park was established on 9 September 2005 and covers 1 @,@ 127 km2 ( 435 sq mi ) , of which 745 km2 ( 288 sq mi ) is on land and 382 km2 ( 147 sq mi ) is sea . The marine environment changes vastly from the mouth of the fjord , through a still , cold , water basin , becoming deeper before reaching the glacier Mittag @-@ Lefflerbreen at the inner @-@ most sections of the fjord . 
 On both sides of Wijdefjorden there is High Arctic steppe vegetation , dominated by grasses and extremely dry , basic earth . There are some areas dominated by exposure of mineral earth . The area around the fjord has a vegetation which is unique and not preserved in other areas of Svalbard . Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs , it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard . There are several exclusive species in the national park , including <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Gentianella tenella and Kobresia <unk> . Of the larger fjords on Svalbard , Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans , although a trapping station has been built at <unk> .

 Indre Wijdefjorden National Park covers 1 @,@ 127 km2 ( 435 sq mi ) , of which 745 km2 ( 288 sq mi ) is on land and 382 km2 ( 147 sq mi ) is sea , making it the smallest national park in Svalbard . It is located in the steep fjord landscape on both sides of the inner ( " Indre " ) parts of Wijdefjorden ( " The Wide Fjord " ) on Spitsbergen . At 108 kilometres ( 67 mi ) length , Wijdefjorden is the longest fjord on Svalbard . It is located on the northern coast of Spitsbergen , between Andrée Land to the west , Dickson Land to the south and Ny @-@ Friesland to the east . The inner parts of Wijdefjorden split into two , with the eastern , 32 @-@ kilometre ( 20 mi ) long part known as <unk> ( " The East Fjord " ) , and the shorter as Vestfjorden ( " The West Fjord " ) . At the end of <unk> is the glacier Mittag @-@ Lefflerbreen . 
 The inner parts of the fjord receive some of the lowest precipitation of the archipelago . Combined with the exposed basic earth , this results in Europe 's only High Arctic steppe . The only other area with this landscape is the north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago . The rock bed on each side of the fjord is different . On the west side there are Devonian deposits , while there is bedrock on the east side , resulting in different vegetation on each side . The fjord has a unique shape ; it has a wide mouth ( thus the name ) , but at <unk> there is a shallow section which is 50 metres ( 160 ft ) deep . This reduces the circulation in the inner parts of the fjord , which have a cold @-@ water basin 250 metres ( 820 ft ) deep . 
 Average July temperatures range from 4 to 6 ° C ( 39 to 43 ° F ) , and in January temperatures are normally between − 12 and − 16 ° C ( 10 and 3 ° F ) . The Arctic climate results in permafrost , which can be up to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) deep . The North Atlantic Current moderates Svalbard 's temperatures , particularly during winter , giving it up to 20 ° C ( 36 ° F ) higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in continental Russia and Canada , keeping the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year . The shelter of the mountains gives the inland fjord areas less temperature difference than the coast . 
 = = History = = 
 The area around Wijdefjorden was first used by Russian , and later Norwegian , trappers . The cabin at <unk> was erected in 1910 , and two years later the cabin at <unk> was built . Trappers considered the area to have few polar bears but much fox ; they could also supplement the catch with common eider . In 1928 , a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes . In 1932 , the area 's special vegetation was protected , which was assimilated into the national park when it was created . Since the 1980s , trapping has again been taken up , and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at <unk> that can be rented for a season of trapping . Of the larger fjords on Svalbard , Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans . 
 During the considerations prior to the establishment of the national park , there was a conflict with the mining industry . Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders , and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park . The national park was established on 9 September 2005 . It completed a several @-@ year @-@ long plan to increase the amount of protected areas of Svalbard from 55 % to 65 % , which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park , Sassen – <unk> Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park . 
 = = Management = = 
 The establishment of the national park and the protection is based on the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act , which takes its mandate from the requirements in the Svalbard Treaty to protect the environment of the archipelago . The overall responsibility for protection lies with the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment , which has delegated management to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of Svalbard . The latter performs all day @-@ to @-@ day practical management , including registration and inspection . In aspects related to cultural heritage , the Governor reports to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage , and in issues relating to pollution , to the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority . While it has no authority , the Norwegian Polar Institute performs monitoring , mapping and research . 
 Traditionally , the mining industry in Svalbard has had more rights to operations within protected areas than in mainland Norway , where all such activities would be completely banned . Indre Wijdefjorden has the most strict regulations , with a total ban on construction of buildings and facilities , laying of cables and roads , earthwork , drainage , drilling , blasting , and excavation of petroleum , gas and minerals . It is the authorities ' goal that Svalbard is to be one of the best @-@ managed wilderness areas in the world . Svalbard , and thus the national park , is on Norway 's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 = = Nature = = 
 The vegetation on both sides of the fjord is High Arctic steppe , which is characterized by grasses . It is caused by extremely low precipitation , basic earth with salt deposits in the surface , and large areas of exposed mineral earth . The area around the fjord has a unique vegetation , which has not preserved in other areas of Svalbard . Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs , it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard . There are several unique species in the national park , including <unk> , which is featured in the national park 's logo and for which Svalbard is the only known location in Europe , <unk> <unk> , Gentianella tenella and Kobresia <unk> . There is breeding ground for pink @-@ footed goose within the park , although Svalbard ptarmigan can also be found . Animals that can be found in the park include polar bear , Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox . 
 Both fauna and flora are affected by the cold temperatures and the extreme light conditions . Activity is at a stand @-@ still during the polar night , which lasts for many months . During the summer , months of midnight sun help accelerate the natural processes . The nature in the area is especially susceptible to global warming . Models show that the winter temperatures will increase more than the summer temperatures , resulting in more precipitation . Because the vegetation requires little rain and much wind , this may result in major changes . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Entrance to national park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north , or over land from <unk> and <unk> from the south . During winter , the area is accessible from Longyearbyen , either by snowmobile or by ski . There are several older trapper cabins in the park , and some of these are lent to residents of Longyearbyen . Except for <unk> , a lake with Arctic char , there are few destinations within the park , although the park can be used as a basis for other destinations . This includes trips to <unk> , Svalbard 's second @-@ highest peak , and the glacier <unk> . Because of the shape of the park , there is little good hiking within the park , except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord . It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag @-@ Lefflerbreen , which can be hiked to from Pyramiden . 
 The freedom to roam is strong in Norwegian culture and law , and also applies to Svalbard . However , there more restrictions on the archipelago . The freedom includes the right to tent , but this must be done at least 100 metres ( 330 ft ) from any cultural monuments . As far as possible , tenting must occur on vegetation @-@ free land . Tenting for more than one week at a site requires a permit from the Governor . Beaches have large amounts of driftwood from Siberia , which can be used for campfires with the same location restrictions as tenting . 
 As in all Norwegian national parks , motorized land transport is banned . However , on Svalbard this does not include snowmobiles . On the other hand , cycling is banned . The Governor can , however , enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park . Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight @-@ seeing are also prohibited . Polar bears are protected , but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self @-@ defense , as a last resort , should they attack . Most flora and fauna are protected ; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks , although there are some exceptions . Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor , and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists . Fishing is not permitted , although dispensations can be given . 
 All tourists traveling to Svalbard must pay a tourist tax of 150 Norwegian krone , which is entirely used for conservation . The tax is included in all ship and air tickets to the archipelago , which residents can get refunded . Everyone roaming outside of the settlements must report to the Governor . This includes the requirement to sign a special insurance policy to cover any search and rescue costs the Governor would incur , should it be necessary . 
 = Lewis McGee = 
 Lewis McGee , VC ( 13 May 1888 – 12 October 1917 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces . As a sergeant in the Australian Imperial Force , McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in the Battle of Broodseinde — part of the Passchendaele offensive — on 4 October 1917 . As his platoon came under heavy machine gun fire from a German pillbox , McGee rushed alone across open ground towards the emplacement . Armed solely with a revolver , he shot the gunners and captured the garrison . He then organised a bombing party , and led the group in the seizure of a second machine gun post . 
 Born in Tasmania , McGee gained employment as an engine driver with the Tasmanian Department of Railways . In March 1916 , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War . He was posted to the 40th Battalion , and completed training in Tasmania and the United Kingdom , where he was promoted to lance corporal . Transferring to the Western Front in November 1916 , McGee was rapidly promoted to corporal then sergeant , and took part in the Battle of Messines . He was killed in action on 12 October 1917 , eight days after his Victoria Cross exploit . 
 = = Early life = = 
 McGee was born in Campbell Town , Tasmania , on 13 May 1888 , the youngest of eleven children to John McGee , a labourer and farmer , and his wife Mary ( née Green ) . Three of McGee 's sisters had died in infancy prior to his birth , and — when Lewis was aged only seven — his mother succumbed to pleurisy . Following his wife 's death , John relocated his remaining family to a new farming property near Avoca . Here , Lewis gained employment as an engine driver with the Tasmanian Department of Railways . He also achieved a reputation as a " powerful athlete " , particularly as a cyclist with the Avoca Cycling Club . On 15 November 1914 , McGee married Eileen Rose Bailey ; the couple had daughter Nada the following year . 
 = = First World War = = 
 On 1 March 1916 , McGee enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War . Allotted to the 40th Battalion as a private , he was initially posted for training at Claremont military camp with his unit for a period of three months . He was advanced to lance corporal on 22 May . On finalising its primary training , the 40th Battalion embarked for the United Kingdom on 1 July , with McGee aboard HMAT Berrima . Arriving seven weeks later , the battalion was dispatched to Salisbury Plain to complete an additional period of training in preparation of its deployment to the Western Front . 
 McGee proceeded to France , and the Western Front , with his battalion on 23 November 1916 , arriving the next day . The unit was ultimately posted to Armentières , where McGee was raised to corporal on 4 December . Five days after his promotion , the 40th Battalion was moved into the frontline , occupying a set of trenches just south of Lys . Over subsequent engagements , McGee gained a reputation as a " natural soldier " , which consequently led to his promotion to sergeant on 12 January 1917 . The 40th Battalion undertook various small @-@ scale operations and raids throughout this period until June , when it fought in the Battle of Messines . This was followed by a period in reserve behind the lines , before the battalion was shipped to Belgium in preparation for its service in the Passchendaele offensive . 
 = = = Victoria Cross = = = 
 As part of the third phase of the Passchendaele offensive , the 10th Australian Brigade — of which McGee 's 40th Battalion was part — was detailed to execute an attack on Broodseinde Ridge . The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault , one for each battalion , with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself . The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06 : 00 on 4 October 1917 , under the cover of an artillery barrage . The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives , though the fighting intensified with each stage . As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective , its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine @-@ gun and rifle fire , as well as by barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp . 
 With McGee 's B Company heading the 40th Battalion 's advance , the unit was able to progress to a point approximately 270 metres ( 300 yd ) in front of the crest , where it was confronted by a thick line of barbed wire and another bog , while simultaneously subject to the fire of ten machine guns in trenches and heavily defended pillboxes . The men of B Company struggled to within 90 metres ( 98 yd ) of the battalion 's objective , when the severe fire of the German machine guns pinned them down in shellholes . 
 McGee 's platoon was suffering heavy casualties from a particular machine gun 50 metres ( 55 yd ) in front of his position , which was set in a recess atop a concrete pillbox and firing directly at his men . Armed solely with a revolver , McGee dashed alone towards the post across the fire @-@ swept ground . Shooting the gunners , he captured the remaining soldiers in the garrison as prisoners and seized control of the pillbox . On returning to his unit , he reorganised his men and led a bombing party in the capture of a second machine @-@ gun post . McGee 's actions reignited the 40th Battalion 's advance , with McGee himself " foremost in the remainder " of the action . By 09 : 12 on 5 October , the 40th Battalion had seized its objective and held complete control of the Broodseinde Ridge , having captured 300 Germans as prisoners in the process . 
 As a result of his actions at Broodseinde , McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross , one of two Australians to be so decorated that day . However , he never saw the announcement of the award . On 12 October 1917 — eight days after McGee 's Victoria Cross action — the 40th Battalion returned to the frontline , in an attempt to exploit the success of the previous week . The battlefield was drenched in rain , turning the ground into a quagmire that was additionally dominated by several German pillboxes . McGee — who had been appointed acting company sergeant major of B Company that morning — led his unit into the attack . As the men of the company advanced forward , a machine gun began firing upon them from the front , before a second opened up on their flank . Men ran to take cover in shellholes as the German fire inflicted several casualties . McGee , however , made a rush towards the guns in an apparent effort to silence them . As he ran towards the pillbox , a bullet struck him in the head , killing him instantly . McGee was later buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery ; he was one of 248 members of the 40th Battalion killed or wounded during the Battle of Passchendaele . McGee 's fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient from Broodseinde , Lance Corporal Walter Peeler , was also severely wounded on this day , receiving a bullet wound to his arm . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The announcement and accompanying citation for McGee 's Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 November 1917 , reading : 
 War Office , 26th November , 1917 . 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer , Non @-@ commissioned Officers and Men : — 
 No. 456 Sjt . Lewis McGee , late Aus . Imp . Force . 
 For most conspicuous bravery when in the advance to the final objective , Sjt . McGee led his platoon with great dash and bravery , though strongly opposed , and under heavy shell fire . 
 His platoon was suffering severely and the advance of the Company was stopped by machine gun fire from a " Pill @-@ box " post . Single @-@ handed Sjt . McGee rushed the post armed only with a revolver . He shot some of the crew and captured the rest , and thus enabled the advance to proceed . He reorganised the remnants of his platoon and was foremost in the remainder of the advance , and during consolidation of the position he did splendid work . 
 This Non @-@ commissioned Officer 's coolness and bravery were conspicuous and contributed largely to the success of the Company 's operations . 
 Sjt . McGee was subsequently killed in action . 
 McGee 's wife , Eileen , was presented with her late husband 's Victoria Cross by the Governor @-@ General of Australia , Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson , at an investiture ceremony in Launceston 's York Park during October 1918 . Additionally , Eileen McGee was later gifted an Iron Cross that her husband had captured from a German officer at Broodseinde , which was enclosed in a letter of condolence written to her by an officer of the 40th Battalion . 
 Prior to his Victoria Cross action , McGee had been noted in the 40th Battalion for his leadership qualities , and had attained a " famous fighting record " . In addition to his decoration , McGee had been recommended for a commission as a result of his actions at Broodseinde , with an officer in his battalion declaring " had he lived his commission would have been assured " . His original company commander , Major Leslie Payne , noted McGee 's " sterling qualities as a leader " and stated : " His ability in the carrying out of certain important tasks early in the year was most marked and ... there is in my opinion , and the opinion of many others , no more gallant and capable non @-@ commissioned officer in the battalion . " 
 McGee is commemorated on a war cenotaph located in Ross , Tasmania , and his name was given to the McGee Soldiers ' Club at Anglesea Army Barracks , Tasmania , which was opened in 1956 . During the 150th anniversary celebrations of the town of Avoca in March 1984 , the Governor of Tasmania , Sir James Plimsoll , unveiled a memorial plaque on the Returned Serviceman 's League cenotaph honouring McGee ; his widow and their daughter attended the ceremony . McGee 's Victoria Cross and other medals are held in the collections of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery , Tasmania .

 " Papers " is a song by American recording artist Usher . The song was a buzz single for his sixth studio album Raymond v. Raymond . It was written by Usher , Alonzo " Gorilla Zoe " Mathis , Sean Garrett and Zaytoven , and was produced by the latter two . Although it was never identified as a track from the album , or as the lead single , it was released to U.S. urban and rhythmic radio stations on October 12 , 2009 , and subsequently available for digital download on October 16 , 2009 . 
 The song received positive reviews from critics who compared the track to his previous work , and embraced the lyrical content of the song . The song peaked at number thirty @-@ one on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs , giving Usher his tenth number one song on the chart . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 In June 2009 , co @-@ writer and producer of the song , Xavier " Zaytoven " Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song . Zaytoven divulged a few details , saying , " I can 't wait for something like that to come out , so people can see I do more than just hip @-@ hop . I can do R & B , pop , gospel ... whatever genre of music that 's out . If you listen to [ this new Usher song ] , you can 't say , ' Zaytoven did that . ' " According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News , the track was originally called " Filing Papers " . Zaytoven said , " This is before there were any reports about Usher 's marriage in the news . So I was thinking to myself , ' Is he trying to say something ? ' I don 't know what Usher is going through , but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers , divorce papers . The beat , it 's got a bounce to it . It 's outta here . " Sean Garrett later clarified , stating that the song was not necessarily called " Filing Papers " , Garret commented , 
 " Let 's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn 't have any idea of what he was going through personally . I work really hard at creating records I feel that 's gonna fit like a glove to an artist . Me and Usher have a close relationship ; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction , where I think they need to go in their next move . I felt that was the direction we needed to go . I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know : Was [ his relationship ] good or was it bad ? Was it right ? Are you happy or you 're not ? " 
 Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher 's state of marriage during the time of the song 's development , stating that the record could have meant anything , saying , " I 'm a heavy believer in God . I 'm a Pisces . My intuition is crazy . I think that 's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people . Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out . Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake @-@ up call to her . " In October 2009 , the track was released as the album 's buzz single , not intended to be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond , but to generate reception and feedback . In March 2010 , Usher continued to support Garrett 's original claims , stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended . Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond : 
 " I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex @-@ wife , " he said . " When the song was recorded , I wasn 't divorced . It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work , having to balance a career and having a normal life . Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships . I felt that in a way , the story did touch on certain things at the time . I didn 't know how realistic it would become . I didn 't know I would become divorced . I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that 's like a marriage at the same time . The song spoke to that place . Unfortunately , it did become a reality . " 
 Garrett said the song appeals to everyone , saying " Whether you 're a female in love , male in love , it 's a real record . Your mama has to feel this record , your daddy has to feel this record , everybody has to feel this record . That 's what good writers do . " Of its appeal Garrett said that it would have the effect of " Yeah ! " , and called the song an " explosive record " . Garrett went on to say , " I definitely feel it 's what Usher 's been wanting to say . But at the same time , it 's what a lot of people wanted to say , they just didn 't know what to say . " Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that " Usher pulls back the curtain , revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real " , and the song could be heard as an " postmortem " on his marriage , through the lines , " For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world / ' Cause you were my girl , girl , girl , I done damn near lost my mama , I done been through so much drama / I done turned into the man I never thought I 'd be / I 'm ready to sign them papers .

 Sarah MacRory of Billboard , compared the song to 2004 's " Burn " comparing " Papers " to the former number one hit 's " layered harmonies , mellow production and lyrics of heartache " . MacRory also said , " It 's the first time in a while that the singer sounds energized , as he unleashes deeply personal lyrics about the real @-@ life sacrifices he made for love . " Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News predicted that if " Papers " were any indication of his upcoming album , then " Raymond vs. Raymond may break some sales records " , as Confessions was the last time when " art was inspired by his life " . Andy Kellman of Allmusic said that Usher " pours himself " into the " Papers " and that the song " bears the closest relation to the turbulence he experienced . " Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that " It ’ s the kind of lacerating perspective that adulthood brings , but Usher ’ s too busy chasing his past to fully embrace it . " Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that the song was the album 's " last @-@ straw slow jam " and the only song other than " Foolin ' Around " that offers real revelation .

 = Leave Me Alone = 
 " Leave Me Alone " is a single by American singer Michael Jackson . The song was featured on Jackson 's seventh studio album , Bad ( 1987 ) , and was its eighth single in February 1989 , but was released outside of the United States and Canada . " Leave Me Alone " was recorded during the original album sessions but the song only appeared on the CD editions of Bad as a bonus track , as well as on the 2001 cassette edition . The song was written and composed by Jackson and produced by Quincy Jones ( with Jackson serving as co @-@ producer ) . 
 Internationally , the song was a success , peaking at number one and two in Ireland and the United Kingdom respectively and reaching the top 10 in Belgium , New Zealand and Spain . " Leave Me Alone " was generally well received by contemporary music critics . A short film was released for the song . In the film , Jackson pokes fun at the false rumors about him such as the stories about him purchasing the bones of " The Elephant Man " and his cosmetic surgeries . The short film was the recipient of a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Short Form Music Video . Despite the success of the single , the song never appeared on any of Jackson 's world concert tours .

 " Leave Me Alone " was a response to negative and false stories about Jackson that frequently appeared in the media and tabloids post @-@ 1986 after the success of Thriller . Beginning in 1986 , the tabloids began to publish false stories about Jackson , one of the first being a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process . A picture leaked out to the media of him lying down in a <unk> chamber at a hospital he visited . An unknown person took the picture of Jackson while he was testing out the chamber out of curiosity . 
 When Jackson bought a pet chimpanzee named Bubbles , the media viewed it as evidence of Jackson 's increasing detachment from reality . It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick , the " Elephant Man " ; Jackson stated that the story was " a complete lie . " These stories inspired the nickname " Wacko Jacko " , which Jackson acquired the following year , and would come to despise . Another frequent response from the media was about Jackson 's plastic surgery . Jackson 's manager said of the media 's criticism towards the topic , " So many terrible things have been written . Okay , so he had his nose fixed , and the cleft — big deal . I got news for you , my nose has broke five times . It 's been fixed twice . Who gives a shit ? Who cares ? Elvis had his nose done . Marilyn Monroe had her nose done , had her breasts done ? Everybody 's had it done . " 
 The song has been viewed as having a " paranoia theme " , a theme that Jackson had frequently used on previous studio albums . The Atlantic felt that Jackson showed " obvious expressions of distrust " in the song and that the song was one of multiple songs where Jackson 's " persistent loneliness in his music " was " prominent " . In 2009 , J. Edward Keyes , of Rolling Stone , described " Leave Me Alone " as sounding like " vintage Michael " and the song works because of its music , " a batch of thick chords for Jackson to vamp over " . Keyes noted that the song was a " kind of darker inversion " of " The Way You Make Me Feel " , and that " Leave Me Alone " was " worked @-@ up and angry , and Jackson 's aggressive scraping of the high notes makes plain his frustration . " 
 = = = Instrumentation = = = 
 " Leave Me Alone " is a funk song played with a synthesizer and a guitar . According to MusicNotes.com , the song is set in the key of Gb Major with Jackson 's voice range being sung from Bb3 to Ab5 . The song 's tempo is moderate and its metronome is 112 beats per minute . 
 = = Critical and commercial reception = = 
 " Leave Me Alone " was generally well received by contemporary music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine , a writer for AllMusic , stated he felt that " Leave Me Alone " was the best track on Bad , commenting " why are all of his best songs paranoid anthems ? " Steve Morse , a writer for The Boston Globe , described " Leave Me Alone " as a " send @-@ up " of Jackson 's feuds with the " paparazzi @-@ filled tabloids . " Jon Pareles , of The New York Times , commented that " Leave Me Alone " had an " unmistakable message " . After Jackson 's death in June 2009 , Rolling Stone listed " Leave Me Alone " as being one of Jackson 's most monumental work , and the song 's composition was generally praised . 
 " Leave Me Alone " performed well on various charts . It was released as a single outside of the United States and Canada . The song , similar to Bad 's previous singles , proved to be a commercial success internationally . " Leave Me Alone " ' s most successful territory was Ireland , where the song peaked at number one . The song saw similar chart success on the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Norwegian and Switzerland charts , peaking within the top 10 at number two , five , six and ten . " Leave Me Alone " also peaked within the top 20 in Austria , France and Sweden , peaking at number 15 , 17 and 19 . The single was least successful in Australia , where the song peaked at number 37 .

 The music video for " Leave Me Alone " , was directed by Jim Blashfield , produced by Jim Blashfield and Paul Diener and released on January 2 , 1989 . The video was also featured in the 1988 film Moonwalker .

There is an emphasis on the tabloid view of Jackson 's personal life and public image , referring to the nickname " Wacko Jacko " given to him by the press , and the various headlines associated with him in the 1980s . <unk> rumours that he tried to purchase Joseph Merrick 's bones , Jackson dances with stop motion " Elephant Man " bones in the video . This particular segment ( without the image of the bones ) was used for the single 's cover art , and the boneless video segment was featured in the Moonwalker trailer . 
 In the video , there are images of shrines to actress Elizabeth Taylor , a real life close friend of Jackson . Throughout the video newspaper headlines , published by " National Intruder " , with bizarre titles are shown , such as " Michael 's Space @-@ Age Diet " and " Michael Proposes to Liz " . Another notable scene in the music video was a nose being chased by a surgical scalpel , which was reference to Jackson 's plastic surgery being criticized by the media . At the end of the video , it is revealed that a gigantic Jackson himself is the amusement park . He breaks free , tearing the park to pieces . That scene is a somewhat reminiscent of Gulliver 's Travels , where Gulliver eventually breaks free from the <unk> ' grasp from Lilliput . The video is featured on Michael Jackson 's Vision and the Target version DVD of Bad 25 . 
 " Leave Me Alone " was the recipient of multiple nominations for its music video . The video won a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Short Form Music Video at the 32nd Grammy Awards . The video also received six nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards for Video of the Year , Viewers ' Choice , Breakthrough Video , Best Editing and Best Art Direction ; the video won Best Special Effects . The video lost its six nominations to Neil Young 's " This Note Is for You " ( " Video of the Year " ) , Art of Noise ( " Breakthrough Video " ) , Paula Abdul ( " Best Editing " ) , and Madonna 's " Express Yourself " ( " Best Cinematography " , " Best Art Direction " ) and " Like a Prayer " ( " Viewers ' Choice " ) . Erlewine described the music video as being " weirdly claustrophobic " and felt that , " not coincidentally , " it was the " best video from the album . "

 " 22 Short Films About Springfield " ( captioned on @-@ screen as " Twenty @-@ Two Short Films About Springfield " ) is the twenty @-@ first episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 14 , 1996 . It was written by Richard Appel , David S. Cohen , Jonathan Collier , Jennifer Crittenden , Greg Daniels , Brent Forrester , Dan Greaney , Rachel Pulido , Steve Tompkins , Josh Weinstein , Bill Oakley and Matt Groening , with the writing being supervised by Daniels . The episode was directed by Jim Reardon . Phil Hartman guest starred as Lionel Hutz and the hospital board chairman . The episode looks into the lives of other Springfield residents in a series of linked stories and originated from the end segment of the season four episode " The Front " . The episode is a loose parody of Pulp Fiction , which gave the staff the idea of a possible spin @-@ off from The Simpsons . The title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode is a series of short skits , each showing a brief slice of life in Springfield after Bart wonders if anything interesting happens to Springfield 's citizens :

He then attempts to disguise food from Krusty Burger as his own cooking , emerging from the kitchen carrying hamburgers and insisting that he said that they were having " steamed hams " ( apparently local Albany dialect for hamburgers ) . He then tries to cover up the kitchen being on fire by claiming that it contains an Aurora Borealis . Later , his mother is heard screaming , and a fire engine races to the house . 
 8 . Homer accidentally traps Maggie in a newspaper vending box , and ends up uprooting the box ( with Maggie inside ) and placing it in her bedroom .

 The episode 's principal idea came from the season four episode " The Front " , which featured a short scene entitled " The Adventures of Ned Flanders " at its conclusion . The scene had no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely to fill time . The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes , but none were short enough to require one . Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show 's characters , in a similar style to Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction . The title " 22 Short Films About Springfield " was decided upon from the start of the episode 's production , even though there are not actually twenty @-@ two stories in it . Originally there were more scenes , but several of them had to be cut out for time . To decide who would write each of the segments , all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat , the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts . Oakley wrote the Superintendent Chalmers story , Weinstein did the Comic Book Guy and Milhouse scene , David Cohen penned the Reverend Lovejoy sketch , as well as the deleted Krusty scene . Brent Forrester wrote the Krusty Burger scene , while Rachel Pulido , whose first Simpsons episode this was , wrote the Bumblebee Man one . Richard Appel wrote a deleted " elaborate fantasy segment " revolving around Marge , the only remnant of which is her cleaning the sink during the first Lisa scene , and also did a scene with Lionel Hutz that was dropped as well . 
 The episode 's first draft was 65 pages long and needed to be cut down to just 42 , so numerous scenes were cut for time or because they did not fit into the overall dynamic of the episode . To solve this problem , a scene before the second act break , where the townspeople go to the Simpsons house to provide advice of how Lisa can get the gum out of her hair , was created to include every character that did not appear anywhere else during the course of the episode . Weinstein and writing supervisor Greg Daniels was responsible for ordering and linking together the episodes , and director Jim Reardon had the challenge of segueing between each section in a way that did not make the change seem abrupt . Those that were hard to link were put before or after an act break or were given a theme song , one of which was cut from the Apu story , but was included as a deleted scene on the DVD . 
 Bill Oakley wrote the Chalmers scene because he is his all time favorite character from the show . The main reason he loved him was that , until Frank Grimes was created for the season eight episode " Homer 's Enemy " , Chalmers was the only character that " seemed to operate in the normal human universe . " In previous episodes , Skinner and Chalmers ' scenes together revolved around one joke : Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie , but Chalmers believes him anyway . So , their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies . The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before , in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all . 
 In the Mr. Burns story , every single word he yells at Smithers is real and used correctly . To maintain accuracy , the writers used a 19th @-@ century slang thesaurus to look up words . Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man 's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish ; this was done deliberately so that non @-@ Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles . The very tall man was a caricature of writer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , and the barber was based on one from the Tracey Ullman shorts . The crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of Matt Groening , Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein . Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield 's biggest idiots and so the animators drew him , Weinstein and Groening into the scene . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode contains numerous references to Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction . Like the film , the episode 's plot is episodic , though the stories are interconnected . The policemen 's conversation about McDonald 's parallels the famous " Royale With Cheese " discussion , and the music played during the segment 's beginning was also taken from the film . The story involving Chief Wiggum and Snake is a direct parody of the " Gold Watch " segment of the film . Snake runs over the donut @-@ carrying Wiggum at a red light , like Butch did to Marcellus Wallace , before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on @-@ foot chase . The two run into Herman 's Military Antique shop , where Herman beats , ties up and gags the two , then waits for " Zed " to arrive , exactly as Maynard does in Pulp Fiction . The writers were pleased that Herman already existed as otherwise they would have had to create another character just for this scene . The episode 's title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast , " 22 Short Films About Springfield " finished tied for 73rd in the weekly ratings for the week of April 8 @-@ April 14 , 1996 with a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 9 . It was the seventh highest rated show from the Fox Network that week . On March 12 , 2002 , the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival , along with the season eleven episode " Beyond Blunderdome " , the season four episode " Itchy & Scratchy : The Movie " , and the season six episode " A Star is Burns " . 
 The episode is Bill Oakley 's personal favorite episode , but it is hated by two prominent figures within the running of the show . That said , the episode is frequently cited as a popular one amongst the show 's fans on the internet . Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 14th on their top 25 The Simpsons episode list , praising the episode 's structure and finding the Pulp Fiction references " priceless " . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , called it " an untypical episode , and a very good one , " naming the Skinner and Chalmers story as the best . IGN named " A Fish Called Selma " the best episode of the seventh season , but found that " 22 Short Films About Springfield " was " good competition " for the crown . Empire named the episode 's Pulp Fiction parody the seventh best film gag in the show , calling Wiggum and Snake bound and gagged with red balls in their mouths " the sickest visual gag in Simpsons history " . The episode is the favorite of British comedian Jimmy Carr who called it " a brilliant pastiche of art cinema " . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 The episode sparked the idea amongst the staff for a spin @-@ off series entitled Springfield Stories or simply Springfield . The proposed show would focus on the town in general , rather than the Simpson family . Every week would be a different scenario : three short stories , an adventure with young Homer or a story about a background character that was not tied in to the Simpson family at all . The idea never came to anything , as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons . The staff maintains that it is something that they would still be interested in doing , and that it " could happen someday . " " 22 Short Films About Springfield " also helped inspire the Futurama episode " Three Hundred Big Boys " . 
 = Sara Northrup Hollister = 
 Sara Elizabeth Bruce Northrup Hollister ( April 8 , 1924 – December 19 , 1997 ) was an occultist who played a major role in the creation of Dianetics , which evolved into the religious movement Scientology . Sara was the second wife of science @-@ fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , who would become the leader of the Church of Scientology . 
 Sara Northrup was a major figure in the Pasadena branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis ( <unk> ) , a secret society founded by the English occultist Aleister Crowley , where she was known as " Soror [ Sister ] <unk> " . She joined as a teenager . From 1941 to 1945 she had a turbulent relationship with her sister 's husband John Whiteside Parsons , the head of the Pasadena branch . Though a committed and popular member , she acquired a reputation for <unk> that prompted Crowley to denounce her as a " vampire . " She began a relationship with L. Ron Hubbard , whom she met through the O.T.O. , in 1945 . She and Hubbard eloped , taking with them a substantial amount of Parsons ' life savings and marrying bigamously a year later while Hubbard was still married to his first wife , Margaret Grubb . 
 Sara played a significant role in the development of Dianetics , Hubbard 's " modern science of mental health " , between 1948 and 1951 . She was Hubbard 's personal auditor and along with Hubbard , one of the seven members of the Dianetics Foundation 's Board of Directors . However , their marriage was deeply troubled ; Hubbard was responsible for a prolonged campaign of domestic violence against her and kidnapped both her and her infant daughter . Hubbard spread allegations that she was a Communist secret agent and repeatedly denounced her to the FBI . The FBI declined to take any action , characterizing Hubbard as a " mental case " . The marriage broke up in 1951 and prompted lurid headlines in the Los Angeles newspapers . She subsequently married one of Hubbard 's former employees , Miles Hollister , and moved to Hawaii and later Massachusetts , where she died in 1997 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sara was one of five children born to Olga Nelson , the daughter of a Swedish immigrant to the United States . She was the granddaughter of Russian emigrant <unk> <unk> ( later Nelson ) who emigrated to Sweden . Sara 's mother first married Thomas Cowley , an Englishman working for the Standard Oil Company . The couple had three daughters . In 1923 the family moved to Pasadena , a destination said to have been chosen by Olga using a <unk> board . Although she later remembered her childhood with warmth , Sara 's upbringing was marred by her sexually abusive father , who was imprisoned in 1928 for financial fraud . She was sexually active from an unusually young age and often claimed to have lost her virginity at the age of ten . 
 = = Relationship with Jack Parsons = = 
 In 1933 , Sara 's 22 @-@ year @-@ old sister Helen met the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Jack Parsons , a chemist who went on to be a noted expert in rocket propulsion . Jack Parsons was also an avid student and practitioner of the occult . Helen and Jack were engaged in July 1934 and married in April 1935 . Parsons ' interest in the occult led in 1939 to him and Helen joining the Pasadena branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) . 
 At age 15 , Sara moved in with sister Helen and her husband Jack , while she finished high school . Parsons had subdivided the house , a rambling mansion next door to the estate of Adolphus Busch ( which later became the first Busch Gardens ) , into 19 apartments which he populated with a mixture of artists , writers , scientists and occultists . Her parents not only knew about her unconventional living arrangements but supported Parsons ' group financially . 
 Sara joined the O.T.O. in 1941 , at Parsons ' urging , and was given the title of Soror [ Sister ] <unk> . She soon rose to the rank of a second degree member , or " Magician " , of the O.T.O. 
 In June 1941 , at the age of seventeen , she began a passionate affair with Parsons while her sister Helen was away on vacation . She made a striking impression on the other lodgers ; George Pendle describes her as " feisty and untamed , proud and self @-@ willed , she stood five foot nine , had a lithe body and blond hair , and was extremely candid . " When Helen returned , she found Sara wearing Helen 's own clothes and calling herself Parsons ' " new wife . " Such conduct was expressly permitted by the <unk> , which followed Crowley 's disdain of marriage as a " detestable institution " and accepted as commonplace the swapping of wives and partners between O.T.O members . 
 Although both were committed O.T.O. members , Sara 's usurpation of Helen 's role led to conflict between the two sisters . The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Sara were markedly different . Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Sara sexually : " This is a fact that I can do nothing about . I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well . Your character is superior . You are a greater person . I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well . " Some years later , addressing himself as " You " , Parsons told himself that his affair with Sara ( whom he called Betty ) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick : " Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time , and the act of adultery tinged with incest , served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema . " 
 Helen was far less sanguine , writing in her diary of " the sore spot I carried where my heart should be " , and had furious – sometimes violent – rows with both Parsons and Sara . She began an affair with Wilfred Smith , Parsons ' mentor in the O.T.O. and had a son in 1943 who bore Parsons ' surname but who was almost certainly fathered by Smith . Sara also became pregnant but had an abortion on April 1 , 1943 , arranged by Parsons and carried out by Dr. Zachary Taylor <unk> , a prominent Pasadena doctor and Democratic politician . 
 Sara 's hostility towards other members of the O.T.O caused further tensions in the house , which Aleister Crowley heard about from communications from her housemates . He dubbed her " the alley @-@ cat " after an unnamed mutual acquaintance told him that Parsons 's attraction to her was like " a yellow pup <unk> around with his snout glued to the rump of an alley @-@ cat . " Concluding that she was a vampire , which he defined as " an elemental or demon in the form of a woman " who sought to " lure the Candidate to his destruction , " he warned that Sara was a grave danger to Parsons and to the " Great Work " which the O.T.O. was carrying out in California . 
 Similar concerns were expressed by other O.T.O. members . The O.T.O. ' s US head , Karl Germer , labeled her " an ordeal sent by the gods " . Her disruptive behavior appalled Fred Gwynn , a new O.T.O. member living in the commune at 1003 South Orange Avenue : " Betty went to almost fantastical lengths to disrupt the meetings [ of the O.T.O. ] that Jack did get together . If she could not break it up by making social engagements with key personnel she , and her gang , would go out to a bar and keep calling in asking for certain people to come to the telephone . " 
 = = Relationship with L. Ron Hubbard = = 
 In August 1945 , Sara met L. Ron Hubbard for the first time . He had visited 1003 South Orange Avenue at the behest of Lou Goldstone , a well @-@ known science fiction illustrator , while on leave from his service in the US Navy . Parsons took an immediate liking to Hubbard and invited him to stay in the house for the duration of his leave . Hubbard soon began an affair with Sara after beginning " affairs with one girl after another in the house . " He was a striking figure who habitually wore dark glasses and carried a cane with a silver handle , the need for which he attributed to his wartime service : as Sara later put it , " He was not only a writer but he was the captain of a ship that had been downed in the Pacific and he was weeks on a raft and had been blinded by the sun and his back had been broken . " She believed all of it , though none of his claims of wartime action or injuries were true . 
 Parsons was deeply dismayed but tried to put a brave face on the situation , informing Aleister Crowley : 
 About three months ago I met Captain L. Ron Hubbard , a writer and explorer of whom I had known for some time … He is a gentleman ; he has red hair , green eyes , is honest and intelligent , and we have become great friends . He moved in with me about two months ago , and although Betty and I are still friendly , she has transferred her sexual affection to Ron . 
 I think I have made a great gain and as Betty and I are the best of friends , there is little loss . I cared for her rather deeply but I have no desire to control her emotions , and I can , I hope , control my own . I need a magical partner . I have many experiments in mind . 
 Hubbard became Parsons ' " magical partner " for a sex magic ritual involving that was intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess . Although they got on well as fellow occultists , tensions between the two men were apparent in more domestic settings . Hubbard and Sara made no secret of their relationship ; another lodger at Parsons ' house described how he saw Hubbard " living off Parsons ' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him . Sometimes when the two of them were sitting at the table together , the hostility was almost tangible . " Despite the tensions between them , Hubbard , Sara and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together , buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit . They set up a business partnership on January 15 , 1946 under the name of " Allied Enterprises " , with Parsons putting up $ 20 @,@ 000 of capital , Hubbard adding $ 1 @,@ 200 and Sara contributing nothing . Hubbard and Sara left for Florida towards the end of April , taking with him $ 10 @,@ 000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership 's first yacht . Weeks passed without word from Hubbard . Louis Culling , another O.T.O. member , wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation : 
 As you may know by this time , Brother John signed a partnership agreement with this Ron and Betty whereby all money earned by the three for life is equally divided between the three . As far as I can ascertain , Brother John has put in all of his money ... Meanwhile , Ron and Betty have bought a boat for themselves in Miami for about $ 10 @,@ 000 and are living the life of Riley , while Brother John is living at Rock Bottom , and I mean Rock Bottom . It appears that originally they never secretly intended to bring this boat around to the California coast to sell at a profit , as they told Jack , but rather to have a good time on it on the east coast . 
 Germer informed Crowley , who wrote back to opine : " It seems to me on the information of our brethren in California that Parsons has got an illumination in which he has lost all his personal independence . From our brother 's account he has given away both his girl and his money . Apparently it is the ordinary confidence trick . " 
 Parsons initially attempted to obtain redress through magical means , carrying out a " <unk> Ritual of the Pentagram " to curse Hubbard and Sara . He credited it with causing the couple to abort an attempt to evade him : 
 Hubbard attempted to escape me by sailing at 5 P.M. , and I performed a full evocation to <unk> [ the spirit of Mars or War ] within the circle at 8 P.M. At the same time , so far as I can check , his ship was struck by a sudden squall off the coast , which ripped off his sails and forced him back to port , where I took the boat in custody ... Here I am in Miami pursuing the children of my folly ; they cannot move without going to jail . However I am afraid that most of the money has already been dissipated . 
 Sara later recalled that the boat had been caught in a hurricane in the Panama Canal , damaging it too badly to be able to continue the voyage to California . Parsons subsequently resorted to more conventional means of obtaining redress and sued the couple on July 1 in the Circuit Court for Dade County . His lawsuit accused Hubbard and Sara of breaking the terms of their partnership , dissipating the assets and attempting to abscond . The case was settled out of court eleven days later , with Hubbard and Sara agreeing to refund some of Parsons ' money while keeping a yacht , the Harpoon , for themselves . The boat was soon sold to ease the couple 's shortage of cash . Sara was able to dissuade Parsons from pressing his case by threatening to expose their past relationship , which had begun when she was under the legal age of consent . Hubbard 's relationship with Sara , while legal , had already caused alarm among those who knew him ; Virginia Heinlein , the wife of the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein , regarded Hubbard as " a very sad case of post @-@ war breakdown " and Sara as his " latest Man @-@ Eating Tigress " . 
 Hubbard 's financial troubles were reflected in his attempts to persuade the Veterans Administration to increase his pension award on the grounds of a variety of ailments which he said were preventing him finding a job . He persuaded Sara to pose as an old friend writing in support of his appeals ; in one letter , she claimed untruthfully to have " known Lafayette Ronald Hubbard for many years " and described his supposed pre @-@ war state of health . His health and emotional difficulties were reflected in another , much more private , document which has been dubbed " The Affirmations " . It is thought to have been written around 1946 – 7 as part of an attempted program of self @-@ hypnotism . His sexual difficulties with Sara , for which he was taking testosterone supplements , are a significant feature of the document . He wrote : 
 Sara , my sweetheart , is young , beautiful , desirable . We are very gay companions . I please her physically until she weeps about any separation . I want her always . But I am 13 years older than she . She is heavily sexed . My libido is so low I hardly admire her naked . 
 Around the same time , Hubbard proposed marriage to Sara . According to Sara 's later recollections she repeatedly refused him but relented after he threatened to kill himself . She told him : " All right , I 'll marry you , if that 's going to save you . " They were married in the middle of the night of August 10 , 1946 at Chestertown , Maryland after awakening a minister and roping in his wife and housekeeper to serve as witnesses . It was not until much later that Sara discovered that Hubbard had never been divorced from his first wife , Margaret " Polly " Grubb ; the marriage was bigamous . Ironically , the wedding took place only 30 miles from the town where Hubbard had married his first wife thirteen years previously . The wedding attracted criticism from L. Sprague de Camp , another science fiction colleague of Hubbard 's , who suggested to the <unk> that he supposed " Polly was tiresome about not giving him his divorce so he could marry six other gals who were all hot & moist over him . How many girls is a man entitled to in one lifetime , anyway ? Maybe he should be reincarnated as a rabbit . " 
 The couple moved repeatedly over the following year – first to Laguna Beach , California , then to Santa Catalina Island , California , New York City , Stroudsburg , Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard 's first wife 's home at South Colby , Washington . Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and non @-@ support , and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Sara , let alone that he had married her . The arrival of Hubbard and Sara three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard 's family , who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly . Sara had no idea of Hubbard 's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married . She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay , claiming that he was in the process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Sara was legal . The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947 , where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines . 
 The relationship was not an easy one . According to Sara , Hubbard began beating her when they were in Florida in the summer of 1946 . Her father had just died and her grief appeared to aggravate Hubbard , who was attempting to restart his pre @-@ war career of writing pulp fiction . He was struggling with constant writers ' block and leaned heavily on Sara to provide plot ideas and even to help write some of his stories . She later recalled : " I would often entertain him with plots so he could write . I loved to make plots . The Ole Doc Methuselah series was done that way . " One night while they were living beside a frozen lake in Stroudsburg , Hubbard hit her across the face with his .45 pistol . She recalled that " I got up and left the house in the night and walked on the ice of the lake because I was terrified . " Despite her shock and humiliation , she felt compelled to return to Hubbard . He was severely depressed and repeatedly threatened suicide , and Sara believed " he must be suffering or he wouldn 't act that way " . 
 After Hubbard was convicted of petty theft in San Luis Obispo in August 1948 , the couple moved again to Savannah , Georgia . Hubbard told his friend Forrest J. Ackerman that he had acquired a Dictaphone machine which Sara was " beating out her wits on " transcribing not only fiction but his book on the " cause and cure of nervous tension " . This eventually became the first draft of Hubbard 's book Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health , which marked the foundation of Dianetics and ultimately of Scientology . 
 = = The Dianetics years = = 
 The final version of Dianetics was written at Bay Head , New Jersey in a cottage which the science fiction editor John W. Campbell had found for the Hubbards . Sara , who was beginning a pregnancy , was said to have been delighted with the location . In three years of marriage to Hubbard , she had set up home in seven different states and had never stayed in one place for more than a few months . She gave birth on March 8 , 1950 to a daughter , Alexis Valerie . A month later Sara was made a director of the newly established Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth , New Jersey , an organization founded to disseminate knowledge of Dianetics . The Hubbards moved to a new house in Elizabeth to be near the Foundation . Sara became Hubbard 's personal auditor ( Dianetic counselor ) and was hailed by him as one of the first Dianetic " Clears " . 
 Dianetics became an immediate bestseller when it was published in May 1950 . Only two months later , over 55 @,@ 000 copies had been sold and 500 Dianetics groups had been set up across the United States . The Dianetics Foundation was making a huge amount of money , but problems were already evident : money was pouring out as fast as it was coming in , due to lax financial management and Hubbard 's own free spending . Sara recalled that " he used to carry huge amounts of cash around in his pocket . I remember going past a Lincoln dealer and admiring one of those big Lincolns they had then . He walked right in there and bought it for me , cash ! " 
 By October , the Foundation 's financial affairs had reached a crisis point . According to his public relations assistant , Barbara Klowden , Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to " political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power . " He began an affair with the twenty @-@ year @-@ old Klowden , much to the annoyance of Sara , who was clearly aware of the liaison . Klowden recalled that Sara " was very hostile to me . We were talking about guns and she said to me that I was the type to use a Saturday night special " ( a very cheap " junk gun " ) . One evening he arranged a double @-@ date with his wife and Klowden , who was accompanied by Miles Hollister , an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation . The dinner party backfired drastically ; Sara began an affair with Hollister , a handsome 22 @-@ year @-@ old who was college @-@ educated and a noted sportsman . 
 The marriage was in the process of breaking down rapidly . Sara and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated . On one occasion , while Sara was pregnant , Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion . She recalled that " with or without an argument , there 'd be an upsurge of violence . The veins in his forehead would engorge " and he would hit her " out of the blue " , breaking her eardrum in one attack . Despite this , she still " felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged . I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn 't even bring him peace of mind . I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor , had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar . " He told her that he didn 't want to be married " for I can buy my friends whenever I want them " but he could not divorce either , as the stigma would hurt his reputation . Instead , he said , if Sara really loved him she should kill herself . 
 Klowden recalled later that " he was very down in the dumps about his wife . He told me how he had met Sara . He said he went to a party and got drunk and when he woke up in the morning he found Sara was in bed with him . He was having a lot of problems with her . I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him . I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening , he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife . " She In November 1950 , Sara attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills . Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation , but resumed the affair with her again within a month . 
 Hubbard attempted to patch up the marriage in January 1951 by inviting Sara and baby Alexis to Palm Springs , California where he had rented a house . The situation soon became tense again ; Richard de Mille , nephew of the famous director Cecil B. de Mille , recalled that " there was a lot of turmoil and dissension in the Foundation at the time ; he kept accusing Communists of trying to take control and he was having difficulties with Sara . It was clear their marriage was breaking up – she was very critical of him and he told me she was fooling around with Hollister and he didn 't trust her . " Hubbard enlisted de Mille and another <unk> , Dave Williams , in an attempt to convince her to stay with him . John <unk> , who worked with Hubbard for many years , recalled : 
 Earlier on ( before the divorce ) he made this stupid attempt to get Sara brainwashed so she 'd do what he said . He kept her sitting up in a chair , denying her sleep , trying to use Black Dianetic principles on her , repeating over and over again whatever he wanted her to do . Things like , " Be his wife , have a family that looks good , not have a divorce . " Or whatever . He had Dick de Mille reciting this sort of thing day and night to her . 
 Sara went to a psychiatrist to obtain advice about Hubbard 's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour , and was told that he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger . She gave Hubbard an ultimatum : get treatment or she would leave with the baby . He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Sara care for her : " He didn 't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors . He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists , with the devils . " She left Palm Springs on February 3 , leaving Hubbard to complain that Sara " had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write . " 
 = = Kidnapped by Hubbard = = 
 Three weeks later , Hubbard abducted both Sara and Alexis . On the night of February 24 , 1951 , Alexis was being looked after by John <unk> while Sara had a night at the movies . Hubbard turned up and took the child . A few hours later , he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Sara , who was now back at her apartment : " We have Alexis and you 'll never see her alive unless you come with us . " She was bundled into the back of a car and driven to San Bernardino , California , where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane . His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona . He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily . Sara agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago , where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Sara 's accusations . Rather than telling Sara where Alexis was , he called her and said that " he had cut [ Alexis ] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault , I 'd done it because I 'd left him . " 
 Hubbard subsequently returned to the Foundation in Elizabeth , New Jersey . There he wrote a letter informing the FBI that Sara and her lover Miles Hollister – whom he had fired from the Foundation 's staff and , according to Hollister , had also threatened to kill – were among fifteen " known or suspected Communists " in his organization . He listed them as : 
 SARA <unk> ( HUBBARD ) : formerly of 1003 S. Orange Grove Avenue , Pasadena , Calif . 25 <unk> of age , 5 ' 10 " , 140 lbs . Currently missing somewhere in California . Suspected only . Had been friendly with many Communists . Currently intimate with them but evidently under coercion . Drug addiction set in fall 1950 . Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago . Separation papers being filed and divorce applied for . 
 <unk> <unk> : Somewhere in the vicinity of Los Angeles . Evidently a prime mover but very young . About 22 yrs , 6 ' , 180 lbs . Black hair . Sharp chin , broad forehead , rather Slavic . <unk> a member of the Young Communists . Center of most turbulence in our organization . <unk> [ sic ] in February when affiliations discovered . Active and dangerous . Commonly armed . <unk> disloyal to the U.S. 
 In another letter sent in March , Hubbard told the FBI that Sara was a Communist and a drug addict , and offered a $ 10 @,@ 000 reward to anyone who could resolve Sara 's problems through the application of Dianetics techniques . 
 Sara filed a kidnapping complaint with the Los Angeles Police Department on her return home but was rebuffed by the police , who dismissed the affair as a mere domestic dispute . After a fruitless six @-@ week search she finally filed a writ of habeas corpus at the Los Angeles Superior Court in April 1951 , demanding the return of Alexis . The dispute immediately became front @-@ page news : the newspapers ran headlines such as " Cult Founder Accused of Tot Kidnap " , " ' Dianetic ' Hubbard Accused of Plot to Kidnap Wife " , and " Hiding of Baby Charged to Dianetics Author " . Hubbard fled to Havana , Cuba , where he wrote a letter to Sara : 
 Dear Sara , 
 I have been in the Cuban military hospital and I am being transferred to the United States next week as a classified scientist immune from interference of all kinds . 
 Though I will be hospitalized probably a long time , Alexis is getting excellent care . I see her every day . She is all I have to live for . 
 My wits never gave way under all you did and let them do but my body didn 't stand up . My right side is paralyzed and getting more so . I hope my heart lasts . I may live a long time and again I may not . But Dianetics will last 10 @,@ 000 years – for the Army and Navy have it now . 
 My Will is all changed . Alexis will get a fortune unless she goes to you as she would then get nothing . Hope to see you once more . Goodbye – I love you . 
 Ron . 
 In reality , Hubbard had made an unsuccessful request for assistance from the US military attaché to Havana . The attaché did not act on the request ; having asked the FBI for background information , he was told that Hubbard had been interviewed but the " agent conducting interview considered Hubbard to be [ a ] mental case . " On April 19 , as Barbara <unk> recorded in her journal , Hubbard telephoned her from Wichita and told her " he was not legally married . His first wife had not obtained divorce until ' 47 and he was married in ' 46 . According to him , Sara had served a stretch at <unk> ( in a desert woman 's prison ) and was a dope addict . " A few days later – while still married to Sara – he proposed marriage to <unk> . 
 = = Divorced from Hubbard = = 
 Sara filed for divorce on April 23 , charging Hubbard with causing her " extreme cruelty , great mental anguish and physical suffering " . Her allegations produced more lurid headlines : not only was Hubbard accused of bigamy and kidnapping , but she had been subjected to " systematic torture , including loss of sleep , beatings , and <unk> and scientific experiments " . Because of his " crazy misconduct " she was in " hourly fear of both the life of herself and of her infant daughter , who she has not seen for two months " . She had consulted doctors who " concluded that said Hubbard was hopelessly insane , and , crazy , and that there was no hope for said Hubbard , or any reason for her to endure further ; that competent medical advisers recommended that said Hubbard be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as paranoid schizophrenia . " 
 Her lawyer , named Caryl Warner , also worked the media on her behalf so that Sara 's story received maximum publicity . He briefed the divorce court reporters for the Los Angeles Times and the Examiner , who were both women and early feminists , to ensure that " they knew what a bastard this guy Hubbard was . " He later told Hubbard 's unofficial biographer , Russell Miller : 
 I liked Sara and Miles a lot . They eventually married and got a house in Malibu and we became friends ; I remember they introduced me to pot . I believed Sara absolutely ; there was no question about the truth in my opinion . When she first came to me with this wild story about how her husband had taken her baby I was determined to help her all I could . I telephoned Hubbard 's lawyer in Elizabeth and warned him : " Listen , asshole , if you don 't get that baby back I 'm going to burn you . " 
 The divorce writ prompted a deluge of bad publicity for Hubbard and elicited an unexpected letter to Sara from his first wife , Polly , who wrote : " If I can help in any way I 'd like to — You must get Alexis in your custody — Ron is not normal . I had hoped that you could straighten him out . Your charges sound fantastic to the average person — but I 've been through it — the beatings , threats on my life , all the sadistic traits you charge — twelve years of it ... Please do believe I do so want to help you get Alexis . " 
 In May 1951 , Sara filed a further complaint against Hubbard , accusing him of having fled to Cuba to evade the divorce papers that she was seeking to serve . By that time , however , he had moved to Wichita , Kansas . Sara 's attorney filed another petition asking for Hubbard 's assets to be frozen as he had been found " hiding " in Wichita " but that he would probably leave town upon being detected " . Hubbard wrote to the FBI to further denounce Sara as a Communist secret agent . He accused Communists of destroying his business , ruining his health and withholding material of interest to the US Government . His misfortunes had been caused by " a woman known as Sara Elizabeth Northrup . . . whom I believed to be my wife , having married her and then , after some mix @-@ up about a divorce , believed to be my wife in common law . " He accused Sara of having conspired in a bid to assassinate him and described how he had found love letters to his wife from Miles Hollister , a " member of the Young Communists . " Her real motive in filing for divorce , he claimed , was to seize control of Dianetics . He urged the FBI to start a " round @-@ up " of " vermin Communists or ex @-@ Communists " , starting with Sara , and declared : 
 I believe this woman to be under heavy duress . She was born into a criminal atmosphere , her father having a criminal record . Her half @-@ sister was an inmate of an insane asylum . She was part of a free love colony in Pasadena . She had attached herself to a Jack Parsons , the rocket expert , during the war and when she left him he was a wreck . Further , through Parsons , she was strangely intimate with many scientists of Los Alamo <unk> [ Alamogordo in New Mexico was where the first atomic bomb was tested ] . I did not know or realize these things until I myself investigated the matter . She may have a record . . . Perhaps in your criminal files or on the police blotter of Pasadena you will find Sara Elizabeth Northrop , age about 26 , born April 8 , 1925 , about 5 ' 9 " , blond @-@ brown hair , slender . . . I have no revenge motive nor am I trying to angle this broader than it is . I believe she is under duress , that they have something on her and I believe that under a grilling she would talk and turn state 's evidence . 
 Fortunately for Sara – as it was the peak of the McCarthyite " Red Scare " – Hubbard 's allegations were apparently ignored by the FBI , which filed his letter but took no further action . In June 1951 , she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce " guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard " . She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation . He told her that she was " in a state of complete madness " due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his " communist cell " . Playing along , she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce . He replied , " You know , I 'm a public figure and you 're nobody , so if you have to go through the divorce , I 'll accuse you of desertion so it won 't look so bad on my public record . " She agreed to sign a statement , written by Hubbard himself , that retracted the allegations that she had made against him : 
 I , Sara Northrup Hubbard , do hereby state that the things I have said about L. Ron Hubbard in courts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or entirely false . 
 I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard is a fine and brilliant man . 
 I make this statement of my own free will for I have begun to realize that what I have done may have injured the science of Dianetics , which in my studied opinion may be the only hope of sanity in future generations . 
 I was under enormous stress and my advisers insisted it was necessary for me to carry through an action as I have done . 
 There is no other reason for this statement than my own wish to make atonement for the damage I may have done . In the future I wish to lead a quiet and orderly existence with my little girl far away from the <unk> influences which have ruined my marriage . 
 Sara Northrup Hubbard . 
 Interviewed more than 35 years later , Sara stated that she had signed the statement because " I thought by doing so he would leave me and Alexis alone . It was horrible . I just wanted to be free of him ! " 
 On June 12 , Hubbard was awarded a divorce in the County Court of Sedgwick County , Kansas on the basis of Sara 's " gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty " , which had caused him " nervous breakdown and impairment to health . " She did not give evidence but was awarded custody of Alexis and $ 200 a month in child support . She left Wichita as soon as Alexis was returned to her . Her reunion with her daughter was uncertain to the last , as Hubbard had second thoughts about letting her go as he drove Sara and Alexis to the local airport . She persuaded him that the compulsion instilled by the communists would be dissipated by going ahead with the flight : " Well , I have to follow their dictates . I 'll just go to the airplane . " She was so desperate to leave by the time she got to the airport that she left behind her daughter 's clothes and her own suitcase and one of Alexis 's shoes fell off as she dashed to the plane . " I just ran across the airfield , across the runways , to the airport and got on the plane . And it was the nineteenth of June and it was the happiest day of my life . " 
 = = Life after Hubbard = = 
 After divorcing Hubbard , Sara married Miles Hollister and bought a house in Malibu , California . Hubbard continued to develop Dianetics ( and ultimately Scientology ) , through which he met his third and last wife , Mary Sue , in late 1951 – only a few months after his divorce . The controversy surrounding the divorce had severely dented his reputation . He sought to explain it to his followers as being the result of his victimization by his ex @-@ wife . Speaking to <unk> following the divorce , Hubbard blamed shadowy outside forces for the bad publicity : " We have just been through the saw mill , through the public presses . Every effort was made to butcher my personal reputation . A young girl is nearly dead because of this effort . My wife Sara . " Around the summer of 1951 , he explained his flight to Cuba as being a bid to escape Sara 's depredations : " He talked a lot about Sara . When she ran off with another man Ron followed them and they locked him in a hotel room and pushed drugs up his nose , but he managed to escape and went to Cuba . " He publicly portrayed his marital problems as being entirely the fault of Sara and her lover Miles : 
 The money and glory inherent in Dianetics was entirely too much for those with whom I had the bad misfortune to associate myself ... including a woman who had represented herself as my wife and who had been cured of severe psychosis by Dianetics , but who , because of structural brain damage would evidently never be entirely sane . ... Fur coats , Lincoln cars and a young man without any concept of honor so far turned the head of the woman who had been associated with me that on discovery of her affairs , she and these others , hungry for money and power , sought to take over and control all of Dianetics . 
 Many years later , another of his followers , Virginia Downsborough , recalled that during the mid @-@ 1960s he " talked a lot about Sara Northrup and seemed to want to make sure that I knew he had never married her . I didn 't know why it was so important to him ; I 'd never met Sara and I couldn 't have cared less , but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place . When he talked about his first wife , the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them . " As Downsborough put it , he portrayed himself as " a constant victim of women " . 
 The writer Christopher Evans has noted that " So painful do the memories of these incidents appear to be that L. Ron has more than once denied that he was ever married to Sarah [ sic ] Northrup at all . " He notes as an example of " this apparent erasure of Sarah Northrup from his mind " a 1968 interview with the British broadcaster Granada Television , in which Hubbard denied that he had had a second wife in between his first , Polly , and the present one , Mary Sue : 
 HUBBARD : " How many times have I been married ? I 've been married twice . And I 'm very happily married just now . I have a lovely wife , and I have four children . My first wife is dead . " 
 <unk> : " What happened to your second wife ? " 
 HUBBARD : " I never had a second wife . " 
 Granada 's reporter commented : " What Hubbard said happens to be untrue . It 's an unimportant detail but he 's had three wives ... What is important is that his followers were there as he lied , but no matter what the evidence they don 't believe it . " Hubbard also gave a new explanation of why he had been involved with Jack Parsons and the O.T.O. After the British Sunday Times newspaper published an exposé of Hubbard 's membership of the O.T.O. in October 1969 , the newspaper printed a statement attributed to the Church of Scientology ( but written by Hubbard himself ) that asserted : 
 Hubbard broke up black magic in America ... L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the US Navy because he was well known as a writer and a philosopher and had friends amongst the physicists , he was sent in to handle the situation . He went to live at the house and investigated the black magic rites and the general situation and found them very bad . Hubbard ’ s mission was successful far beyond anyone ’ s expectations . The house was torn down . Hubbard rescued a girl they were using . The black magic group was dispersed and destroyed and has never recovered . 
 Only a couple of months later , he highlighted Sara to his staff as a participant in a " full complete covert operation " mounted against Dianetics and Scientology by a " Totalitarian Communistic " enemy . In a memo of December 2 , 1969 , he wrote that the operation had started with bad reviews of Dianetics , " pushed then by the Sara <unk> [ sic ] ( alias Northrup ) " divorce " actions ... At the back of it was Miles Hollister ( psychology student ) Sara <unk> [ sic ] ( housekeeper at the place nuclear physicists stayed near Caltech ) ... " 
 By 1970 , Sara and Hollister had moved to Maui , Hawaii . Sara 's daughter Alexis , who was by now twenty @-@ one years old , attempted to contact her father but was rebuffed in a handwritten statement in which Hubbard denied that he was her father : " Your mother was with me as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948 . . . In July 1949 I was in Elizabeth , New Jersey , writing a movie . She turned up destitute and pregnant . " He claimed that Sara had been a Nazi spy during the war and accused her and Hollister of using the divorce case to seize control of Dianetics : " They obtained considerable newspaper publicity , none of it true , and employed the highest priced divorce attorney in the US to sue me for divorce and get the foundation in Los Angeles in settlement . This proved a puzzle since where there is no legal marriage , there can 't be any divorce . " Despite clearly being written by Hubbard , who spoke in the first person in the letter , it was signed " Your good friend , J. Edgar Hoover " . Even his own staff were shocked by the contents of Hubbard 's letter ; he ended his instructions to them with the statement , " Decency is not a subject well understood " . 
 Neither Sara nor Alexis made any further attempt to contact Hubbard , who disinherited Alexis in his will , written in January 1986 on the day before he died . In June 1986 the Church of Scientology and Alexis agreed a financial settlement under which she was compelled not to write or speak on the subject of L. Ron Hubbard and her relationship to him . An attempt was made to have her sign an affidavit stating that she was in fact the daughter of L. Ron Hubbard 's first son , her half @-@ brother L. Ron Hubbard , Jr . 
 As the United Press International news agency noted , Church of Scientology biographies of Hubbard 's life do not mention either of his first two wives . In one publication the Church has airbrushed Sara out of a photograph of the couple that appeared in the Miami Daily News issue of June 30 , 1946 . The news story which the photograph accompanied has been republished by the Church with all mention of Sara edited out from the text . 
 The church continues to promulgate Hubbard 's claims about their relationship . The writer Lawrence Wright was told in September 2010 by Tommy Davis , the then spokesman for the Church of Scientology , that Hubbard " was never married to Sara Northrup . She filed for divorce in an effort to try and create a false record that she had been married to him . " She had been part of Jack Parson 's group because " she had been sent in there by the Russians . I can never pronounce her name . Her actual true name is a Russian name . That was one of the reasons L. Ron Hubbard never had a relationship with her . He never had a child with her . He wasn 't married to her . But he did save her life and pull her out of that whole black magic ring . " After the documentary @-@ maker Alex Gibney directed the film Going Clear , based on Wright 's book of the same name and citing Sara 's words about Hubbard , the Church published a video calling Sara a " failed gold digger " and " self admitted perjurer " who was responsible for " a get @-@ rich @-@ quick scheme [ concocted ] by the woman and her publicity starved lawyer to try to shake down Mr. Hubbard for money and take over the Hubbard Dianetics Foundation after Dianetics soared to the top of national bestseller lists . " 
 Although Sara did not speak out publicly against her ex @-@ husband following their divorce , she broke her silence in 1972 . She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper , the author of the book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church 's Operation Freakout . Sara told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic , and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him , she was still afraid both of him and of his followers , whom she later described as looking " like Mormons , but with bad complexions . " In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex @-@ Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard 's death , which had reduced her fear of retaliation . Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon 's 1987 book , L. Ron Hubbard : Messiah or Madman ? . She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape @-@ recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard . It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta . Rejecting any suggestion that she was some kind of " pathetic person who has suffered through the years because of my time with Ron " , Sara spoke of her relief that she had been able to put it behind her . She stated that she was " not interested in revenge ; I 'm interested in the truth " 
 = Whacking Day = 
 " Whacking Day " is the twentieth episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29 , 1993 . The episode revolves around the fictional holiday " Whacking Day " , celebrated annually , in which the citizens of Springfield drive snakes into the town square , then club them to death . The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jeffrey Lynch ; Barry White , who had expressed a wish to appear in the show , guest stars as himself . It was pitched by George Meyer , who wanted to create an episode against the mistreatment of snakes ( the episode ended up winning a Genesis Award ) . The episode includes the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers , and it features an Itchy & Scratchy parody of Oliver Stone 's film JFK . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During an inspection by Superintendent Chalmers , Principal Skinner lures Bart , Jimbo , Kearney , Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement with the promise of free mountain bikes and locks the door . Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie 's tractor for a joyride , crashing into Chalmers . Rather than giving him detention , Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart is quickly expelled from a new private Christian school , Marge decides to homeschool Bart. 
 Meanwhile , Kent Brockman announces that Springfield 's annual " Whacking Day " is approaching . Each year on May 10 , the people of Springfield drive snakes to the center of town and beat them to death . The tradition appalls Lisa , who finds no support from any of the adults of the town , including Reverend Lovejoy who lies about Whacking Day being supported by the Bible . Barry White arrives to begin the festivities , but is disgusted and quickly leaves when he discovers what the holiday is about . 
 After Marge takes Bart on a <unk> to Fort Springfield , Bart discovers that the origins of Whacking Day , which supposedly involved Jebediah Springfield , is a lie because it conflicts with a major Revolutionary War battle he took part in , and suggests to Lisa that they lure the snakes to safety by playing music with a lot of bass and putting the stereo speakers to the ground . White , who just happens to have been walking by , agrees to help by singing " Can 't Get Enough of Your Love , Babe " , attracting hundreds of snakes into the house . 
 The pursuing crowd arrives , but they are soon turned around on the subject of Whacking Day by Bart 's newfound knowledge . It turns out that the day was actually invented in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish . Skinner is impressed with Bart 's efforts and welcomes him back to the school , but then realizes in horror that the bullies are still in the utility basement . While the bullies are spending the time talking about their feelings , Skinner and Willie race to the school with the mountain bikes to avoid a potential lawsuit .

 Writer George Meyer , who was very " animal conscious " , was interested in writing an episode related to an annual ritual held in a Texan town , where the townspeople would beat rattlesnakes with sticks . Meyer did not have time to pen the episode himself , so the idea was given to John Swartzwelder . The subject matter of " beating snakes " worried the staff who thought that many would deem it cruel , even though the episode 's message is against the mistreatment of snakes . The episode 's first act was one of the shortest the staff had ever written at that time , roughly ten pages in length , but with no ideas to expand , they left it as it was . Due to this , the main plot does not start until the beginning of the second act , as the writers could not come up with much material for it . 
 In order to speed up animation , director Jeffrey Lynch " begged " storyboard artists Kevin O 'Brien and Steve Markowski to help him with the episode . The three spent months on the episode . Barry White wanted to guest star on the show , so he was written into the plot . He sang " Can 't Get Enough of Your Love , Babe " specially for the episode , rather than using a recorded version . 
 The song Grampa was supposed to sing in his flashback , showing how he posed as a German cabaret singer in World War II , was " Lili Marlene " by Marlene Dietrich . The staff could not get the rights to it because , according to the people who own the song , " everybody makes fun of it " . Much of the flashback was pitched by Conan O 'Brien . The episode marks the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers . The staff wanted to introduce a boss for Skinner , and Wallace Wolodarsky pitched his name . Much of the dialogue and interactions between Skinner and Chalmers were ad @-@ libbed by Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria .

 The untitled Itchy & Scratchy short , with " guest director " Oliver Stone , is a parody of the scene where Jack Ruby shoots Lee Harvey Oswald in Stone 's film JFK : someone is heard to shout , " Oh God ! Get his gun ! " as the screenplay draws to a close . The song " O Whacking Day " uses the same tune as the Christmas carol " O Tannenbaum " , known in English as " O Christmas Tree " . Additionally , Bob Woodward is shown to be the author of the book The Truth About Whacking Day . In one scene , Marge encourages Bart to read Johnny Tremain , a novel which won the Newbery Medal in 1943 .

 In its original American broadcast , " Whacking Day " finished tied for 25th in the weekly ratings for the week of April 26 – May 2 , 1993 with a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 2 . It was the highest rated show from the Fox Network that week . For " consciousness @-@ raising on behalf of animal issues " , the episode was awarded the Genesis Award for " Best Television Prime Time Animated Series " in 1994 . Jeffrey Lee Puckett of The Courier @-@ Journal cited " Whacking Day " as " the series ' richest episode " . He wrote : " In 22 remarkable minutes , ' Whacking Day ' skewers the quality of America 's educational system , self @-@ aggrandizing politicians , greed , the mob mentality , sexuality in the age of political correctness and the whole notion of political correctness , and makes a hero of Barry White . " Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News noted the episode was one of the fourth season 's best episodes in his review of the DVD . The show 's creator Matt Groening considers Homer 's " I am evil Homer " fantasy to be one of the greatest moments in the show 's history . Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Barry White his fifth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten . 
 A 2003 article in the The Journal News reported that records show genuine " Whacking Days " having taken place in Eastchester , New York from 1665 onwards : " That one day every spring be chosen for the destroying of rattle snakes . " The article quoted show runner Al Jean as saying : " I agree with the premise of the episode : leave the snakes alone . They didn 't hurt anybody . " In North Queensland , Australia since 2009 , citizens have held an annual " Toad Day Out " , where thousands of cane toads ( which , unlike rattlesnakes , are an invasive and highly @-@ destructive species not native to Australia ) are collected up and humanely destroyed . The event was inspired by the episode . 
 = Take Ichi convoy = 
 The Take @-@ Ichi <unk> ( <unk> , " Bamboo No . One " convoy ) was a Japanese convoy of World War II . The convoy left Shanghai on 17 April 1944 , carrying two infantry divisions to reinforce Japan 's defensive positions in the Philippines and western New Guinea . United States Navy ( USN ) submarines attacked the convoy on 26 April and 6 May , sinking four transports and killing more than 4 @,@ 000 soldiers . These losses caused the convoy to be diverted to Halmahera , where the surviving soldiers and their equipment were unloaded . 
 The Take Ichi convoy 's losses had important strategic results . The failure to bring the two divisions to their destination without loss contributed to the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ' decision to move Japan 's defensive perimeter back by 600 mi ( 970 km ) . The divisions ' combat power was also blunted by their losses , and while they both saw action against United States Army forces , they contributed little to Japan 's attempt to defend its empire .

 In September 1943 , the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) agreed to establish defensive positions along what was termed Japan 's " absolute zone of national defense " . The zone 's perimeter reached from the Marianas Islands and Caroline Islands to western New Guinea and the Banda and Flores Seas . At this time there were few Army units in the area , and it was decided to move combat units from China and Manchuria to protect the air bases which formed the basis of Japan 's defensive plans . The movement of these troops was delayed by shipping shortages , however . Efforts to reinforce the Marianas and Caroline islands were assigned the highest priority , and the units selected for western New Guinea remained in China until April 1944 , when ships became available to transport them . 
 By early 1944 , Allied submarines were sinking large numbers of Japanese ships . Their activities were frequently guided by ' Ultra ' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions . The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection , and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines in the vicinity of convoys . The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable . 
 The IJN 's faulty anti @-@ submarine doctrine also contributed to Japan 's shipping losses . The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and during the early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943 . The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine . The Escort @-@ of @-@ Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys , though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti @-@ submarine warfare . 
 Attacks on merchant shipping during February 1944 led the Japanese to change the composition of their convoys . During this month , over ten percent of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by submarines and air attack . These losses included several transport ships carrying reinforcements to the Marianas and Carolines . In response , the Grand Escort Fleet Headquarters increased the average size of Japanese convoys from five ships to " large " convoys of 10 @-@ 20 vessels . This change allowed the IJN to allocate more escort ships to each convoy and it was hoped that conducting fewer convoys would also reduce the number of targets available to submarines . While Japanese officers attributed a drop in sinkings during March to the changed tactics , this was actually due to the U.S. Pacific Fleet 's submarines being diverted to support raids conducted by the Fast Carrier Task Force that month . 
 The Take Ichi convoy was assembled at Shanghai in April 1944 . Its task was to carry the 32nd Division to Mindanao and the main body of the 35th Division to western New Guinea . Both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in China during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . One of the 35th Division 's three infantry regiments was detached from the division in early April and sent to the Palau islands , arriving there later that month without loss . 
 The two divisions embarked on large transport ships protected by an unusually strong escort force . Rear Admiral <unk> Kajioka — who was a veteran of several previous operations , including the Battle of Wake Island — was appointed to command the convoy . The escort force was the newly established 6th Escort Convoy Command and included Kajioka 's flagship , the coal burning minelayer Shirataka , as well as destroyers <unk> , Shiratsuyu and Fujinami , frigate Kurahashi , ocean escort ships ( ' <unk> ' ) CD @-@ 20 and CD @-@ 22 , minesweeper W @-@ 2 , subchasers CH @-@ 37 and CH @-@ 38 and gunboats Uji , <unk> and Tama Maru No. 7 .

 = = = Shanghai to Manila = = = 
 The Take Ichi convoy sailed from Shanghai bound for Manila on 17 April , and initially comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command . Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels . Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals relating to the convoy 's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed radio traffic analysts to follow its progress south . 
 Intelligence from the intercepted radio signals was used to guide the submarine USS Jack toward the convoy , and she made contact with it off the northwest coast of Luzon on the morning of 26 April . The submarine 's captain — Commander Tommy Dykers — attempted to maneuver into a position to attack the convoy but lost contact when he was forced to evade a Japanese submarine . An aircraft sighted and attacked Jack a few minutes later , but the convoy did not change course . Dykers regained contact at midday after sighting Shirataka 's heavy smoke exhaust and surfaced an hour before sunset to get into an attack position . He was forced to submerge , however , when another aircraft attacked the submarine . 
 Jack surfaced again after dark , and successfully attacked after the moon set . Dykers found that the Japanese escorts were alert , and was unable to penetrate the convoy . As a result , he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 torpedoes from long range into the mass of ships at the center of the convoy . These attacks sank the 5 @,@ 425 @-@ ton freighter Yoshida Maru , which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division . All 3 @,@ 000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly . The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila , arriving there on 29 April . 
 = = = Manila to Halmahera = = = 
 The 32nd Division 's destination changed during the voyage from Shanghai to Manila . Imperial General Headquarters was concerned that the increasing difficulty of shipping units towards the front line meant that it would not be possible to complete the planned reinforcement of the " absolute zone of national defense " before Allied forces reached the area . As a result , it was decided to use the division to reinforce the Second Army in western New Guinea and the eastern Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) — which were under direct threat of attack — rather than send it to Mindanao . 
 The Take Ichi convoy resumed its journey to New Guinea on 1 May . Its composition was now eight transports ( one of the Manila @-@ bound transports having replaced Yoshida Maru ) under the protection of Shirataka , <unk> , Shiratsuyu , minesweeper W @-@ 22 , CH @-@ 37 and CH @-@ 38 . The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet to reduce the risk of submarine attack . 
 U.S. signals intelligence operators again detected the convoy 's departure . On 2 May , analysts estimated its size as nine transports and seven escorts carrying 12 @,@ 784 troops of the 32nd Division and an unknown number of men from the 35th Division . Decoded Japanese Army Water Transport Code messages also provided the Allies with the convoy 's route , speed , daily noon positions and destination . This " extraordinary intelligence coup " was passed to the relevant commands on 2 May and the USN positioned submarines to ambush the Japanese ships . 
 The Take Ichi convoy suffered a devastating submarine attack on 6 May . On that day , USS Gurnard intercepted the Japanese ships in the Celebes Sea near the northeastern tip of Celebes . Gurnard 's captain — Commander Herb Andrews — submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft . He reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports . Only one of these torpedoes struck its mark , and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport . Andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from Gurnard 's stern torpedo tubes which hit a third transport . One of the Japanese destroyers counterattacked Gurnard and forced Andrews to break off his attack . The destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function , however , and did not damage the submarine , despite dropping approximately 100 depth charges . 
 Gurnard rose to periscope depth two hours later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and equipment from the torpedoed transports was under way . That night , the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat . Gurnard 's attack sank transports Aden Maru ( 5 @,@ 825 tons ) and <unk> Maru ( 6 @,@ 995 tons ) as well as the cargo ship <unk> <unk> ( 6 @,@ 886 tons ) . While the rescue effort was relatively successful , 1 @,@ 290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost . 
 Due to its heavy losses , the Take Ichi convoy was ordered to dock at Halmahera in the eastern NEI rather than continue to New Guinea . The surviving ships arrived there on 9 May . Both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and the convoy sailed for Manila on 13 May , arriving on 20 May without further loss . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The attacks on the Take Ichi convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions ' fighting power . The 32nd Division 's combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry battalions and from four to one and a half artillery battalions . Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division 's artillery was lost . 
 The destruction of the Take Ichi convoy also forced the Japanese leadership to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to reinforce or defend most of western New Guinea . While the Second Area Army 's commander Lieutenant General Korechika Anami requested that the surviving ships attempt to carry the 35th Division to New Guinea , this was rejected by Imperial General Headquarters . The losses inflicted on the convoy also contributed to the Imperial General Headquarters ' decision to move the perimeter of the " absolute zone of national defense " back to a line extending from <unk> to Halmahera . This represented a 600 mi ( 970 km ) strategic withdrawal from the perimeter which had been planned in March . 
 Japanese naval staff officers gathered in Manila in June to analyze the Take Ichi convoy . The officers believed that Japan 's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for the convoy 's detection . These explanations included the increase in radio signals at the time the convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts , a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy 's composition and departure . The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy 's detection , and the Japanese military 's codes were not changed . 
 Some of the surviving elements of the 32nd and 35th divisions later saw action against American forces . The 35th Division was moved forward from Halmahera to <unk> in small ships during May . The regiment which had been sent to the Palaus in April was also successfully transferred to New Guinea . Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the Battles of Biak and Sansapor , but most of the division was stationed on the Vogelkop Peninsula where it was isolated from September 1944 . The 32nd Division was retained at Halmahera to garrison the island . Much of the division later saw action on the neighboring island of Morotai , where it suffered heavy losses while trying to counterattack an Allied force which had established a base there during September and October 1944 .

 Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction adventure comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale . It stars Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly , who is sent back in time to 1955 , where he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother 's romantic interest . Christopher Lloyd portrays the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett " Doc " Brown , Marty 's friend who helps him repair the damage to history by advising Marty how to cause his parents to fall in love . Marty and Doc must also find a way to return Marty to 1985 . 
 Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale mused upon whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together . Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis ' Romancing the Stone . Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg , who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment , with Universal Pictures as distributor . The first choice for the role of Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox . However , he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show 's producers would not allow him to star in the film . Consequently , Eric Stoltz was cast in the role . During filming , Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast , and Fox was again approached for the part . Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show 's producers , Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both . 
 Back to the Future was released on July 3 , 1985 , grossing over $ 389 million worldwide , becoming the highest @-@ grossing film of 1985 . It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film , and the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing , as well as receiving three additional Academy Award nominations , five BAFTA nominations , and four Golden Globe nominations , including Best Motion Picture ( Musical or Comedy ) . Ronald Reagan even quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address . In 2007 , the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry , and in June 2008 the American Film Institute 's special AFI 's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th @-@ best film in the science fiction genre . The film marked the beginning of a franchise , with two sequels , Back to the Future Part II ( 1989 ) and Back to the Future Part III ( 1990 ) , as well as an animated series , theme park ride , several video games and a forthcoming musical . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Teenager Marty McFly is an aspiring musician dating girlfriend Jennifer Parker in Hill Valley , California . His father George is bullied by his supervisor , Biff Tannen , while his mother Lorraine is an overweight , depressed alcoholic . While dissatisfied with Marty 's relationship with Jennifer , Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with a car . 
 On October 26 , 1985 , Marty meets his scientist friend , Dr. Emmett Brown , at a shopping mall parking lot . Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists . Doc demonstrates the navigation system with the example date of November 5 , 1955 : the day he conceived the machine . A moment later , the Libyans arrive and kill him . Marty escapes in the DeLorean , but inadvertently activates the time machine , and arrives in 1955 without the required plutonium needed to return . 
 There , Marty encounters the teenage George , who is bullied by classmate Biff . After Marty saves George from an oncoming car and is knocked unconscious , he awakens to find himself tended by an infatuated Lorraine . Marty leaves and tracks down Doc 's younger self to help him return to 1985 . With no plutonium , Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1 @.@ 21 gigawatts of electricity to power the time machine is a bolt of lightning . Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town 's courthouse the coming Saturday night . Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone , as he could inadvertently change the course of history and alter the future ; because of this , Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985 . Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he doesn 't find a way to introduce George to Lorraine . Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents , but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process . 
 When Lorraine asks Marty to the upcoming school dance , Marty plans to have George " rescue " Lorraine from Marty 's inappropriate advances . The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine . George arrives to rescue her from Marty , but finds Biff instead . George knocks out Biff and Lorraine follows George to the dance floor , where they kiss and fall in love while Marty plays music with the band . Satisfied that he has secured his future existence , Marty leaves to meet Doc . 
 As the storm arrives , Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes on cue , sending Marty back to October 1985 . He finds that Doc is not dead , as he had listened to Marty 's warnings and worn a bullet @-@ proof vest . Doc takes Marty home and departs to 2015 . 
 Marty awakens the next morning to find his family changed : George is a self @-@ confident , successful author , Lorraine is physically fit and happy , David is a successful businessman , Linda works in a boutique and has many " boyfriends " and Biff is now an obsequious auto valet . As Marty reunites with Jennifer , the DeLorean appears with Doc , dressed in a futuristic outfit , insisting they accompany him to 2015 to fix a problem with their future children . The trio get inside the DeLorean and disappear into the future .

 Writer and producer Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited his parents in St. Louis , Missouri after the release of Used Cars . Searching their basement , Gale found his father 's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class . Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class , who was someone he had nothing to do with . Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together . When he returned to California , he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept . Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when , in fact , she was highly promiscuous . The two took the project to Columbia Pictures , and made a development deal for a script in September 1980 . 
 Zemeckis and Gale said that they had set the story in 1955 because a 17 @-@ year @-@ old traveling to meet his parents at the same age <unk> required the script to travel to that decade . The era also marked the rise of teenagers as an important cultural element , the birth of rock n ' roll , and suburb expansion , which would flavor the story . In an early script , the time machine was designed as a refrigerator , and its user needed to use the power of an atomic explosion at the Nevada Test Site to return home . Zemeckis was " concerned that kids would accidentally lock themselves in refrigerators " , and found that it would be more convenient if the time machine were mobile . The DeLorean DMC @-@ 12 was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable . Zemeckis and Gale found it difficult to create a believable friendship between Marty and Brown before they created the giant guitar amplifier , and only resolved his Oedipal relationship with his mother when they wrote the line " It 's like I 'm kissing my brother . " Biff Tannen was named after studio executive Ned Tanen , who behaved aggressively toward Zemeckis and Gale during a script meeting for I Wanna Hold Your Hand . 
 The first draft of Back to the Future was finished in February 1981 and presented to Columbia , who put the film in turnaround . " They thought it was a really nice , cute , warm film , but not sexual enough , " Gale said . " They suggested that we take it to Disney , but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us . " Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years , while Back to the Future went through two more drafts . During the early 1980s , popular teen comedies ( such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky 's ) were risqué and adult @-@ aimed , so the script was commonly rejected for being too light . Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney . " They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner , " Gale said . 
 The two were tempted to ally themselves with Steven Spielberg , who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand , which were both box office bombs . Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg , who had " loved " it . Spielberg , however , was absent from the project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him , he would never be able to make another film . Gale said " we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were two guys who could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg . " Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead , which was a box office success . Now a high @-@ profile director , Zemeckis <unk> Spielberg with the concept . Agreeing to produce Back to the Future , Spielberg set the project up at his production company , Amblin Entertainment , with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film . 
 The script remained under Columbia 's shelf until legal issues forced them to withdraw . The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send @-@ up of Double Indemnity entitled Big Trouble . Columbia 's legal department determined that the film 's plot was too similar to Double Indemnity and they needed the permission of Universal Pictures , owners of the earlier film , if the film was ever to begin shooting . With Big Trouble already set to go , desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal 's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork . Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script for Back to the Future during his tenure there . As a result , Universal agreed to trade the Double Indemnity license in exchange for the rights to Back to the Future . Thus , the film finally had a home at Universal . 
 Executive Sidney Sheinberg made some suggestions to the script , changing Marty 's mother 's name from Meg to Lorraine ( the name of his wife , actress Lorraine Gary ) , to change Brown 's name from Professor Brown to Doc Brown and replace his pet chimpanzee with a dog . Sheinberg also wanted the title changed to Spaceman from Pluto , convinced no successful film ever had " future " in the title . He suggested Marty introduce himself as " Darth Vader from the planet Pluto " while dressed as an alien forcing his dad to ask out his mom ( rather than " the planet Vulcan " ) , and that the farmer 's son 's comic book be titled Spaceman from Pluto rather than Space Zombies from Pluto . Appalled by the new title that Sheinberg wanted to impose , Zemeckis asked Spielberg for help . Spielberg subsequently dictated a memo back to Sheinberg , wherein Spielberg convinced him they thought his title was just a joke , thus embarrassing him into dropping the idea . In addition , the original climax was deemed too expensive by Universal executives and was simplified by keeping the plot within Hill Valley and incorporating the clocktower sequence . Spielberg later used the omitted refrigerator and Nevada nuclear site elements in his film , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly , but he was committed to the show Family Ties . Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show 's success . With co @-@ star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave , he refused to allow Fox time off to work on a film . Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film . Zemeckis ' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz . Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask ( which had yet to be released ) that they selected him to play Marty McFly . Because of the difficult casting process , the start date was pushed back twice . 
 Four weeks into filming , Zemeckis determined Stoltz had been miscast . Although he and Spielberg realized re @-@ shooting the film would add $ 3 million to the $ 14 million budget , they decided to recast . Spielberg explained Zemeckis felt Stoltz was not comedic enough and gave a " terrifically dramatic performance " . Gale further explained they felt Stoltz was simply acting out the role , whereas Fox himself had a personality like Marty McFly . He felt Stoltz was uncomfortable riding a skateboard , whereas Fox was not . Stoltz confessed to director Peter Bogdanovich during a phone call , two weeks into the shoot , that he was unsure of Zemeckis and Gale 's direction , and concurred that he was wrong for the role . 
 Fox 's schedule was opened up in January 1985 when Baxter returned to Family Ties following her pregnancy . The Back to the Future crew met with Goldberg again , who made a deal that Fox 's main priority would be Family Ties , and if a scheduling conflict arose , " we win " . Fox loved the script and was impressed by Zemeckis and Gale 's sensitivity in releasing Stoltz , because they nevertheless " spoke very highly of him " . Per <unk> and Bob <unk> assisted on the skateboarding scenes . Fox found his portrayal of Marty McFly to be very personal . " All I did in high school was skateboard , chase girls and play in bands . I even dreamed of becoming a rock star . " 
 Christopher Lloyd was cast as Doc Brown after the first choice , John Lithgow , became unavailable . Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai ( 1984 ) , producer Neil Canton suggested him for the part . Lloyd originally turned down the role , but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife . He improvised some of his scenes , taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski . Brown pronounces gigawatts as " <unk> " , which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script , rather than with an initial hard " g " , although both pronunciations are acceptable . Doc Brown 's notable hunch came about because at 6 ' 1 " Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 5 ' 5 " , and they needed to look closer in height . 
 Crispin Glover played George McFly . Zemeckis said Glover improvised much of George 's nerdy mannerisms , such as his shaky hands . The director joked he was " endlessly throwing a net over Crispin because he was completely off about fifty percent of the time in his interpretation of the character " . Due to a contract disagreement , Glover was replaced by Jeffrey Weissman in Part II and Part III . 
 Lea Thompson was cast as Lorraine McFly because she had acted opposite Stoltz in The Wild Life ; the producers noticed her as they had watched the film while casting Stoltz . Her prosthetic makeup for scenes at the beginning of the film , set in 1985 , took three and a half hours to apply . 
 Thomas F. Wilson was cast as Biff Tannen because the producers felt that the original choice , J. J. Cohen , wasn 't physically imposing enough to bully Stoltz . Cohen was recast as Skinhead , one of Biff 's cohorts . Had Fox been cast from the beginning , Cohen probably would have won the part because he was sufficiently taller than Fox . 
 Melora Hardin was originally cast in the role of Marty 's girlfriend Jennifer , but was let go after Stoltz was dismissed , with the explanation that the actress was now too tall to be playing against Fox . Hardin was dismissed before she had a chance to shoot a single scene and was replaced with Claudia Wells . Actress Jill <unk> had also been considered to play Marty 's girlfriend . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Following Stoltz 's departure , Fox 's schedule during weekdays consisted of filming Family Ties during the day , and Back to the Future from 6 : 30 pm to 2 : 30 am . He averaged five hours of sleep each night . During Fridays , he shot from 10 pm to 6 or 7 am , and then moved on to film exterior scenes throughout the weekend , as only then was he available during daytime hours . Fox found it exhausting , but " it was my dream to be in the film and television business , although I didn 't know I 'd be in them simultaneously . It was just this weird ride and I got on . " Zemeckis concurred , dubbing Back to the Future " the film that would not wrap " . He recalled that because they shot night after night , he was always " half asleep " and the " fattest , most out @-@ of @-@ shape and sick I ever was " . 
 The Hill Valley town square scenes were shot at Courthouse Square , located in the Universal Studios backlot ( 34 @.@ <unk> ° N 118 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 34 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) . Gale explained it would have been impossible to shoot on location " because no city is going to let a film crew remodel their town to look like it 's in the 1950s . " The filmmakers " decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first , and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful . Then we would just totally trash it down and make it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes . " The interiors for Doc Brown 's house were shot at the Robert R. Blacker House , while exteriors took place at Gamble House . The exterior shots of the Twin Pines Mall , and later the Lone Pine Mall ( from 1985 ) were shot at the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry , California . The exterior shots and some interior scenes at Hill Valley High School were filmed at Whittier High School in Whittier , California . The Battle of the Bands tryout scene was filmed at the McCambridge Park Recreation Center in Burbank , and the " Enchantment Under the Sea " dance was filmed in the gymnasium at Hollywood United Methodist Church . The scenes outside of the Baines ' house in 1955 were shot at Bushnell Avenue , South Pasadena , California . 
 Filming wrapped after 100 days on April 20 , 1985 , and the film was delayed from May to August . But after a highly positive test screening ( " I 'd never seen a preview like that , " said Frank Marshall , " the audience went up to the ceiling " ) , Sheinberg chose to move the release date to July 3 . To make sure the film met this new date , two editors , Arthur Schmidt and Harry <unk> , were assigned to the picture , while many sound editors worked 24 @-@ hour shifts on the film . Eight minutes were cut , including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam , George getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing Lorraine , as well as much of Marty pretending to be Darth Vader . Zemeckis almost cut out the " Johnny B. Goode " sequence as he felt it did not advance the story , but the preview audience loved it , so it was kept . Industrial Light & Magic created the film 's 32 effects shots , which did not satisfy Zemeckis and Gale until a week before the film 's completion date . The compositing involved for the film 's time travel sequences , as well as for the lightning effects in the climactic clock tower scene , was handled by animation supervisor Wes Takahashi , who would also work on the subsequent two Back to the Future films with the rest of the ILM crew . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Alan Silvestri collaborated with Zemeckis on Romancing the Stone , but Spielberg disliked that film 's score . Zemeckis advised Silvestri to make his compositions grand and epic , despite the film 's small scale , to impress Spielberg . Silvestri began recording the score two weeks before the first preview . He also suggested Huey Lewis and the News create the theme song . Their first attempt was rejected by Universal , before they recorded " The Power of Love " . The studio loved the final song , but were disappointed it did not feature the film 's title , so they had to send memos to radio stations to always mention its association with Back to the Future . In the end , the track " Back in Time " was featured in the film , playing during the scene when Marty wakes up after his return to 1985 and also during the end credits . 
 Although it appears that Fox is actually playing a guitar , music supervisor Bones Howe hired Hollywood guitar coach and musician Paul Hanson to teach Fox to simulate playing all the parts so it would look realistic , including playing behind his head . Fox lip @-@ synched " Johnny B. Goode " to vocals by Mark Campbell ( of Jack Mack and the Heart Attack fame ) , with the guitar solo played by Tim May . 
 The original 1985 soundtrack album only included two tracks culled from Silvestri 's compositions for the film , both Huey Lewis tracks , the songs played in the film by the fictional band Marvin Berry and The <unk> ( and Marty McFly ) , one of the vintage 1950s songs in the movie , and two pop songs that are only very briefly heard in the background of the film . On November 24 , 2009 , an authorized , limited @-@ edition two @-@ CD set of the entire score was released by Intrada Records . 
 = = Release = = 
 Back to the Future opened on July 3 , 1985 , on 1 @,@ 200 screens in North America . Zemeckis was concerned the film would flop because Fox had to film a Family Ties special in London and was unable to promote the film . Gale was also dissatisfied with Universal Pictures ' tagline " Are you telling me my mother 's got the hots for me ? " . 
 When the film was released on VHS in 1986 , Universal added a " To be continued ... " graphic at the end to increase awareness of production on Part II . This caption is omitted on the film 's DVD release in 2002 and on subsequent Blu @-@ ray and DVD releases . 
 In October 2010 , in commemoration for the film 's 25th anniversary , Back to the Future was digitally restored and remastered for a theatrical re @-@ release in the US , the UK and Italy . The release also coincided with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment 's Blu @-@ ray Disc releases of the trilogy . 
 On October 21 , 2015 , the futuristic date depicted in Part II , the entire trilogy was re @-@ released theatrically for one day in celebration of the film 's 30th anniversary .

 = Conn Smythe = 
 Constantine Falkland Cary Smythe , MC ( February 1 , 1895 – November 18 , 1980 ) was a Canadian businessman , soldier and sportsman in ice hockey and horse racing . He is best known as the principal owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) from 1927 to 1961 and as the builder of Maple Leaf Gardens . As owner of the Leafs during numerous championship years , his name appears on the Stanley Cup eight times : 1932 , 1942 , 1945 , 1947 , 1948 , 1949 , 1951 and 1962 . 
 Smythe is also known for having served in both World Wars , organizing his own artillery battery in the Second World War . The horses of Smythe 's racing stable won the Queen 's Plate twice among 145 stakes race wins during his lifetime . Smythe started and ran a successful sand and gravel business . He was a big supporter of the Ontario Society for Crippled Children and the Variety Club and founded the Conn Smythe Foundation philanthropic organization . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Conn Smythe was born on February 1 , 1895 , in Toronto to Albert Smythe , an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889 , and Mary Adelaide Constantine , an English woman . Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada . Albert and Mary had a rocky marriage and did not live together for more than a few months at a time . Mary , who was known as Polly , was remembered by Conn as pretty , a drinker and troublemaker , while Albert was quiet , a vegetarian and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky 's Theosophical movement . Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891 , and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life . 
 Smythe 's first home was 51 McMillan Street , now known as Mutual Street , not far from the future site of Maple Leaf Gardens . He was the second of two children born to Mary and Albert . Conn had a sister , Mary , five years older , who died due to illness in 1903 . The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe 's youth , the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe 's wages at the time . At one point , Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Mary and Polly stayed on North Street . Conn 's mother Mary died in 1906 , and Smythe attributes his mother 's drinking with making him a lifelong abstainer from alcohol . At age eleven Conn was christened and that was the first time that he insisted on Conn instead of his given name of Constantine . Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson . The two married in 1913 and had a daughter Moira . 
 Smythe first went to high school at Upper Canada College . He hated it , and after a year and a half he transferred to Jarvis Collegiate Institute . Smythe developed his athleticism there , playing on hockey , rugby football and basketball teams , playing on city championship teams in basketball and hockey in 1912 . At the age of 16 , Conn Smythe met Irene Sands , his future wife , after a football game against Parkdale Collegiate Institute , which she attended . Albert Smythe wanted his son to attend university after grade 12 but Smythe defied his father , bolting at age 17 to become a homesteader on 150 acres ( 61 ha ) in Clute Township , near Cochrane , Ontario . After one summer building a home on the property only to have it destroyed by a devastating fire , Smythe changed his mind about living in the bush and he enrolled in engineering studies at the University of Toronto in the fall of 1912 . There he played hockey as a centre , captaining the Varsity Blues men 's ice hockey team to the finals of the 1914 Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) junior championships and to the OHA junior championship the following year . The coach of the losing team in 1915 was Frank J. Selke , who years later would work for Smythe at Maple Leaf Gardens . Smythe also played on the University of Toronto football team , although not as a starter . 
 = = First World War = = 
 The First World War interrupted his studies . A week after winning the OHA championship in March 1915 , Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted . Smythe recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates tried to enlist at the beginning of the 1914 – 15 season , but were told to come back when they had beards . After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd ( Ottawa ) Battery , 8th Brigade , on July 17 , he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston , Ontario , in August for five weeks of training . He made full lieutenant on September 11 , and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th ( Sportsmen 's ) Battery of Hamilton , organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam , son of William Southam . The unit , with Smythe as team manager , organized a team to compete in the OHA 's senior league ; they were one of four Toronto @-@ based teams in the league in 1916 . He played one game at centre , and then decided to replace himself with a better player . The team did not complete the season , as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916 . 
 The Battery was ordered into the Ypres salient . On October 12 , shelling found their position killing Major Southam and Sergeant @-@ Major Norm Harvie , making Smythe temporarily commander of the Battery . The Battery fought for nearly two months in the trenches near the Somme before being relieved . In February 1917 , Smythe earned a Military Cross , when during an attack the Germans counter @-@ attacked with grenades . Smythe ran into the fight and killed three Germans and helped several wounded Canadian soldiers back to safety On March 5 , 1917 , Smythe was awarded the Military Cross for " dispersing an enemy party at a critical time . Himself accounted for three of the enemy with his revolver . " After an attack where several Canadians were killed because of what Smythe thought was poor planning by the Battery 's Major , Smythe wanted out . Smythe transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in July 1917 . One of his instructors was Billy Barker , who would later become the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs . Smythe served as an airborne observer , directing artillery fire . Smythe was shot down by the Germans and captured on October 14 , 1917 . He was imprisoned by the Germans at Schweidnitz ( <unk> ) in Upper Silesia . He made two failed escape attempts and ended up in solitary confinement as a result . He was a POW until the end of the war . Smythe would later make light of his fourteen months in captivity " We played so damned much bridge that I never played the game again . " 
 = = Return to Toronto = = 
 Following the war , Smythe returned to Toronto . With his accrued Army salary and the proceeds from the sale of his homestead plot , he started a sand and gravel business . For a while , the business became a partnership with Frank <unk> , who owned a paving business . To support the need for sand and gravel , Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a sand pit . He returned to the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920 . Irene and Conn were married during the school year . Smythe and his paving business partner split , and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business . The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was " C. Smythe for sand " , which he had painted on his trucks , the lettering in white on the blue of the trucks . Frank Selke , who had moved to Toronto , was one of Smythe 's first employees in the business . Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone as well as taking care of newborn son Stafford . Smythe would own the business until 1961 . 
 In the evenings , he coached the University of Toronto varsity team . It was through his coaching of this team that he became involved in the NHL . The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against colleges from that area , with great success . In 1926 , Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended him to Col. John S. Hammond , representing the owners of the new New York Rangers franchise , who was looking for someone to build his team . Smythe was hired to recruit a team , which he would then manage . But on October 27 , 1926 , before the Rangers had played a regular season game , Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick . Smythe believed that he lost his job by refusing to sign two @-@ time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye , against Hammond 's wishes . Smythe thought Dye was not a team player . 
 Smythe applied to coach the Toronto St. Pats , but was rejected in favour of Mike Rodden . He continued to coach for the University of Toronto and took on a new senior team made up of University of Toronto players , called the Varsity Grads . The team won the Allan Cup , and represented Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz the following year . Smythe refused to go when two Varsity Blues players he had promised could be part of the team were blocked by what he described as a " pressure play " from two Grads players to get relatives placed on the team instead . One of the players was Joe Sullivan , who years later became a Canadian Senator . 
 Although no longer a Rangers employee , Smythe was invited to the Rangers ' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard , an invitation he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short @-@ changed him . Hammond paid Smythe $ 7 @,@ 500 to settle his contract , and Smythe felt he was owed $ 10 @,@ 000 . At the insistence of his wife Irene , they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard 's private box . When the Rangers won the game , surprising the Montreal Maroons , Rickard offered Smythe a vice @-@ presidency with the club . Smythe turned the Rangers down , partly because of the disputed $ 2 @,@ 500 , although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest . On the return trip to Toronto , Conn and Irene visited Montreal , where Smythe bet the $ 2 @,@ 500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill . He then bet the $ 5 @,@ 000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto , winning again , turning the $ 2 @,@ 500 into $ 10 @,@ 000 in three days . The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928 , their second year of existence , largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team . 
 = = Smythe forms the Maple Leafs = = 
 The Rangers went to the top of their division , while the St. Pats were doing poorly . J. P. Bickell , a part @-@ owner of the St. Pats , contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the St. Pats . However , Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying the team , or at least a stake in the team . Not long after , the St. Pats were put up for sale , and agreed in principle to be sold for $ 200 @,@ 000 to a group who would move the team to Philadelphia . Bickell contacted Smythe and told him that if Smythe could raise $ 160 @,@ 000 and keep the team in Toronto , Bickell would not sell his $ 40 @,@ 000 interest . After persuading majority owner Charlie Querrie that civic pride was more important than money , Smythe put together a syndicate that included Bickell and several other investors that bought the St. Pats . Smythe himself invested $ 10 @,@ 000 of his own money . Soon after the sale closed on February 14 , 1927 , the new owners changed the St. Pats ' name to the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
 At first , Smythe 's name was kept in the background . However , when the Leafs promoted a public share offering to raise capital , they announced that " one of the most prominent hockey coaches in Toronto " would be taking over management of the club . That prominent coach turned out to be Smythe . He succeeded Querrie as the team 's governor , and installed himself as general manager . He installed Alex <unk> as coach . For the next season ( 1927 – 28 ) , Smythe changed the team 's colours from green and white to their present blue and white . According to the Maple Leafs , the blue represents the Canadian skies , while white represents snow . They were also the same colours as those of his sand and gravel business trucks . Smythe also took over as coach and for the next three years served as team governor , general manager and coach . 
 Smythe developed a public image as a " red @-@ faced , pepper @-@ pot " with nicknames such as " little corporal " or " little dictator . " Smythe was not reluctant to chase players and referees on the rink and off . Smythe also developed feuds with opposing coaches and general managers . He used any tactic available to disrupt the opponent . He advertised in a Boston newspaper inviting people to watch " a real hockey team , the Toronto Maple Leafs . " After learning that Boston general manager Art Ross suffered from hemorrhoids , he gave Ross a bouquet of flowers with a note in Latin describing where he should shove the flowers . 
 In 1929 , Smythe decided , in the midst of the Great Depression , that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena . The Arena Gardens seated 8 @,@ 000 and the Maple Leafs were regularly filling it with 9 @,@ 000 customers . Smythe knew it would take over a million dollars to construct and he got backing from the Sun Life insurance company for half a million . He found a site owned by the T. Eaton Co. department store chain on Carlton Street , a site Smythe selected because it was on the street car line . Smythe gave up the coaching position to concentrate on the arena project . The building started construction on June 1 , 1931 , and was ready on November 12 , 1931 , after five months . As part of a corporate reorganization , Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was founded that year to own both the team and the arena . To pay for the building construction , the construction workers were paid with Maple Leaf Gardens stock instead of 20 % of their pay . Selke , who had union connections , and Smythe were successful in negotiating the payment method in exchange for using unionized workers . 
 In its first season in the new building , Smythe fired coach Art Duncan after five games and hired Dick Irvin to coach . Irvin promptly led the Maple Leafs to their first Stanley Cup as the Maple Leafs , and the franchise 's third overall . While the Leafs would go to the finals every year except for 1934 and 1937 during Irvin 's nine @-@ year tenure , they were unable to win another Cup . By 1940 , Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs as far as he could , and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day , who had retired . Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough enough without Smythe to back him up . Meanwhile , the Montreal Canadiens had had a ten @-@ win season , and were looking for a new coach . At the suggestion of Smythe , Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens . 
 = = Thoroughbred horse racing = = 
 Smythe first became interested in horse racing as a boy , when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown . Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s , but he rarely had any success . One early purchase turned out to be one of his most famous . When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable , he bought Rare Jewel , a filly , for $ 250 . The filly regularly ran last . The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes , one of the best two @-@ year @-@ old races . Smythe was full of blind hope , and on the trainer 's advice , entered her in the race . The day of the race , both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy , unknown to Smythe , who bet over $ 100 on Rare Jewel . She won the race , a 100 – 1 longshot paying $ 214 @.@ 40 on a $ 2 bet , besting future Queen 's Plate winner Froth Blower . Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner 's purse as horse owner , Smythe won more than $ 10 @,@ 000 on that one race . Three weeks later , he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression @-@ strapped Ottawa Senators for $ 35 @,@ 000 . The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings , as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators ' then @-@ high price , and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money . 
 Smythe continued to own horses through the 1930s , but he sold them in 1940 , when he made plans to fight in the Second World War . He did not re @-@ enter the racing business until 1954 . In 1951 , Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon , Ontario , originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit . At first he kept only cattle , but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses , in partnership with Larkin Maloney , and an area was set aside to keep horses . Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding , buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines , and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer <unk> Starr . 
 Maloney and Smythe 's most famous horse Wonder Where , also led to the breakup of the partnership . Wonder Where , named by Maloney , was bred at Frank Selke 's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957 . In 1959 , Wonder Where had an outstanding season , including winning the Canadian Oaks . The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later , the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame . The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965 , becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995 . After the outstanding year in 1959 , Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not , concerned over some tendon trouble . The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie , and the partnership dissolved after that . 
 While not the largest operation , Smythe 's horses won 145 stakes races during his lifetime , a record second only to E. P. Taylor in Canada . Smythe 's stable won the Queen 's Plate twice , the first in 1958 with Caledon Beau and the second in 1967 with Jammed Lovely . In 1973 , Smythe became a founding member of the Jockey Club of Canada . In 1977 he was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame . After his death , the Smythe stable was sold in 1981 to Gardiner Farms and Harlequin Ranches , for an estimated $ 2 @.@ 5 million . Smythe 's will gave the racing stable to the Conn Smythe Foundation , which as a charitable foundation , could not run a business . The new owners leased back the farm and stables . The only horse not in the sale was Jammed Lucky , Smythe 's favourite , which was given to Smythe 's grandson Tommy . Jammed Lucky was 23 years old and had sired 25 winning foals to that point . 
 = = Second World War and the conscription crisis = = 
 In the Second World War , at age 45 , Smythe again served in the Canadian Army . Initially , he was a captain in charge of a troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps , based at the University of Toronto . In 1941 , along with Colonel Richard Greer , he formed the 30th Battery , a sportsmen 's anti @-@ aircraft battery that was part of the 7th Toronto Regiment , Royal Canadian Artillery , Canadian Active Army . Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding . He was offered a higher rank to become the army 's sports officer , but turned it down . After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack , the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England . After being stationed in England for nearly two years , Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944 , where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot . For the rest of his life he would walk with a limp and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems . He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship . 
 Smythe , who had seen that the army was using improperly trained troops due to a lack of soldiers , interviewed other soldiers during his time in the hospital , compiling a record over which to confront Mackenzie King . King had developed an official government policy of voluntary service for political reasons and Smythe saw the detrimental effect it had on the Army . Volunteers tried to press home service troops into active service to assist and augment the undermanned troops overseas . From his bed in the Chorley Park Hospital , Smythe dictated a statement to The Globe and Mail newspaper , which printed it on its front page on September 19 , 1944 : 
 Smythe was accused of acting solely for political gain . The publisher of the Globe and Mail at the time was prominent Conservative George McCullagh , and Smythe was friends with Ontario Conservative Premier George Drew . McCullagh and Drew may have used Smythe for their political ends to defeat King . The issue of lack of reinforcements was well @-@ known within the Army and Smythe did not make any complaints to senior officers while in active service . Despite being criticized , Smythe kept up his public criticism in the newspapers . After James Ralston , Canada 's defence minister , traveled to Italy , he saw for himself the shortage of skilled reinforcements . Ralston , who King did not trust , was replaced with Andrew McNaughton , who was against conscription . However , even King saw the need to send troops for the Canadian Army and he ordered 17 @,@ 500 reserve troops to Europe in November 1944 , which started to arrive in January 1945 
 = = Majority owner of the Maple Leafs = = 
 While Smythe was away , a committee , headed by Ed Bickle , Bill MacBrien , and Selke ran Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd . Upon his return from the military , Smythe found himself in the middle of a power struggle over the presidency of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd . Smythe suspected that MacBrien , a member of the board of directors , wanted to succeed Bickle as president and give Smythe 's job to Selke , who had been acting general manager in Smythe 's absence . Smythe wanted to be president and asked Selke for his support . Selke equivocated , and relationship between the two long @-@ time friends turned acrimonious , leading to Selke 's resignation in May 1946 . Two months later , Selke became head of hockey operations for the Montreal Canadiens and manager of the Montreal Forum , succeeding Tommy Gorman . 
 With the support of J. P. Bickell and with the help of a $ 300 @,@ 000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and Gardens shareholder Percy Gardiner , Smythe was able to buy enough stock to become majority shareholder of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd . He was thus able to install himself as president of the Gardens on November 19 , 1947 . Andy Lytle , sports editor of the Toronto Star , said the appointment " simply makes official what he has been for years in actuality ... Smythe and the Gardens are synonymous terms . " MacBrien was made chairman . Smythe repaid his debt to Gardiner by 1960 . He later succeeded MacBrien as chairman of the board . 
 Smythe oversaw one of hockey 's greatest dynasties when Toronto won six Stanley Cups in 10 seasons between 1942 and 1951 . Hap Day coached the team to five of those Cups and was assistant general manager for the sixth . He was named in a poll of Canadian sports editors the " most dominating personality in any capacity in sports " for 1949 . The Maple Leafs were masters of playoff hockey ; their regular @-@ season performances were usually fair to good or just good enough to make the playoffs . Smythe was known for caring little about gaudy regular season records but he did care about winning the Cup , because " winning sells tickets . " 
 However , the Leafs spent most of the 1950s as a mediocre team , struggling under three different coaches while Day remained assistant general manager under Smythe . Even so , in 1955 , Smythe turned over most responsibility for hockey operations to Day , but nominally remained general manager . However , just after the Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs in 1957 , Smythe told the media that it had been " a season of failure " and that he did not know if the 55 @-@ year @-@ old Day would be available for the next season . Day felt that his legs had been cut out from under him and resigned . 
 By this time Smythe had turned the operation of the hockey team over to a seven @-@ person committee , headed by his son , Stafford Smythe . Newspaper owner John Bassett was another member of the committee , as was Percy Gardiner 's son , George Gardiner . The committee became known as the " Silver Seven " because the seven had been " born with a silver spoon in their mouths . " Initially , all members were in their 30s or early 40s , but that changed before the end of the year when 54 @-@ year @-@ old Harold Ballard , president of the Toronto Marlboros , was appointed to the committee to fill a vacancy . The committee hired Punch Imlach as general manager , who would later take over the coaching job . 
 Smythe was an NHL owner during the era before the player 's union . The NHL was only six teams and players who didn 't toe the line could easily be demoted to the minor leagues and a replacement found . Players who didn 't follow Smythe 's rules were traded or sent to the minors . Two players , Danny <unk> and John McCormack were both demoted to the minors for getting married without Smythe 's permission . 
 While the pay was relatively good , it still left many players looking for other jobs during the off @-@ season , while the owners were all wealthy men . The conditions led to two organizing efforts at forming a player 's union , which Smythe was vehemently against . From 1957 onwards , Smythe , along with other NHL owners including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings were accused of union busting activities related to the attempt by Ted Lindsay and a group of NHL players to form an NHL Players Association . Mr. Smythe 's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie , Net Worth . Jimmy Thomson , who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize was singled out by Smythe . Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior , while he arranged for Thomson to be left off the team , allegedly calling Thomson a traitor and publicly blaming him for the team 's poor season . Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs . Thomson and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago . The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players , such as contributing to the players ' pensions . The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union , although it would eventually be organized some ten years later .

 Though the committee made most decisions involving the Leafs , Smythe was not a hands @-@ off owner and was constantly fighting with his son . Stafford commented : " My father has always given me lots of rope . When I was thirty , I was ten years ahead of everybody . But at forty , I 'm ten years behind everybody . " Finally , in 1961 , Stafford resigned from the Silver Seven and this spurred Conn . After four years of fighting , he offered to sell his shares to Stafford and in November 1961 , Smythe sold 45 @,@ 000 of his 50 @,@ 000 shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a partnership of his son , Ballard , and Bassett for $ 2 @.@ 3 million — a handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier . At first , Smythe thought the sale was only to his son , and when he learned that it was to the threesome , he was furious with Stafford . He had hoped that Stafford would eventually keep the Gardens for his son Tommy . Despite his misgivings , Smythe did not cancel the deal . 
 As part of the deal , Smythe resigned as president and managing director , nominating Stafford to succeed him . On Stafford 's instigation , the board then granted Smythe a $ 15 @,@ 000 annual allowance , an office at the Gardens , and a car and driver for the rest of his life . Stafford , Ballard and Bassett then nominated Smythe as chairman of the board . Smythe retired as NHL governor on February 5 , 1962 , a position he had held since 1927 . Smythe resigned the chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962 and Bassett succeeded him . 
 In 1964 , Smythe opposed the Lester Pearson government 's plan to replace the traditional Canadian flag with a completely new design . He wrote to Pearson , whom he had known since the 1920s : " In the Olympic Games , the whole world is represented and when Canada sometimes wins a Gold Medal everybody knows , when the Red Ensign ( see Canadian Red Ensign ) is raised to the masthead , that Canada has won . " Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country . Smythe switched his support to John Diefenbaker . Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament . In 1965 , he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada . Harold Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag . 
 In March 1966 , Smythe sold his remaining shares and resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens . He found Ali 's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War to be offensive , because , as he put it in his autobiography " The Gardens was founded by men – sportsmen – who fought for their country . It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country . The Gardens was built for many things , but not for picking up things that no one else wants . " He also said that by accepting the fight , Gardens owners had " put cash ahead of class . " 
 Smythe stayed away from the Gardens and he took pot shots in the press , stating that he had been " traded for $ 35 @,@ 000 and a black Muslim minister . " The seats at the Gardens had been replaced with new , narrower ones and Smythe commented that " only a slim , young man could sit in them but the prices are so high that only a fat rich man could afford them . " 
 Smythe continued to be sought out for his views on hockey . When the NHL expanded to 12 teams from six in 1967 , he openly opposed the expansion on the basis that it would make for inferior hockey . " We had the best players in the world split between six teams , and hockey was always worth the money . " 
 By this time Conn and Stafford were not on speaking terms and it fell to Tom Smythe , Stafford 's son , to mediate between the two . Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn , and the feud was over . After Stafford was charged in 1971 with fraud and became ill with a stomach ulcer , Conn was with him in hospital when he died . According to Conn , Stafford 's last words to him were " see dad , I told you they wouldn 't put me in jail . "

 After the Second World War , Smythe became involved in charities and would remain so for the rest of his life . He became heavily involved in the Ontario Society for Crippled Children . Smythe helped organize the financing and construction of their Variety Club Village complex in Toronto . In 1975 , at the age of 80 , Smythe organized the financing and building of the Ontario Community Centre for the Deaf , which opened in 1979 . 
 In 1960 , after paying off his debt to Percy Gardiner , Smythe set up the Conn Smythe Charitable Foundation , which distributes money to charities in the Toronto area . The foundation was operated by Conn , his children and Hap Day . Day continued to help with the Foundation until his death in 1990 . Before he died , Conn arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to continue the Foundation after his death . 
 Smythe supervised the construction of the Hockey Hall of Fame building in Toronto in 1961 . He served as the Hall 's chairman for several years , but resigned in June 1971 when Busher Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall . Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Leafs as " Apps , Primeau , Conacher , Clancy and Kennedy . If the standards are going to be lowered I 'll get out as chairman of the board . " Jackson was notorious for his off @-@ ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages . Frank Selke , head of the selection committee defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out " because of the amount of beer he drank . " 
 The National Hockey League honoured Smythe 's contribution to the game by introducing the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1965 , to be presented to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs . After his death , the trophy was renamed the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy . The league also named one of its four divisions , the Smythe Division , after him prior to the 1974 – 75 season . 
 Smythe Park and Recreation Centre in Toronto is located on the site of his old gravel pit . The surrounding neighbourhood is named <unk> @-@ Smythe , partly a sub @-@ division Smythe built for war veterans . Smythe made provisions for a portion of the lands of the sub @-@ division to be reserved for the centre . A street north of Eglinton Avenue , west of Markham Avenue , is named Conn Smythe Drive in his honour . 
 His autobiography , Conn Smythe : If You Can 't Beat ' Em in the Alley , written with Scott Young , was published posthumously in 1981 . The title was taken from Smythe 's credo , " If you can 't beat ' em in the alley , you can 't beat ' em on the ice . " In Smythe 's memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made . Rather than meaning that his players should go out and bully the opposition , he meant the opposite ; that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition . 
 Conn Smythe was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 .

 Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17 , 1920 , at Central Methodist Church . The couple lived in an apartment on St. Clair Avenue , then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto to be close to Smythe 's sand and gravel business , which operated a gravel pit north @-@ west of Jane Street and St. Clair . ( Smythe Park exists on the site today ) . In 1927 , after their first two children , Stafford and Miriam , were born , they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto , where they would live for the rest of their lives . Irene and Smythe had two other children , Hugh and Patricia . Hugh became a doctor ; a specialist in rheumatology , and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens . Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten , in 1945 . Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971 . Stafford 's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens , before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn 's death . 
 Smythe 's father died in 1947 at 86 years of age . Smythe had had a rapprochement with his father , seeing him at Christmas and at times when Albert came to Toronto to preach . After his father 's death , Smythe joined the Theosophical Society and remained a member for life . In 1977 , Smythe explained why he was a theosophist : " It 's because a theosophist teaches you that ya can 't get away with anything in this life anyway . " 
 Irene Smythe was diagnosed with cancer after Christmas 1963 . The illness progressed and Irene died on June 20 , 1965 . Due to the amount of pain Irene endured , Conn and Irene considered using a revolver to end her life , but near the end she told Conn that it was a " coward 's way out " and she endured . After the amount of pain Irene endured , Smythe called her death a " blessed release . " Smythe set up a foundation at the University of Toronto in her name , which opened the Irene Eleanor Smythe Pain Clinic at Toronto General Hospital . 
 On April 20 , 1978 , Smythe suffered a heart attack . He spent a month in the hospital , in time to spend May 18 at Woodbine , where he had four horses racing that day . His health continued to deteriorate and Conn realized that he was dying . He arranged for Thomas Smythe to take over the Conn Smythe Foundation , and he made gifts of money to relatives . Conn Smythe died at the age of 85 in 1980 at his home on Baby Point . He is interred with Irene at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto .

 Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , 548 U.S. 557 ( 2006 ) , is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that military commissions set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack " the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949 . " Specifically , the ruling says that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was violated . 
 The case considers whether the United States Congress may pass legislation preventing the Supreme Court from hearing the case of an accused combatant before his military commission takes place , whether the special military commissions that had been set up violated federal law ( including the Uniform Code of Military Justice and treaty obligations ) , and whether courts can enforce the articles of the 1949 Geneva Convention . 
 An unusual aspect of the case was an amicus brief filed by Senators Jon Kyl and Lindsey Graham , which presented an " extensive colloquy " added to the Congressional record as evidence that " Congress was aware " that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear cases brought by the Guantanamo detainees . Because these statements were not included in the December 21 debate at the time , Emily <unk> of Slate magazine has argued their brief was an attempt to mislead the court . 
 On June 29 , 2006 , the Court issued a 5 – 3 decision holding that it had jurisdiction , that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization , because they did not comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention ( which the court found to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 The plaintiff was Salim Ahmed Hamdan , a citizen of Yemen who worked as a bodyguard and chauffeur for Osama bin Laden . Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed . Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States . In 2002 , he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its Naval Base in Cuba . 
 In July 2004 , Hamdan was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission , established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21 , 2002 . He was assigned a defense counsel , LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG , who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus , challenging the constitutionality of the military commission , and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice . 
 Following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld ( 2004 ) , which established that detainees had the right of habeas corpus to challenge their detention , Hamdan was granted a review before the Combatant Status Review Tribunal . It determined that he was eligible for detention by the United States as an enemy combatant or person of interest . 
 The defendants in this case included many United States government officials allegedly responsible for Hamdan 's detention ; the short name of the case includes only the first @-@ named defendant , then @-@ Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
