 In 1935 , the political climate in Italy ( under Mussolini ) became unacceptable to Escher . He had no interest in politics , finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium , but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy . When his eldest son , George , was forced at the age of nine to wear a <unk> uniform in school , the family left Italy and moved to Château @-@ d <unk> , Switzerland , where they remained for two years . 
 The Netherlands post office had Escher design a semi @-@ postal stamp for the " Air Fund " in 1935 and again in 1949 he designed Netherlands stamps . These were for the 75th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union ; a different design was used by Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles for the same commemoration . 
 Escher , who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in Italy , was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland . In 1937 , the family moved again , to Uccle ( <unk> ) , a suburb of Brussels , Belgium . World War II forced them to move in January 1941 , this time to Baarn , Netherlands , where Escher lived until 1970 . Most of Escher 's best @-@ known works date from this period . The sometimes cloudy , cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work . After 1953 , Escher lectured widely . A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness , and he stopped creating artworks for a time , but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as part of the book Escher on Escher . He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange @-@ Nassau in 1955 . 
 In July 1969 he finished his last work , a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes , in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings . These shrink to infinity toward both the center and the edge of a circle . It was exceptionally elaborate , being printed using three blocks , each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps , for a total of nine print operations for each finished print . The image encapsulates Escher 's love of symmetry , of interlocking patterns , and at the end of his life , of his approach to infinity . The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording . 
 Escher moved to the Rosa Spier Huis in Laren in 1970 , an artists ' retirement home in which he had his own studio . He died there on 27 March 1972 , aged 73 . He is buried at the New Cemetery in Baarn . 
 = = Mathematically @-@ inspired work = = 
 Escher 's work is inescapably mathematical . This has caused a disconnect between his full @-@ on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world . His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected , but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical . Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world 's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism , but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective . However , these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public . Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes : Parmigianino ( 1503 – 1540 ) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self @-@ portrait in a Convex Mirror , depicting his own image in a curved mirror , while William Hogarth 's 1754 Satire on False Perspective , foreshadows Escher 's playful exploration of errors in perspective . Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi ( 1720 – 1778 ) , whose dark " fantastical " prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri ( " Prisons " ) sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps , peopled by walking figures . Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism , De Stijl , Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher @-@ like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints . However , while Escher had much in common with , for example , Magritte 's surrealism , he did not make contact with any of these movements . 
 = = = Tessellation = = = 
 In his early years , Escher sketched landscapes and nature . He also sketched insects such as ants , bees , grasshoppers and mantises , which appeared frequently in his later work . His early love of Roman and Italian landscapes and of nature created an interest in tessellation , which he called Regular Division of the Plane ; this became the title of his 1958 book , complete with reproductions of a series of woodcuts based on tessellations of the plane , in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks . He wrote " Mathematicians have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain . " 
 After his 1936 journey to the Alhambra and to La Mezquita , Cordoba , where he sketched the Moorish architecture and the tessellated mosaic decorations , Escher began to explore the properties and possibilities of tessellation using geometric grids as the basis for his sketches . He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs , for example with animals such as birds , fish , and reptiles . One of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil , India ink and watercolour Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles ( 1939 ) , constructed on a hexagonal grid . The heads of the red , green and white reptiles meet at a vertex ; the tails , legs and sides of the animals exactly interlock . It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph Reptiles . 
 His first study of mathematics began with papers by George Pólya and by the crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups , sent to him by his brother Berend ( known as Beer ) . He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups , and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry . From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation . Starting in 1937 , he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups . His Metamorphosis I ( 1937 ) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures . In Metamorphosis I , he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif . He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III , which is four metres long . 
 In 1941 and 1942 , Escher summarized his findings for his own artistic use in a sketchbook , which he labeled ( following Haag ) <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Regular division of the plane with asymmetric congruent polygons " ) . The mathematician Doris Schattschneider unequivocally described this notebook as recording " a methodical investigation that can only be termed mathematical research . " She defined the research questions he was following as 
 ( 1 ) What are the possible shapes for a tile that can produce a regular division of the plane , that is , a tile that can fill the plane with its congruent images such that every tile is surrounded in the same manner ? 
 ( 2 ) Moreover , in what ways are the edges of such a tile related to each other by isometries ? 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Although Escher did not have mathematical training — his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive — his art had a strong mathematical component , and several of the worlds which he drew were built around impossible objects After 1924 , Escher turned to sketching landscapes in Italy and Corsica with irregular perspectives that are impossible in natural form . His first print of an impossible reality was Still Life and Street ( 1937 ) ; impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as Relativity ( 1953 ) . House of Stairs ( 1951 ) attracted the interest of the mathematician Roger Penrose and his father the biologist Lionel Penrose . In 1956 they published a paper , " Impossible Objects : A Special Type of Visual Illusion " and later sent Escher a copy . Escher replied , admiring the <unk> ' continuously rising flights of steps , and enclosed a print of Ascending and Descending ( 1960 ) . The paper also contained the <unk> or Penrose triangle , which Escher used repeatedly in his lithograph of a building that appears to function as a perpetual motion machine , Waterfall ( 1961 ) . 
 Escher was interested enough in Hieronymus Bosch 's 1500 triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights to recreate part of its right @-@ hand panel , Hell , as a lithograph in 1935 . He reused the figure of a Mediaeval woman in a two @-@ pointed headdress and a long gown in his lithograph Belvedere in 1958 ; the image is , like many of his other " extraordinary invented places " , peopled with " jesters , knaves and <unk> " . Escher was thus not only interested in possible or impossible geometry , but was in his own words a " reality enthusiast " ; he combined " formal astonishment with a vivid and idiosyncratic vision . " 
 Escher worked primarily in the media of lithographs and woodcuts , though the few mezzotints he made are considered to be masterpieces of the technique . In his graphic art , he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes , figures and space . Integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones , spheres , cubes , rings and spirals . 
 Escher was also fascinated by mathematical objects like the Möbius strip , which has only one surface . His wood engraving Möbius Strip II ( 1963 ) depicts a chain of ants marching for ever around over what at any one place are the two opposite faces of the object — which are seen on inspection to be parts of the strip 's single surface . In Escher 's own words 
 An endless ring @-@ shaped band usually has two distinct surfaces , one inside and one outside . Yet on this strip nine red ants crawl after each other and travel the front side as well as the reverse side . Therefore the strip has only one surface . 
 The mathematical influence in his work became prominent after 1936 , when , having boldly asked the Adria Shipping Company if he could sail with them as travelling artist in return for making drawings of their ships , they surprisingly agreed , and he sailed the Mediterranean , becoming interested in order and symmetry . Escher described this journey , including his repeat visit to the Alhambra , as " the richest source of inspiration I have ever tapped . " 
 Escher 's interest in curvilinear perspective was encouraged by his friend and " kindred spirit " the art historian and artist Albert Flocon , in another example of constructive mutual influence . Flocon identified Escher as a " thinking artist " alongside Piero della Francesca , Leonardo da Vinci , Albrecht Dürer , Wenzel <unk> , Abraham Bosse , Girard Desargues , and Père Nicon . Flocon was delighted by Escher 's <unk> en <unk> ( " Graphics in Drawing " ) , which he read in 1959 . This stimulated Flocon and André Barre to correspond with Escher , and to write the book La Perspective <unk> ( " Curvilinear perspective " ) . 
 = = = Platonic and other solids = = = 
 Escher often incorporated three @-@ dimensional objects such as the Platonic solids such as spheres , <unk> and cubes into his works , as well as mathematical objects like cylinders and stellated polyhedra . In the print Reptiles , he combined two and three @-@ dimensional images . In one of his papers , Escher emphasized the importance of dimensionality : 
 The flat shape irritates me - I feel like telling my objects , you are too fictitious , lying there next to each other static and frozen : do something , come off the paper and show me what you are capable of ! ... So I make them come out of the plane . ... My objects ... may finally return to the plane and disappear into their place of origin . 
 Escher 's artwork is especially well liked by mathematicians like Doris Schattschneider and scientists like Roger Penrose , who enjoy his use of polyhedra and geometric distortions . For example , in Gravitation , animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron . 
 The two towers of Waterfall 's impossible building are topped with compound polyhedra , one a compound of three cubes , the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher 's solid . Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars , which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids , representing stars ; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space . Escher possessed a 6 cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars . 
 = = = Levels of reality = = = 
 Escher 's artistic expression was created from images in his mind , rather than directly from observations and travels to other countries . His interest in the multiple levels of reality in art is seen in works such as Drawing Hands ( 1948 ) , where two hands are shown , each drawing the other . The critic Steven Poole commented that 
 It is a neat depiction of one of Escher 's enduring fascinations : the contrast between the two @-@ dimensional flatness of a sheet of paper and the illusion of three @-@ dimensional volume that can be created with certain marks . In Drawing Hands , space and the flat plane coexist , each born from and returning to the other , the black magic of the artistic illusion made creepily manifest . 
 = = = Infinity and hyperbolic geometry = = = 
 In 1954 , the International Congress of Mathematicians met in Amsterdam , and N. G. de Bruin organized a display of Escher 's work at the Stedelijk Museum for the participants . Both Roger Penrose and H. S. M. Coxeter were deeply impressed with Escher 's intuitive grasp of mathematics . Inspired by Relativity , Penrose devised his <unk> , and his father , Lionel Penrose , devised an endless staircase . Roger Penrose sent sketches of both objects to Escher , and the cycle of invention was closed when Escher then created the perpetual motion machine of Waterfall and the endless march of the monk @-@ figures of Ascending and Descending . In 1957 , Coxeter obtained Escher 's permission to use two of his drawings in his paper " Crystal symmetry and its generalizations " . He sent Escher a copy of the paper ; Escher recorded that Coxeter 's figure of a hyperbolic tessellation " gave me quite a shock " : the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the hyperbolic plane , growing rapidly smaller towards the edge of the circle , was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent infinity on a two @-@ dimensional plane . 
 Escher carefully studied Coxeter 's figure , marking it up to analyse the successively smaller circles with which ( he deduced ) it had been constructed . He then constructed a diagram , which he sent to Coxeter , showing his analysis ; Coxeter confirmed it was correct , but disappointed Escher with his highly technical reply . All the same , Escher persisted with hyperbolic tiling , which he called " <unk> " . Among the results were the series of wood engravings Circle Limit I – IV . In 1959 , Coxeter published his finding that these works were extraordinarily accurate : " Escher got it absolutely right to the millimeter . "

 Bingo America is an American game show broadcast by Game Show Network . The series follows two contestants as they try to compete to win up to $ 100 @,@ 000 . Additionally , the series lets at @-@ home viewers print bingo cards online that allow them to play along with the show to win small amounts of money for themselves . 
 Created and produced by Andrew Glassman , the show was originally hosted by Patrick Duffy and Crystal <unk> . When its second season premiered on October 6 , 2008 , they were replaced by Richard Karn and Diane Mizota , respectively . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 = = = Main game = = = 
 Two contestants compete on each episode . On each turn , a Bingo ball comes out of the hopper and a question is asked . Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word " <unk> " printed on it . If the question is answered correctly , the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank , which starts at $ 500 ( e.g. , if G @-@ 50 comes out , the bank increases by $ 50 ) . If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player , no extra letters are earned . The first player that spells out <unk> from the earned letters wins the game . A Free @-@ Space Ball with a sponsor 's logo acts as a wild card in the game . The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter , and $ 100 is added to the bank . Two regular games are played . Contestants who win both games win the match and receive all the money in the bank . If each contestant wins one game , a five @-@ question tie @-@ breaker game is played . The first question 's answer begins with a B , the second question 's answer starts with I , and so on . The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 If time runs short during a game , the show goes to a 50 / 50 round . In the 50 / 50 round the remaining questions of that game are asked in a multiple @-@ choice fashion , with two possible answers given . Contestants who answer incorrectly at this point have credit for the question ( and the given letter , if applicable ) automatically given to their opponent ; however , no money is added to the bank for that question . 
 = = = Bonus round = = = 
 The winner of the main game plays the Bingo Bonus Board , which used two different formats . In the first season of the show , each number on the Bingo Bonus Board represented a cash amount or another prize , up to a grand prize of $ 100 @,@ 000 cash . Every prize was repeated at least twice on the board . The contestant chose one number at a time , and won the first prize to be revealed twice . 
 In the second season , 55 of the 75 spaces concealed cash values , while 20 hid " wrecking balls . " Contestants started with the " B " row ( the only row without wrecking balls ) and selected a number in that row . After each selection , the contestants could leave the game with the money already won or risk their winnings and continue with a selection in the next row . Contestants who chose wrecking balls lost the money they had accumulated in the bonus round . Contestants who made five successful picks kept all of their accumulated bonus money and activated the Bingo Sphere one more time for the Superball . If the contestants ' five chosen bonus numbers matched the one on the Superball , their bonus round winnings were augmented to $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 Marine John Stefan was the first contestant to win $ 100 @,@ 000 , doing so under the first format in April 2008 . John Hanlin was the only player to win the top prize under the second format , doing so in October 2008 .

 Bingo America received mixed critical reception . David Hinckley of the New York Daily News argued that the series only got " partly there " in attempting to bring bingo to television , and " doesn 't quite capture what the game is about . " Additionally , Ed Bark , a former television critic at The Dallas Morning News , argued that the show , " moves along briskly enough and it won 't hurt anybody , " and added that it had potential to raise the level of GSN 's " <unk> " audience . 
 = = Merchandise = = 
 In 2008 , GSN announced plans to launch a new website featuring multiple variations of game show @-@ themed merchandise ; the now @-@ defunct website was launched September 30 of that year . Among the items featured in the online store was an interactive DVD game by Imagination Entertainment based on the series ' format , which was released at the time the second season premiered . The game plays similarly to the show , beginning with a " Bingo Draw " round . During this round , players attempt to be the first to earn a " Bingo " while accumulating points by correctly answering trivia questions . Once a player earns a " Bingo " the " Bingo Bonus Board " round is played . The winner of the previous round tries to add more points to their score by matching two hidden numbers ; the round ends once the player finds a match . Opposing players can also earn points by guessing which numbers the other player chooses in this round . Whoever earns the most points during the game is the winner . 
 = Vance plan = 
 The Vance plan ( Croatian : <unk> plan , Serbian Latin : <unk> plan ) was a peace plan negotiated by the former United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . At that time , Vance was the Special Envoy of the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations ; he was assisted by United States diplomat Herbert Okun during the negotiations . The plan was designed to implement a ceasefire , demilitarize parts of Croatia that were under the control of Croatian Serbs and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) , allow the return of refugees , and create favourable conditions for negotiations on a permanent political settlement of the conflict resulting from the breakup of Yugoslavia . 
 The Vance plan consisted of two agreements . The first agreement , known as the Geneva Accord , was signed by Yugoslav defence minister General Veljko Kadijević , President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević and Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Geneva , Switzerland , on 23 November 1991 . Because the ceasefire agreed at that time did not hold , further negotiations resulted in the Implementation Agreement of 2 January 1992 . The Implementation Agreement , signed in Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina , by JNA Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta and Croatian defence minister Gojko Šušak , produced a longer lasting ceasefire , which was supervised by the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) . The parties failed to completely implement the remaining major aspects of the Vance plan . 
 = = Background = = 
 In August 1990 , an insurgency known as the Log Revolution took place in Croatia . It centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin , parts of the Lika , Kordun , and Banovina regions , and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations . These areas were subsequently declared to be the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . After the RSK declared its intention to join Serbia , the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebel organization . By March 1991 , the conflict had escalated , resulting in the Croatian War of Independence . In June 1991 , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . A three @-@ month moratorium on the declarations of independence by Croatia and the RSK followed , but both declarations came into effect on 8 October . 
 The Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde , ZNG ) was formed in May 1991 because the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Jugoslavenska Narodna Armija , JNA ) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation . In November the same year , the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Croatian : Hrvatska vojska , HV ) . The establishment of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo that had been introduced in September . The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war , culminating in the Battle of the Barracks , the Siege of Dubrovnik , and the Battle of Vukovar . 
 = = Geneva Accord = = 
 The Vance plan was a result of a diplomatic mission by Cyrus Vance , the former United States Secretary of State , then Special Envoy of the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . He was assisted by US diplomat Herbert Okun and Under @-@ Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs Marrack Goulding . The mission was sent to SFR Yugoslavia and was aimed at negotiating the end of hostilities in Croatia in late 1991 . The plan proposed a ceasefire , protection of civilians in specific areas designated as United Nations Protected Areas and a United Nations ( UN ) peacekeeping operation in Croatia . 
 The plan was first presented to the President of Serbia , Slobodan Milošević . Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure the leadership of the RSK eventually supported it . He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991 , retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina . Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević , who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so . After the plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman , the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman , Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva , Switzerland , on 23 November 1991 . The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force . It comprised four provisions ; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks , the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid . 
 The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia , which was later authorized through United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November , following a formal request for deployment of the peacekeepers submitted by the Yugoslav government the previous day . 
 The Vance plan was approved pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 721 as a part of the Report of the UN Secretary @-@ General submitted on 11 December , as UN Security Council Resolution 724 of 15 December . That resolution determined that the conditions necessary to deploy the peacekeepers had not yet been met . Instead , the UN deployed 50 liaison officers to prepare the mission while fighting continued throughout 1991 . The blockade of JNA barracks in HV @-@ controlled territory remained in place until December 1991 . 
 In the final ten @-@ day round of meetings , Vance negotiated another ceasefire agreement as a provisional arrangement backed by a deployment of UN peacekeepers to oversee it . The final obstacle to the agreement was removed when Tuđman agreed to lift the blockade of the remaining JNA barracks in HV @-@ held territory on 25 December . This met Kadijević 's conditions for the implementation of the ceasefire , and Milošević declared he had no objections to the plan on 31 December . 
 = = Implementation Agreement = = 
 The final agreement is known as the Vance plan , the Implementation Agreement , or the Sarajevo Agreement ( Croatian : Sarajevski sporazum ) . The UN deployment was made possible by the acceptance that the agreement did not represent a final political settlement and by the description of the role of the UN mission , which allowed both sides to claim it as a victory . The RSK claimed the situation allowed for the maintenance of RSK authorities until a final political settlement was reached , virtually ensuring the RSK had no incentive to negotiate . Croatians believed the UN would restore the RSK @-@ controlled area to Croatian authority , which the UN would not attempt . 
 After four hours of negotiations , the agreement was signed by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak and deputy commander of the JNA 's 5th Military District Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina , on 2 January 1992 . It was the 15th ceasefire agreement signed since the start of the Croatian War of Independence on 31 March 1991 . The ceasefire generally held after it took effect on 3 January at 18 : 00 hours . The main exception was in the Dubrovnik area , where the JNA held positions around the city of Dubrovnik and in nearby Konavle until July 1992 . That area was not included in the UN peacekeeping deployment schedule . On 4 January , the Yugoslav Navy retreated from the Lora naval base near Split . On 5 January , Major General Imra Agotić , commander of the ZNG , noted 84 ceasefire violations by the Serb side . On 7 January , the Yugoslav Air Force shot down a European Community Monitor Mission helicopter . The next day , Kadijević resigned as Minister of Defence and was replaced with Colonel General Blagoje Adžić . 
 The Vance plan was designed to stop fighting in Croatia and allow negotiations to proceed without the impact of ongoing hostilities . It offered no political solutions in advance . The plan entailed the deployment of the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) to the three major conflict areas designated as UN Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) . The plan listed specific municipalities that were to be included in each UNPA , but the exact borders of each UNPA were not defined clearly because several municipalities were only to be partially included . The task of defining the exact borders of each UNPA was delegated to the UN liaison officers deployed in advance , in co @-@ operation with authorities in each area . Creation of the UNPAs was necessary for acceptance of the plan by Milošević and Tuđman . The Serb @-@ dominated authorities of Yugoslavia originally requested the deployment of a UN force along a zone between Serb and Croatian areas , reflecting the Serb desire to see the peacekeeping force securing the confrontation lines . Croatia wanted the UN force deployed along its international borders . The UNPAs served to formally satisfy both parties . 
 UNPROFOR was tasked with creating buffer zones between the belligerents , disarming the Croatian Serb Territorial Defence Force troops , overseeing the JNA and HV withdrawal from the UNPAs , and the return of refugees to those areas . United Nations Security Council Resolution 743 of 21 February 1992 described the legal basis of the UN mission , requested and agreed upon in November 1991 , with no explicit reference to Chapter VI or Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . Instead , the resolution referred to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter , which foresees enforcement through regional arrangements or agencies after further authorization by the UN Security Council . 
 President of the RSK Milan Babić refused to endorse the plan ; Milošević summoned him to Belgrade where he , Serb members of the federal presidency , JNA commanders and Bosnian Serb leaders tried to persuade Babić to change his mind in a 70 @-@ hour @-@ long meeting . Despite failing to persuade Babić , Milošević arranged to have the RSK parliament approve the plan instead . Babić 's and Milošević 's supporters organized two separate , concurrent sessions of the RSK parliament — each group proclaiming victory . On 27 February , Babić was removed as RSK president following an intervention by Milošević ; he was replaced with Goran Hadžić . Babić opposed the Vance plan because he considered that acceptance of it , and the replacement of the JNA by UNPROFOR , would represent a de facto acceptance of Croatian sovereignty over the territory held by the RSK because the Vance plan treated RSK territory as part of Croatia . Croatia considered the UNPAs part of Croatia and objected to any official recognition of RSK officials within them . It feared the RSK would use the UN mission to consolidate itself within the UNPAs . The Croatian authorities considered that the only parties to the Vance Plan were the authorities in Belgrade , the UN and Croatia . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Despite the Geneva Accord requiring the immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the JNA remained there for another seven to eight months . When they eventually withdrew , they left their equipment to RSK forces . The 2 January ceasefire allowed the JNA to retain its positions in East and West Slavonia , which were on the brink of military collapse . As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the previous ceasefire agreement , the UNPROFOR did not start to arrive until 8 March and took two months to fully deploy in the UNPAs . Even though UNPROFOR had placed most of the RSK 's heavy weapons in storage areas jointly controlled by the UN and the RSK by January 1993 , the peacekeeping troops were unable to fulfil the provisions of the Vance plan , such as the disarmament of the RSK militia , the return of refugees , the restoration of civilian authority and establishment of an ethnically mixed police force . The RSK military was retitled as police while the ethnic cleansing of areas under its control continued unchecked . UNPROFOR was compelled to prevent the return of refugees because of poor security conditions . No attempt was made to establish an ethnically mixed police force . UNPROFOR also failed to remove RSK forces from areas outside designated UNPAs that were under RSK control when the Implementation Agreement ceasefire was signed . Those areas — later better known as the " pink zones " — were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset . Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of friction between Croatia and the RSK . 
 In 1993 , Croatia launched several small @-@ scale military operations against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and capture international attention ; it was worried the situation on the ground might become permanent . In response , the RSK military retrieved their weapons from the UN / RSK @-@ controlled storage sites , reversing the only major success of UNPROFOR . In March 1995 , the UNPROFOR mission was terminated following the efforts of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke ; the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation was deployed to Croatia with a new mandate . Later that year , most of the territory controlled by the RSK was captured by the HV during Operations Flash and Storm , which was foreseen by Babić when he opposed the Vance plan in 1991 . The rest of the RSK @-@ held areas were regained by Croatia following the Erdut Agreement negotiated between Croatian and Serbian authorities on 12 November 1995 during peace talks that also produced the Dayton Agreement . 
 = Cadbury Camp = 
 Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset , England , near the village of Tickenham . It is a scheduled monument . Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely , from artefacts , including a bronze spear or axe head , discovered at the site , that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot ; however there is no evidence to support this . 
 The 7 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 8 ha ) hill fort is well preserved , and is managed by the National Trust through a Higher Level Stewardship agreement with Natural England which involves tree clearing , including non @-@ native Turkey Oaks , and management of the scrub . 
 The name Cadbury is derived from " Cada 's byrig " ; byrig is the Anglo @-@ Saxon word meaning " fort " or " town " , which is frequently , but not exclusively , used to refer to hill @-@ forts . It is one of three sites in Somerset to include the Cadbury name , the others being Cadbury Castle , near South Cadbury and Cadbury Hill which is also known as Cadbury @-@ Congresbury to distinguish it from the other sites . 
 = = Location = = 
 Cadbury Camp is situated on a natural ridge between the Gordano Valley and the North Somerset Levels , next to the <unk> Wood ancient woodland and nature reserve . 
 = = History = = 
 The hill fort was constructed during the Iron Age , probably by the local Dobunni tribe , however the details are not fully known . The discovery of a bronze spear or axe head at the site indicates use before the Iron Age . The Bronze Age spearhead is in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton . 
 Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated " the forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare . But I would not see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction " . 
 The fort , which covers about 7 acres ( 2 @.@ 8 ha ) , consisted of ditches and earth banks topped with a wooden fence in an elevated position above the marshy land below . The ramparts are 45 feet ( 14 m ) apart . It extends approximately 190 metres ( 620 ft ) from north to south and 160 metres ( 520 ft ) from east to west . The ditch is around 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) deep and the ramparts rise up around 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) . 
 After the Iron Age occupation may have continued into the Roman era indicated by the discovery of pottery fragments , a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II . The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922 , although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano @-@ British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974 . The relief was given to North Somerset Museum , and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . 
 During World War II the site was used for bomb disposal and as the location for a searchlight battery . 
 = = Current management = = 
 The site was once part of the estate linked to Clevedon Court . It is now managed via a Higher Level Stewardship agreement between the National Trust and Natural England . This has involved removing trees whose roots are growing into the earthen banks of the site . In particular non native Turkey Oaks , which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps , are being removed . Cattle are also being used to manage the scrub and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids .

 = Italian battleship Ammiraglio di Saint Bon = 
 Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Italian Navy ( Italian : Regia Marina ) built during the 1890s . She was laid down in July 1893 , launched in April 1897 , and completed in May 1901 . She was the lead ship of her class , and had one sister ship , Emanuele Filiberto . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns and was capable of a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Ammiraglio di Saint Bon served in the active squadron of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career . She was assigned to the 3rd Division during the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 1912 . During the war , she was involved in the seizure of the island of Rhodes , where she provided gunfire support to Italian infantry . The ship was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914 – 15 , but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon a respite . She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and , after April 1916 , was used primarily as a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery . She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was 111 @.@ 8 meters ( 367 ft ) long overall , and had a beam of 21 @.@ 12 m ( 69 @.@ 3 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 69 m ( 25 @.@ 2 ft ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 531 long tons ( 10 @,@ 700 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines rated at 14 @,@ 296 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 661 kW ) . Steam for the engines was provided by twelve coal @-@ fired cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 18 @.@ 3 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 mph ) and a range of approximately 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Ammiraglio di Saint Bon had a crew of 557 officers and enlisted men . 
 As built , the ship was armed with four 10 in ( 254 mm ) 40 @-@ caliber guns placed in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . She was also equipped with eight 6 in ( 152 mm ) 40 @-@ cal. guns in individual casemates amidships , and eight 4 @.@ 7 in ( 119 mm ) 40 @-@ cal. guns in shielded pivot mounts directly above the casemate battery . The ship 's gun armament was rounded out by eight 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns and two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . Ammiraglio di Saint Bon also carried four 17 @.@ 7 in ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck @-@ mounted launchers . The ship was protected by Harvey steel . The main belt was 9 @.@ 8 in ( 249 mm ) thick , and the deck was 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) thick . The conning tower was protected by 9 @.@ 8 in of armor plating . The main battery guns had 9 @.@ 8 in thick plating , and the casemates were 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service = = 
 Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was built by the Venice Naval Shipyard . She was laid down on 18 July 1893 and launched on 29 April 1897 , after which her fitting out took place . The ship began her sea trials in January 1901 off La Spezia , and was commissioned on 1 February . Her preliminary full @-@ power trials began on 5 May , during which she reached 19 @.@ 2 knots ( 35 @.@ 6 km / h ; 22 @.@ 1 mph ) . Her official speed trials took place on 23 May , where she reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) . Her trials were completed the following day . 
 The ship spent the first several years of her career in the 1st Squadron , along with her sister Emanuele Filiberto and the two Regina Margherita @-@ class battleships . In October 1906 , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon participated in major fleet maneuvers under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di <unk> in the Ionian Sea . The exercises lasted from 10 to 26 October . The maneuvers culminated in a mock attack by the Italian fleet on the harbor defenses at Taranto . During the 1908 maneuvers , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon served in the hostile squadron , tasked with attacking the friendly squadron , where her sister was assigned . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish War = = = 
 On 29 September 1911 , Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya . Ammiraglio di Saint Bon initially served in the 3rd Division of the 2nd Squadron , but was later transferred to the Division of the Torpedo Boat Inspector , commanded by Rear Admiral Prince Luigi Amedeo . The ship was not heavily involved in the fighting in North Africa in the first months of the war and , in December , was transferred to Italy . On 13 April 1912 , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the rest of the Division sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to rendezvous with the 1st Division . The two divisions met on 17 April off the island of Stampalia , after which the combined fleet steamed north . The following day , the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros , Tenedos , Lemnos , Salonica , and the Dardanelles . They then steamed to the entrance to the Dardanelles in an attempt to lure out the Ottoman fleet . When the Ottoman coastal fortifications began to take the Italian ships under fire , the Italians returned fire and inflicted serious damage on them . On 19 April , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and most of the fleet returned to Italy , leaving only Pisa , Amalfi , and a flotilla of torpedo boats to cruise off the Ottoman coast . 
 On 30 April 1912 , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the rest of the 3rd Division escorted a convoy of troopships from Tobruk to the island of Rhodes . The Italian heavy ships demonstrated off the city of Rhodes , while the transports landed the expeditionary force 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the south on 4 May ; the soldiers quickly advanced on the city , supported by artillery fire from the Italian fleet . The Turks surrendered the city the following day . While the Italian troops completed the conquest of the island , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon bombarded Ottoman positions in support of the Italian offensive . Toward the end of May , the 3rd Division returned to Italy . In July , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the rest of the Division had withdrawn to Italy to replace worn @-@ out gun barrels , along with other repairs . By October , the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war . After the war , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon had six searchlights installed on platforms abreast the funnels and the mast . A rangefinder was also added on top of the conning tower . 
 In 1913 , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars . Ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the British pre @-@ dreadnought HMS King Edward VII , the Austro @-@ Hungarian pre @-@ dreadnought SMS Zrínyi , the French armored cruiser Edgar Quinet , and the German light cruiser SMS Breslau . The most important action of the combined flotilla , which was under the command of British Admiral Cecil Burney , was to blockade the Montenegrin coast . The goal of the blockade was to prevent Serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at Scutari , where Montenegro had besieged a combined force of Albanians and Ottomans . Pressured by the international blockade , Serbia withdrew its army from Scutari , which was subsequently occupied by a joint Allied ground force . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Italy declared her neutrality after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 but , by July 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers . Nevertheless , the outbreak of war prompted Italy to retain Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and her sister , which had been scheduled for disposal in 1914 – 15 . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , Italy 's traditional naval rival , was the primary opponent in the conflict . The Italian Naval Chief of Staff , Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , believed that an active fleet policy was prohibited by the serious threat from submarines in the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea . Instead , Revel decided to implement blockade at the southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Meanwhile , Revel 's capital ships would be preserved to confront the Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement . As a result , the ship was not particularly active during the war . 
 From the onset of Italian participation in the war , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was used as a harbor defense ship in Venice , along with her sister and the old battleship Sardegna , as well as two cruisers and several smaller craft . After April 1916 , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was used as a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery to defend Venice . She continued in this role until the end of the war in November 1918 . The ship remained in the Italian Navy 's inventory for only a short time after the end of the war ; she was stricken from the naval register on 18 June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = Red @-@ tailed hawk = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis ) is a bird of prey , one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the " <unk> , " though it rarely preys on standard sized chickens . It breeds throughout most of North America , from western Alaska and northern Canada to as far south as Panama and the West Indies , and is one of the most common <unk> in North America . Red @-@ tailed hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range . There are fourteen recognized subspecies , which vary in appearance and range . It is one of the largest members of the genus Buteo in North America , typically weighing from 690 to 1 @,@ 600 g ( 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 5 lb ) and measuring 45 – 65 cm ( 18 – 26 in ) in length , with a wingspan from 110 – 145 cm ( 43 – 57 in ) . The red @-@ tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size , with females averaging about 25 % heavier than males . The bird is sometimes referred to as the red @-@ tail for short , when the meaning is clear in context . 
 The subspecies Harlan 's hawk ( B. j. harlani ) is sometimes considered a separate species ( B. harlani ) . 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes , including deserts , grasslands , coniferous and deciduous forests , agricultural fields and urban areas . It lives throughout the North American continent , except in areas of unbroken forest or the high arctic . It is legally protected in Canada , Mexico and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . 
 Because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters , the majority of hawks captured for falconry in the United States are red @-@ tails . Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks ( which have left the nest , are on their own , but are less than a year old ) so as to not affect the breeding population . Adults , which may be breeding or rearing chicks , may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so . Passage red @-@ tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed the adult behaviors which would make them more difficult to train .

 As is the case with many raptors , the red @-@ tailed hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size , as females are up to 25 % larger than males . As is typical in large raptors , frequently reported mean body mass for Red @-@ tailed Hawks are somewhat higher than expansive research reveals . Part of this weight is highly seasonally variable and due to clinal variation , male red @-@ tailed hawks may weigh from 690 to 1 @,@ 300 g ( 1 @.@ 52 to 2 @.@ 87 lb ) and in females between 900 and 2 @,@ 000 g ( 2 @.@ 0 and 4 @.@ 4 lb ) . However , research from nine studies occurring at migration sites in the United States and two breeding studies , one from the smallest race in Puerto Rico , the other from larger races in Wisconsin show that males weigh a mean of 837 g ( 1 @.@ 845 lb ) and females weigh a mean of 1 @,@ 040 @.@ 7 g ( 2 @.@ 294 lb ) , about 15 % lighter than prior species @-@ wide published weights . The heaviest surveyed weights came from migrants in Cape May , New Jersey , where females weighed a mean of 1 @,@ 278 g ( 2 @.@ 818 lb ) , males a mean of 990 @.@ 8 g ( 2 @.@ 184 lb ) . The lightest were from the breeding population in forest openings of Puerto Rico , where the females and males weighed an average of 1 @,@ 023 g ( 2 @.@ 255 lb ) and 795 g ( 1 @.@ 753 lb ) , respectively , also the highest size sexual dimorphism in the species . Size variation in body mass reveals that the red @-@ tailed hawks typically varies only a modest amount , racial variation in average weights of great horned owls show that mean body mass is nearly twice ( the heaviest race is about 36 % heavier than the lightest known race on average ) as variable as that of the hawk ( where the heaviest race is only just over 18 % heavier on average than the lightest ) . Males can reportedly measure 45 to 60 cm ( 18 to 24 in ) in total length , females measuring 48 to 65 cm ( 19 to 26 in ) long . The wingspan can range from 105 to 141 cm ( 41 to 56 in ) and , in the standard scientific method of measuring wing size , the wing chord is 325 @.@ 1 – 444 @.@ 5 mm ( 12 @.@ 80 – 17 @.@ 50 in ) long . The tail measures 188 to 258 @.@ 7 mm ( 7 @.@ 40 to 10 @.@ 19 in ) in length . The exposed culmen was reported to range from 21 @.@ 7 to 30 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 85 to 1 @.@ 19 in ) and the tarsus averaged 74 @.@ 7 – 95 @.@ 8 mm ( 2 @.@ 94 – 3 @.@ 77 in ) . The middle toe ( excluding talon ) can range from 38 @.@ 3 to 53 @.@ 8 mm ( 1 @.@ 51 to 2 @.@ 12 in ) , with the hallux @-@ claw ( the talon of the rear toe , which has evolved to be the largest in accipitrids ) measuring from 24 @.@ 1 to 33 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 95 to 1 @.@ 32 in ) in length . 
 Red @-@ tailed hawk plumage can be variable , depending on the subspecies and the region . These color variations are morphs , and are not related to molting . The western North American population , B. j. calurus , is the most variable subspecies and has three color morphs : light , dark , and intermediate or rufus . The dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10 – 20 % of the population . 
 Though the markings and hue vary across the subspecies , the basic appearance of the red @-@ tailed hawk is consistent . Overall , this species is blocky and broad in shape , often appearing ( and being ) heavier than other <unk> of similar length . A whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across the belly , formed by horizontal streaks in feather patterning , is present in most color variations . Especially in younger birds , the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting . The red tail , which gives this species its name , is uniformly brick @-@ red above and light buff @-@ orange below . The bill is short and dark , in the hooked shape characteristic of raptors , and the head can sometimes appear small in size against the thick body frame . They have a relatively short , broad tails and thick , chunky wings . The cere , the legs , and the feet of the red @-@ tailed hawk are all yellow . 
 Immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises . As the bird attains full maturity over the course of 3 – 4 years , the iris slowly darkens into a reddish @-@ brown hue . In both the light and dark morphs , the tail of the immature red @-@ tailed hawk is patterned with numerous darker bars . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk is a member of the genus Buteo , a group of medium @-@ sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings . Members of this genus are known as buzzards in Europe , but hawks in North America . 
 There are at least 14 recognized subspecies of Buteo jamaicensis , which vary in range and in coloration : 
 B. j. jamaicensis , the nominate subspecies , occurs in the northern West Indies , including Jamaica , Hispaniola , Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles but not the Bahamas or Cuba . El Yunque National Forest , Puerto Rico holds the highest known density of red @-@ tailed hawks anywhere . The bird is referred to as " <unk> " in the island . 
 B. j. alascensis breeds ( probably resident ) from southeastern coastal Alaska to the Queen Charlotte Islands and Vancouver Island in British Columbia . 
 B. j. borealis group ( eastern red @-@ tailed hawk ) breeds from southeast Canada and Maine south through eastern Texas and east to northern Florida . It winters from southern Ontario east to southern Maine and south to the Gulf coast and Florida . 
 B. j. calurus ( western red @-@ tailed hawk ) breeds from central interior Alaska , through western Canada south to Baja California . It winters from southwestern British Columbia southwest to Guatemala and northern Nicaragua . <unk> individuals of northern Mexico may lack the dark wing marking . 
 B. j. costaricensis is resident from Nicaragua to Panama . This subspecies is dark brown above with cinnamon flanks , wing linings and sides , and some birds have rufous underparts . The chest is much less heavily streaked than in northern migrants ( B. j. calurus ) to Central America . 
 B. j. <unk> ( southwestern red @-@ tailed hawk ) breeds from northern Chihuahua to southern Texas . It winters in Arizona , New Mexico , and southern Louisiana . The belly is unstreaked or only lightly streaked , and the tail is pale . 
 B. j. <unk> , Islas Marías , Mexico 
 B. j. <unk> , Mexican Highlands 
 B. j. harlani ( Harlan 's red @-@ tailed hawk , sometimes classified as its own species , B. harlani , Harlan 's hawk ) is markedly different from all other red @-@ tails . In both color morphs , the plumage is blackish and white , lacking warm tones ( save the tail ) . The tail may be reddish , dusky , whitish , or gray and can be longitudinally streaked , mottled , or barred . Shorter primaries result in wingtips that don 't reach the tail in perched birds . It breeds in Alaska and northwestern Canada and winters from Nebraska and Kansas to Texas and northern Louisiana . This population may well be a separate species . 
 B. j. <unk> is a dark subspecies resident from Chiapas to Nicaragua . The dark wing marking may not be distinct in paler birds . 
 B. j. <unk> ( Krider 's red @-@ tailed hawk ) is paler than other red @-@ tails , especially on the head ; the tail may be pinkish or white . In the breeding season , it occurs from southern Alberta , southern Saskatchewan , southern Manitoba , and extreme western Ontario south to south @-@ central Montana , Wyoming , western Nebraska , and western Minnesota . In winter , it occurs from South Dakota and southern Minnesota south to Arizona , New Mexico , Texas and Louisiana .

 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk is one of the most widely scattered hawks in the Americas . It breeds from central Alaska , the Yukon , and the Northwest Territories east to southern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada , and south to Florida , the West Indies , and Central America . The winter range stretches from southern Canada south throughout the remainder of the breeding range . 
 Its preferred habitat is mixed forest and field , with high bluffs or trees that may be used as perch sites . It occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes , including deserts , grasslands , coastal regions , mountains , foothills , coniferous and deciduous woodlands , tropical rainforests , agricultural fields and urban areas . It is second only to the peregrine falcon in the use of diverse habitats in North America . It lives throughout the North American continent , except in areas of unbroken forest or the high Arctic . 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk is widespread in North America , partially due to historic settlement patterns , which have benefited it . The clearing of forests in the Northeast created hunting areas , while the preservation of woodlots left the species with viable nest sites . The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the red @-@ tailed hawk as well as range expansions of many other species of birds . The construction of highways with utility poles alongside treeless medians provided perfect habitat for perch @-@ hunting . Unlike some other raptors , the red @-@ tailed hawk are seemingly unfazed by considerable human activity and can nest and live in close proximity to large numbers of humans . Thus , the species can also be found in cities , where common prey such as rock pigeons and brown rats may support their populations . One famous urban red @-@ tailed hawk , known as " Pale Male " , became the subject of a non @-@ fiction book , Red @-@ Tails in Love : A Wildlife Drama in Central Park , and is the first known red @-@ tail in decades to successfully nest and raise young in the crowded New York City borough of Manhattan . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 In flight , this hawk soars with wings often in a slight dihedral , flapping as little as possible to conserve energy . Active flight is slow and deliberate , with deep wing beats . In wind , it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains stationary above the ground . When soaring or flapping its wings , it typically travels from 32 to 64 km / h ( 40 mph ) , but when diving may exceed 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) . 
 = = = Vocalization = = = 
 The cry of the red @-@ tailed hawk is a two to three second hoarse , rasping scream , described as <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ar , that begins at a high pitch and slurs downward . This cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam whistle . The red @-@ tailed hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring , but vocalizes loudest in annoyance or anger , in response to a predator or a rival hawk 's intrusion into its territory . At close range , it makes a croaking " <unk> @-@ <unk> " . Young hawks may utter a wailing klee @-@ uk food cry when parents leave the nest . The fierce , screaming cry of the red @-@ tailed hawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows and other media , even if the bird featured is not a red @-@ tailed hawk . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk is carnivorous , and an opportunistic feeder . Its diet is mainly small mammals , but it also includes birds and reptiles . Prey varies with regional and seasonal availability , but usually centers on rodents , comprising up to 85 % of a hawk 's diet . Most commonly reported prey types include mice , including both native Peromyscus species and house mice ; gophers , voles , chipmunks , ground squirrels and tree squirrels . Additional prey ( listed by descending likelihood of predation ) include lagomorphs , shrews , bats , pigeons , quail , corvids , waterfowl , other raptors , reptiles , fish , crustaceans , insects and earthworms . Where found in Caribbean islands , red @-@ tailed hawks prey mostly on reptiles such as snakes and lizards , since these are perhaps the most predominant native land animals of that region . Prey specimens can range to as small a size as beetles and worms . However , they can also prey on marmots , white @-@ tailed jackrabbits , or female wild turkey , all of which are at least easily double the weight of most red @-@ tails . Although they prefer to feed on fresh prey they 've killed themselves , these hawks are not above occasionally consuming carrion . During winter in captivity , an average red @-@ tail will eat about 135 g ( 4 @.@ 8 oz ) daily . 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk commonly employs one of two hunting techniques . Often , they scan for prey activity from an elevated perch site , swooping down from the perch to seize the prey . They also watch for prey while flying , either capturing a bird in flight or pursuing prey on the ground until they can pin them down in their talons . Red @-@ tailed hawks , like some other raptors , have been observed to hunt in pairs . This may consist of stalking opposites sides of a tree , in order to surround a tree squirrel and almost inevitably drive the rodent to be captured by one after being flushed by the other hawk . They are opportunistically attracted to conspicuous meals , such as displaying male red @-@ winged blackbirds . 
 The great horned owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally to the red @-@ tail , taking similar prey . Competition may occur between the hawk and owl species during twilight , although the differing nesting season and activity times usually results in a lack of direct competition . Although the red @-@ tail 's prey is on average larger ( due in part to the scarcity of diurnal squirrels in the owl 's diet ) , the owl is an occasional predator of red @-@ tailed hawks themselves , of any age , while the hawks are not known to predate adult great horned owls . Other competitors include other large Buteo species such as Swainson 's hawks and rough @-@ legged hawks , as well as the northern goshawk , since prey and foraging methods of these species occasionally overlap . Hawks have been observed following American badgers to capture prey they flush and the two are considered potential competitors . Competition over carcasses may occur with American crows , and several crows working together can displace a hawk . Larger raptors , such as eagles and ferruginous hawks , may steal hawk kills . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk reaches sexual maturity at two years of age . It is monogamous , mating with the same individual for many years . In general , the red @-@ tailed hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies . The same nesting territory may be defended by the pair for years . During courtship , the male and female fly in wide circles while uttering shrill cries . The male performs aerial displays , diving steeply , and then climbing again . After repeating this display several times , he sometimes grasps her talons briefly with his own . Courtship flights can last 10 minutes or more . Copulation often follows courtship flight sequences , although copulation frequently occurs in the absence of courtship flights . 
 In copulation , the female , when perched , tilts forward , allowing the male to land with his feet lodged on her horizontal back . The female twists and moves her tail feathers to one side , while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female 's cloaca . Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre @-@ nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day . 
 In the same period , the pair constructs a stick nest in a large tree 4 to 21 m ( 13 to 69 ft ) off the ground or on a cliff ledge 35 m ( 115 ft ) or higher above the ground , or may nest on man @-@ made structures . The nest is generally 71 to 97 cm ( 28 to 38 in ) in diameter and can be up to 90 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) tall . The nest is constructed of twigs , and lined with bark , pine needles , corn cobs , husks , stalks , aspen catkins , or other plant lining matter . 
 Great horned owls compete with the red @-@ tailed hawk for nest sites . Each species has been known to kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other , but in general , both species nest in adjacent or confluent territories without conflict . Great horned owls are incapable of constructing nests and typically expropriate existing red @-@ tail nests . Great horned owls begin nesting behaviors much earlier than red @-@ tails , often as early as December . Red @-@ tails are therefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year 's nest has been overtaken by owls or otherwise lost . New nests are typically within a kilometer or less of the previous nest . Often , a new nest is only a few hundred meters or less from a previous one . Being a large predator , most predation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings , which are taken by owls , corvids and raccoons . 
 A clutch of one to three eggs is laid in March or April , depending upon latitude . Clutch size depends almost exclusively on the availability of prey for the adults . Eggs are laid approximately every other day . The eggs are usually about 60 mm × 47 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in × 1 @.@ 9 in ) . They are incubated primarily by female , with the male substituting when the female leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings . The male brings most food to the female while she incubates . After 28 to 35 days , the eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days ; the nestlings are altricial at hatching . The female broods them while the male provides most of the food to the female and the young , which are known as eyasses ( pronounced " EYE @-@ <unk> @-@ ez " ) . The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces . After 42 to 46 days , the eyasses begin to leave the nest . The fledging period follows , with short flights engaged in , after another 3 weeks . About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging , the young begin to capture their own prey . Shortly thereafter , when the young are around 4 months of age , they become independent of their parents . However , the hawks do not generally reach breeding maturity until they are around 3 years of age . In the wild , red @-@ tailed hawks have lived for at least 25 years , for example , Pale Male was born in 1990 , and in Spring 2014 is still raising eyasses . The oldest captive hawk of this species was at least 29 and a half years of age .

 = = = Use in falconry = = = 
 The red @-@ tailed hawk is a popular bird in falconry , particularly in the United States where the sport of falconry is tightly regulated and where red @-@ tailed hawks are both widely available and allowed to novice falconers . Red @-@ tailed hawks are highly <unk> and trainable , with a more social disposition than all other falcons or hawks other than the Harris 's hawk . They are also long lived and highly disease resistant , allowing a falconer to maintain a red @-@ tailed hawk as a hunting companion for many years . There are fewer than 5 @,@ 000 falconers in the United States , so despite their popularity any effect on the red @-@ tailed hawk population , estimated to be about one million in the United States , is negligible . 
 Not being as swift as falcons or accipiters , red @-@ tailed hawks are not the most effective of bird hawks and are usually used against ground game such as rabbits and squirrels . However , some individuals may learn to ambush birds on the ground with a swift surprise approach and capture them before they can accelerate to full speed and escape . Some have even learned to use a falcon @-@ like diving stoop to capture challenging game such as pheasants . In the course of a typical hunt , a falconer using a red @-@ tailed hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point . The falconer , who may be aided by a dog , then attempts to flush prey by stirring up ground cover . A well @-@ trained red @-@ tailed hawk will follow the falconer and dog , realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game . Once a raptor catches game , it does not bring it back to the falconer . Instead , the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey , " make in " ( carefully approach ) and trade the bird its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat .

 The feathers and other parts of the red @-@ tailed hawk are considered sacred to many American indigenous people and , like the feathers of the bald eagle and golden eagle , are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the regalia of many Native Americans in the United States ; these parts , most especially their distinctive tail feathers , are a popular item in the Native American community . As with the other two species , the feathers and parts of the red @-@ tailed hawk are regulated by the eagle feather law , which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds .

 Genesis was announced in early @-@ August 2005 on TNA 's official website . It was planned for November 13 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . This event caused a change in TNA 's PPV schedule , as the November 2004 PPV event was titled Victory Road . This was a small change as TNA intended to stick with the other names used for PPVs throughout 2005 . A promotional poster for the event was released prior by TNA featuring Jeff Hardy . TNA created a section covering the event on their website . A thirty @-@ minute pre @-@ show was slatted to take place prior to the telecast featuring two wrestling matches : Shark Boy versus the debuting Nigel McGuinness , and The Diamonds in the Rough ( David Young , Elix Skipper , and Simon Diamond ) versus Lance Hoyt and The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) . TNA promoted the debut of a newly signed wrestler to occur at Genesis , which the promotion called a " major acquisition . " Genesis was dedicated to World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Eddie Guerrero , who died the day of the event . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 Genesis featured seven professional wrestling matches and two pre @-@ show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at Genesis was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting the team of Rhino and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ; AMW ) . This match was promoted for Genesis by TNA on their official website , and later announced on the October 29 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! . The storyline behind this match began the October 1 episode of Impact ! , when Team 3D made their TNA debut . On the October 8 episode of Impact ! , AMW and Jarrett assaulted Team 3D to the point they were left covered in blood . Afterwards , Team 3D were not seen due to a scripted injury , with Jarrett , AMW , and Team Canada ( A @-@ 1 , Bobby Roode , Eric Young , Petey Williams , and Coach Scott D 'Amore ) hosting a segment where they buried Team 3D 's careers on the October 15 episode of Impact ! . Meanwhile , then @-@ NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jarrett was involved in a feud with Kevin Nash which was to lead to a title defense at TNA 's Bound for Glory PPV event on October 23 . However , Nash was rushed to the hospital the night before and was not cleared to wrestle . Rhino took Nash 's place in the match , where he defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship .

 = Izak catshark = 
 The Izak catshark ( or simply Izak , Holohalaelurus regani ) is a species of catshark , belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae , common off the coasts of South Africa and southern Namibia . It typically inhabits the outer continental shelf at depths of 100 – 300 m ( 330 – 980 ft ) , with the males found deeper than the females and juveniles . The Izak catshark has a short , wide , flattened head and a robust body tapering to a long , slender tail . It can be identified by its ornate color pattern of dark brown spots ( in juveniles ) or reticulations and blotches ( in adults ) on a light yellowish background , as well as by the enlarged dermal denticles over its pectoral fins and along its dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin . This species reaches 69 cm ( 27 in ) in length , with the males larger than females . 
 Bottom @-@ dwelling and perhaps relatively active in nature , the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a diverse array of bony fishes , crustaceans , and cephalopods . A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries . This species is oviparous , with females producing encapsulated eggs two at a time year @-@ round . The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery , but is discarded rather than utilized . Despite the fishing pressure , its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed it as Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Izak catshark was originally described by South African ichthyologist John Gilchrist in a 1922 fisheries survey report . He assigned the new species to the genus <unk> , and gave it the specific epithet regani in honor of fellow ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan . In 1934 , Henry Weed Fowler assigned this species to his newly created Holohalaelurus , a subgenus of Halaelurus . Holohalaelurus has since been elevated to the rank of full genus . As there do not appear to be any existing type specimens referable to Gilchrist 's account , in 2006 Brett Human designated a 63 cm ( 25 in ) long male caught in <unk> Bay as the species neotype . 
 Historically , there has been much confusion in the scientific literature between H. regani , H. punctatus , and H. <unk> , the last of which at various times had been considered a junior synonym of H. regani and was itself confounded with H. <unk> . Furthermore , two forms of H. regani were once recognized : the " Cape " or " typical " form and the " Natal " or " northeastern " form . The latter " northeastern " form was described as a separate species , H. <unk> , in 2006 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The body of the Izak catshark is firm and stout , tapering dramatically towards the tail . The head is very short , wide , and flattened , with a blunt snout . The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have thick ridges beneath ; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle . The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long , angular mouth . The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor , and lacks furrows at the corners . The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively ; each tooth is relatively large , with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1 – 2 smaller cusplets . There are five pairs of gill slits . 
 The pectoral fins are rather long and broad . The first dorsal fin originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases ; the second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over the rear of the anal fin base . The pelvic and anal fins are long and low , and larger than the dorsal fins . The free rear tips of the pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree , but never completely ; males have slender , pointed claspers . The caudal peduncle is long and thin , particularly in younger sharks . The caudal fin makes up one @-@ fourth to one @-@ fifth of the total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The thick skin is covered by well @-@ calcified dermal denticles , except around the gill slits . Enlarged , spike @-@ like denticles are found on the upper surface of the pectoral fins and along the dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin origin . Juvenile Izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background . The spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and U @-@ shaped markings in adults . The underside is plain white , with obvious black sensory pores beneath the head , body , and paired fins . Like other Holohalaelurus species , but contrary to the pattern in most cartilaginous fishes , males attain a much greater maximum length than females : 69 cm ( 27 in ) versus 52 cm ( 20 in ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Endemic to the southern tip of Africa , the range of the Izak catshark extends from Lüderitz , Namibia in the west to Durban , South Africa in the east . Older records further north along the East African coast ( e.g. Somalia ) most likely refer to other Holohalaelurus species . This abundant , bottom @-@ dwelling species inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope , from 40 m ( 130 ft ) to at least 1 @,@ 075 m ( 3 @,@ 527 ft ) deep . Off South Africa , it is most common in areas with a wider continental shelf , and at depths of 100 – 200 m ( 330 – 660 ft ) off the south coast and 200 – 300 m ( 660 – 980 ft ) off the west coast . Females and juveniles tend to be found in shallower water than males . For the most part , the number of sharks in a given area remains largely constant throughout the year . However , sharks at the southernmost point of the Agulhas Bank may perform a small autumn migration towards the shore . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Compared to other deep @-@ sea sharks , the Izak catshark has a large heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle . It is a generalist that feeds on a wide variety of bony fishes , crustaceans , and cephalopods ; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes . At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards , given the presence of fast @-@ moving , pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live . Polychaete worms , hydrozoans , gastropods , and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested . This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach . 
 The Izak catshark is oviparous and reproduction proceeds throughout the year without seasonal patterns . Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts ; a single egg matures within each oviduct at a time . Each egg is contained within a purse @-@ shaped capsule 3 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 7 in ) long and 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) across . The capsule is light brown with long tendrils at the four corners that likely serve to anchor it to rocks ; its surface has a velvet @-@ like texture and bears lengthwise striations . The rate of egg laying is unknown but thought to be high , based on this shark 's resilience to fishing pressure . The preponderance of females and juveniles at shallower depths may indicate that such waters serve as nursery areas . The young hatch at under 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) long . Males and females mature sexually at 45 – 50 cm ( 18 – 20 in ) and 40 – 45 cm ( 16 – 18 in ) long respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The Izak catshark is harmless and of no commercial value . It is regularly caught incidentally ( and discarded ) by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town . In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes , its numbers have been increasing in the presence of commercial fishing . The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate , its breeding in less @-@ fished shallower waters , its hardiness allowing for high post @-@ capture survival , and its opportunistic diet . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern , while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range . 
 = Alan Kippax = 
 Alan Falconer Kippax ( 25 May 1897 – 5 September 1972 ) was a cricketer for New South Wales ( NSW ) and Australia . Regarded as one of the great stylists of Australian cricket during the era between the two World Wars , Kippax overcame a late start to Test cricket to become a regular in the Australian team between the 1928 – 29 and 1932 – 33 seasons . A middle @-@ order batsman , he toured England twice , and at domestic level was a prolific scorer and a highly considered leader of NSW for eight years . To an extent , his Test figures did not correspond with his great success for NSW and he is best remembered for a performance in domestic cricket — a world record last wicket partnership , set during a Sheffield Shield match in 1928 – 29 . His career was curtailed by the controversial Bodyline tactics employed by England on their 1932 – 33 tour of Australia ; Kippax wrote a book denouncing the tactics after the series concluded . 
 Kippax was an " impeccably correct and elegant batsman , [ with ] an upright , easy stance at the wicket ; like his schoolboy idol Victor Trumper , he rolled his sleeves between wrist and elbow and excelled with the late cut " , who was probably at his peak during the 1920s . His omission from the 1926 team to tour England caused great controversy at the time — especially as he hit a brilliant 271 not out against Victoria on the eve of selection . Kippax was well into his thirties by the time he became a consistent selection for the Test team . Highly regarded by both fellow players and spectators , Kippax 's innings of 83 in the Lord 's Test of 1930 induced Neville Cardus to comment that , " he pleased the eye of the connoisseur all the time . " 
 = = Early years = = 
 The third son of Arthur Percival Howell Kippax and his wife Sophie Estelle ( née Craigie ) , Alan Kippax was born in the inner @-@ city Sydney suburb of Paddington . He attended both Bondi and Cleveland Street Public schools . At 14 , Kippax joined Waverley ( now Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club ) and was a regular in the first @-@ grade team within three years . At this stage , first @-@ class cricket was suspended because of World War I , but when competition resumed in the 1918 – 19 season he made his debut for New South Wales ( NSW ) . However , the state possessed a lot of batting talent , which was supplemented by the return to Australia of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team that played in England after the armistice . Therefore , Kippax ’ s opportunities were restricted for a number of seasons . He also played a lot of baseball with the Waverley Baseball Club ( usually at third base ) and represented Australia against touring teams from American universities . 
 Kippax ’ s cricketing potential did not go completely unnoticed . He was offered a tour of New Zealand in the autumn of 1921 . Playing in an Australian second team captained by the Test batsman Vernon Ransford , he made only two half @-@ centuries in nine innings . In the 1922 – 23 season , Kippax became a regular for NSW , scoring 631 runs at 90 @.@ 14 @.@ and led the side 's first @-@ class averages . The next season he hit 248 in only 316 minutes against South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) , then toured New Zealand with the NSW team skippered by Charlie Macartney . Kippax made two centuries in his 461 runs ( average 92 @.@ 2 ) on the tour . 
 He quickly won the respect of his fellow players and the spectators for his approach to the game . Alan McGilvray describes Kippax 's demeanour and presence on the field : 
 ... meticulous in his dress and his life , a man with a squeaky @-@ clean image who would never raise his voice or allow his emotions to run away with him ... His shirt would always be buttoned the same way , the crease would always be sharp in his trousers , no hair would ever be out of place . He was an admirable engaging man . 
 Journalists employed many superlatives to describe the Kippax style . Ray Robinson thought that Kippax 's batting " had a silky quality not seen in any other player of his time or since " ; he captivated the crowds with his late cut when he , " made a <unk> bow over the ball and stroked it away with the bat 's face downward , as if to squeeze the ball into the ground " . His favourite hook shot propelled the ball " with such unhurried ease that the punishing power of the stroke was revealed only in the way the ball smacked against the fence . " Donald Bradman believed him to be the best exponent of the hook shot in the game . 
 = = International career = = 
 Kippax began the 1924 – 25 summer with 115 for NSW against an Australian XI at the SCG . In the Sheffield Shield he had scores of 127 , 122 and 31 , 212 not out and 40 , earning him a first Australian cap ( at the age of 27 ) in the final Test of the Ashes series against England at Sydney . Sharing a 105 run partnership with Bill Ponsford in the first innings , Kippax impressed with a score of 42 from number seven . Wisden commented that the partnership " turned the fortunes of the game " , and Australia went on to victory . 
 = = = Shock omission = = = 
 Another 585 runs at 83 @.@ 57 in the 1925 – 26 season looked likely to win Kippax a place in the team to tour England in 1926 . He failed in the Test @-@ trial match staged in early December , but made the highest score of the Sheffield Shield competition , 271 not out ( in 423 minutes ) against Victoria at the SCG , which effectively steered NSW to the title . The subsequent omission of Kippax from the touring team is a famous blunder in Australian cricket history . Although Kippax was nearly 29 , former Australian captain Monty Noble called the non @-@ selection a " crime against the cricketing youth of Australia " . His omission is usually attributed to " interstate parochialism " and was a " triumph of dullness over batting artistry . " Australia surrendered the Ashes on the tour , with much of the blame for the loss directed at the team ’ s skipper , Herbie Collins . After he returned to Australia , administrators relieved Collins of the captaincy of his grade team and NSW , thus creating an opportunity for Kippax . 
 = = = Captain of NSW = = = 
 Installed as leader of NSW , Kippax earned a reputation as one of Australia ’ s leading batsmen over the next three years . His captaincy " welded with wit , kindness and some practical joking a raw team into a formidable unit , nurturing such youngsters as Archie Jackson , Stan McCabe and ( Sir ) Donald Bradman " . He hit a century in each innings against Queensland in their inaugural Sheffield Shield match in 1926 – 27 . The following season he registered the highest score of his career , 315 not out in 388 minutes versus Queensland at the SCG . Bradman wrote of this performance , " ... although they say Victor Trumper was even more beautiful to watch , it is hard to conceive more graceful batting than our skipper produced on that occasion . " Kippax ended the season with 926 runs at an average of 84 @.@ 18 . 
 The Test selectors still had Kippax under consideration and during March 1928 , he again toured New Zealand with an Australian second team , but failed to pass 40 in the seven innings he played . Restored to the Test team for the beginning of the 1928 – 29 Ashes series , Kippax made just 50 runs in four innings . Australia slipped to two heavy defeats and Kippax 's place was in jeopardy . 
 During the second Test at Sydney , Kippax was the central figure in the most controversial incident of the summer . Early in Australia ’ s first innings , Kippax had nine runs on the board , when : 
 According to George Hele , the umpire at the bowler ( Geary 's ) end , the latter delivered an <unk> ball just wide of Kippax ’ s legs . When the bails were seen to fall Hele refused an appeal for ‘ bowled ’ . [ English fieldsman Jack ] Hobbs , who had been at cover point , then appealed to Umpire Elder . Kippax at no time had left his crease . [ <unk> ] Duckworth had stepped to the leg side of the stumps to intercept the ball . The consensus of opinion is that it rebounded from one of his pads onto the wicket . Elder gave Kippax out ‘ bowled ’ , something he had no right to do from square @-@ leg . Kippax stood his ground for a time , disclosing later he left the wicket only because the persistent Hobbs had kept demanding , ‘ What sort of a sport are you to be standing here when you ’ re out ? ’ Vic Richardson tried to persuade his captain , Jack Ryder , to intercept Kippax before he crossed the incoming batsman and send him back . Ryder deliberated and <unk> till it was too late . Elder afterwards admitted his mistake to Hele . ‘ What have I done ? ’ he asked . 
 At the conclusion of the Test , Kippax travelled to Melbourne where he led NSW in a Sheffield Shield match beginning on 22 December . At stumps on the second day , NSW was staring at defeat as they were seven for 58 in pursuit of Victoria ’ s first innings of 376 . When play resumed on Christmas Day , NSW slipped to nine for 113 , with Kippax 20 not out . However , the number eleven batsman Hal Hooker stuck with his captain as the score gradually mounted and the opposition ’ s frustrations grew . 
 As news of the last @-@ wicket stand spread , the crowd swelled , eventually reaching almost 15 @,@ 000 . Kippax 's initial nervousness about his partner had disappeared , and most overs followed the same pattern - Kippax would crack as many as he could from the first two or three balls , and then happily take a single to leave Hooker to fend off the remaining four or five deliveries and paced his innings to perfection . 
 By the end of play , Kippax was well beyond his double century . The following day , when the stand was finally broken after 307 runs had been added in 304 minutes , Kippax stood on 260 not out . This " most remarkable of all world batting records , " still stands today as the highest last @-@ wicket partnership in first @-@ class cricket . 
 Retaining his place for the third Test that started just days later on the same ground , Kippax maintained his superb form and hit his maiden Test century in Australia ’ s first innings . With Australia struggling against the pace of England 's Harold Larwood , Kippax steadied the innings and then launched an assault on Larwood , hooking him for four boundaries . Journalist Ray Robinson pointed out that before Kippax ’ s flurry of fours , Larwood had taken 14 wickets at 18 @.@ 3 runs in the series . After , he managed only four wickets for 472 runs . Kippax followed up with 41 in the second innings , as Australia fell to their third consecutive defeat in the rubber and lost the Ashes . 
 Kippax completed the series with scores of 3 and 51 at Adelaide , and 38 and 28 in Australia ’ s only winning effort , at the MCG . He received criticism in that , " his play was too delicately tuned for the hard business of winning matches . " Nevertheless , Kippax had another outstanding domestic season in 1929 – 30 , hitting four centuries in his 744 runs , at an average of 62 . This time , he was one of the first picked to go to England . 
 = = = Test regular = = = 
 The 1930 tour of England was dominated by the emergence of Don Bradman . Kippax finished second to Bradman in the first @-@ class averages and aggregates , scoring 1451 runs at 58 @.@ 04 . He hit a century in each innings of the match with Sussex . In the Tests , Kippax passed fifty four times in seven innings , without going on to a hundred . He shared two big partnerships with Bradman : 192 in the second Test at Lord 's and 229 in the third Test at Leeds . However , Wisden rated his 64 not out on a wet wicket in the first Test at Nottingham as his best effort and summarised his tour thus : 
 Essentially a stylist , Kippax was in every sense a great batsman , for he could suit his game to the needs of the occasion . A beautiful driver to the off , he cut at times in delightful fashion , the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree . 
 In the 1930 – 31 home series against the West Indies , Kippax began with what was to be his highest score in Test cricket ( 146 in under four hours ) in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval . This was the first Test century in matches between the two teams . He made 84 in the third Test at Brisbane , sharing a partnership of 193 with Bradman . However , Wisden called Kippax ’ s knock " unsteady " and he failed in his remaining three Test innings . For NSW , he hit two centuries in the Sheffield Shield . 
 The next season began badly for Kippax . Playing in a minor match at Parkes ( in rural NSW ) on a matting wicket , he had his nose broken by a delivery that bounced erratically — it hit a peg accidentally left under the mat when it was laid out . On 6 November 1931 , during NSW ’ s first match of the season at Brisbane , he was struck a severe blow to the temple by a rising ball from fast bowler Pud Thurlow . Taken to hospital , he retired from the match , but was selected for the first Test against South Africa , but scored only one run . He missed the second Test through injury , while his replacement Keith Rigg scored an impressive century on debut . 
 Kippax came back for the third Test at Melbourne and rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring 52 and 67 , his two highest first @-@ class innings of the season . However , his best knock of the summer came on another rain @-@ affected pitch at Melbourne in the final Test . He batted " serenely " to top score with an elegant 42 . The entire South Africa team only managed 36 and 45 in their two completed innings on a " treacherous " wicket . As compensation for his lack of runs , Kippax led NSW to victory over Victoria in late January , which clinched the Sheffield Shield title for the state . During the winter of 1932 , Kippax joined a private team that toured Canada and the USA , a tour organised by ex @-@ Test bowler Arthur Mailey . Teammates noticed that his confidence was shaken by the blows to the head , and he no longer employed his famous hook shot . 
 = = = Bodyline series = = = 
 England toured during the 1932 – 33 season , and played the infamous " Bodyline " series . While the tactic of using short @-@ pitched bowling and close @-@ in fielders on the leg side was originally conceived to stop Don Bradman ’ s phenomenal run @-@ making , Bodyline was used against all the Australian batsmen . Kippax and the other Australian batsmen were adept at playing long innings and supporting Bradman in big partnerships — in Tests , Kippax had , in the past , featured in three stands of over 100 with Bradman — so the English were looking to undermine his confidence as well . 
 Kippax secured his Test place with 179 against Queensland at the Gabba in mid @-@ November 1932 . A fortnight later , he led NSW against the tourists and failed in both innings as his side suffered a heavy defeat . Selected for the first Test at Sydney , Kippax looked very uncomfortable in losing his wicket twice to the spearhead of the Bodyline attack , Harold Larwood . After batting at number four in the first innings , Kippax was demoted to bat behind his NSW understudy Stan McCabe in the second innings ; McCabe had scored a brilliant 187 not out in the first innings , defying Bodyline with aggressive hook shots . Irrespective of the change , Australia collapsed for 164 , leaving England needing just one run for victory in their second innings . In the dressing room , Kippax commented of Larwood , " he 's too bloody fast for me " . 
 Omitted from the remainder of the series , Kippax became the first of several Australian batting " casualties " during the summer . While most sympathised with his misfortune , and attributed his lack of confidence to the blows he received the previous season , Larwood was more succinct : " Kippax was scared stiff and he let you see it " . Employed as a radio commentator , Kippax spent the remainder of the series covering the Tests , and he also delivered a ten @-@ minute round up of each day ’ s play for the BBC , broadcast in England through its Empire short wave service . 
 Outspoken in his criticism of Bodyline , Kippax combined with the cricketer and physician Eric Barbour to write the book Anti Body @-@ Line , released just months after the tour ended . A short , polemical work aimed at an English readership , the book warned of the danger to the game if Bodyline was allowed as a legitimate tactic . Although the book kept the controversy raging , it was " calmly expressed ’ and " reasonable " . 
 After several seasons of struggling for runs , Kippax returned to form in 1933 – 34 . Against Queensland at New Year , he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135 minutes with Bradman . Altogether , he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England . Passed over for the vice @-@ captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman , Kippax had the confidence of knowing that the Australian Board of Control had reached an agreement with the MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour . 
 = = = Final tour = = = 
 Beginning the tour with a duck , Kippax recovered with 89 at Leicester before contracting a heavy dose of influenza that forced him to miss the next four matches . On his return , he struggled for form , and was not chosen for the first Test . Kippax was the third selector on tour , and was out @-@ voted by his fellow selectors , so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team . Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches , so he missed out on the next Test at Lord 's , which was lost . 
 Struck down by serious illness again , Kippax was hospitalised with a ( wrongly ) suspected case of diphtheria and forced to miss the drawn Tests at Old Trafford and Leeds . Eventually , he returned to play in late July and hit form at the right time . With the series locked at one @-@ all , and a timeless Test to be played at The Oval to decide the Ashes , Australia needed to strengthen the batting . The experienced Kippax replaced the struggling youngster Len Darling in the middle order , for what proved to be his last Test . 
 The way the game unfolded , Kippax had little responsibility with the bat . A record partnership of 451 between Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman meant that Australia was four for 574 by the time he got to the crease . Kippax made 28 in just under an hour as Australia amassed 701 runs . He scored just 8 in the second innings , but Australia were victorious by 562 runs and regained the Ashes . Six days later , Kippax celebrated by making 250 against the Sussex bowling attack , his highest score in England and his first double century for more than five years . This boosted his first @-@ class above 50 on what had been a tour of mixed fortunes . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 On the team 's return from England , Kippax handed the NSW captaincy to Test teammate Bert Oldfield , and ended his first @-@ class career with four Sheffield Shield matches for the state . His last century came in mid @-@ December 1934 , when he scored 139 against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval . This gave Kippax a total of 32 centuries for NSW , a record tally , subsequently beaten only by Michael Bevan . His 6 @,@ 096 runs ( at 70 @.@ 06 ) for NSW in Sheffield Shield matches contributed to five title @-@ winning campaigns . In addition to his 12 @,@ 792 first @-@ class runs , Kippax scored over 7 @,@ 000 runs at an average of 53 for his grade club Waverley . Don Bradman summed up Kippax 's place in Australian cricket during his career : 
 This beautiful and stylish player was unlucky to emerge on the horizon of big cricket at a time when NSW had virtually an international side for its State XI . When his opportunity did come , Alan proved a real stalwart . In addition , his <unk> style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys . Unquestionably , the line of Trumper and Kippax has much to do with the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States . 
 Kippax captained NSW in 45 first @-@ class matches , winning 19 , drawing 17 and losing only nine . His commentary of the fourth Test at Adelaide in early 1937 via a radio @-@ telephone service made history as the first direct radio broadcast of a cricket match from Australia to England . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 After a period working as a clerk , Kippax opened a sports store in Martin Place , Sydney during 1926 . It became a very profitable business . Two years later , on 20 April 1928 at St Stephen 's Presbyterian Church , he married Mabel Charlotte Catts . The New South Wales Cricket Association elected him a life member in 1943 – 44 . In February 1949 , Kippax was awarded a joint testimonial with his old teammate , wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield . Played between Lindsay Hassett ’ s XI and Arthur Morris ’ s XI at the SCG , the match raised ₤ 6 @,@ 030 , which was split evenly between Kippax and Oldfield . In later years , Kippax was an A @-@ grade golfer at The Lakes course in Sydney and a club champion lawn bowler at Double Bay . 
 A " ... small , gentle man with a kindly way about him " , Kippax enjoyed a great reputation within the game ; he was " a man of personal charm " . He was as elegant off the field as he was on ; the cricket writer David Frith recorded that , " to visit him in his Bellevue Hill home was to be transported into a calm 1930s world of silk smoking jacket , cigarette holder and art deco trimmings . " Kippax died of heart disease at his home in Bellevue Hill on 5 September 1972 . The Kippax Centre in the Canberra suburb of Holt is named after him . 
 He was an uncle of the renowned theatre critic H. G. Kippax . 
 = Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha = 
 Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha and Edinburgh GCStJ CI VA RRC ( 25 November 1876 – 2 March 1936 ) was the third child and second daughter of Alfred , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia . She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria as well as of Tsar Alexander II of Russia . 
 Born a British princess , Victoria spent her early life in England and lived in Malta for three years , where her father was serving in the Royal Navy . In 1889 the family moved to Coburg , where Victoria 's father became the reigning duke in 1893 . In her teens Victoria fell in love with her maternal first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia , but the disapprobation of marriage between first cousins of his faith , Orthodox Christianity , discouraged their romance . Instead , bowing to family pressure , Victoria married in 1894 a paternal first cousin , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse , following the wishes of their shared grandmother , Queen Victoria . Their marriage was a failure . Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901 . The couple 's only child , Princess Elisabeth , died of typhoid fever in 1903 . 
 Victoria married Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905 . They wed without the formal approval of Britain 's King Edward VII , required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 , and in defiance of Tsar Nicholas II . In retaliation , the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honours , also initially banishing the couple from Russia . They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909 . In 1910 they moved to Russia , where Nicholas recognized her as Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna . After the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917 , they escaped to Finland where she gave birth to her only son . In exile they lived for some years among her relatives in Germany , and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint @-@ Briac . In 1926 , Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile and Victoria supported her husband 's claims . Victoria died after suffering a stroke while visiting her daughter Maria in <unk> . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Victoria was born on 25 November 1876 in San Anton Palace in Attard , Malta , hence her second name , Melita . Her father , who was stationed on the island as an officer in the Royal Navy , was Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , the second son of Queen Victoria . Her mother was Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna , the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse . 
 As a grandchild of the British monarch , she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Edinburgh . Within her family , she was always known as " Ducky " . At the time of her birth , she was 10th in the line of succession to the British throne . The princess was christened on 1 January 1877 at San Antonio Palace by a Royal Navy chaplain . Her godparents included her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria , who was represented by a proxy . 
 After the Duke ’ s service in Malta was over they returned to England where the family lived for the next few years . They divided their time between Eastwell Park , their country home in Kent , and Clarence House , their residence in London facing Buckingham Palace . Eastwell , a large estate of 2 @,@ 500 acres near Ashford , with its forest and park was the children 's favorite residence . In January 1886 , shortly after Princess Victoria turned nine , the family left England when her father was appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Mediterranean naval squadron , based on Malta . For the next three years , the family lived at the San Anton Palace in Malta , Victoria 's birthplace . 
 The marriage of her parents was unhappy . The Duke was taciturn , unfaithful , prone to drinking and emotionally detached from his family . Victoria 's mother was independent @-@ minded and cultured . Although she was unsentimental and strict , the Duchess was a devoted mother and the most important person in her children 's lives . As a child , Victoria had a difficult temperament . She was shy , serious and sensitive . In the judgment of her sister Marie : " This passionate child was often misunderstood . " Princess Victoria Melita was talented at drawing and painting and learned to play the piano . She was particularly close to Marie . The two sisters would remain very close throughout their lives . They contrasted in appearance and personality . Victoria was dark and moody while Marie was blond and easy @-@ going . Although she was one year younger , Victoria was taller and seemed to be the older of the two . 
 = = Youth in Coburg = = 
 As a son of Queen Victoria 's deceased prince consort , Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , Victoria Melita 's father , Prince Alfred , was in the line of succession to Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , the sovereign German duchy ruled by Albert 's elder brother , Ernest II , until his death in 1893 . Alfred became heir presumptive to the duchy when his older brother , the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , deferred his Saxon succession rights in favour of his younger brothers . Alfred and his family therefore moved to Coburg in 1889 . Their mother immediately began attempting to " Germanise " her daughters by installing a new governess , buying them plain clothing , and having them confirmed in the German Lutheran church , even though they had previously been raised as Anglicans . The children rebelled and some of the new restrictions were eased . Victoria 's ties to the British royal family were nonetheless emphasised when she served as a bridesmaid at the 1893 wedding of Prince George , Duke of York , and Princess Mary of Teck . 
 The teenage Victoria was a " tall , dark girl , with violet eyes ... with the assuredness of an Empress and the high spirits of a tomboy , " according to one observer . Victoria had " too little chin to be conventionally beautiful , " in the opinion of one of her biographers , but " she had a good figure , deep blue eyes , and dark complexion . " In 1891 , Victoria travelled with her mother to the funeral of Grand Duchess Alexandra <unk> of Russia , the wife of her mother 's brother Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich . There Victoria met her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich . Although the two were deeply attracted to each other , Victoria 's mother was reluctant to allow her to marry him because the Russian Orthodox faith forbids the marriage of first cousins . She was also suspicious of the morality of the Romanov men . When her teenage daughters were impressed by their handsome cousins , their mother warned them against the Russian grand dukes who did not make good husbands . 
 Soon after her sister Marie was married to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania , a search was made for a suitable husband for Victoria . Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle in the autumn of 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse , heir to the grand ducal throne of Hesse . Both were artistic and fun loving , got along well and even shared a birthday . The Queen , observing this , was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry . 
 = = Grand Duchess of Hesse = = 
 Eventually , Victoria and Ernst bowed to their families ' pressure and married on 9 April 1894 at Schloss Ehrenburg in Coburg . The wedding was a large affair , with most of the royal families of Europe attending , including Queen Victoria , the Empress Frederick , Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Prince of Wales . Victoria was now titled The Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine . Her wedding is also significant since at the same time the official engagement of the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Ernst 's younger sister , Alix , was proclaimed . Together Victoria and Ernst had two children , a daughter , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , whom they nicknamed Ella , born on 11 March 1895 , and a stillborn son , born on 25 May 1900 . 
 Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible . Victoria despaired of her husband 's lack of affection towards her , while Ernst devoted much of his attention to their daughter , whom he adored . Elisabeth , who physically resembled her mother , preferred the company of her father to Victoria . Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends . Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty " was old and out . " Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished . Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals as well as those who enjoyed fun and frolic . Victoria 's cousin Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark remembered one stay there as " the jolliest , merriest house party to which I have ever been in my life . " 
 Victoria was , however , less enthusiastic about fulfilling her public role . She avoided answering letters , put off visits to elderly relations whose company she did not enjoy , and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring . Victoria 's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst . The young couple had loud , physical fights . The volatile Victoria shouted , threw tea trays , smashed china against the wall , and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments . Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard @-@ to @-@ control stallion named Bogdan . While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II , Victoria 's affection for Kirill was also rekindled . She enjoyed flirting with him at the balls and celebrations that marked the coronation . 
 = = Divorce = = 
 Her marriage to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897 , when Victoria returned home from a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst in bed with a male servant . She did not make her accusation public , but told a niece that " no boy was safe , from the stable hands to the kitchen help . He slept quite openly with them all . " Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan , her chargé d 'affaires , but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter , Elisabeth . Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and , when Queen Victoria died in January 1901 , significant opposition to the end of the marriage was removed . The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901 . Ernst , who had at first resisted the divorce , came to believe it was the only possible step . " Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad , " Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg . " For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless . I only tried for her sake . If I had not loved her so , I would have given it up long ago . " Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was . " Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage , it had been a failure ... [ T ] heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart . " The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe . Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than " the general disgrace of a divorce . " 
 After her divorce , Victoria went to live with her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera . She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth , who spent six months of each year with each parent . Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a difficult time reconnecting with her daughter . Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa , crying , before one visit to her mother . Ernst assured the child that her mother loved her too . Elisabeth responded , " Mama says she loves me , but you do love me . " Ernst remained silent and didn 't correct the child 's impression . Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge . The doctor advised the Tsar 's family to notify the child 's mother of her illness , but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram . Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the child 's death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside . At Elisabeth 's funeral , Victoria removed her Hessian Order , a medallion , and placed it on her daughter 's coffin as a final gesture " that she had made a final break with her old home . " 
 = = Remarriage = = 
 After Victoria 's divorce from Ernst , Grand Duke Kirill , whom Victoria had seen on all her subsequent visits to Russia , was discouraged by his parents from trying to keep a close relationship with her . Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else . A few months later , war broke out between Russia and Japan . As a senior member of the navy , Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo @-@ Japanese War . His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors . Sent home to recover , the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria . The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirill 's determination to marry Victoria . " To those over whom the shadow of death has passed , life has a new meaning , " Kirill wrote in his memoirs . " It is like daylight . And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life . Nothing would cheat me of it now . I had gone through much . Now , at last , the future lay radiant before me . " 
 The couple married on 8 October 1905 in Tegernsee . It was a simple ceremony , with Victoria 's mother , her sister Beatrice , and a friend , Count <unk> , in attendance , along with servants . The couple 's uncle Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia was invited , without being told the reason , but did not arrive until after the ceremony . Tsar Nicholas II responded to the marriage by stripping Kirill of his imperial allowance and expelling him from the Russian navy . The Tsarina was outraged at her former sister @-@ in @-@ law and said she would never receive Victoria , " a woman who had behaved so disgracefully " , or Kirill . The couple retired to Paris , where they purchased a house off the Champs @-@ Élysées and lived off the income provided by their parents . 
 Victoria , who had matured as she entered her 30s , decided to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1907 , a decision that thrilled both her mother and her husband . That same year the first of their three children , Maria <unk> , was born . She was named after her grandmother and nicknamed " Masha . " Their second daughter , Kira <unk> , was born in Paris in 1909 . Victoria and Kirill , who had hoped for a son , were disappointed to have a girl , but named their daughter after her father . 
 = = Grand Duchess of Russia = = 
 Nicholas II reinstated Kirill after deaths in the Russian imperial family promoted Kirill to third in the line of succession to the Russian throne . Kirill and Victoria were allowed in Russia , Victoria was granted the title of Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna and in May 1910 , the couple arrived in St Petersburg . The new grand duchess enjoyed entertaining at evening dinners and lavish balls attended by the cream of Saint Petersburg society . Victoria had an artistic talent that she applied to home decoration in her several elaborate residences which she arranged attractively . She decorated , gardened , and rode and also enjoyed painting , particularly watercolors . 
 Victoria fit in within the Russian aristocracy and the circle of her mother @-@ in @-@ law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna . As French was frequently spoken in high circles , Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language . Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II , on her mother 's side , and to Empress Alexandra , on her father 's side , the relationship with them was neither close nor warm . As Kirill became a keen auto racer , the couple often took trips by car : a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces . Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days , and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother in the south of France or in Coburg . Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters , Maria and Kira . The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out . 
 = = War = = 
 During World War I , Victoria worked as a Red Cross nurse and organized a motorized ambulance unit that was known for its efficiency . Victoria frequently visited the front near Warsaw and she occasionally carried out her duties under enemy fire . Kirill , for his part , was also in Poland , assigned to the naval department of Admiral <unk> , member of the staff of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich , commander in chief of the Russian army . Kirill and Victoria had always shared their relatives ' distaste for the Tsar and Tsarina 's friendship with the starets Grigori Rasputin . The Tsarina believed Rasputin healed her son of his hemophiliac attacks with his prayers . Victoria told her sister , Queen Marie of Romania , that the Tsar 's court was " looked upon as a sick man refusing every doctor and every help . " 
 When Rasputin was murdered in December 1916 , Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other relatives asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , one of those implicated in the murder . The Tsar denied their request . Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania , where her sister Marie was now queen , volunteering aid for war victims . Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917 . Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards , quartered in Saint Petersburg , so he could be with his family for some time . Although publicly loyal to the Tsar , Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss the best way to save the monarchy . 
 = = Revolution = = 
 At the end of the " February Revolution " of 1917 , Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and political turmoil followed . Victoria wrote to Queen Marie of Romania in February 1917 that their home was surrounded by a mob , " yet heart and soul we are with this movement of freedom which at the time probably signs our own death warrant ... We personally are losing all , our lives changed at one blow and yet we are almost leading the movement . " By March 1917 , the revolution had spread all over Petrograd ( Saint Petersburg ) . During this period Victoria , almost 41 years old , discovered she was again pregnant , which worried her because of her previous miscarriages and difficult pregnancies . 
 Kirill led his naval unit to the Provisional Government on 14 March 1917 , which was obliged to share headquarters with the new Petrograd Soviet , and swore loyalty to its leadership , hoping to restore order and preserve the monarchy . It was an action which later provoked criticism from some members of the family , who viewed it as treason . Victoria supported her husband and felt he was doing the right thing . She also sympathized with the people who wanted to reform the government . Kirill was forced to resign his command of the Naval Guards , but nevertheless his men remained faithful and they continued to guard Kirill and Victoria 's palace on Glinka Street . Close to despair Victoria wrote to her sister Marie of Romania that they had " neither pride nor hope , nor money , nor future , and the dear past blotted out by the frightful present ; nothing is left , nothing . " 
 Anxious for their safety Kirill and Victoria decided that the best thing to do was to leave Russia . They chose Finland as the best possible place to go . Although a territory of the Russian Empire , Finland possessed its own government and constitution , so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time . They had already been once invited to <unk> , a beautiful estate , near <unk> , a small town on the south coast of Finland , not far away from Helsinki . The Provisional Government permitted them to leave , though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them . They sewed jewels into the family 's clothing , hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities . They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917 . 
 = = Exile = = 
 After two weeks in <unk> , the family moved to a rented house in Porvoo where , in August 1917 , Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir <unk> of Russia , her only son and the heir to the dynasty . The family remained in Finland , a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule , which had declared its independence in December 1917 . They hoped that the White Russians would prevail . They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family . In July 1918 , Victoria wrote to her first cousin , Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden , begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir . She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs . 
 She pleaded with her cousin , George V , to help the White Russians retake the country . In a letter to the King , Lord Acton , the British Minister in Helsinki , noted the toll the revolution had taken on Victoria . She " looked aged and battered and has lost much of her beauty , which is not astonishing considering all that she has gone through . " 
 After more than two years living under strained conditions in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany . In Munich they were reunited with Victoria 's mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919 . With the death of Victoria 's mother , she inherited her villa , Chateau <unk> in Nice and her residence in Coburg , the Edinburg Palais . In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places . 
 While in Germany , Victoria showed an interest in the Nazi Party , which appealed to her because of its anti @-@ Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy . She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party . She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party . 
 = = Claims to the Russian throne = = 
 Kirill suffered a nervous breakdown in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health . She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming Tsar . At Saint @-@ Briac Kirill , aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son , officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924 . Victoria went on a trip to the United States in 1924 , hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy . Her efforts evoked little response , due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s . She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork to raise money for the household . 
 By the mid @-@ 1920s , Victoria worried over the prospects of her children . Maria , her eldest daughter married the head of one of Germany 's mediatized families , Karl , Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925 , Victoria ’ s 49th birthday . Victoria was at her daughter 's bedside when she gave birth to her first child , Emich Kirill , in 1926 ( father of claimant to the Russian throne , Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen ) . She also attended the subsequent births of Maria 's children . 
 In the mid @-@ 1920s the German government established relations with Moscow and the presence of Kirill and his wife , pretenders to the Russian throne , became an embarrassment . Although the Bavarian government rejected pressures to expel the Russian claimant , Kirill and Victoria decided to establish their permanent residence in France . In the summer of 1926 they moved to Saint @-@ Briac on the Breton coast , where they had spent their summer vacations before . The remoteness of Brittany provided both privacy and security . They bought a large house on the outskirts of the town and gave it a Breton name , Ker <unk> , Villa Victoria . The resort town of Saint @-@ Briac was a favorite spot for retired British citizens who wanted to live well on a limited income . Victoria made friends among the Britons as well as the French and other foreign residents of the town . Though at first her manner could seem haughty , residents soon discovered that Victoria was more approachable than her husband . Their friends treated them with deference , <unk> or calling them by their imperial titles . They lived a secluded country life , finding it more agreeable than at Coburg . 
 Victoria was exceedingly protective of her son Vladimir , upon whom her hopes for the future rested . She would not let him attend school because she was worried about his safety , and because she wanted him to be brought up as Romanov grand dukes were prior to the revolution . Instead , she hired a tutor for him . She also refused to let him be educated for a future career . In return for her devotion , Vladimir loved and respected his mother . " We adored our parents and their love for us was infinite , " Vladimir wrote after their deaths . " All the hardships and bitterness we had to endure in the years were fully covered by our mutual love . We were proud of ( them . ) " 
 = = Last years = = 
 In Saint @-@ Briac , during the summer , Kirill played golf and he and Victoria joined in picnics and excursions . They were part of the social life of the community , going out to play bridge and organizing theatricals . During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games . However , it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris " for the occasional fling " . Victoria , who had devoted her life to Kirill , was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her , according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania . She kept up a façade for the sake of her children , including her teenage son Vladimir , but was unable to forgive Kirill 's betrayal . Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild , <unk> of Leiningen , in February 1936 . Family and friends arrived , but nothing could be done . When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come , to which Victoria haltingly replied , " It makes all the difference . " However , she " shuddered away from Kirill 's touch , " wrote Marie . She died on 1 March 1936 . Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death : " The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination , a tragic end to a tragic life . She carried tragedy within her – she had tragic eyes – always – even as a little girl – but we loved her enormously , there was something mighty about her – she was our Conscience . " 
 Victoria was buried in the ducal family mausoleum at Friedhof am <unk> in Coburg , until her remains were transferred to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1995 . Her husband was intensely lonely after her death . The marriage of their daughter , Kira , to Louis Ferdinand , Prince of Prussia , in 1938 was a bright spot for Kirill , who saw it as the joining of two dynasties . However , Kirill died just two years after his wife . Kirill , though he had been unfaithful , still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together . " There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul , mind , and body , " he wrote . " She had it all , and more . Few there are who are fortunate in having such a woman as the partner of their lives -- I was one of those privileged . "

 = Death of Adolf Hitler = 
 Adolf Hitler killed himself by gunshot on 30 April 1945 in his Führerbunker in Berlin . His wife Eva ( née Braun ) committed suicide with him by taking cyanide . That afternoon , in accordance with Hitler 's prior instructions , their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker 's emergency exit , doused in petrol , and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker . Records in the Soviet archives show that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 , when they were again exhumed , cremated , and the ashes scattered . 
 Accounts differ as to the cause of death ; one states that he died by poison only and another that he died by a self @-@ inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule . Contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions . One eye @-@ witness recorded that the body showed signs of having been shot through the mouth , but this has been proven unlikely . There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments which were recovered . In 2009 , American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler 's . The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old . The jaw fragments which had been recovered were not tested .

 By early 1945 , Germany 's military situation was on the verge of total collapse . Poland had fallen to the advancing Soviet forces , who were preparing to cross the Oder between <unk> and Frankfurt with the objective of capturing Berlin , 82 kilometres ( 51 mi ) to the west . German forces had recently lost to the Allies in the Ardennes Offensive , with British and Canadian forces crossing the Rhine into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr . American forces in the south had captured Lorraine and were advancing towards Mainz , Mannheim , and the Rhine . In Italy , German forces were withdrawing north , as they were pressed by the American and Commonwealth forces as part of the Spring Offensive to advance across the Po and into the foothills of the Alps . In parallel to the military actions , the Allies had met at Yalta between 4 – 11 February to discuss the conclusion of the war in Europe . 
 Hitler , presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich , retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 . To the Nazi leadership , it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war in Europe . Some 325 @,@ 000 soldiers of Germany 's Army Group B were surrounded and captured on 18 April , leaving the path open for American forces to reach Berlin . By 11 April the Americans crossed the Elbe , 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) to the west of the city . On 16 April , Soviet forces to the east crossed the Oder and commenced the battle for the Seelow Heights , the last major defensive line protecting Berlin on that side . By 19 April the Germans were in full retreat from Seelow Heights , leaving no front line . Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April ( Hitler 's birthday ) . By the evening of 21 April , Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city . 
 At the afternoon situation conference on 22 April , Hitler suffered a total nervous collapse when he was informed that the orders he had issued the previous day for SS @-@ General Felix Steiner 's Army Detachment Steiner to move to the rescue of Berlin had not been obeyed . Hitler launched a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders , culminating in a declaration — for the first time — that the war was lost . Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end , and then shoot himself . Later that day he asked SS physician Dr. Werner Haase about the most reliable method of suicide . Haase suggested the " pistol @-@ and @-@ poison method " of combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to the head . When head of the Luftwaffe Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring learned about this , he sent a telegram to Hitler asking for permission to take over the leadership of the Reich in accordance with Hitler 's 1941 decree naming Göring his successor . Hitler 's influential secretary , Martin Bormann , convinced Hitler that Göring was threatening a coup . In response , Hitler informed Göring that he would be executed unless he resigned all of his posts . Later that day , he sacked Göring from all of his offices and ordered his arrest . 
 By 27 April , Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany . Secure radio communications with defending units had been lost ; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information . On 28 April , a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up ; a copy of the message was given to Hitler . The report stated that Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies ; the offer had been declined . Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender ; Hitler considered this treason . During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler . Hitler ordered Himmler 's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein ( Himmler 's SS representative at Hitler 's headquarters in Berlin ) shot . 
 By this time , the Red Army had advanced to the <unk> , and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Chancellery . This report , combined with Himmler 's treachery , prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life . After midnight on 29 April , Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker . Afterwards Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife . Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament . He signed these documents at 04 : 00 and then retired to bed ( some sources say Hitler dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding , but all sources agree on the timing of the signing ) . 
 During the course of 29 April , Hitler learned of the death of his ally , Benito Mussolini , who had been executed by Italian partisans . Mussolini 's body and that of his mistress , Clara Petacci , had been strung up by their heels . The bodies were later cut down and thrown in the gutter , where vengeful Italians reviled them . It is probable that these events strengthened Hitler 's resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be made " a spectacle of " , as he had earlier recorded in his Testament . That afternoon , Hitler expressed doubts about the cyanide capsules he had received through Himmler 's SS . To verify the capsules ' potency , Hitler ordered Dr. Werner Haase to test one on his dog , Blondi , and the animal died as a result . 
 = = Suicide = = 
 Hitler and Braun lived together as husband and wife in the bunker for fewer than 40 hours . By 01 : 00 on 30 April General Wilhelm Keitel reported that all forces which Hitler had been depending on to come to the rescue of Berlin had either been encircled or forced onto the defensive . Late in the morning of 30 April , with the Soviets less than 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) from the bunker , Hitler had a meeting with General Helmuth Weidling , commander of the Berlin Defence Area , who told him that the garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night and that the fighting in Berlin would inevitably come to an end within the next 24 hours . Weidling asked Hitler for permission for a breakout , a request he had made unsuccessfully before . Hitler did not answer , and Weidling went back to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock . At about 13 : 00 he received Hitler 's permission to try a breakout that night . Hitler , two secretaries , and his personal cook then had lunch , after which Hitler and Braun said farewell to members of the Führerbunker staff and fellow occupants , including Bormann , Joseph Goebbels and his family , the secretaries , and several military officers . At around 14 : 30 Adolf and Eva Hitler went into Hitler 's personal study . 
 Several witnesses later reported hearing a loud gunshot at around 15 : 30 . After waiting a few minutes , Hitler 's valet , Heinz Linge , with Bormann at his side , opened the study door . Linge later stated he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds , a common observation made in the presence of prussic acid , the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide . Hitler 's adjutant , SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche , entered the study and found the lifeless bodies on the sofa . Eva , with her legs drawn up , was to Hitler 's left and slumped away from him . Günsche stated that Hitler " ... sat ... sunken over , with blood dripping out of his right temple . He had shot himself with his own pistol , a Walther PPK 7 @.@ 65 " . The gun lay at his feet and according to SS @-@ Oberscharführer Rochus Misch , Hitler 's head was lying on the table in front of him . Blood dripping from Hitler 's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet . According to Linge , Eva 's body had no visible physical wounds , and her face showed how she had died — cyanide poisoning . Günsche and SS @-@ Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated " unequivocally " that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker " did not have any access " to Hitler 's private living quarters during the time of death ( between 15 : 00 and 16 : 00 ) . 
 Günsche left the study and announced that the Führer was dead . The two bodies were carried up the stairs to ground level and through the bunker 's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery , where they were doused with petrol . An eye @-@ witness , Rochus Misch , reported someone shouting ' Hurry upstairs , they 're burning the boss ! ' After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work , Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers . Bormann lit the papers and threw the torch onto the bodies . As the two corpses caught fire , a small group , including Bormann , Günsche , Linge , Goebbels , Erich <unk> , Peter Högl , Ewald <unk> , and Hans <unk> , raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway . 
 At around 16 : 15 , Linge ordered SS @-@ Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS @-@ Oberscharführer Werner <unk> to roll up the rug in Hitler 's study to burn it . <unk> later stated that upon entering the study , he saw a pool of blood the size of a " large dinner plate " by the arm @-@ rest of the sofa . Noticing a spent cartridge case , he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1 mm from a 7 @.@ 65 pistol . The two men removed the blood @-@ stained rug , carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden . There the rug was placed on the ground and burned . 
 On and off during the afternoon , the Soviets shelled the area in and around the Reich Chancellery . SS guards brought over additional cans of petrol to further burn the corpses . Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains , as the corpses were being burned in the open , where the distribution of heat varies . The burning of the corpses lasted from 16 : 00 to 18 : 30 . The remains were covered up in a shallow bomb crater at around 18 : 30 by <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The first inkling to the outside world that Hitler was dead came from the Germans themselves . On 1 May the radio station <unk> Hamburg interrupted their normal program to announce that an important broadcast would soon be made . After dramatic funeral music by Wagner and Bruckner , Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz ( appointed as Hitler 's successor in his will ) announced that Hitler was dead . Dönitz called upon the German people to mourn their Führer , who died a hero defending the capital of the Reich . Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans , Dönitz authorized a fighting withdrawal to the west . His tactic was somewhat successful : it enabled about 1 @.@ 8 million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets , but it came at a high cost in bloodshed , as troops continued to fight until 8 May . 
 On the morning of 1 May , thirteen hours after the event , Stalin was informed of Hitler 's suicide . General Hans Krebs had given this information to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov when they met at 04 : 00 on 1 May , when the Germans attempted to negotiate acceptable surrender terms . Stalin demanded unconditional surrender and asked for confirmation that Hitler was dead . He wanted Hitler 's corpse found . In the early morning hours of 2 May , the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery . Down in the Führerbunker , General Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head . 
 Later on 2 May , the remains of Hitler , Braun , and two dogs ( thought to be Blondi and her offspring , Wulf ) were discovered in a shell crater by a unit of the Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked with finding Hitler 's body . Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead , and restricted the release of information to the public . The remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit 's relocation from Berlin to a new facility in Magdeburg . The bodies , along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels , his wife Magda , and their six children , were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard . The location was kept secret . 
 Various versions of Hitler 's fate were presented by the Soviet Union according to its political desires . In the years immediately following 1945 , the Soviets maintained Hitler was not dead , but had fled and was being shielded by the former western allies . This worked for a time to create doubt among western authorities . The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremberg , Thomas J. Dodd , said : " No one can say he is dead . " When President Harry S. Truman asked Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead , Stalin replied bluntly , " No " . But by 11 May 1945 , the Soviets had already confirmed through Hitler 's dentist , Hugo Blaschke , and his dental technician that the dental remains found were Hitler 's and Braun 's . In November 1945 , Dick White , then head of counter @-@ intelligence in the British sector of Berlin ( and later head of MI5 and MI6 in succession ) , had their agent Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper investigate the matter to counter the Soviet claims . His findings were written in a report and published in book form in 1947 . 
 In May 1946 , SMERSH agents recovered from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage . These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993 , when they were re @-@ found . In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment , which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler 's . According to the American researchers , the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and the examination of the sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old . The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested . 
 In 1969 , Soviet journalist Lev <unk> 's book on the death of Hitler was published in the West . It included the SMERSH autopsy report , but because of the earlier disinformation attempts , western historians thought it untrustworthy . 
 In 1970 , the SMERSH facility , by then controlled by the KGB , was scheduled to be handed over to the East German government . Fearing that a known Hitler burial site might become a Neo @-@ Nazi shrine , KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains that had been buried in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946 . A Soviet KGB team was given detailed burial charts . On 4 April 1970 they secretly exhumed five wooden boxes containing the remains of " 10 or 11 bodies ... in an advanced state of decay " . The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed , after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river , a tributary of the nearby Elbe . 
 According to Ian Kershaw the corpses of Braun and Hitler were already thoroughly burned when the Red Army found them , and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler 's remains .

 The 2006 UAW @-@ Ford 500 was a stock car racing competition which took place on October 8 , 2006 . Held at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega , Alabama before 160 @,@ 000 spectators , the 188 @-@ lap race was the thirtieth in the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series and the fourth in the ten @-@ race , season @-@ ending Chase for the Nextel Cup . Brian Vickers of Hendrick Motorsports won the race ; Kasey Kahne finished second , and Kurt Busch came in third . 
 David Gilliland , who had the pole position , was passed immediately by teammate Dale Jarrett . The race lead changed 63 times , with Dale Earnhardt , Jr. leading for the most laps ( 37 ) . Earnhardt was leading on the final lap when he and Jimmie Johnson crashed after Vickers clipped Johnson 's right quarter panel . Vickers ( Johnson 's teammate ) was criticized after the race , since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings . 
 The victory was the first in Vickers ' career . After the race Jeff Burton maintained his Drivers ' Championship points lead , although that lead decreased significantly because he had a flat tire in the race 's final laps . Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers ' Championship , fifty @-@ one points ahead of Dodge and fifty @-@ two ahead of Ford with six races remaining in the season .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Talladega Superspeedway is one of six superspeedways which host NASCAR races . The standard track is a four @-@ turn , 2 @.@ 66 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 28 km ) superspeedway . Its turns are banked 33 degrees , and its front stretch ( the location of the finish line ) is banked at 16 @.@ 5 degrees . The back stretch also has a two @-@ degree bank . 
 Before the race Jeff Burton led the Drivers ' Championship with 5 @,@ 511 points , with Denny Hamlin second and Mark Martin third . Matt Kenseth and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top five and Jeff Gordon , Dale Earnhardt , Jr . , Jimmie Johnson , Kyle Busch and Kasey Kahne rounded out the top ten drivers competing in the 2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup . In the Manufacturers ' Championship , Chevrolet led with 222 points ; Ford was second with 175 , and Dodge was a close third with 174 points . Dale Jarrett was the race 's defending champion . 
 After the previous race at Talladega ( the 2006 Aaron 's 499 ) , the track 's condition was beginning to deteriorate . Cracks in the third and fourth turns were beginning to cause handling problems with the cars , and a temporary storage unit was built outside the track to accommodate the asphalt needed for resurfacing the track . The entire track , including the skid pad and pit road , was resurfaced , with the work completed shortly before the 2006 UAW @-@ Ford 500 began . 
 = = = Practice and qualification = = = 
 Two 60 @-@ minute practice sessions were held the Friday before Sunday 's race . In the first session Jeff Gordon was the fastest , ahead of Jarrett in second and Robby Gordon in third . David Gilliland placed fourth and Dave Blaney followed in fifth , with Casey Mears , J. J. Yeley , David Stremme , Brian Vickers and Kurt Busch rounding out the top ten . Later that day , Robby Gordon paced the second session , with Bobby Labonte , Hamlin and Tony Stewart in second , third and fourth place . Blaney duplicated his first @-@ session result in fifth , followed by Yeley , Harvick , Scott Riggs , Ryan Newman and Tony Raines . 
 Forty @-@ nine cars were entered in the qualifier , although due to NASCAR 's qualifying procedure only forty @-@ three could race . Gilliland clinched his first career pole position with a time of 49 @.@ 950 seconds and was joined on the grid 's front row by Jarrett , his Robert Yates Racing teammate . Johnson , Jeff Gordon and Greg Biffle rounded out the top five positions , with Travis Kvapil , Chad Chaffin , Todd Bodine , Hermie Sadler , Kirk <unk> and Kevin Lepage failing to qualify . 
 Early practice speeds approached 200 miles per hour ( 320 km / h ) . NASCAR had mandated before the qualifier that the holes in the cars ' restrictor plates be reduced by 1 ⁄ 64 inch ( 0 @.@ 4 mm ) , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others . According to Gilliland , " They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and ( engine builder ) Doug Yates wasn 't worried at all . He put the super @-@ tune on it and the thing ran great . " Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary : " The track is safe ... I don 't feel ( the late change in plate size ) is a very fair situation for everybody . Once you 're up around the 190s , what 's two miles an hour ? I don 't see what the big deal is . The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt . As far as running in a straight line , we 're no faster than we 've always run here . " Despite the mandated change , NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session .

 Live television coverage of the race , the thirtieth of thirty @-@ six in the 2006 season , began in the United States at 1 : 00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on NBC . Rev. Mike Jackson gave the invocation at 2 : 20 , followed by the 151st Army Band 's rendition of the national anthem . The command for the drivers to start their engines was given by Gary Casteel of the UAW , and no driver had to move to the rear of the grid at the start . 
 The race began at 2 : 41 p.m. Jarrett passed Gilliland almost immediately to lead the first lap , but lost the lead to Jeff Gordon a lap later . Jamie McMurray passed Gordon for the lead on lap 4 ; by this time , Gilliland had fallen back to 30th after losing the draft . Three laps later Gordon regained the lead from McMurray , with drafting assistance from Vickers . On lap 18 McMurray reclaimed the lead from Gordon , and they exchanged the lead again two laps later . On lap 24 McMurray reclaimed the lead , and Kenny Wallace made a pit stop with his car smoking . 
 On lap 28 , Biffle took the lead from McMurray and Earnhardt moved into the top five . Green @-@ flag pit stops were made from laps 30 to 33 , with Biffle maintaining his lead . On lap 35 he was passed by Stewart , who lost the lead to Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch two laps later . On the 38th lap , Earnhardt took the lead . Busch passed him on lap 41 , with Earnhardt ( in the outside lane ) dropping back to seventh . On lap 46 Kenseth passed Kyle Busch for the lead , with Kurt Busch and Earnhardt passing Kenseth five laps later . 
 Earnhardt reclaimed the lead on lap 52 , losing it seven laps later to Elliott Sadler . Sadler refueled on the next lap , giving the lead back to Earnhardt . Kenseth took the lead on lap 61 , as Earnhardt and others made green @-@ flag pit stops . Kenseth stopped on lap 71 with Biffle and Edwards , with Biffle taking the lead as the pit @-@ stop cycle ended . Lap 72 saw the first caution , as Blaney 's left rear tire shredded and he made a pit stop . Biffle , Edwards and Sterling Marlin stayed out , while the others stopped . 
 Biffle led the field back up to speed at the restart , and was passed on lap 77 by Jeff Gordon . Three laps later , Sadler made a pit stop with a flat right rear tire . On lap 90 Kyle Busch took the lead , losing it to Gordon on the next lap . Earnhardt passed Gordon on lap 93 , holding the lead for nine laps . Vickers took the lead on lap 102 ; Earnhardt 's left front tire went flat the next lap , costing him a lap . Green @-@ flag pit stops began on lap 107 , with Vickers stopping on lap 108 and giving the lead to McMurray . After the pit stops , Vickers regained the lead . 
 On lap 121 Kyle Busch took the lead , losing it to Jeff Gordon two laps later . Within a lap Gordon lost the draft and fell back to 27th , allowing Kenseth to regain the lead . On lap 127 Clint Bowyer passed Kenseth , holding the lead for two laps until a second yellow flag was displayed due to debris . Hamlin and Michael Waltrip staggered their pit stops , enabling each of them to lead a lap under the caution . Bowyer regained the lead after Waltrip stopped , and the race restarted on lap 134 . Kenseth moved back into the lead on the next lap , with Bowyer falling back to tenth . 
 In a multi @-@ car accident on the first turn of lap 137 Edwards and Mears collided , involving Biffle , Jeff Gordon , Hamlin , Harvick , Marlin , McMurray , Kyle Petty and Martin Truex , Jr . Gordon drove straight to the garage and others made pit stops , giving the lead to Burton . The race restarted on lap 145 , during which many drivers topped up with fuel . Kenseth regained the lead ; Vickers passed him on lap 147 , with Johnson taking the lead a lap later . That lap Reed Sorenson 's engine failed , ending his race . 
 Truex Jr. stayed out of pit road , and led the field to the restart on lap 152 before Johnson passed him a lap later . On lap 154 Paul Menard took the lead , with drafting assistance from Earnhardt , before Johnson regained the lead a lap later . Kahne took the lead on lap 158 , losing it to Earnhardt on lap 165 . A five @-@ car accident on turn two of lap 173 , involving Yeley , Menard , Stewart , Stremme and Hamlin , prompted the fifth caution ; none of the leaders made pit stops during this caution . 
 The race restarted on lap 178 , with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers . That lap , Burton ( in fifth ) had a flat left rear tire and lost a lap . The field then formed a single line , with most remaining in that formation for the rest of the race . On the final lap , Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt . When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance , he clipped Johnson 's right rear quarter panel . Johnson clipped Earnhardt , sending both drivers into the infield . The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place , with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began . This gave Vickers the victory ( the first of his career ) , although he was booed by the crowd . 
 = = = Post @-@ race comments = = = 
 Vickers appeared in victory lane to celebrate his first career win in front of the crowd , earning $ 228 @,@ 850 for the victory . Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last @-@ lap accident : " He didn 't wreck anyone on purpose . He was trying to push the 48 . I don 't think he thought , ' Oh , here 's my chance to knock them both out . ' He just got excited trying to push the 48 . " Johnson was less sanguine : " We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate ... I was real patient until the white flag was up . I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help ... Knowing the situation we 're all in , I would hope someone would be a little more patient . " Johnson 's crew chief , Chad Knaus , was annoyed : " I just don 't think [ Vickers ] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him . " 
 Vickers , who would leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team , said : " I would expect them to be a little upset . Jimmie is my friend , my teammate , and he is running for a championship . But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn 't bump @-@ drafting , he never would have had a shot to pass Junior . " Additionally , he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving . Third @-@ place finisher Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a " Catch @-@ 22 " situation : " He was trying to help his teammate , " said Busch , who finished third behind Kasey Kahne . " It just didn 't turn out that way . Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48 . He just didn 't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did . " Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend . 
 The result kept Burton in the lead in the Drivers ' Championship . After the race , Jeff Gordon ( who was involved in the lap @-@ 137 accident ) was less optimistic about his championship chances : " This pretty much does it for us as far as I 'm concerned for the championship . You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen . " In the Manufacturers ' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231 ; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179 . The race took three hours , ten minutes and twenty @-@ three seconds to complete ; because it ended under caution , no margin of victory was recorded .

 = 1984 – 85 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1984 – 85 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an average cyclone season . Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion . The first storm formed in mid @-@ November , though it was not officially named . A few days later , the first official storm of the year ( Anety ) formed . In December , one storm formed . During January 1985 , two tropical cyclones formed towards the end of the month . Three more systems developed in a short period of time in early to mid @-@ February . After nearly two more months of inactivity , an unusually powerful late season storm developed ( Helisaonina ) in mid @-@ April , which was the strongest storm of the year . While a number of storms during the season reached severe tropical storm status , only one of those intensified further . Even though two tropical cyclones this year made landfall , no known damage was recorded . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 During the season , advisories were issued by Météo @-@ France 's ( MFR ) meteorological office at Réunion . At the time , the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80 ° E , and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region , also tracked a long @-@ lived tropical storm in November in addition to the 8 storms MFR named , which is comparable to the average of nine named storms per year . Following the season , the boundary for the basin was extended to 90 ° E. 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm 01S = = = 
 According to the JTWC , a tropical depression formed on November 9 quite far from land . However , the system was never monitored by MFR . Tracking southwest throughout its lifetime , the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm on November 11 . Twelve hours later , the storm attained peak intensity of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The storm gradually weakened , and at <unk> on November 14 , it fell to a depression . On November 17 , 01S was no more . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Anety = = = 
 Early on November 20 , the JTWC reported that a tropical depression had developed . Shortly thereafter , MFR reported that a tropical disturbance had formed . The low moved west @-@ southwest while gradually deepening . Late on November 20 , MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm . The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar . By November 21 , MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance . After emerging into the Mozambique Channel , Anety reportedly re @-@ intensified back to moderate tropical storm status . While making its closest approach to the African mainland , the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast . On November 23 , both agencies stopped monitoring the system . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Bobalahy = = = 
 During the morning hours of December 2 , a tropical cyclone developed in extreme western portion of the Australian basin . After crossing the 80 ° E boundary that at that time separated the two basins the following day , MFR classified the system as a tropical depression . Early on December 4 , the agency upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm . Moving steadily southwest , it gradually intensified , only to turn west on December 5 . That day , MFR reported that Moderate Tropical Storm Bobalahy had attained peak intensity of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . Around that time , the JTWC estimated that Bobalahy attained peak intensity of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . After maintaining peak intensity for a day or so , Bobalahy resumed a southwesterly path far from land while slowly weakening . On December 6 , MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression ; the JTWC followed suit the next day . Now moving south @-@ southwest , the JTWC stopped issuing advisories on the system as it had become extratropical . However , MFR continued to monitor the remnants of the system for four more days . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Celestina = = = 
 Well away from land , the JTWC reported that a tropical disturbance developed on January 1 . Initially , the storm remained weak , but later on January 11 , the JTWC noted that the system had intensified into a tropical storm . Continuing to intensify , the storm moved towards the southwest . On January 12 , MFR first classified the system ; within six hours , it was declared a moderate tropical storm . As Celestina made a turn towards the south @-@ southwest , MFR estimated that Celestina attained peak intensity as a severe tropical storm at 0600 UTC on January 13 . According to the JTWC , the storm briefly developed hurricane @-@ force winds ; however , Celestina began to weakened thereafter . Moving south , Celestina was situated roughly 350 mi ( 565 km ) east of Madagascar . Furthermore , on January 15 , Celestina briefly re @-@ intensified while undergoing a counterclockwise loop . By January 18 , Celestina resumed a weakening trend ; by that night , MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression as it was now moving south @-@ southwest . The storm was re @-@ upgraded into a moderate tropical storm three days later , on January 21 . However , this trend was short lived and that evening , the JTWC stopped monitoring the system . MFR followed suit at 0600 UTC on January 23 . During its lifetime , Severe Tropical Storm Celestina brought rains to Reunion , peaking at 600 mm ( 25 in ) in Trois @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Ditra = = = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Ditra originated from a tropical depression that the JTWC first warned on January 26 . At first , the storm moved southwest , but once it developed gale @-@ force winds , the system turned south . At 1800 UTC on January 27 , MFR started monitoring the low ; early the next morning , MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm . Twelve hours later , the JTWC estimated that Ditra had intensified into winds equal to a Category 1 on Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . During the early morning hours of January 29 , Ditra intensified into a severe tropical storm as the storm briefly turned west @-@ southwest . Shortly thereafter , the JTWC announced that Ditra had attained its peak intensity of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . While the JTWC suggests that the storm gradually weakened during this time , MFR suggests that Ditra continued to intensify ; they estimated that Ditra peaked in intensity on 0600 UTC January 30 . Around this time , Ditra made its closet approach to Reunion , passing about 150 mi ( 240 km ) south @-@ southeast of the island . After maintaining this intensity for several hours , Ditra rapidly weakened as it accelerated to the southeast . It steadily weakened and late on January 31 , the JTWC reportedly downgraded the system into a depression . Both agencies stopped monitoring Tropical Depression Ditra the following day . On January 29 , <unk> passed just east of Rodrigues , bringing heavy rains .

 On February 9 , MFR first classified the system as a tropical depression about 400 mi ( 645 km ) east of the northern tip of Madagascar . Never warned on by the JTWC , the storm moved southwest . After briefly weakening into a tropical disturbance , the storm suddenly re @-@ intensified into a moderate tropical storm as <unk> re @-@ curved to the southwest . On February 11 , MFR stopped keeping an eye on the system . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Gerimena = = = 
 On February 11 , MFR reported that a moderate tropical storm formed over 700 mi ( 1 @,@ 125 km ) east of Reunion . The storm erratically drifted south for the two days when the JTWC declared the system a tropical depression . Subsequently , the system turned north @-@ northwest and slowed . Data from the MF suggests that Moderate Tropical Storm Gerimena rapidly degenerated tropical disturbance before slowly re @-@ intensifying ; however , the JTWC suggests it gradually intensified . Before turning west , the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm midday on February 14 . According to the JTWC , Gerimena reached a secondary peak with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) before weakening a little . Meanwhile , MFR upgraded the system back to moderate tropical storm status . Slowly intensifying , Gerimena turned south . Although the JTWC suggest that Germaine briefly weakened on January 18 while turning east , data from MFR shows that <unk> did not weaken until 1800 UTC February 19 . On January 20 , however , both agencies agree that Gerimena started to re @-@ intensify . The next day , the JTWC reported that the storm intensified into a hurricane even though MFR suggests that the system was just a disturbance by that time . Not long after becoming a hurricane , the JTWC remarked that Cyclone Gerimena had attained peak intensity . 
 Shortly thereafter , data from the JTWC suggests that Gerimena weakened as it turned southeast . Then , it turned east @-@ southeast . On February 24 , Gerimena briefly level off in intensity while turning back to south . Furthermore , the JTWC stopped keeping an eye on Gerimena at 0000 UTC on February 26 as the storm re @-@ curved east . However , MFR continued to track Gerimena until March 4 as it fluctuated in intensity . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Feliska = = = 
 On February 12 , MFR first designated what would later become Feliska while it was centered north of the Mozambique Channel . The next day , MFR downgraded Feliska into a tropical depression . Hours later , the JTWC first monitored the system . Drifting east , the depression gradually intensified . MFR reported that the system regained moderate tropical storm intensity at 1800 UTC that day . Early on February 13 , the JTWC upgraded Feliska into a tropical storm as it turned north . While slowing gaining strength , Feliska turned east . By 0000 UTC February 16 , MFR declared that Feliska attained peak intensity . Moreover , the JTWC suggested that Feliska had peaked in intensity , with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Thereafter , Feliska turned south and start a slow weakening trend . On February 17 , Feliska briefly weakened into a tropical depression . That night <unk> was re @-@ upgraded into a moderate tropical storm as it made landfall along northeastern Madagascar . At that time of landfall , the JTWC estimated that Feliksa was still a tropical storm . After moving inland , MFR stopped monitoring the system , though the JTWC kept tracking Feliska for another 24 hours as it headed southeast . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Helisaonina = = = 
 On April 10 , MFR reportedly classified a low far from any land masses . Later that day , the JTWC upgraded Helisaonina into a tropical depression after turning from west to southwest . On April 11 , MFR upgraded the system into a Severe Tropical Storm . At 0600 UTC the next day , the JTWC upgraded the system into a hurricane while MFR upgraded the system into tropical cyclone intensity . That evening , the JTWC announced that it had developed winds equivalent to Category 2 intensity . Two days after becoming a severe tropical storm , on April 13 , the JTWC upgraded <unk> to the equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane . While undergoing a counterclockwise loop , the JTWC reported that Cyclone <unk> had peaked in intensity with 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) winds . At that time , 000 UTC April 14 , MFR estimated it attained peak wind speed , with winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . 
 After attaining peak intensity , the storm weakened rapidly as it began to move west @-@ northwest . Later that morning , MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm . By April 15 , MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression . That very day , the JTWC reported that winds of <unk> had fallen below hurricane @-@ force . During the morning hours of April 17 , the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression . Shortly thereafter , MFR stopped monitoring the system . After re @-@ curving just east of Madagascar , <unk> dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18 . While the storm was weakening , it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact . 
 = 29th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 29th Infantry Division ( 29th I.D. ) , also known as the " Blue and Gray " , is an infantry division of the United States Army based in Fort Belvoir , Virginia . It is a formation of the United States Army National Guard and contains units from Maryland , Virginia , and North Carolina . 
 Formed in 1917 , the division deployed to France as a part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. Called up for service again in World War II , the division 's 116th Regiment , attached to the First Infantry Division , was in the first wave of troops ashore during Operation Overlord , the landings in Normandy , France . It supported a special Ranger unit tasked with clearing strong points at Omaha Beach . The rest of the 29th ID came ashore later then advanced to Saint @-@ Lô , and eventually through France and into Germany itself . These actions have since been the subject of many motion pictures and video games . 
 Following the end of World War II , the division saw frequent reorganizations and <unk> . Although the 29th did not see combat through most of the next 50 years , it participated in numerous training exercises throughout the world . It eventually saw deployments to Bosnia ( <unk> ) and Kosovo ( KFOR ) as command elements , and units of the division continue to deploy to locations such as Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and to the War in Afghanistan as a part of the Global War on Terrorism 's Operation Enduring Freedom , and also to the Iraq War , as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn . 
 = = History = = 
 The 29th Division was first constituted on paper 18 July 1917 , shortly after the American entry into World War I , in the Army National Guard . The division 's infantry units were the 57th Infantry Brigade , made up of the 113th Infantry Regiment and 114th Infantry Regiment from New Jersey , and the 58th Infantry Brigade , made up of the 115th Infantry Regiment from Maryland and 116th Infantry Regiment from Virginia . Its artillery units were Maryland 's 110th Artillery Regiment ; Virginia 's 111th Artillery Regiment ; and New Jersey 's 112th Artillery Regiment . As the division was composed of men from states that had units that fought for both the North and South during the Civil War , it was nicknamed the " Blue and Gray " division , after the blue uniforms of the Union and the gray uniforms of the Confederate armies during the American Civil War . The division was actually organized on 25 August 1917 at Camp McClellan , Alabama .

 The division departed for the Western Front in June 1918 to join the American Expeditionary Forces fighting in World War I The division 's advance detachment reached Brest , France on 8 June . In late September , the 29th received orders to join the First United States Army 's Meuse @-@ Argonne offensive as part of the French XVII Corps . During its 21 days in combat , the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers , captured 2 @,@ 148 prisoners , and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces . Thirty percent of the division became casualties — 170 officers and 5 @,@ 691 enlisted men were killed or wounded . Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed , ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers . The division returned to the United States in May 1919 . It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix , New Jersey , though it remained an active National Guard unit .

 At the outbreak of World War II , the United States Army began buildup and reorganization of its fighting forces . The division was reactivated into active service on 3 February 1941 . Elements of the division were then sent to Fort Meade , Maryland for training . The 57th and 58th Brigades were inactivated as part of an army @-@ wide removal of brigades from divisions . Instead , the division was based around three infantry regiments ; the 115th Infantry Regiment , the 116th Infantry Regiment , and the 175th Infantry Regiment . Also assigned to the division were the 110th , 111th , 224th , and 227th Field Artillery Battalions , as well as the 29th Signal Company , the <unk> Ordnance Company , the 29th Quartermaster Company , the 29th Reconnaissance Troop , the 121st Engineer Battalion , the 104th Medical Battalion , and the 29th Counter Intelligence Detachment . On 12 March 1942 , with this reorganization complete the division was redesignated the 29th Infantry Division and began preparing for deployment to Europe . 
 The division was sent to England on 5 October 1942 on RMS Queen Mary . It was based throughout England and Scotland , where it immediately began training for an invasion of northern Europe across the English Channel . In May 1943 the division moved to the Devon – Cornwall peninsula and started conducting simulated attacks against fortified positions . At this time it was assigned to V Corps of the U.S. First Army . 
 = = = = Operation Overlord = = = = 
 The cross @-@ channel invasion of France finally came on 6 June 1944 , D @-@ Day , Operation Overlord , the invasion of Normandy . The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry Regiment to support the western flank of the 1st Infantry Division 's 16th Infantry Regiment at Omaha Beach . Omaha was known to be the most difficult of the five landing beaches , due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach , which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the 352nd Infantry Division . The 116th Infantry Regiment was assigned four sectors of the beach ; Easy Green , Dog Red , Dog White , and Dog Green . Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded a large number of attack transports for the D @-@ Day invasion , among them Landing craft , Landing Ship , Tank and Landing Ship , Infantry ships and other vessels such as the SS Empire Javelin , USS Charles Carroll , and USS Buncombe County . 
 As the ships were traveling to the beach , the heavy seas , combined with the chaos of the fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown off @-@ course and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots . Most of the regiment 's tank support , launched from too far off @-@ shore , foundered and sank in the channel . The soldiers of the 116th Infantry began to hit the beach at 0630 , coming under heavy fire from German fortifications . A Company , 1st Battalion , 116th Infantry , from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford , Virginia was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th 's westernmost section of the beach , along with half of C Company , 2nd Ranger Battalion which was landing to the west of the 116th . The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D @-@ Day Memorial . The 1st Infantry Division 's forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of the beach , suffering massive casualties coming ashore . By 0830 , the landings were called off for lack of space on the beach , as the Americans on Omaha Beach were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding the beach exits . Lieutenant General Omar N. Bradley , commander of the United States First Army , considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere . However , by noon , elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off the beach , and the landings resumed . By nightfall , the division headquarters landed on the beach with about 60 percent of the division 's total strength , and began organizing the push inland . On 7 June , a second wave of 20 @,@ 000 reinforcements from the 1st and 29th divisions was sent ashore . By the end of D @-@ Day , 2 @,@ 400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha Beach . Added to casualties at other beaches and air @-@ drops made the total casualties for Operation Overlord 6 @,@ 500 Americans and 3 @,@ 000 British and Canadians , lighter numbers than expected . 
 The entire division had landed in Normandy by 7 June . By 9 June , Omaha Beach was secure and the division occupied Isigny . On 14 July , the division was reassigned to XIX Corps , United States First Army , Twelfth United States Army Group .

 The division cut across the Elle River and advanced slowly toward Saint @-@ Lô , fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows . German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town , and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town . German forces used the dense bocage foliage to their advantage , mounting fierce resistance in house to house fighting in the ravaged Saint @-@ Lô . By the end of the fight , the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following the depletion of the infantry contingent . The 29th Division , which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D @-@ Day , was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint @-@ Lô . Eventually , the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault , supported by airstrikes from P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts . 
 After taking Saint @-@ Lô , on 18 July , the division joined in the battle for Vire , capturing that strongly held city by 7 August. it continued to face stiff German resistance as it advanced to key positions southeast of Saint @-@ Lô It was then reassigned to V Corps , and then again to VIII Corps . Turning west , the 29th took part in the assault on Brest which lasted from 25 August until 18 September . After a short rest , the division returned to XIX Corps and moved to defensive positions along the <unk> @-@ Geilenkirchen line in Germany and maintained those positions through October . On 16 November , the division began its drive to the Roer River , blasting its way through <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Bettendorf , and reaching the Roer by the end of the month . Heavy fighting reduced Jülich <unk> and the <unk> Gut on 8 December . 
 From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945 , the division was assigned to XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive . The division was reassigned to XIX Corps , and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February , and carried the division through Jülich , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , to Mönchengladbach by 1 March 1945 . The division was out of combat in March . In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps , where 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr area . On 19 April 1945 the division , assigned to XIII Corps , pushed to the Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May . Meanwhile , the 175th Infantry cleared the <unk> Forest . After V @-@ E Day , the division was on military duty in the Bremen enclave . It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment .

 During World War II , the 29th Infantry Division was commanded by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt . The division had such a high casualty rate that it was said that Gerhardt actually commanded three divisions : one on the field of battle , one in the hospital and one in the cemetery . The 29th Infantry Division lost 3 @,@ 720 killed in action , 15 @,@ 403 wounded in action , 462 missing in action , 526 prisoners of war , and 8 @,@ 665 non @-@ combat casualties , for a total of 28 @,@ 776 casualties during 242 days of combat . This amounted to over 200 percent of the division 's normal strength . The division , in turn , took 38 @,@ 912 German prisoners of war . 
 Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division were awarded five Medals of Honor , 44 Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , 854 Silver Star Medals , 17 Legion of Merit Medals , 24 Soldiers ' Medals , 6 @,@ 308 Bronze Star Medals , and 176 Air Medals during the conflict . The division itself was awarded four distinguished unit citations and four campaign streamers for the conflict . 
 The division remained on occupation duty until the end of 1945 . Camp <unk> near Bremen was the division headquarters until January 1946 . It returned to the United States in January 1946 and was demobilized and inactivated on 17 January 1946 at Camp Kilmer , New Jersey . 
 = = = Reactivation = = = 
 On 23 October 1946 , the division was reactivated in Norfolk , Virginia . However , its subordinate elements were not fully manned and activated for several years . It resumed its National Guard status , seeing weekend and summer training assignments but no major contingencies over the next few years . 
 In 1959 , the division was reorganized under the Pentomic five battle group division organization . Ewing 's 29th Infantry Division : A Short History of a Fighting Division says that several Maryland infantry and engineer companies were reorganized to form 1st Med Tank Bn , 115th Armor ; the 29th Aviation Company was established ; and the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron , 183rd Armor , was established in Virginia as the division 's reconnaissance squadron . In 1963 , the division was reorganized in accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan , eliminating its regimental commands in favor of brigades . The division took command of 1st Brigade , 29th Infantry Division and 2nd Brigade , 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia Army National Guard , as well as 3rd Brigade , 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland Army National Guard . The division continued its service in the National Guard under this new organization . 
 In 1968 , in the middle of the Vietnam War , the Army inactivated several National Guard and Reserve divisions as part of a realignment of resources . The 29th Infantry Division was one of the divisions inactivated . During that time , the division 's subordinate units were reassigned to other National Guard divisions . 1st Brigade was inactivated , while 2nd Brigade was redesignated as the 116th Infantry Brigade , and the 3rd Brigade was redesignated as 3rd Brigade , 28th Infantry Division . 
 On 6 June 1984 , 40 years after the landings on Omaha Beach , the Army announced that it would reactivate the 29th Infantry Division , organized as a light infantry division , as part of a reorganization of the National Guard . On 30 September 1985 , the division was reactivated at Fort Belvoir , Virginia , with a detachment in Maryland . The 116th Infantry Brigade was redesignated the 1st Brigade , 29th Division , while the 58th Infantry Brigade became the 3rd Brigade . That year , the division also received its distinctive unit insignia . 
 = = = Post Cold War = = = 
 At the end of the Cold War , the Army saw further drawdowns and reductions in spending . The 29th Infantry Division was retained , however 2nd Brigade was inactivated in favor of assets from the inactivating 26th Infantry Division , which was redesignated the 26th Brigade , 29th Infantry Division . 
 The largest National Guard training exercise ever held in Virginia took place in July 1998 , bringing units from the 29th Infantry Division together for one large infantry exercise . The Division Maneuver Exercise , dubbed Operation <unk> , brought together Guard units from Virginia and Maryland , as well as Massachusetts , New Jersey , Connecticut and the District of Columbia . The exercise began with the insertion of troops from the 29th Infantry Division 's 1st and 3rd Brigades by UH @-@ 60 Blackhawk helicopters into strategic landing zones . NATO @-@ member forces trained with the 29th Infantry Division throughout the exercise . In December 2008 , the division also dispatched a task force to Camp Asaka near Tokyo , Japan for exercises with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force called Yama Sakura 55 , an bilateral exercise simulating an invasion of Japan .

 Hundreds of soldiers from the 29th Infantry Division completed nine days of training on 16 June 2001 at Fort Polk , Louisiana , to prepare for their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia , as the second division headquarters to be deployed as a part of SFOR 10 . In all , 2 @,@ 085 National Guard soldiers from 16 states from Massachusetts to California served with the multinational force that operated in the US sector , MND @-@ N. Their rotation began in October 2001 and lasted six months . 
 The 29th Infantry Division completed a two @-@ week <unk> exercise at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas in late July 2003 . Nearly 1 @,@ 200 soldiers of the division participated in the training , which was overseen by First United States Army . Also engaged in the simulation war were about 150 soldiers of the New York Army National Guard 's 42nd Infantry Division . The exercises covered a variety of operations , ranging from large scale contingencies to airborne and civil affairs operations . 
 In March 2004 , the 3rd Battalion 116th Infantry of 500 + soldiers was mobilized for 579 days in support of Operation Enduring Freedom , Afghanistan . Following 4 month train up , the battalion deployed to Bagram Air Base Afghanistan where the unit split into two operational elements . One element was stationed at Bagram where they were responsible for near base security and the theater @-@ north Quick Reaction Force . They executed 5 , 10 , and 20 kilometer ring patrols to increase force security and stayed ready to react at a moments notice to deploy anywhere in Afghanistan to react to " troops in contact " that requested support . The other element moved south with the Bn Commander to control and shape operations in the Wardak and Ghazni provinces . It was here that the 116th would take its first casualties by enemy contact since WWII . <unk> Bobby Beasley and SSG Craig Cherry were killed in an IED attack on a patrol in southern Ghazni near Gilan . Within the first three months , the unit would deploy nearly every soldier around Bagram , and throughout the Wardak and Ghazni provinces during the first Afghan elections in which President Hamid Karzai was elected . The unit would redeploy back to the United States in July 2005 highly decorated for its efforts during their mission following hundreds of successful combat patrols and engagements . 
 In 2005 , 350 veterans , politicians , and soldiers representing the division went to Normandy and Paris , in France for the 60th anniversary of the D @-@ Day landings . The Army National Guard organized a major ceremony for the 60th anniversary , as many of the veterans who participated in the invasion were in their 80s at that time , and the 60th anniversary was seen as the last major anniversary of the landings in which a large number of veterans could take part . 
 The division underwent major reorganization in 2006 . A special troops battalion was added to the division 's command structure , and its three brigades were redesignated . It as organized around three brigades ; the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team of North Carolina , the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of Virginia , and the Combat Aviation Brigade , 29th Infantry Division of Maryland . 
 In December 2006 , the division took command of the Eastern region of Kosovo 's peacekeeping force , to provide security in the region . The division 's soldiers were part of a NATO multi @-@ national task force consisting of units from the Ukraine , Greece , Poland , Romania , Armenia and Lithuania under the command of U.S. Army Brigadier General Douglas B. Earhart who concurrently served as the 29th 's Deputy Commanding General . The division returned to Fort Belvoir in November 2007 . 
 After a three @-@ month pre @-@ deployment train @-@ up at Camp Shelby , MS , the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in September , 2007 , as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom , returning home in May 2008 . 
 Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard Soldiers with the 29th ID deployed to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011 . As part of the 29th ID Security Partnering Team , the Soldiers were assigned to NATO 's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command Security Partnering Team with the mission of assisting with the growth and development of the Afghan National Security Forces where they served as advisers and mentors to senior Afghan leaders . They were part of a NATO Coalition of 49 troop @-@ contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan . 
 They were replaced in November 2011 by a new team from the 29th Infantry Division . A team of 65 29th ID Soldiers served in Afghanistan as a Security Partnering Team until July 2012 . 
 The 29th ID suffered one casualty during this deployment . Maj. Robert <unk> of the Maryland Army National Guard , was killed on 25 February 2012 . 
 In 2014 the 29th ID twice sent Soldiers to the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in <unk> , Germany to assist in the training of U.S. and multinational Soldiers preparing to head to Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force mission . The 29th ID Soldiers performed as the KFOR staff , serving as subject matter experts , enforcing KFOR orders , systems and procedures , and working with <unk> to help the deploying troops achieve their training objectives . 
 The 29th ID currently serves as the Domestic All @-@ Hazards Response Team ( DART ) in FEMA Regions 1 through 5 ( states east of the Mississippi ) . In this role the 29th ID is prepared to assist state National Guard in their service to governors and citizens during an incident response . The DART provides defense support of civil authority capabilities in response to a catastrophic event . The DART conducts joint reception , staging , onward @-@ movement and Integration of inbound <unk> forces and establishes base support installations and / or forward operating bases for sustaining operations . 
 On 24 July 2015 , Brig. Gen. Blake C. Ortner took command of the 29th Infantry Division from Maj. Gen. Charles W. Whittington .

 = Dartmouth Big Green football under William Wurtenburg = 
 From 1895 to 1899 , William Wurtenburg served as the head coach of the Dartmouth Big Green football program , which represented Dartmouth College in collegiate football competitions . Dartmouth had adopted football as a school sport in 1881 when the team went 1 – 0 – 1 . Prior to Wurtenburg 's hiring , the team had won two consecutive Triangular Football League championships under coach Wallace Moyle . Wurtenburg had been a highly successful player at Yale , where he had played at quarterback on teams that went 46 – 1 – 1 in a four @-@ year span . He had graduated from the school in 1893 and coached the Navy Midshipmen football program for a year before his hiring by Dartmouth . 
 During Wurtenburg 's five year coaching tenure , Dartmouth went 8 – 2 in conference contests and won four consecutive Triangular Football League championships . The 1895 season was made up of thirteen games , a record @-@ setting amount for a Dartmouth team . It included the closest loss to rival Harvard up to that point . The 1896 was the most successful season of Wurtenburg 's , in terms of winning percentage ; the squad went 5 – 2 – 1 , the tenth @-@ best record among major teams , for a <unk> win percentage . The fewest games played in a season under Wurtenburg were seven in 1897 . That team managed a 4 – 3 record , which included a three @-@ game scoreless streak . The 1898 squad finished the season with a losing record , 5 – 6 , but managed to outscore its opponents 205 – 137 . Wurtenburg 's final season as Dartmouth 's head coach was his worst . The team had a 2 – 7 overall record and went 0 – 2 in conference play . The season was also marked by several of the largest blowouts of Dartmouth in years . 
 Overall , the Dartmouth football program went 23 – 23 – 2 in Wurtenburg 's five years of coaching . The 1898 season was the final Triangular Football League championship the school would win ; the conference would become defunct in 1901 , two years later . Following Wurtenburg 's departure , Frederick E. Jennings , a player under Wurtenburg , would take over the program , leading it to a 2 – 4 – 2 record in one year of coaching . Another former player , Walter <unk> would coach the program starting in 1901 , and led the team to a 15 @-@ win record in two years . Wurtenburg 's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked as the beginning of Dartmouth 's acceptance as a major team . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Dartmouth College fielded its first football team in 1881 , when the school challenged Amherst College to a two @-@ game series . They won the first contest , one touchdown to none , and tied the second . The following year , the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge , Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson . Dartmouth was blown out 53 – 0 , and a rivalry with Harvard formed . The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s , skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents . Prior to Wurtenburg 's arrival , the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years . Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program ; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg 's appointment and led the school to a 9 – 7 record . 
 William Wurtenburg was born and raised in Western New York by immigrant parents . He was introduced to football while a student at Phillips Exeter Academy , where , in his senior year , he played quarterback and served as team captain . In 1886 , Wurtenburg entered Yale University to study to become a doctor . He joined the school football team in his first year , playing as a backup halfback . He remained a backup halfback on the 1887 team , which went undefeated and was later recognized as a national champion . Wurtenburg transitioned to the quarterback position in 1888 and took the starting spot . He finished playing with the team regularly in 1889 . During the time Wurtenburg played , Yale went 46 – 1 – 1 . Upon graduating from Yale in 1893 , Wurtenburg accepted a position as head coach of the Naval Academy football team for the 1894 season . He guided the team to a 4 – 1 – 2 record . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the 1899 season concluded , Wurtenburg declined to return the next year . Instead , he was replaced by one of his former players , Frederick E. Jennings . During the time that Wurtenburg coached Dartmouth , the program went 23 – 23 – 2 and won four consecutive Triangular Football League championships . The team had also amassed an 8 – 2 conference record . Jennings took the 1900 squad to a 2 – 4 – 2 record , and was replaced following that season by Walter <unk> . He found more success with the program and led it to a 15 – 3 – 1 record over two years . The Big Green would never win another Triangular Football League championship ; the conference folded after the 1901 season . Following his coaching career , Wurtenburg became an occasional referee for Yale , and later established himself as a respected surgeon . Fred <unk> , captain of the 1898 team , would reflect on Wurtenburg 's coaching career at Dartmouth for William " Big Bill " Edwards ' book Football Days , stating that : 
 One man , whose influence more than any other one thing , succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth 's wonderful results , but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg , who was brought up in the early Yale football school . He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge . Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth . 
 = Krohn Air = 
 Krohn Air AS was a virtual , regional airline whose primary route was between Molde Airport , Årø to Trondheim Airport , Værnes in Norway . The airline was established in 2010 after Scandinavian Airlines pulled out of the Molde – Trondheim route . The airline aimed at the business segment , with early morning departures and two daily round trips . 
 Services were originally flown using a Dornier Do 328 operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia . Later in that year , Krohn Air acquired a Jetstream 32 and started flights from Molde to Bergen Airport , Flesland and Stavanger Airport , Sola , but these services did not have sufficient patronage and were later terminated . By 2011 , the aircraft operation was transferred to Helitrans . In the spring of 2013 the aircraft operation was transferred to AIS Airlines , using two British Aerospace Jetstream 32 . The airline started a service from Ålesund Airport , Vigra to Trondheim in March 2013 , but pulled out in September . The airline ceased operations on 4 February 2014 .

 From 31 January 2010 , Scandinavian Airlines terminated its service from Molde to Trondheim . Krohn Air started operations on 3 February 2010 on the same route , using a Dornier Do 328 wet leased from Sun Air of Scandinavia . The airline was established and fully owned by Claus Krohn , a local businessman , who was 76 years old at the time . SAS stated in 2011 that they did not regret closing the route , as with the size of aircraft they operated they would need in excess of 20 @,@ 000 passengers per year on the route , while Krohn Air could survive with fewer because they used smaller aircraft . 
 On 28 June , the Scandinavian Airlines route from Molde to Bergen was taken over by Widerøe . However , while Scandinavian Airlines previously flew from Molde at 06 : 45 , Widerøe 's first flight departed at 08 : 55 . Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen . Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun @-@ Air , which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport , Kvernberget to Trondheim . However , after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011 , Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen . The Bergen service was started on 31 August . On 7 September , the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport , Sola on 13 August . Because there were few passengers , the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010 . 
 Krohn Air bought both aircraft from Sun Air , but later decided that they would lease aircraft . Krohn Air paid 21 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) for the Dornier and NOK 9 @.@ 5 million for the Jetstream . The Dornier was sold back to Sun Air , whilst the Jetstream was sold to Helitrans , who took over operation of the route . However , there arose a disagreement between Krohn Air and Sun Air regarding the price of the Dornier , which was settled in court . The settlement resulted in a loss of NOK 13 million for Krohn Air . 
 In 2010 , the airline transported 14 @,@ 000 people and had a revenue of NOK 17 million , allowing Krohn Air to break even . On 14 February 2011 , the company increased the service from Molde to Trondheim from two to four daily services in each direction , from Monday through Thursday . From 2010 to 2012 the airline had an accumulated loss of NOK 3 @.@ 3 million . This later was reduced back to a typical twice @-@ daily schedule . A twice @-@ daily route from Ålesund to Trondheim was introduced on 3 March 2013 . The Ålesund service was terminated on 13 September 2013 , with Krohn stating that they were lacking two to three passengers per flight to break even . The company had a revenue of NOK 19 million in 2013 . Krohn Air ceased all operations on 4 February 2014 , and filed for bankruptcy the following day . Widerøe commenced flights on the Molde – Trondheim route from 1 September 2014 .

 Krohn Air was a virtual airline , with a single Jetstream 32 operated by AIS Airlines . The airline provided two daily round trips between Molde Airport , Årø and Trondheim Airport , Værnes . As of 2013 Claus Krohn owned 90 percent of the company , and Roy Uren was co @-@ owner .

 = M @-@ 21 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 21 is an east – west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan connecting the cities of Grand Rapids and Flint . The highway passes through rural farming country and several small towns along its course through the Lower Peninsula . Following the course of a handful of rivers , M @-@ 21 also connects some of the state 's freeways like Interstate 96 ( I @-@ 96 ) , US Highway 127 ( US 127 ) and I @-@ 75 . The highway is used by between 1 @,@ 700 and 36 @,@ 000 vehicles daily . 
 M @-@ 21 was designated along the highway by July 1 , 1919 between Ionia and Goodells near Port Huron . Changes made in the 1920s extended it on the west end to Holland and on the east end to Port Huron . M @-@ 21 was truncated at both of its current termini as two Interstate freeways were completed . I @-@ 196 functionally replaced M @-@ 21 between Holland and Grand Rapids with a portion retained under state maintenance as Old M @-@ 21 , now M @-@ 121 . I @-@ 69 replaced M @-@ 21 from Flint to Port Huron . A section of M @-@ 21 through Flint became M @-@ 56 . That designation was decommissioned in the 1980s when M @-@ 21 was returned to its former routing in Flint . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 21 starts on Fulton Street at a junction with M @-@ 37 / M @-@ 44 ( East Beltline Avenue ) on the east side of greater Grand Rapids . Fulton passes through residential areas on this side of town , and crosses over I @-@ 96 . Continuing east , the highway passes the headquarters of Amway and crosses the Grand River near its confluence with the Thornapple River in Ada . M @-@ 21 runs long the north back of the Grand , turning southeasterly and east to Lowell . The roadway passes through downtown and over the Flat River near its confluence with the Grand . M @-@ 21 runs east of town through the southern end of the Lowell State Gaming Area and crosses into Ionia County . 
 The road follows Bluewater Highway along the river , passing to the north of Saranac . It turns northeasterly through lightly forested farmland passing Bertha Brock Park as it approaches the city of Ionia . In town , M @-@ 66 runs concurrently along M @-@ 21 for a few blocks in the central business district . Bluewater Highway leaves town and continues along the Grand River to Muir , and the trunkline crosses the Maple River on east side of town . M @-@ 21 follows the course of the Maple briefly before turning east through farms along the Stony Creek to Pewamo . The highway bypasses the village to the south and crosses into Clinton County near the eastern edge of town . Western Clinton County 's landscape is dominated by farms , interrupted by the community of Fowler . The highway enters the county seat , St. Johns on State Street , passing through a residential section of town . In the middle of downtown , M @-@ 21 intersects 2nd Street , which carries Business US Highway 127 ( Bus . US 127 ) . East of downtown , M @-@ 21 passes back into agricultural land and under the US 127 freeway . The landscape is once again dominated by these farms through the western side of the county . 
 M @-@ 21 passes into the community of Ovid and over the county line into Shiawassee County . Continuing east through the county , the highway enters Owosso . The trunkline follows Main Street into downtown and crosses the Shiawassee River between junctions with M @-@ 52 and M @-@ 71 in Owosso . M @-@ 21 runs roughly parallel to the river out into the country side . The remainder of the county is the same , dominated by farmland along a straight stretch of flat highway . North of Lennon , M @-@ 21 meets M @-@ 13 at an intersection on the Shiawassee – Genesee county line . The landscape starts to transition to residential subdivisions as the roadway approaches the Flint area . 
 In Flint Township , M @-@ 21 follows Corunna Road and meets I @-@ 75 / US 23 at exit 118 . The road crosses a former branch line of the Canadian National Railway ( converted into a bicycle trail ) east of the interchange . Corunna Road angles to the northeast near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street . The trunkline turns east and follows Court over a tributary of the Flint River near Aldrich Park . Northeast of the stream , M @-@ 21 splits along a one @-@ way pairing of Court and 5th streets . Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area . The highway passes over I @-@ 475 and terminates at the east frontage road . Traffic connecting between M @-@ 21 and I @-@ 475 must use the frontage roads to make the connection . 
 All of M @-@ 21 , except for some segments just outside Grand Rapids and Flint , along with the highway split into two one @-@ way streets inside Flint , is undivided surface road ; none of M @-@ 21 is freeway . The section between I @-@ 75 / US 23 and Saginaw Street in Flint is part of the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . M @-@ 21 , like all state highways , is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . As part of these responsibilities , the department tracks traffic volumes along its highways . They use a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the average traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year . Traffic volumes in 2009 vary from 22 @,@ 756 vehicles in the Forest Hills neighborhood east of Grand Rapids to 1 @,@ 719 vehicles in Pewamo daily . MDOT reported that the peak AADT was 36 @,@ 053 vehicles daily near the I @-@ 75 interchange in the Flint area . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the Interstate era , M @-@ 21 extended across the entire Lower Peninsula , from the junction with US 31 in Holland near Lake Michigan east to the St. Clair River at Port Huron , and crossed into Canada where the Blue Water Bridge is currently located . 
 M @-@ 21 was designated by July 1 , 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells . Along the way , it ran through Lyons and Pewamo , joining its current routing to Ovid . M @-@ 21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint . There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area . The highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924 , and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M @-@ 16 ( later US 16 ) . The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M @-@ 71 at this time when M @-@ 21 was shifted along the current routing between the two communities . The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M @-@ 21 along US 16 to Grand Rapids . From there west , M @-@ 21 replaced M @-@ 51 on Chicago Drive to Holland . The highway was moved to a new routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929 ; the old route was renumbered M @-@ 21A . All in @-@ city portions of M @-@ 21 were transferred to state control in 1931 with the passage of the Dykstra Act of 1931 ( PA 131 of 1931 ) . 
 A Bypass M @-@ 21 ( Byp . M @-@ 21 ) designation was created in the Grand Rapids area in 1945 . This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp . US 16 and Byp . US 131 on 28th Street . At East Beltline Avenue , Byp . US 131 / Byp . M @-@ 21 turned north back to M @-@ 21 . M @-@ 21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948 , decommissioning the number . The Byp . M @-@ 21 routing was replaced by M @-@ 21 in 1953 . The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus . M @-@ 21 instead . 
 A bypass of Zeeland opened in 1958 , rerouting M @-@ 21 around the town . The I @-@ 196 freeway opened through Grand Rapids in 1964 , and M @-@ 21 was routed along the freeway between Chicago Drive in Grandville and downtown , using I @-@ 96 to complete the connection to its previous routing on Fulton Street . 
 The first freeway segment of M @-@ 21 on the east end was built from Wadhams to Port Huron in 1966 . A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971 . M @-@ 21 was routed down M @-@ 13 to the new freeway where it joined the M @-@ 78 designation from M @-@ 13 east . The section of M @-@ 21 formerly between M @-@ 13 and Bus . M @-@ 54 was redesignated M @-@ 56 . The M @-@ 78 designation was replaced by I @-@ 69 in 1973 after I @-@ 69 was extended north from Charlotte . The 1974 completion of I @-@ 196 meant the truncation of M @-@ 21 to end in Grand Rapids . At the time , M @-@ 21 was extended along Fulton Street to the East Beltline , and the business loop was truncated into a spur route redesignated BS I @-@ 196 . The remaining segment of freeway connecting Flint with Port Huron opened in 1984 as I @-@ 69 , and M @-@ 21 was shortened to Flint . M @-@ 56 was replaced by M @-@ 21 at this time as well . The former M @-@ 21 in Port Huron became BL I @-@ 69 , and the remainder was turned back to local control . 
 Michigan legislators have proposed naming the section of highway in Genesee County after University of Alabama tailback Mark Ingram . The state senate approved the measure on November 4 , 2010 , and the bill moved to the state house for approval . The bill failed to pass the state house during the session .
