 = = = Palaeozoic era = = = 
 The Palaeozoic era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds , namely the Carboniferous ( including Coal Measures and limestone ) and Permian . 
 Crystal Palace 's two <unk> models are based on incomplete Permian fossils found in South Africa , along with Owen 's guess that they were similar to turtles . There is no evidence of any shelled <unk> , and recent more complete fossils show that they looked more like Hippopotamus . 
 = = = Mesozoic era = = = 
 The Mesozoic era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds , namely the Jurassic and Cretaceous , by models of dinosaurs and other animals known from <unk> fossils , and by suitable vegetation - both living plants and models . 
 Curiously , it is Hylaeosaurus , from the Cretaceous of England , not Iguanodon , that most resembles the giant iguana stereotype of early ideas of dinosaurs . The model Hylaeosaurus is depicted much like Ankylosaurus , as a smallish quadrupedal herbivore with a <unk> armoured back , and spines along its sides . Hawkins 's depiction is of a large Iguana @-@ like beast with long sharp spines along its back , which Owen noted were " accurately given in the restoration [ by Hawkins , to Owen 's instructions , but ] necessarily at present conjectural " . The head of the Hylaeosaurus model is a fiberglass replica ; the original head is on the ground , on a hill above the ichthyosaur end of the lake . 
 The Ichthyosaurus models are based on Triassic or Jurassic fossils from Europe . Though the three ichthyosaurs are partly in water , they are implausibly shown basking on land like seals . Owen supposed they resembled crocodiles or plesiosaurs . Better fossil evidence shows that they have more in common with sharks , having a dorsal fin and fish @-@ like tail , whereas in Hawkins 's models the tail is a flat protuberance from a straight backbone . A further discrepancy is that the models ' eyes have exposed bony sclerotic plates , Owen conjecturing that with such large eyes they had " great powers of vision , especially in the dusk " . They became one of the three mascots of Crystal Palace Park , along with the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus ( although ichthyosaurs are not dinosaurs ) . The models more closely resemble more basic ichthyosaurs such as <unk> . 
 The Iguanodon models represent fossils from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Europe . Gideon Mantell sketched the original fossil , found in Sussex in 1822 by his wife , Mary Ann Mantell , as like a long slender lizard climbing a branch ( on four legs ) , balancing with a whiplike tail ; lacking a skull , he conjectured that the thumb bone was a nose horn . The nose horn in particular is used repeatedly in popular textbooks and documentaries about dinosaurs to make fun of Victorian inaccuracies ; actually , even in 1854 , Owen commented " the horn [ is ] more than doubtful " . 
 Three Labyrinthodon models were made for Crystal Palace , based on Owen 's guess that , being amphibian in lifestyle , the Triassic animals might have resembled frogs ; he named them Batrachia , from the Greek ' <unk> ' , frog . One is smooth skinned and is based on the species " Labyrinthodon <unk> " ( Mastodonsaurus <unk> ) ; the other two were based on " Labyrinthodon <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) . Casts of <unk> footprints that Owen thought were made by the animals were included in the ground around the models . 
 Gigantic and visually impressive , the Megalosaurus became one of the park 's three ' mascot dinosaurs ' along with the Iguanodon and ( less so ) the <unk> . Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England , consisting mainly of a hip and femur ( thigh bone ) , with a rib and a few vertebrae , Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal ; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal ( standing like Tyrannosaurus rex ) . The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858 , just too late to influence the model . 
 When the models were built , only skulls of the Cretaceous fossil Mosasaurus had been discovered in the Netherlands , so Hawkins only built the head and back of the animal . He submerged the model deep in the lake , leaving the body unseen and undefined . The Mosasaurus at Crystal Palace is positioned in an odd place near the secondary island that was originally a waterfall , and much of it is not visible from the lakeside path . 
 The three Plesiosaurus models represents three species of marine reptile , P. macrocephalus , P. <unk> and P. <unk> , from the Jurassic of England . Two of them have implausibly @-@ flexible necks . 
 Owen noted that the Pterodactylus fossils from the Jurassic of Germany had scales , not feathers , and while " somewhat bird @-@ like " they had conical teeth , suggesting they were predatory . The two surviving models are perched on a rock outcrop ; there were originally two more ' pterodactyls of the Oolite ' . 
 Owen correctly identified <unk> as slender Jurassic Crocodilians with very long thin jaws and small eyes , inferring from the sediment in which they were found that they were " more strictly marine than the crocodile of the Ganges [ the gharial ] . " 
 = = = Cenozoic era = = = 
 <unk> is an extinct mammal from the Eocene to Oligocene epochs , first found near Paris . Hawkins 's models draw on Owen 's speculation about its camel @-@ like appearance . ( They are now thought to be related to hippopotamus and pigs ) . Three models were made , forming a small herd . 
 Megaloceros or Irish Elk is a species from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia . Hawkins built a family unit of male , female and fawn ; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers , long since replaced . Moved from the third island , they had fallen into disrepair as they were in a place easily accessible by vandals . With their original but fragile antlers , the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models ; since they are of recent geological age ( dying out 11 @,@ 000 years ago ) , Hawkins was able to model them on living deer . 
 The giant ground sloth Megatherium is from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America , where Charles Darwin had excavated some fossils in 1835 . The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model 's arm . The arm was replaced and later the tree died . This model used to be in the children 's zoo which has now been demolished . 
 The models of <unk> represent an extinct Eocene mammal thought by Cuvier to be tapir @-@ like . They have suffered the most wear and tear of all of the models , and the standing model no longer looked much like the original made by Hawkins . During the 1960s these models were lying discarded in the bushes about fifty yards from the original site and , prior to the 2002 restoration , they were in such bad shape that they were removed and put into store . Some sources state that these models were added at a later date , but an Illustrated London News illustration of Hawkins 's workshop shows them in the background . Models of the " fearfully great bird " Dinornis of New Zealand ( extinct by 1500 AD ) , and of the extinct elephant @-@ like Mastodon ( <unk> ) of the Miocene and Pliocene of America , were planned for the ' Tertiary Islands ' but not completed . 
 = = In literature and popular culture = = 
 Charles Dickens 's 1853 novel , Bleak House , begins with a description of muddy streets , whose primordial character is emphasized by the first ever mention of any dinosaur in a popular work , Megalosaurus : 
 " Implacable November weather . As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus , forty feet long or so , waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill . " 
 George Baxter , a pioneer of colour printing , made a well @-@ known engraving which imagines Crystal Palace , set in its landscaped grounds with tall fountains and the dinosaurs in the foreground , before the 1854 opening . 
 In H G Wells 's 1905 novel Kipps , Kipps and Ann visit Crystal Palace and sit " in the presence of the green and gold Labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake " to discuss their future . There is a brief description of the dinosaurs and their surroundings and the impact they have on the characters . Several of E. Nesbit 's children 's books reference the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures , and their coming to like , including The Enchanted Castle of 1907 . The 1932 novel Have His <unk> , by Dorothy L. Sayers , has the character Lord Peter Wimsey mention the " antediluvian monsters " of the Crystal Palace . Ann Coates 's 1970 children 's book Dinosaurs Don 't Die , illustrated by John Vernon Lord , tells the story of a young boy who lives near Crystal Palace Park and discovers that Hawkins ' models come to life ; he befriends one of the Iguanodon and names it ' Rock ' and they visit the Natural History Museum . 
 In travel writer Paul Theroux 's 1989 novel My Secret History , the novel 's narrator , Andre Parent , accidentally learns of his wife 's infidelity when his young son , Jack , reveals that he has visited the dinosaurs in the company of his mother 's ' friend ' during Andre 's prolonged absence gathering material for a travel book . The title story in Penelope Lively 's 1991 novel Fanny and the Monsters is about a Victorian girl who visits the Crystal Palace dinosaurs and becomes fascinated by prehistoric creatures . Brett Anderson used the line " So I went and sat in Crystal Palace , by the plastic dinosaurs " on his solo track To The Winter , from his 2007 self @-@ titled album . The Lie Tree , a 2015 children 's mystery @-@ fantasy by Frances Hardinge features a dream scene with some of the dinosaur models coming to life . 
 = Battle of the Strait of Otranto ( 1917 ) = 
 The 1917 Battle of the Strait of Otranto was the result of an Austro @-@ Hungarian raid on the Otranto Barrage , an Allied naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto . The battle took place on 14 – 15 May 1917 , and was the largest surface action in the Adriatic Sea during World War I. The Otranto Barrage was a fixed barrier , composed of lightly armed drifters with anti @-@ submarine nets coupled with minefields and supported by Allied naval patrols . 
 The Austro @-@ Hungarian navy planned to raid the Otranto Barrage with a force of three light cruisers and two destroyers under the command of Commander ( later Admiral ) Miklós Horthy , in an attempt to break the barrier to allow U @-@ boats freer access to the Mediterranean , and Allied shipping . An Allied force composed of ships from three navies responded to the raid and in the ensuing battle , heavily damaged the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Novara . However , the rapid approach of the Austro @-@ Hungarian relief force persuaded Rear Admiral Acton , the Allied commander , to retreat . 
 = = Disposition of forces = = 
 Under the command of Horthy , three Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers : Novara , Saida , and Helgoland , modified to resemble large British destroyers , were to attack the drifters on the night of 14 May and attempt to destroy as many as possible before daybreak . The destroyers Csepel and Balaton were to mount a diversionary raid off the Albanian coast in order to confuse any Allied counter @-@ attack . Two Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats — U @-@ 4 and U @-@ 27 , along with the German U @-@ boat UC @-@ 25 — were to participate in the operation as well . A supporting force composed of the armored cruiser Sankt Georg , two destroyers , and a number of torpedo boats was on standby if the raiders ran into trouble . The old pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Budapest and a screen of torpedo boats were also available if necessary . 
 An Allied destroyer patrol was in the area on the night of 14 May , to the north of the Barrage . The Italian flotilla leader Mirabello was accompanied by the French destroyers Commandant Rivière , Bisson , and <unk> . The Italian destroyer Borea was also in the area , escorting a small convoy to Valona . A support force was based in the port of Brindisi , consisting of the British cruisers Dartmouth and Bristol and several French and Italian destroyers . 
 = = Raid on the drifters = = 
 The Italian convoy escorted by Borea was attacked by the Austro @-@ Hungarian destroyers Csepel and Balaton at approximately 03 : 24 . The Austro @-@ Hungarians sank Borea and a munitions ship , and a second was set on fire and abandoned . 
 The three cruisers were able to pass through the line of drifters , and at 03 : 30 began attacking the small barrage ships . The Austro @-@ Hungarians frequently gave the drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire . In some instances , the drifter crews chose to fight : Gowan Lee returned fire on the <unk> @-@ Hungarian ships . The ship was heavily damaged , but remained afloat ; her captain — Joseph Watt — was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle . 
 There were 47 drifters in Barrage on the night of 14 May ; the Austro @-@ Hungarians managed to sink 14 drifters and damage four more . The lack of sufficient Allied escorts forced the withdrawal of the remaining blockading ships , although only for a short time . 
 = = Battle = = 
 By this time , the Allied naval forces in the area were aware of the raid , and were in a position to block the Austro @-@ Hungarian retreat . Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton — the commanding officer of the Italian Scouting Division — ordered Mirabello 's group southward at 04 : 35 , while he embarked on the British light cruiser HMS Dartmouth . By 06 : 45 , the cruisers Dartmouth and Bristol — along with the Italian destroyers <unk> , Pilo , <unk> , <unk> , and Aquila — were sailing north in an attempt to cut off the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers . The Italian light cruiser Marsala , the flotilla leader <unk> , and the destroyers <unk> , Indomito , and <unk> were readying to sail in support as well . 
 The Mirabello group engaged the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers at 07 : 00 , but were heavily outgunned , and instead attempted to shadow the fleeing cruisers . At 07 : 45 , Rear Admiral Acton 's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton . After 20 minutes , the Italian destroyers were able to close the distance to the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships ; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship 's boilers . By this time , the Austro @-@ Hungarian destroyers were under the cover of the coastal batteries at Durazzo , and were able to make good their escape . 
 At 09 : 00 , Bristol 's lookouts spotted the smoke from the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers to the south of her position . The Allied ships turned to engage the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships ; the British ships had both a superiority in numbers and in firepower ; Dartmouth was armed with eight 6 in ( 150 mm ) guns and Bristol had two 6 inch and ten 4 in ( 100 mm ) , compared to the nine 3 @.@ 9 in ( 99 mm ) guns on each of the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships . Unfortunately for the Allies , their numerical superiority was quickly lost , as their destroyers were either occupied with mechanical problems , or protecting those destroyers suffering from breakdowns . The support forces of both sides — the Sankt Georg group for the Austro @-@ Hungarians , and the Marsala group for the Allies — were quickly dispatched to the battle . 
 Dartmouth — faster than Bristol — closed to effective engagement range with the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships , and opened fire . A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara , at which point the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance . Dartmouth was struck several times , and by 11 : 00 , Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up . Novara was hit several more times , and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged , which caused the ship to begin losing speed . At 11 : 05 , Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland . At this point , Sankt Georg was approaching the scene , which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces . This break in the action was enough time for the Austro @-@ Hungarians to save the crippled Novara ; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them . 
 Unaware that Novara had been disabled , and fearing that his ships would be drawn too close to the Austrian naval base at Cattaro , Acton broke off the pursuit . The destroyer <unk> misread the signal , and attempted to launch a torpedo attack , but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara , Saida , and Helgoland . At 12 : 05 , Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in , but by this time , the Sankt Georg group was too close . The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara , Saida , and Helgoland , and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well . The entire group returned to Cattaro together . 
 At 13 : 30 , the submarine UC @-@ 25 torpedoed Dartmouth , causing serious damage . The escorting destroyers forced UC @-@ 25 from the area , but Dartmouth had to be abandoned for a period of time , before it could be towed back to port . The French destroyer <unk> attempted to pursue the German submarine , but struck a mine laid by UC @-@ 25 that morning and sank rapidly . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As a result of the raid , it was decided by the British naval command that unless sufficient destroyers were available to protect the barrage , the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night . The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day , and would have to leave their positions by 15 : 00 every day . Despite the damage received by the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol , the Austro @-@ Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade . In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters , the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC @-@ 25 , the French destroyer <unk> was mined and sunk , and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted . 
 However , in a strategic sense , the battle had little impact on the war . The barrage was never particularly effective at preventing the U @-@ boat operations of Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary in the first place . The drifters could cover approximately .5 mi ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) apiece ; of the 40 mi ( 64 km ) -wide Strait , only slightly more than ½ was covered . The raid risked some of the most advanced units of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet on an operation that offered minimal strategic returns .

The entire length of NY 148 is named Quaker Road and maintained by Niagara County as part of County Route 15 ( CR 15 ) . The concurrent county route number is unsigned , as are all county routes in Niagara County . NY 148 was assigned in 1960 , supplementing the preexisting CR 15 .

 NY 148 begins at an intersection with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) and Quaker Road in the town of Hartland , just east of the Hartland Central Cemetery . The highway proceeds north through Hartland as a two @-@ lane rural road , maintained by Niagara County as part of the unsigned CR 15 . NY 148 proceeds north , running along a short residential strip before the intersection with Chapman Road . After Chapman Road , NY 148 continues to pass homes until its junction with Seaman Road , where it enters more rural surroundings . The route crosses a canal as it proceeds northward through Hartland , bending northeast into the town of Somerset at Town Line Road . 
 In Somerset , NY 148 remains a two @-@ lane roadway , passing through sparsely developed areas on its way to the village of Barker . In the southern part of the community , the route meets Coleman and West Somerset roads ( CR 2 and CR 3 , respectively ) . Through Barker , NY 148 is a two @-@ lane residential street , passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School . After Haight Road , NY 148 leaves the village , continuing north through a lightly populated area . At Arlington Road , the number of homes along NY 148 rises once again as the route enters the hamlet of Somerset , located at the junction of NY 148 and NY 18 ( Lake Road ) . This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY 148 , while CR 15 continues north through Somerset towards Lake Ontario .

 Quaker Road was established as a north – south highway between Hartland and Somerset sometime prior to 1897 . By 1915 , the segment of Quaker Road between Ridge Road and Lake Road in the hamlet of Somerset was taken over by Niagara County and designated as CR 15 . On March 10 , 1915 , the county awarded a contract worth $ 65 @,@ 258 ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 53 million in 2016 ) to rebuild the highway .

The project finished slightly over @-@ budget with a final cost of $ 65 @,@ 554 ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 53 million in 2016 ) . A celebration commemorating the completion of the rebuilt road was organized by the Barker Chamber of Commerce and held on December 6 , 1915 . The portion of Quaker Road between Ridge and Lake roads ( then U.S. Route 104 and NY 18 , respectively ) was designated as NY 148 by the state of New York in 1960 ; however , ownership and maintenance of the route remained in the hands of Niagara County .

 = McDonnell XF @-@ 85 Goblin = 
 The McDonnell XF @-@ 85 Goblin was an American prototype fighter aircraft conceived during World War II by McDonnell Aircraft . It was intended to be deployed from the bomb bay of the giant Convair B @-@ 36 bomber as a parasite fighter . The XF @-@ 85 's intended role was to defend bombers from hostile interceptor aircraft , a need demonstrated during World War II . Two prototypes were constructed before the program was terminated . 
 The XF @-@ 85 was a response to a United States Army Air Forces ' ( USAAF ) requirement for a fighter to be carried within the Northrop XB @-@ 35 and B @-@ 36 , then under development . This was to address the limited range of existing interceptor aircraft compared to the greater range of new bomber designs . The XF @-@ 85 was a diminutive jet aircraft featuring a distinctive egg @-@ shaped fuselage and a forked @-@ tail stabilizer design . The prototypes were built and underwent testing and evaluation in 1948 . Flight tests showed promise in the design , but the aircraft 's performance was inferior to the jet fighters it would have faced in combat , and there were difficulties in docking . The XF @-@ 85 was swiftly canceled , and the prototypes were thereafter relegated to museum exhibits . The 1947 successor to the USAAF , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) , continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft under Project MX @-@ 106 " Tip Tow " , Project FICON and Project " Tom @-@ Tom " following the cancellation . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 During World War II , American bombers such as the Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress , Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator and Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress were protected by long @-@ range escort fighters such as the Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt and North American P @-@ 51 Mustang . These fighters could not match the range of the Northrop B @-@ 35 or Convair B @-@ 36 , the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) . The development cost for longer @-@ ranged fighters was high , while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult . Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific , giving further impetus to innovative approaches . 
 The USAAF considered a number of different options including the use of remotely piloted vehicles before choosing parasite fighters as the most viable B @-@ 36 defense . The concept of a parasite fighter had its origins in 1918 , when the Royal Air Force examined the viability of Sopwith Camel parasite fighters operating from <unk> airships . In the 1930s , the U.S. Navy had a short @-@ lived operational parasite fighter , the Curtiss <unk> Sparrowhawk , aboard the airships Akron and Macon . Starting in 1931 , aircraft designer Vladimir <unk> conducted experiments in the Soviet Union as part of the Zveno project during which up to five fighters of various types were carried by Polikarpov TB @-@ 2 and Tupolev TB @-@ 3 bombers . In August 1941 , these combinations flew the only combat missions ever undertaken by parasite fighters – TB @-@ 3s carrying Polikarpov I @-@ <unk> dive bombers attacked the Cernavodă bridge and <unk> docks , in Romania . After that attack , the squadron , based in the Crimea , carried out a tactical attack on a bridge over the river Dnieper at <unk> , which had been captured by advancing German troops . Later in World War II , the Luftwaffe experimented with the Messerschmitt Me 328 as a parasite fighter , but problems with its <unk> engines could not be overcome . Other late @-@ war rocket @-@ powered parasite fighter projects such as the Arado E.381 and <unk> So 344 were unrealized " paper projects " . 
 On 3 December 1942 , the USAAF sent out a Request for Proposals ( <unk> ) for a diminutive piston @-@ engined fighter . By January 1944 , the Air Technical Service Command refined the <unk> and in January 1945 , the specifications were further revised in MX @-@ 472 to specify a jet @-@ powered aircraft . Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft , McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements . The company 's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications . 
 The initial concept for the Model 27 was for the fighter to be carried half @-@ exposed under the B @-@ 29 , B @-@ 35 or B @-@ 36 . The USAAF rejected this proposal , citing increased drag , and hence reduced range for the composite bomber @-@ fighter configuration . On 19 March 1945 , McDonnell 's design team led by Herman D. <unk> , submitted a revised proposal , the extensively redesigned Model <unk> . The smaller aircraft had an egg @-@ shaped fuselage , three fork @-@ shaped vertical stabilizers , horizontal stabilizers with a significant dihedral , and 37 ° swept @-@ back folding wings to allow it to fit in the confines of a bomb bay . The diminutive aircraft measured 14 ft 10 in ( 4 @.@ 52 m ) long ; the folding wings spanned 21 ft ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) . Only a limited fuel supply of 112 US gal ( 93 imp gal ; 420 l ) was deemed necessary for the specified 30 @-@ minute combat endurance . A hook was installed along the aircraft 's center of gravity ; in flight , it retracted to lie flat in the upper part of the nose . The aircraft had an empty weight just short of 4 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 t ) . To save weight , the fighter had no landing gear . During the testing program , a fixed steel skid under the fuselage and spring @-@ steel " runners " at the underside of the wingtips were installed in case of an emergency landing . Despite the cramped quarters , a pilot was provided with a cordite ejection seat , bail @-@ out oxygen bottle and high @-@ speed ribbon parachute . Four .50 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns in the nose made up the aircraft 's armament . 
 In service , the parasite fighter would be launched and retrieved by a trapeze . With the trapeze fully extended , the engine would be <unk> and the release from the mother ship was accomplished by the pilot pulling the nose back to disengage from the hook . In recovery , the aircraft would approach the mother ship from underneath and link up with the trapeze using the retractable hook in the aircraft 's nose . The anticipated production shift would see a mixed B @-@ 36 fleet with both " fighter carriers " and bombers employed on missions . There were plans that , from the 24th B @-@ 36 onward , provisions would be made to accommodate one XF @-@ 85 , with a maximum of four per bomber envisioned . Up to 10 percent of the B @-@ 36s on order were to be converted to fighter carriers with three or four F @-@ 85s instead of a bomb load . 
 On 9 October 1945 , the USAAF signed a letter of intent covering the engineering development for two prototypes ( US serial numbers 46 @-@ 523 / 4 ) , although the contract was not finalized until February 1947 . After the successful conclusion of two reviews of a wooden mock @-@ up in 1946 and 1947 by USAAF engineering staff , McDonnell constructed two prototypes in late 1947 . The Model <unk> was re @-@ designated XP @-@ 85 , but by June 1948 , it was changed to XF @-@ 85 and given the name " Goblin " . There were plans to acquire 30 production P @-@ 85s , but the USAAF took the cautious approach – if test results from the two prototypes were positive , production orders for more than 100 Goblins would be finalized later . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 During wind tunnel testing at Moffett Field , California , the first prototype XF @-@ 85 was accidentally dropped from a crane at a height of 40 ft ( 12 m ) , causing substantial damage to the forward fuselage , air intake and lower fuselage . The second prototype had to be substituted for the remainder of the wind tunnel tests and the initial flight tests . 
 As a production series B @-@ 36 was unavailable , all XF @-@ 85 flight tests were carried out using a converted EB @-@ 29B Superfortress mother ship that had a modified , " cutaway " bomb bay complete with trapeze , front airflow deflector and an array of camera equipment and instrumentation . Since the EB @-@ 29B , named Monstro , was smaller than the B @-@ 36 , the XF @-@ 85 would be flight tested , half @-@ exposed . In order to carry the XF @-@ 85 , a special " loading pit " was dug into the tarmac at South Base , Muroc Field , where all the flight tests originated . On 23 July 1948 , the XF @-@ 85 flew the first of five captive flights , designed to test whether the EB @-@ 29B and its parasite fighter could fly " mated " . The XF @-@ 85 was carried in a stowed position , but was sometimes tethered and extended into the airstream with the engine off , for the pilot to gain some feel for the aircraft in flight . 
 McDonnell test pilot Edwin Schoch was assigned to the project , riding in the XF @-@ 85 while it was stowed aboard the EB @-@ 29B , before attempting a " free " flight on 23 August 1948 . After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 000 m ) , he completed a 10 @-@ minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250 mph ( 290 – 400 km / h ) , testing controls and maneuverability . When he attempted a hook @-@ up , it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber 's turbulence , as well as being affected by the air cushion created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity . Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect . After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze , Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off . He saved the prototype by making a belly landing on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc . All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF @-@ 85 was repaired and modified . Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem @-@ free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P @-@ 80 Shooting Star fighter . 
 After boosting the trim power by 50 percent , adjusting the aerodynamics , and other modifications , two further mated test flights were carried out before Schoch was able to make a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948 . During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948 , Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber 's trapeze , aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF @-@ 85 's nose . Again , a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc . 
 With the first prototype 's repairs completed , it also joined the flight test program , completing captive flights . While in flight , the Goblin was stable , easy to fly , and recoverable from spins , although initial estimates of a 648 mph ( 1 @,@ 043 km / h ) top speed proved optimistic . The first test flights revealed that turbulence during approach to the B @-@ 29 was significant , leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage , as well as two wingtip fins to compensate for the increased directional instability in docking . All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position , but when the hook was stowed and later raised , the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a hookup . To address the problem , small aerodynamic fairings were added to the hook well that reduced the buffeting when the hook was extended and retracted . When testing resumed , on the 18 March 1948 test flight , Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up , striking and damaging the trapeze 's nose @-@ stabilizing section , before resorting to another emergency belly landing . After repairs to the trapeze , Schoch flew the first prototype on 8 April 1949 , completing a 30 @-@ minute free flight test , but after three attempts , abandoned his efforts and resorted to another belly landing at Muroc . 
 Aware of the problems revealed in flight tests , McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0 @.@ 9 capability , using alternatively a 35 ° swept wing and delta wing . McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship . Before any further work on the trapeze , other modifications to the XF @-@ 85 , or continued design studies on its follow @-@ up could be carried out , the USAF canceled the XF @-@ 85 program on 24 October 1949 . 
 Two main reasons contributed to the cancellation . The XF @-@ 85 's deficiencies revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters , and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected . The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also a factor in the cancellation . The two Goblins flew seven times , with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup . Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft . 
 = = Further developments = = 
 Despite the cancellation of the XF @-@ 85 , the USAF continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft as defensive fighters through a series of projects including Project MX @-@ 106 " Tip Tow " , Project FICON , and Project " Tom @-@ Tom " which involved fighter aircraft attached to bomber aircraft by their wingtips . Project FICON ( " fighter conveyor " ) emerged as an effective Convair GRB @-@ <unk> and Republic RF @-@ <unk> Thunderflash combined bomber @-@ reconnaissance @-@ fighter , although the role was changed to that of strategic reconnaissance . Project FICON drew heavily on data from the abortive XF @-@ 85 project and closely followed McDonnell 's recommendations in designing a more refined trapeze . A total of 10 converted B @-@ 36s and 25 reconnaissance fighters saw limited service with the Strategic Air Command in 1955 – 1956 , before being supplemented by more effective aircraft and satellite systems .

 After the program 's termination , the two XF @-@ 85 prototypes were stored , before being <unk> and relegated to museum display in 1950 .

Following the cancellation of the program , the aircraft was transferred to the museum on 23 August 1950 and was one of the first experimental aircraft to be displayed at the new Air Force Museum . For several decades , the aircraft was displayed alongside the museum 's Convair B @-@ 36 . In 2000 , the aircraft was moved to the museum 's Experimental Aircraft Hangar . Museum staff and visitors objected to this move , believing the aircraft should be displayed alongside the B @-@ 36 to properly represent its original design intentions .

It was originally transferred to the Norton Air Force Base ( near San Bernardino , California ) in 1950 , still in a damaged state after its last emergency landing .

 = Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force = 
 Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Valve Software 's science fiction first @-@ person shooter video game Half @-@ Life . The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19 , 1999 . Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half @-@ Life and was first announced in April 1999 . Randy Pitchford , the lead designer on the game , later noted that he believed Gearbox was selected to develop Opposing Force because Valve wanted to concentrate on their future projects . Over the course of development , Gearbox brought in a variety of outside talent from other areas of the video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design . 
 Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half @-@ Life , but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine , one of the enemy characters in the original game . The player character , Adrian Shephard , is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens , but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units . 
 Opposing Force was received well by critics , many describing it as the new benchmark title for expansion packs , in a similar fashion to how Half @-@ Life revolutionized the first @-@ person shooter genre . Other reviewers , however , thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs , although it was still regarded as an exceptional add @-@ on . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As an expansion pack for Half @-@ Life , Opposing Force is a first @-@ person shooter . The overall gameplay of Opposing Force does not significantly differ from that of Half @-@ Life : players are required to navigate through the game 's levels , fight hostile non @-@ player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance . The game continues Half @-@ Life 's methods of an unbroken narrative . The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains in control of the player character for almost all of the game . Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes . Progress through the game 's world is continuous ; although the game is divided up into chapters , the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment . Opposing Force also features an extended multiplayer , incorporating the various new environments and weapons into the original deathmatch mode used in Half @-@ Life . After release , a new capture the flag mode with additional levels , items and powerups , was created by Gearbox for the game . 
 For the most part the player battles through the single @-@ player game alone , but is occasionally assisted by friendly non @-@ player characters . Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information . However , Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far greater degree than security guards . Three types of Marines are featured in the game : the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun , shotgun or machine gun , the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non @-@ player characters , while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles , allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered . A selection of enemies from Half @-@ Life populate the game , including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts . 
 A variety of new alien non @-@ player characters , labelled " Race X " , appear in the game as well , often engaging in combat with the aliens from Xen . The player also encounters human opponents in the form of a detachment of black operations units who have been sent to destroy the base in the wake of the failure of the U.S. Marines to eliminate the alien threat . A limited selection of Half @-@ Life 's weaponry is allocated to the player to defend themselves with , although several new weapons such as a sniper rifle , combat knife and a variety of alien weaponry are also present in the game . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Opposing Force is set in the same location and timeframe as that of Half @-@ Life , taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility . In Half @-@ Life , the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman , a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter @-@ dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen , allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility . The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal , ultimately traveling to Xen to do so . Opposing Force , however , shows the events of Half @-@ Life from the perspective of a different protagonist . The player assumes the role of Adrian Shephard , a U.S. Marine Corporal assigned to the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit , a specialized unit sent in to Black Mesa by the government to quell the alien threat and silence all witnesses . However , after Shephard becomes isolated from his fellow Marines , he must ally with the Black Mesa personnel and attempt to escape the base . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Opposing Force opens with Shephard riding on a V @-@ 22 Osprey with his squad . His squad discuss their deployment , somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for . However , as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa , airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation , causing Shephard 's Osprey to crash land . Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay , tended to by the science team , learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out . Consequently , Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility . However , Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G @-@ Man , forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him . 
 Other Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa 's Lambda Complex , but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors . Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive , and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half @-@ Life . To escape the teleportation chamber , Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal , briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility . The facility is now heavily damaged , and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race , Race X , has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion , attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately . Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies . 
 Shephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base , and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility 's storage unit , but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units . A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base , thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it . After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit , Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas , intent on escape . However , the G @-@ Man <unk> the device as Shephard departs . The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units , and although Shephard manages to evade them , he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path . 
 At the portal , Shephard discovers a gene worm , a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion . Shephard is able to kill the creature , but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G @-@ Man . As the G @-@ Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments , the nuclear device detonates in the background , destroying Black Mesa . The game closes with the G @-@ Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed , pending further evaluation .

 Half @-@ Life : Opposing Force was first announced by developer Gearbox Software on April 15 , 1999 . In their press release , founder Randy Pitchford stated that " our number one goal is to preserve the integrity of Half @-@ Life and provide new experiences that expand upon the sensation of the original " , and also announced that the expansion pack would allow the player to play as one of the soldiers featured in the original game . The name Opposing Force has a double meaning , referring both to the fact that the player is now one of the enemies in the original game , as well as to Newton 's third law of motion . In a later interview , Pitchford stated that he believed that Valve Software offered Gearbox the chance to make a Half @-@ Life expansion was from a wish " to focus on their future titles " . In addition , Pitchford commented that Valve and Gearbox had agreed not to " severely modify " the game engine used by Half @-@ Life and Opposing Force as it " risks breaking all of the wonderful work " that the game 's custom content community was creating . Substantial information on Opposing Force 's development direction , as well as new locations , characters and story were revealed at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo convention . The official website for Opposing Force , hosted by publisher Sierra Studios , was put online in July 1999 . 
 Over the course of the game 's development , Gearbox acquired various outside talent to assist in designing some aspects of the game . In June 1999 , Gearbox announced that the successful level designer Richard Gray would be assisting in developing the multiplayer aspects of the game . Several other designers subsequently joined the project in September 1999 , with collective experience from the development of Daikatana , Quake II , Doom and Shadow Warrior . In the subsequent two months , media releases displaying a variety of screenshots were unveiled . The game was released on November 19 , 1999 . Gearbox later released a multiplayer update in May 2000 , adding a new capture the flag mode to the game , along with various new items to accompany the new mode . Opposing Force was later released on Valve Software 's Steam content delivery system . Opposing Force was also published as part of Sierra 's Half @-@ Life : Generation compilation in 2002 , and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts ' Half Life 1 : Anthology on September 26 , 2005 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Opposing Force received a very favorable reception from critics , holding a score of 85 @.@ 45 % on the review aggregator site GameRankings . Although figures for the game 's sales on Steam have not been released , Opposing Force has sold over 1 @.@ 1 million copies at retail . 
 Computer and Video Games reviewer Kim Randell noted that " Gearbox has obviously gone to great pains to provide a similar experience to the original " . Praise was also given to the game 's multiplayer ; Randell stated that the new additions for multiplayer made it the area of Opposing Force that " really shines " . Randell closed the review by concluding that Opposing Force is " an awesome achievement " . Erik Wolpaw , writing for GameSpot , noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre , " it 's appropriate that Gearbox Software 's Opposing Force , the official expansion for the genre @-@ redefining Half @-@ Life , in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action @-@ game mission packs " . Wolpaw praised the design of the single @-@ player campaign , commenting that " you can sense the designers ' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another , and it compels you to keep playing " . Although criticizing some elements of the game 's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as " merely window dressing " , the review concluded that Opposing Force was an " impassioned application of creative design " . 
 Other reviews echoed many of the positive aspects of the game . GamePro stated that " Gearbox has done one hell of a job in creating not just an add @-@ on for Half @-@ Life , but a continuation of a masterpiece " , praising both level design and story elements , but noted that it was a little too short . However , some critics dissented on the idea that Opposing Force was as influential as other reviewers made out . 
 PC Zone stated that " the taste left in the mouth is a bitter one " , noting that " Opposing Force is a few excellent ideas strung together by pedestrian Half @-@ Life padding " , but concluded that " it was still a good weekend 's worth of entertainment " . Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs , commenting that " χ amount of new content has been created and it is going to be cut into the old content in a linear way to make it look like an all new game " , but noted that " fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force ... is pretty damn good " . Although praising the level design as the game 's strongest point , the reviewer felt that " towards the end of the game ... they were running out of development time " . Reviewing for IGN , Vincent Lopez stated that the game " does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why you enjoyed the original so much " , but criticized this as the biggest drawback , commenting that " you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience " , but concluded that " for good , and bad : it 's good to be back " . The game won several publication awards , as well as the Computer Game of the Year Interactive Achievement Award of 2000 from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences .

 " Nest of Angels " is the second episode of the second series of the British espionage television series Spooks , and the eighth episode overall . It was originally broadcast on BBC Three on 2 June 2003 , and repeated on frontline channel BBC One on 9 June . The episode was written by Howard Brenton , and directed by Bharat Nalluri . The episode centres on MI5 's actions in stopping Muhammed Rachid ( <unk> Marshall ) , a radicalised mullah in a mosque and community centre in Birmingham , who they believe is recruiting young suicide bombers . After their previous asset is discovered and brutally expelled , the team turn to Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun ( Alexander Siddig ) , an Algerian agent who left his country to work with the British . 
 Brenton came up with the idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists . Brenton and the producers researched elements of Islam in order to provide a balanced view towards the religion , as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode who oppose the extremists among their religion . Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham , it was filmed entirely in London . The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed ( Nicola Walker ) , and the return of Christine Dale ( Megan Dodds ) , who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character 's role can be expanded . 
 The episode was seen by 7 @.@ 87 million following its broadcast on BBC One , however , despite the measures used to provide the balanced view , it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims , among them the Muslim Council of Britain , for fear that the episode would incite Islamophobia . Nearly a thousand complaints were made , although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims who opposed the episode did not understand the context . 
 = = Plot = = 
 MI5 plant an asset Johnny Patel ( San <unk> ) at the Parkmount mosque and community centre in Birmingham to follow Muhammed Rachid , an Afghan @-@ born mullah who is acting more hostile to the West . Johnny however , is discovered to be a spy , and is thrown to the surveillance van outside as a result . Tom Quinn ( Matthew Macfadyen ) questions him in hospital , learning that the mullah is recruiting suicide bombers , however the stress of the questioning results in a cerebral hemorrhage . Superior Harry Pearce ( Peter Firth ) pressures Tom to find another agent . He turns to Tessa Phillips ( Jenny Agutter ) , now a manager at a security firm since she was fired in the first series finale for running phantom agents for monetary gain . However , she refuses to help . 
 Later , new officer Ruth Evershed , transferred from Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , informs the team that Metropolitan Police have arrested Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun , an Algerian secret service agent . After his release Khaldun reveals that since the death of his family , he desired to leave Algeria to work for British intelligence , so he fooled his agency into believing he was killed while stopping a jihadist group in France , before smuggling himself into England via a Channel Tunnel freight train . The team allow him to work undercover in Parkmount , posing as a labourer at the local university , where he quickly gains Rachid 's trust . Beforehand however , Khaldun removes all the surveillance equipment on him . Furthermore , news of Khaldun 's arrival also gains the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , who also wish to use him . 
 In the meantime , Danny Hunter ( David Oyelowo ) persuades Tom to go on a date with Vicky Westbrook ( Natasha Little ) , a nurse introduced in the previous episode , in order to get over Ellie Simm , Tom 's previous girlfriend who broke up with him . Although Tom asks her out for dinner , the two end up having sex . Zoe Reynolds ( Keeley Hawes ) continues seeing Carlo Franceschini ( Enzo Cilenti ) , also introduced in the previous episode , at a bar . 
 When Khaldun fails to meet with Tom , the team worry that he had deceived them . However , that night , Khaldun sneaks into Tom 's bedroom at the university campus , and warns him that Rachid is keeping explosives , and a suicide attack will take place the next day , but will not disclose where . Tom turns to Parkmount 's imam Fazul Azzam ( Roshan Seth ) , who opposes Rachid 's radicalised views . After learning <unk> 's daughter Aminah ( Praveen <unk> ) is involved , he forces her into revealing the location of the planned attack . Rachid is placed under arrest when explosives are found in his prayer room . Khaldun meanwhile , kills Rachid 's men in an empty building , and attempts to disarm the bomber , young Abu Hassan ( <unk> Husein ) , but he runs away into a playground . As Tom 's team and local police surround the playground , Khaldun attempts to talk Abu out of the attack . However , when he fails , Khaldun throws himself as Abu detonates the bomb , in order to avoid further casualties . Later , CIA liaison Christine Dale voices disappointment towards Khaldun 's death , but appears grateful that Tom is unharmed .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 The story idea came from writer Howard Brenton , who wanted to delve into the world of suicide bombings , a significant issue in national security . It became the first episode in Spooks that explicitly portrays Islamic extremism , which Oyelowo described as a " hot potato " because of this sensitive issue . The actor was also worried that the plot may " put ideas into people 's heads " after the audience would watch the episode . Brenton heavily researched the episode to provide a balanced view . He included characters , such as innocent Muslims who opposed the Islamic extremists , as well as a " Muslim hero " who would thwart the terrorists . The writer still wrote " Nest of Angels " as a classic spy story , where an operative goes undercover to subvert a villainous operation . Director Bharat Nalluri felt that making the hero a Muslim exemplified the balanced view . Series creator David Wolstencroft meanwhile , emphasised that the episode not only showed Islamic extremism , but a more peaceful side of the religion as well , and that the producers should not shy away from those issues . 
 To further provide the fair and balanced view of the topic , script editor Karen Wilson furthered her research by consulting with a Muslim advisor throughout the scripting and filming stages , as well as consulting the Muslims who played extras in the episode . Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand , it was the first time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline , and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes . It was also based on real life instances , something that Brenton considered a hallmark of the series , as many episodes are based on such events . News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode 's broadcast , and the producers believed it justified the episode . The ending was written to be melancholic , in which there were no winners . 
 In writing the pre @-@ title sequence of the episode , Brenton wanted to include a " frightening thriller set up " where spies would listen in as an agent is undercover , and be absolutely helpless to aid the agent when he is in trouble , yet be nearby as this happens . He also wanted the audience to admire the villains , especially from the conversation between Tom and Rachid . Furthermore , the episode exemplifies Tom 's brutality in his professional life ; in one scene Tom questions Johnny who is recovering in hospital , but came to want the information more than care for his wellbeing . 
 The episode also further explores the Grid characters ' private lives , however some of the ideas had to be dropped due to the amount of plot towards the main storyline . " Nest of Angels " continues the relationship between Tom and Vicky Westbrook which began in the previous episode . Vicky was included more in the episode , and it further delved into her personality , namely she differs vastly from Ellie Simm , Tom 's previous girlfriend , who was depicted as more of a normal human being ; Vicky was portrayed as more " <unk> " and " insane " who would often <unk> Tom . The producers also decided to introduce a potential relationship between Danny and Sam Buxton ( Shauna Macdonald ) . However , the idea was dropped later in the series as it " never seemed to click . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The episode included a guest appearance from Alexander Siddig , who played the " Muslim hero " Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun . Siddig was already well known as playing regular character Julian Bashir in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . The producers viewed Siddig as a " noble " actor when he was playing the character . Siddig described the role as a " godsend " to him , because it enabled him to " portray various aspects of an Arab man who was readily credible . He came out of a new identity I was looking for , trying to take a snapshot of this guy before he disappears . He was my father . He was your father . He was the father of all the generations that had a liberal upbringing and didn 't make a lot of money . " Roshan Seth played imam Fazul Azzam ; he was cast because Brenton wanted him to appear in the episode . Meanwhile , <unk> Husain played the bomber Abu Hassan . The producers felt that the child actor was " a find " for them ; it was his first television appearance , but they believed his performance " carried it off . " 
 The episode also marks the return of American actress Megan Dodds , who first appeared in a handful of scenes in the first episode of the first series . The producers enjoyed the actress ' company , and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series . Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips ; it allows the audience to see what happens to her since her sacking in the first series finale . The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed , played by Nicola Walker . The producers needed another " interesting , strong " member of the team following Tessa 's departure . The character also came from GCHQ in the series ; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70 @,@ 000 people , and the producers did not want to ignore this aspect of British intelligence gathering . Describing Walker 's casting , producer Jane Featherstone recalled " Nicola is extraordinary in it . I think she 's completely brilliant . And she 's developed that and I think once Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part , and she 's really made it her own . " The character was created by Brenton . Her introduction depicted her as clumsy , mirroring the writer . 
 = = = Filming and soundtrack = = = 
 The episode was directed Bharat Nalluri ; he continued to portray a balanced approach towards Muslims during filming . Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham , it was all filmed in London . The mosque interior was shot at the basement of a building in Portland Place , while another street of terraced houses was used to double a typical residential street in the city . One of its most best looking houses doubled the home of Fazul and Aminah . Other scenes were shot in Kensington Gardens , with one of them being filmed in front of the park 's Peter Pan statue . The scenes leading up to Abu 's suicide attack was filmed at a playground . The scenes were originally set to be shot at a shopping centre , but it was deemed " unfilmable . " Producers later considered using a bus , but they thought that too was impractical . The final scenes of the episode were shot at the shore of the River Thames near the National Film Theatre , which houses a beach during low tide . The shootout scene between Khaldun and Rachid 's men was among the last to be shot . In addition , the producers made use of actual news footage following a suicide attack in Israel , in order to show the audience the consequences of such attacks . 
 Filming the pre @-@ title sequence went through some alterations . One of the scenes saw Johnny being foot whipped , however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality . Also , when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards , Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown to the top of the surveillance van , which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them . Later on in the episode , Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots , which shows Khaldun 's actions while he narrates them to MI5 . In one scene , Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door . However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom . Following the broadcast of the episode , the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup , as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement . They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn @-@ Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box , which they thought was a more obvious example . Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery . 
 The episode 's soundtrack was composed by Jennie Muskett , who also composed for the series . When reviewing the scenes leading to the conclusion she felt sympathetic towards the suicide bomber , and wanted to portray the background music through the bomber 's point of view . Muskett also hired vocalist Paul Gladstone @-@ Reed to become the voice behind his emotions . In addition , regular pieces of the soundtrack were reused throughout much of the episode . Muskett saw the episode as among the most rewarding she worked on .

 = = = Controversy = = = 
 The episode gained a considerable amount of controversy , largely by Muslims who believed the episode showed Islam in a negative light , and that it could incite Islamophobia . Following the broadcast of the episode on BBC Three , the BBC received around 800 complaints , of which 500 of them were telephone calls , and 300 were emails , and a further 150 complaints were made after the BBC One repeat , totalling nearly one thousand complaints . The complaints made on its original broadcast appealed to the BBC not to repeat it on BBC One . The corporation chose not to drop the episode from the schedules . However , since fewer complaints were made after the repeat , members of the broadcasters believed that viewers realised the content was not as bad as expected . Inayat <unk> , the media secretary for the Muslim Council of Britain , stated " We can 't deny that the BBC have a right to screen a drama about this – it is topical , " but " It is the treatment of the subject that will lead to attacks . " 
 Following the episode , a Muslim student in Birmingham was assaulted by two attackers , who said " you have been spooked . " Furthermore , the Birmingham Central Mosque was vandalised , with the slogan " suicide bombers inside – kill the bombers " in graffiti . The BBC however denied that the episode had influence on the incidents , and West Midlands Police ruled that there was no evidence linking the attacks to the programme . The BBC further defended the episode , by stating the Muslim involvement towards making it , and that it does not suggest that mosques breed terrorists . In July 2003 , the Broadcasting Standards Commission dismissed some of the complaints as the episode was presented as a drama and not a factual account . 
 In the Friday before the BBC One repeat , <unk> wrote to Lorraine Heggessey , the BBC One controller , stating " the programme , which was of a very sensational nature , unfortunately only serves to reinforce many negative stereotypes of British Muslims . Instead of being a well @-@ informed piece of film @-@ making , this episode of Spooks pandered to grossly offensive and Islamophobic caricatures of imams , Muslim students and mosques , " and warned that the " increased amount of Islamophobia that is sure to result from the broadcasting of this programme at peak @-@ time is wholly unacceptable and a gross violation of your responsibilities as a public service broadcaster . " Heggessey however , argued that the episode presented a balance view and that it fell " legitimately within the story lines of Spooks . " Also , <unk> Ali of the Islamic Society of Britain claimed that the episode " adds fuel to the fire of already negative perceptions of Muslims and fans the flames of British National Party rhetoric . " 
 The controversy invoked responses from some cast and crew members from the series . Gareth Neame , the executive producer for the BBC was glad that the episode provoked debate , and the producers would adequately defend the episode from their research into making the story . That said Neame was also surprised by some of the responses , rationalising that those responders did not understand the context , and that it was not intended to offend anybody . Stephen Garrett , the director of Kudos Film and Television , the producer of Spooks agreed , further stating that the episode " deals with very real stuff that 's happening in the world . It touches nerves on a regular basis , and deals with uncomfortable truths . " Brenton meanwhile stated that " people are free to make what they want of drama , " and believed the audience did not like the villains as they portrayed something disturbing in their culture , religion , world or profession . Oyelowo had said that the episode did not say that all Muslims are terrorists , only that some fanatics can give " millions of good people a bad name . " The actor also believed that the Muslims who were " up in arms " about the story did not see the episode , but merely heard the basis of the plot and did not consider the Muslims in the episode who tried to stop the antagonists .

 SMS Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was a unique ironclad warship built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in the 1880s . The last ironclad completed for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was laid down in January 1884 , launched in July 1887 , and completed in September 1889 . She was armed with a main battery of three 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns and had compound steel plating of the same thickness on her armored belt . The ship had an uneventful career , in large part due to her rapid obsolescence . She made trips to foreign countries to represent Austria @-@ Hungary , but was reduced to a coastal defense ship by 1906 . She continued in this role through World War I , based at Cattaro Bay , where her crew took part in the Cattaro Mutiny in early 1918 . After the war , Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the Royal Yugoslav Navy and renamed Kumbor , but she remained in the Yugoslav inventory for only three years , being sold for scrap in 1922 .

 In the decades that followed the Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866 , naval expenditure in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire were drastically reduced , in large part due to the veto power the Hungarian half of the empire held . Surrounded by potentially hostile countries powers on land , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire was more concerned with these threats , and so naval development was not prioritized . Admiral Friedrich von Pöck argued for several years to improve the strength of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , finally winning authorization to build the center battery ship Tegetthoff in 1875 . He spent another six years trying in vain to secure a sister ship to Tegetthoff . Finally , in 1881 , Pöck succeeded in securing funding for a new ironclad , authorized as " Ersatz Salamander " , a replacement for the earlier ironclad frigate . The new ship , to be named Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf , cost 5 @.@ 44 million gulden . The design for the new ship was prepared by Josef <unk> , the Director of Naval Construction for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ; a second ship , Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie , was authorized at the same time . Nearly another decade would pass before the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy secured funding for new capital ships , the three Monarch @-@ class coastal defense ships begun in 1893 .

 Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was armed with a main battery of three 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) 35 @-@ caliber guns mounted singly in open barbettes . Two were placed forward in sponsons over the battery deck to maximize end @-@ on fire , with the third placed aft . The guns were manufactured by Krupp , while the carriages that carried them were built by Armstrong Mitchell & Co .. Each of the forward guns had an arc of 180 degrees , while the stern gun could traverse 270 degrees , all hydraulically operated . The guns fired a 450 @-@ kilogram ( 990 lb ) shell using a 140 kg ( 310 lb ) charge of brown powder , which produced a muzzle velocity of 530 metres per second ( 1 @,@ 700 ft / s ) .

 SMS Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was laid down on 25 January 1884 at the Navy Dockyard in Pola . The ship was the first ironclad to be laid down in Austria @-@ Hungary in nearly a decade , since the center battery ship Tegetthoff . She was launched on 6 July 1887 and then began fitting out , which was completed in September 1889 . Embarrassingly for the Habsburgs , the ship 's namesake had committed suicide earlier that year . In 1890 , the German emperor , Kaiser Wilhelm II , invited the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet to take part in the annual fleet training exercises in August . Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf , the ironclad Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie , and the protected cruiser Kaiser Franz Joseph I were sent to Germany under the command of Rear Admiral Johann von <unk> . While en route , the squadron made visits in Gibraltar and Britain ; during the latter stop , the ships took part in the Cowes Regatta , where they were reviewed by Queen Victoria . The ships also stopped in Copenhagen , Denmark and Karlskrona , Sweden . During the voyage back to Austria @-@ Hungary , the squadron visited Cherbourg , France and Palermo , Italy . Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf experienced repeated difficulties with her engines on the trip , but it was nevertheless considered to be a great success in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . 
 Celebrations to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's first trans @-@ Atlantic voyage were held in several countries ; Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf , Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie , and Kaiser Franz Joseph I represented Austria @-@ Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa , Italy , Columbus 's birthplace . While there , she was inspected by King Umberto I of Italy and his son Victor Emmanuel III . Already by 1898 , the ship was regarded by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as a second @-@ rate vessel , after less than 10 years in service . The rapid pace of naval development in the late 19th century had quickly rendered her obsolescent . Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was reclassified as a coastal defense ship in 1906 . In 1908 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy attempted to sell the ship , Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie , and Tegetthoff to Uruguay in an attempt to raise funds for new projects , but the deal fell through . 
 After Austria @-@ Hungary declared war on Serbia in July 1914 , beginning World War I , the ship was stationed in Cattaro Bay under Commander Richard Florio , the leader of Mining Command II . The force also included an old destroyer , four torpedo boats , a minelayer , and two minesweepers , among other minor vessels . She remained there for the duration of the conflict . By early 1918 , the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro , including Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf . On 1 February , the Cattaro Mutiny broke out , starting aboard the armored cruiser Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to other ships . Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands , which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war , based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson 's Fourteen Points . The following day , shore batteries loyal to the government fired on Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf as she steamed to the Bay of <unk> , the outermost part of Cattaro Bay . The batteries scored a single hit that killed two men , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort . On the morning of 3 February , the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships of the III Division arrived in Cattaro , which convinced the last holdouts to surrender . Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed . 
 With the end of the war in November 1918 and the dissolution of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the fledgling Royal Yugoslav Navy , who renamed her Kumbor . She remained in the Yugoslav inventory only briefly , being broken up for scrap in 1922 . 
 = Sicilian Baroque = 
 Sicilian Baroque is the distinctive form of Baroque architecture which evolved on the island of Sicily , off the southern coast of Italy , in the 17th and 18th centuries . The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes , but also by its grinning masks and putti and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity . 
 The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693 . Previously , the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and parochial manner , having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome . After the earthquake , local architects , many of them trained in Rome , were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy ; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead . Around 1730 , Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style . Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island . From the 1780s onwards , the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism . 
 The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years , and perfectly reflected the social order of the island at a time when , nominally ruled by Spain , it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated . Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Baroque architecture is a European phenomenon originating in 17th @-@ century Italy ; it is flamboyant and theatrical , and richly ornamented by sculpture and an effect known as chiaroscuro , the strategic use of light and shade on a building created by mass and shadow . 
 The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church , and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy . The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy @-@ handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome , Florence , and Naples . However , even at this early stage , provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily 's older architecture . By the middle of the 18th century , when Sicily 's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland , it typically included at least two or three of the following features , coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words . 
 Grotesque masks and putti , often supporting balconies or decorating various bands of the entablature of a building ; these grinning or glaring faces are a relic of Sicilian architecture from before the mid @-@ 17th century ( Illustrations 2 and 9 ) . 
 Balconies , often complemented by intricate wrought iron balustrades after 1633 ( Illustrations 2 & 9 ) , and by plainer balustrades before that date ( Illustration 6 ) . 
 External staircases . Most villas and palazzi were designed for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade , leading to a courtyard within . An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile . This would be the palazzo 's principal entrance to the first @-@ floor reception rooms ; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards as many as four times . Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps ; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases , in themselves decorative architectural features ( illustration 19 ) , in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome . 
 <unk> , concave , or convex façades ( Illustrations 1 and 6 ) . Occasionally in a villa or palazzo , an external staircase would be fitted into the recess created by the curve . 
 The Sicilian belfry . <unk> were not placed beside the church in a campanile tower as is common in Italy , but on the façade itself , often surmounting the central pediment , with one or more bells clearly displayed beneath its own arch , such as at Catania 's <unk> ( Illustration 1 ) . In a large church with many bells this usually resulted in an intricately sculpted and decorated arcade at the highest point of the principal façade ( Illustration 3 ) . These belfries are among the most enduring and characteristic features of Sicilian Baroque architecture . 
 <unk> coloured marble set into both floor and walls especially in church interiors . This particular form of <unk> developed in Sicily from the 17th century ( see the floor of illustration 14 ) . 
 Columns that are often deployed singularly , supporting plain arches and thus displaying the influence of the earlier and much plainer Norman period ( Illustration 3 ) . Columns are rarely encountered , as elsewhere in Europe , in clustered groups acting as piers , especially in examples of early Sicilian Baroque . 
 Decorated rustication . Sebastiano Serlio had decorated the blocks of ashlar in his rustication ; by the end of the 16th century , Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves , fish @-@ scales , and even sweets and shells ; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design . Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls , a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke ( illustration 2 ) . 
 The local volcanic lava stone that was used in the construction of many Sicilian Baroque buildings , because this was the most readily available . Many sculptors and stone @-@ cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna , making a diversity of objects , including balustrades , pillars , fountains and seats for buildings . Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects , accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in ( illustration 2 ) . 
 The Spanish influence . The architectural influence of the ruling Spanish ( Illustration 13 ) , although this was a milder influence than that of the Normans . The Spanish style , a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture , is particularly evident in eastern Sicily , where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence . Messina 's monumental Porta Grazia , erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel , would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere . The style of this arched city gate , with its ornate mouldings and scrolls , was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake . 
 While these characteristics never occur all together in the same building , and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque , it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air . Other Baroque characteristics , such as broken pediments over windows , the extravagant use of statuary , and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture , but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe . 
 = = Early Sicilian Baroque = = 
 Volcanic Sicily in the central Mediterranean , off the Italian peninsula , has been colonised by the Greeks , then it was under the Romans , the Byzantines , the Ostrogoths , the Muslims , the Normans , the Hohenstaufen , the Angevins and the Aragonese , after whom it became a province of the Spanish Empire and then was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies , before finally being absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860 . Thus Sicilians have been exposed to a rich sequence of disparate cultures ; this is reflected in the extraordinary diversity of architecture on the island . 
 A form of decorated classical architecture peculiar to Sicily had begun to evolve from the 1530s . Inspired by the ruined Greek architecture and by the Norman cathedrals on the island , this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman architecture with Gothic features such as pointed arches and window apertures . The Sicilian Norman architecture incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman architecture elsewhere , and like other Romanesque architecture it went on to incorporate Gothic features . This early ornate architecture differs from that of mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture ; instead , it was developed from Norman styles . Renaissance architecture hardly touched Sicily ; in the capital city of Palermo , the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria , a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di <unk> by Florentine artists <unk> <unk> and Michelangelo <unk> and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old ( Illustration 5 ) . 
 Whatever the reason that Renaissance style never became popular in Sicily , it was certainly not ignorance . Antonello Gagini was midway through constructing the church of Santa Maria di Porto Salvo in 1536 in the Renaissance style when he died ; he was superseded by the architect Antonio Scaglione , who completed the building in a Norman style . This style seems to have influenced Sicilian architecture almost up to the time of the 1693 earthquake . Even Mannerism passed the island by . Only in the architecture of Messina could a Renaissance influence be discerned , partly for geographical reasons : within sight of mainland Italy and the most important port in Sicily , Messina was always more amenable to the prevailing tides of fashion outside the island . The town 's aristocratic patrons would often call on Florence or Rome to provide them with an architect ; one example was the Florentine Giovanni Angelo <unk> , who established the Tuscan styles of architecture and sculpture there in the mid @-@ 16th century . However , these influences remained largely confined to Messina and the surrounding district . It seems likely that it was the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church , removed from the influences of Roman fashion , that remained conservative in architectural taste . 
 This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe . Architecture in the island 's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini , who arrived from Florence in 1463 . This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture . Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island 's churches ( 1531 – 37 ) , Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium @-@ like arch of the " Capella della Madonna " in the " Santuario dell <unk> " at Trapani . This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted , but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints ; and , most importantly in terms of architecture , the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment . This ornate pediment , although still unbroken , was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture . Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù ( Illustration 14 ) , constructed between 1564 and 1633 , which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque . 
 Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693 . While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650 , the scarcity of these isolated , surviving examples of Sicily 's 17th @-@ century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster : the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings , but also most of their documentation . Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II . 
 The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso 's Quattro Canti , an octagonal piazza , or circus , constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city 's two principal streets . Around this intersection are four open sides , being the streets , and four matching buildings with identical canted corners . The sides of the four buildings are curved , further heightening the Baroque design of the buildings lining the circus . These four great buildings dominating the circus are each enhanced by a fountain , reminiscent of those of Pope Sixtus V 's " Quattro Fontane " in Rome . However , here in Palermo the Baroque theme continues up three storeys of the buildings , which are adorned with statues in recessed niches depicting the four seasons , the four Spanish kings of Sicily , and the four <unk> of Palermo : Saints Cristina , Ninfa , Olivia , and Agata . 
 While each façade of Quattro Canti is pleasing to the eye , as a scheme it is both out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and , like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque , can be considered provincial , naive and heavy @-@ handed , compared with later developments . Whatever its merit , it is evident that during the 17th century , the Baroque style in the hands of the local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy . This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily , but occurred as far afield as Bavaria , and Russia , where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin .

 = = = Earthquake and patrons = = = 
 The great Sicilian earthquake of 1693 destroyed at least 45 towns and cities , affecting an area of 5600 square kilometres and causing the deaths of about 60 @,@ 000 people . The epicentre of the disaster was offshore , although the exact position remains unknown . Towns which suffered severely were Ragusa , Modica , Scicli , and <unk> . Rebuilding began almost immediately . 
 The lavishness of the architecture that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time ; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule , but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy . This was led by the Duke of <unk> , whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy , who were numerous . The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe , and a gentry class was missing . In the 18th century , one estimate held that there were 228 noble families , who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of 58 princes , 27 dukes , 37 marquesses , 26 Counts , one viscount and 79 barons ; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility ( last published in 1926 ) lists even more . In addition to these were the younger scions of the families , with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron . 
 Architecture was not the only legacy of the Normans . Rule over the peasants ( there was no established middle class ) was also enforced by a feudal system , unchanged since its introduction following the Norman conquest of 1071 . Thus the Sicilian aristocracy had not only wealth but vast manpower at their command , something that had by this time declined in many other parts of Europe . As in Southern Spain , the huge rural estates remained almost as concentrated as when they had been Roman " <unk> " . The Sicilian economy , though very largely agriculturally based , was very strong , and became more so during the 18th century as shipping became more efficient and the threat of Muslim piracy died away . The export markets for lemons ( for the great 18th century fashion for lemonade ) and wines increased greatly , and Sicilian wheat remained , as it had been since Roman times , the backbone of the economy . The disaster that was to give Sicily its modern reputation of poverty , namely the opening @-@ up of the American Middle West to wheat @-@ farming , was a century away . When it came , this permanently more than halved the price of wheat , and destroyed the old economy forever . 
 The aristocracy shared their power only with the Roman Catholic Church . The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present , and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints ' days . Many priests and bishops were members of the aristocracy . The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents , in order to preserve the family estates from division ; a large fee , or dowry , was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this , in the form of property , jewels , or money . Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time . This is one of the reasons that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries , such as San Martino delle Scale , were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale . 
 Once rebuilding began , the poor rebuilt their basic housing in the same primitive fashion as before . By contrast , the wealthiest residents , both secular and spiritual , became caught in an almost manic orgy of building . Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily . For one thing , the Spanish viceroy spent six months of the year in Palermo and six in Catania , holding court in each city , and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city . Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion , the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison , so they too were eventually rebuilt . Following this , from the middle of the 18th century , villas to retire to in the autumn , essentially status symbols , were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria . This pattern was repeated , on a smaller scale , throughout the lesser cities of Sicily , each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate . The country estate also did not escape the building mania . Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles , or country villas were completely rebuilt . Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 = = = New cities = = = 
 Following the quake a program of rebuilding was rapidly put into action , but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments . The Viceroy , the Duke of <unk> , aware of new trends in town planning , decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets , the new rebuilding would offer <unk> and wider main streets , often on a rational grid system . The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon , typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning . The city of <unk> represents an example of these new cities <unk> with a hexagonal plan . 
 This concept was still very new in the 1690s , and few new cities had had reason to be built in Europe – Christopher Wren 's city plan after the Great Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because of the complexities of land ownership there . There were some other examples such as Richelieu , and later Saint Petersburg . The prototype may well have been the new city of Terra del Sole , constructed in 1564 . Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont . A little later , from 1711 , this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America , especially by the Portuguese in Brazil . In other parts of Europe , lack of finance , complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical replanning after disaster too difficult : after 1666 , London was rebuilt on its ancient plan , though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system . In Sicily , public opinion ( the public being anyone not a member of the ruling class ) counted for nothing , and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed . 
 In Sicily , the decision was taken not just for fashion and appearance but also because it would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes . In 1693 , the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes . Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall , cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained , posing a hazard for the poor . Architecturally and aesthetically , the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities , where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours , in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective . This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of <unk> , <unk> in Val di Catania , Catania , Modica , Noto , <unk> <unk> , Ragusa , and Scicli . 
 One of the finest examples of this new urban planning can be seen at Noto ( Illustration 9 ) , the town rebuilt approximately 10 km from its original site on Mount <unk> . The old ruined town now known as " Noto <unk> " can still be viewed in its ruinous state . The new site chosen was flatter than the old to better facilitate a linear grid @-@ like plan . The principal streets run east to west so they would benefit from a better light and a sunnier disposition . This example of town planning is directly attributable to a learned local aristocrat , Giovanni Battista <unk> ; helped by three local architects , he is credited with planning the new city himself . 
 In these new towns , the aristocracy was allocated the higher areas , where the air was cooler and fresher and the views finest . The church was allocated the town centre ( Illustration 8 ) , for convenience to all , and to reflect the church 's global and central position ; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal Palazzo <unk> were built the convents . The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas . Finally , the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted . Lawyers , doctors , and members of the few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford building plots , often lived on the periphery of the commercial and upper class residential sectors , but equally often these people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas . However , many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons . In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority , and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America , and most <unk> Haussmann 's 19th century re @-@ designing of Paris . The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture , which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century . 
 Later many other Sicilian towns and cities which had been either little damaged or completely untouched by the quake , such as Palermo , were also transformed by the Baroque style , as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city . In Palermo the Church of Santa Caterina , began in 1566 , was one of many in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style , with coloured marbles .

 Of Sicily 's own form of Baroque , post 1693 , it has been said , " The buildings conceived in the wake of this disaster expressed a light @-@ hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended , perhaps , to assuage the horror " . While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of joie de vivre in stone , it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice . As with all architectural styles , the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion . Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style ; Louis XIV 's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth , taste , or power . Thus it was the obvious choice for the " homeless rich " of Sicily , of whom there were hundreds . The excesses of the Baroque @-@ style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily , however , were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint . 
 As the 18th century dawned , Sicilian architects were employed to create the new palazzi and churches . These architects , often local , were able to design in a more sophisticated style than those of the late 17th century ; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom . Their work inspired less @-@ travelled Sicilian designers . Very importantly , these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de ' Rossi , who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings , giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome . In this way , the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy . 
 At this stage of its development , Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire . Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian architect during this period . He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini , and introduced to the island 's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves , which would have been unacceptable in Rome itself . However , his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come . Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania ; and Vaccarini 's church of Santa Agata , also in Catania . On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini 's <unk> Civile . It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period , while opulent , also to be disciplined and almost reined in . Vaccarini 's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades . 
 A second hindrance to Sicilian architects ' fully achieving their potential earlier was that frequently they were only rebuilding a damaged structure , and as a consequence having to match their designs to what had been before , or remained . The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica ( Illustration 10 ) is an example . It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613 , rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout , then damaged again in 1693 . Rebuilding again began in 1702 , by an unknown architect . Finally , Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade 's completion in 1760 , but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious . While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa , here in Modica the building is heavier , and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design . 
 There were also at this time other influences at work . Between 1718 and 1734 Sicily was ruled personally by Charles VI from Vienna , and as a result close ties with Austrian architecture can be perceived . Several buildings on the island are shameless imitations of the works of Fischer von Erlach . Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach had begun to rebuild Schönbrunn Palace in 1686 in a simple form of Baroque ; this form was later to be reproduced in Sicily in the final years of its Baroque era . The palace also had an external staircase ( removed in 1746 ) similar to those that later evolved in Sicily . One Sicilian architect , Tommaso Napoli , a monk , visited Vienna twice early in the century , returning with a store of engraving and drawings . He was later the architect of two country villas of the early Sicilian Baroque period , remarkable for their concave and convex walls and the complex design of their external staircases . One villa , his Villa <unk> begun in 1705 , is the most complex and ingenious of all constructed in Sicily 's Baroque era ; its double staircase of straight flights , frequently changing direction , was to be the prototype of a distinguishing feature of Sicilian Baroque . 
 Later , a new wave of architects , who would master the Baroque sentiments , aware of Rococo interior styles beginning elsewhere to gain an ascendancy over Baroque , would go on to develop the flamboyance , freedom , and movement that are synonymous with the term Sicilian Baroque today . 
 = = High Sicilian Baroque = = 
 Around 1730 , the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality , for two reasons : the rush to rebuild was subsiding , construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful ; and a new clutch of home @-@ grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront . This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque , and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland . However , they were not like their predecessors ( the former students of the Romans ) , and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own . They included Andrea Palma , Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli . While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome , they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions . Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive . Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase , which was now taken to a new dimension : churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini 's mentor Francesco de Sanctis 's Spanish Steps in Rome . 
 Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence , competence , and stature . Church interiors , which until this date had been slightly pedestrian , came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours . Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as " either fascinating or repulsive , but however the individual spectator may react to it , this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance , and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island " . This is the key to Sicilian Baroque ; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality , and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island . Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more evident than in Ragusa and Catania . 
 = = = Ragusa = = = 
 Ragusa was very badly damaged in 1693 . The town is in two halves , divided by a deep ravine known as the " Valle dei Ponti " : the older town of Ragusa Ibla , and the higher Ragusa Superiore . 
 Ragusa Ibla , the lower city , boasts an impressive array of Baroque architecture , which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi , designed in 1738 ( Illustration 12 ) . In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site . The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps , a Baroque feature , especially exploited in Sicily due to the island 's topography . The tower seems to explode from the façade , accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls . Above the doorways and window apertures , pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini . The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820 . 
 In an alley connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore is the church of Santa Maria delle Scale . This church is interesting , though badly damaged in the earthquake . Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style , while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman ( with Gothic features ) , thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque . 
 The Palazzo <unk> is one of the more notable Baroque buildings of the city , its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work , while supports of grotesques mock , shock or amuse the passerby . The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio . It was later acquired by the <unk> family , after which it is named . The building has two street façades , each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family , a frame of acanthus leaves from which a <unk> leans . The balconies , a feature of the palazzo , are notable for the differing corbels which support them , ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques . The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies , divided by columns with Corinthian capitals . Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces . 
 The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore was built between 1718 and 1778 . Its principal façade is pure Baroque , containing fine carvings and sculptures . The cathedral has a high Sicilian belfry in the same style . The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles ( Illustration 3 ) . Ragusa Superiore , the most badly damaged part of the town , was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque : the palazzi here are peculiar to this town , of only two storeys and long , with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden . This very Portuguese style , probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes , is very different from the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla , which are in true Sicilian style . Unusually , Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century . The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies . 
 = = = Catania = = = 
 Sicily 's second city , Catania , was the most damaged of all the larger cities in 1693 , with only the medieval Castello <unk> and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining . Thus it was replanned and rebuilt . The new design separated the city into quarters , divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo ( Cathedral Square ) . Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania , and the city 's only surviving architect , Alonzo di Benedetto . Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina , which quickly began to rebuild , concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo . Three palazzi are situated here , the Bishop 's Palace , the Seminario and one other . The architects worked in complete harmony and it is impossible to distinguish di Benedetto 's work from that of his junior colleagues . The work is competent but not remarkable , with decorated rustication in the 17th @-@ century Sicilian style , but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial . This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake . 
 In 1730 , Vaccarini arrived in Catania as the appointed city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style . The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures , or curved pediments , and free @-@ standing columns support balconies . Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature rather than a general building material , using it intermittently with other materials , and spectacularly for an obelisk supported on the back of the <unk> heraldic elephant , for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall . Vaccarini 's principal façade to Catania 's cathedral , dedicated to Santa Agata , shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque . Also in the city is Stefano <unk> 's Church of the <unk> , built around 1768 . It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple . 
 = = Church interiors = = 
 Sicilian church exteriors had been decorated in elaborate styles from the first quarter of the 17th century , with profuse use of sculpture , stucco , frescoes , and marble ( Illustration 14 ) . As the post @-@ earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s , interiors also began to reflect this external decoration , becoming lighter and less intense ( compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15 ) , with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars , cornices , and pediments , often in the form of putti , flora , and fauna . <unk> coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style . These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe , again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture . The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance : in many instances a single block of coloured marble , decorated with gilt scrolls and swags , and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate . Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles . One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo . 
 The building of Sicily 's churches would typically be funded not just by individual religious orders but also by an aristocratic family . Contrary to popular belief , the majority of Sicily 's nobility did not choose to have their mortal remains displayed for eternity in the Capuchin catacombs of Palermo , but were buried quite conventionally in vaults beneath their family churches . It has been said , though , that " the funeral of a Sicilian aristocrat was one of the great moments of his life " . Funerals became tremendous shows of wealth ; a result of this ostentation was that the stone memorial slabs covering the burial vaults today provide an accurate barometer of the development of Baroque and marble inlay techniques at any specific time . For instance , those from the first half of the 17th century are of simple white marble decorated with an incised armorial bearing , name , date , etc . From c . 1650 , small quantities of coloured marble inlay appear , forming patterns , and this can be studied developing until , by the end of the century , the coats of arms and calligraphy are entirely of inset coloured marble , with decorative patterned borders . Long after Baroque began to fall from fashion in the 1780s , Baroque decor was still deemed more suitable for Catholic ritual than the new pagan @-@ based neoclassicism . 
 The Church of San Benedetto in Catania ( Illustrations 15 and 16 ) is a fine example of a Sicilian Baroque interior , decorated between 1726 and 1762 , the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality . The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni <unk> . The most spectacular part of the church 's decoration is the nun 's choir ( Illustrations 16 ) , created c . 1750 , which was designed in such a way that the nuns ' voices could be heard during services , but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside . 
 = = Palazzi interiors = = 
 With but a few notable exceptions , the interiors of the palazzi were from the start less elaborate than those of Sicily 's Baroque churches . Many were finished without ornate interior decoration , simply because they took so long to build and by the time they were completed Baroque had passed from fashion ; the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style known as " Pompeian " . Often one can find a fusion of the two styles , as in the ballroom wing of the Palazzo <unk> in Palermo , built by Andrea Giganti in 1763 , where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe <unk> with allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster . This ceiling was already old @-@ fashioned when it was finished , and the rest of the room was decorated in a far simpler mode . Changing use over the past 250 years has simplified palazzo decor further , as the ground floors are now usually shops , banks , or restaurants , and the upper floors divided into apartments , their interiors lost . 
 A further reason for the absence of Baroque decoration , and the most common , is that most rooms were never intended for such decoration . Many of the palazzi were vast , meant for huge numbers of people . The household of the Sicilian aristocrat , beginning with himself , his wife and many children , would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members , all of whom had minor apartments in the house . Moreover , there were paid employees , often including a private chaplain or confessor , a major <unk> , governesses , secretary , archivist , accountant , librarian , and innumerable lower servants , such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest . Often the servants ' extended families , especially if elderly , also lived in the palazzo . Thus many rooms were needed to house the household . These everyday living quarters , even for the " Maestro and Maestra di Casa " , were often simply decorated and furnished . Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns . Any visiting foreigner , especially an Englishman , was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige . Hence the Sicilian aristocrat 's home was seldom empty or quiet . 
 As in the rest of Italy , the finest and most decorated rooms were those on the piano nobile , reserved for guests and entertaining . Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase , these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons , with one very large salon being the principal room of the house , often used as a ballroom . Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too , but by the end of the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above . If decorated during the Baroque era , the rooms would be profusely ornamented . Walls were frequently mirrored , the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls , often alternating with paintings similarly framed , while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between . Ceilings were high and frescoed , and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass , while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls . One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo 's Palazzo <unk> @-@ Gangi ( Illustration 17 ) . This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is , however , one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo , which was ( from 1750 ) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna <unk> , mostly in the later neoclassical style . 
 Furniture during the Baroque era was in keeping with the style : ornate , gilded and frequently with marble used for tabletops . The furniture was transient within the house , frequently moved between rooms as required , while leaving other rooms unfurnished . Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room , for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame . As in the rest of Europe , the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall , to be moved forward by servants if required , never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room , which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble , or more often ceramic , patterned floor tiles . 
 The common element to both church and palazzi interior design was the stucco work . Stucco is an important component of the Baroque design and philosophy , as it seamlessly combines architecture , sculpture , and painting in three @-@ dimensional form . Its combination with trompe l 'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art . While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers , in a private house it might represent the owner 's favourite foods or musical instruments . 
 = = Final period = = 
 As with all architectural styles , people eventually tired of Baroque . In some parts of Europe , it metamorphosed into the rococo , but not in Sicily . No longer ruled by Austria , Sicily , from 1735 officially the Kingdom of Sicily , was ruled by the King of Naples , Ferdinand IV . Hence Palermo was in constant association with the principal capital Naples , where there was architecturally a growing reversion to the more classical styles of architecture . Coupled with this , many of the more cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with all things French , from philosophy to arts , fashion , and architecture . Many of them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest architectural engravings and theoretical treatises . The French architect Léon Dufourny was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient Greek temples on the island . Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past , which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion . The change in tastes did not come about overnight . Baroque remained popular on the island , but now Sicilian balconies , extravagant as ever , would be placed next to severe classical columns . Dufourny began designing in Palermo , and his " Entrance Temple " ( 1789 ) to the Botanical Gardens was the first building in Sicily in a style based on the Greek Doric order . It is pure neoclassical architecture , as established in England since 1760 , and it was a sign of things to come . 
 It was Dufourny 's great friend and fellow architect Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque . In 1784 he designed the Palazzo <unk> @-@ Belmonte , the finest example of this period of architectural transition , combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs , built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade , or chiaroscuro . The main façade , punctuated by giant pilasters , also had Baroque features , but the skyline was unbroken . The pilasters were undecorated , simple , and Ionic , and supported an undecorated entablature . Above the windows were classical unbroken pediments . Sicilian Baroque was waning . 
 Another reason for the gradual decline in the development of Sicily 's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out . During the 17th century , the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates , tending and improving them , and as a result their income also increased . During the 18th century , the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities , in particular Palermo , to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy 's court and Catania . Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour , to the detriment of the abandoned estates , which were still expected to provide the revenue . The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient , or corrupt , often both . Consequently , aristocratic incomes fell . The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety , until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them . Moreover , Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially . Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife , Sicily had declined to the point of no return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily . The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17 @,@ 000 British troops , and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name . King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes , at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy . 
 The tax was rescinded by the British in 1812 , who then imposed a British style constitution on the island . One legal innovation of this time of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors , who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage , could now seize property . Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions , and consequently a land @-@ owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish . Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821 , and 1848 divided the nobility , and liberalism was in the air . These factors coupled with the social and political upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class . Furthermore , because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige , an essential element of the feudal system , the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages , and the once grand country villas were decaying . The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over . 
 However , the British influence in Sicily was to provide Sicilian Baroque with one last flourish . Marvuglia , recognising the new fashion for all things British , developed the style he had first cautiously used at Palazzo <unk> @-@ Belmonte in 1784 , combining some of the plainer , more solid elements of Baroque with Palladian motifs rather than Palladian designs . The late Sicilian Baroque was similar in style to the Baroque popular in England at the beginning of the 18th century , popularised by Sir John Vanbrugh with such edifices as Blenheim Palace . An example is Marvuglia 's Church of San Francesco di Sales , which is almost English in its interpretation of Baroque . However , this was a temporary success and the neoclassical style was soon dominant . Few aristocrats could now afford to build , and the new style was mainly used in public and civil buildings such as those at the Botanical Gardens in Palermo . Sicilian architects — even Andrea Giganti , once a competent architect in Baroque — now began to design in the neoclassical style , but in this case in the version of the neoclassical adopted by fashionable France . Giganti 's Villa <unk> at Bagheria is clearly inspired by the work of Ange @-@ Jacques Gabriel . 
 As with the early days of Sicilian Baroque , the first buildings of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles . The Palazzo <unk> ( Illustration 19 ) was begun in 1746 , and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque . However , when a few years later the upper floor was added , despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows , the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced , highlighted by the central curved bay . The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sicilian Baroque is today recognised as an architectural style , largely due to the work of <unk> Sitwell , whose Southern Baroque Art of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style , followed by the more academic work of Anthony Blunt . 
 Most of the Baroque palazzi continued in private ownership throughout the 19th century , as the old aristocracy either married middle @-@ class money or fell further into debt . There were a few exceptions and some of these retain the ancestral palazzo still today . Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which they were designed . 
 However , much of the blame for the decay and ruinous state of preservation of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change , but the political agendas of successive socialist governments . Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi , including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa , are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943 . In many cases , no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them . Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub @-@ divided into offices or apartments , their Baroque interiors dismantled , divided , and sold . 
 The remaining members of the Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism a major source of income , unlike some Northern , especially English , counterparts . The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small , and there is much less local interest among the general population . The Princes , Marquesses , and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation , surrounded often by beauty and decay . It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage . 
 As Sicily now becomes a more politically stable , secure and less corrupt environment , the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning to open their doors to an eager paying public , American and Northern European as much as Italian . In 1963 , when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set , but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events . Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests , once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily , the purpose for which they were originally intended . 
 In 2002 , UNESCO selectively included Baroque monuments of Val di Noto into its World Heritage List as " providing outstanding testimony to the exuberant genius of late Baroque art and architecture " and " representing the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe .

 = Big Thunder Ski Jumping Center = 
 Big Thunder Ski Jumping Centre was a twin ski jumping hill located in Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario , Canada . It constitutes part of Big Thunder National Training Centre . The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963 . They were originally known as Lille Norway Ski Area , then Mt . Norway Ski Area , and Sundance Northwest Resort before taking the current name . The large and normal hills were built in 1974 and the venue was taken over by the provincial government in 1985 . The hills hosted 29 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 50 Canadian Ski Jumping Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995 , climaxing with the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995 . Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained .

 The location was first identified by Knute Hansen , a ski jumper who felt that a location in Mount McRae in <unk> would be ideal for a ski jumping hill . He and Thor Hansen built the first jumps , which were opened in 1963 and named Lille Norway Ski Area . In 1969 , after the <unk> had fallen into financial difficulties , the venue was sold and renamed Mt . Norway Ski Area . Additional land for the complex was also leased , and the provincial government provided funding to construct the main twin hill . Construction of the 70 meter and 90 meter ( current K @-@ 90 and K @-@ 120 ) hills was completed in 1974 . The following year , the venue hosted its first Canadian Ski Jumping Championships . Three years later , the venue was again sold , this time being named Sundance Northwest Resort . In 1981 , the Provincial Government of Ontario started redeveloping the site to transform it into a national training center . In 1985 , the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Recreation bought the site . In the course of five years , they built a K @-@ 64 hill , as well as Little Thunder , which consisted of K @-@ 10 , K @-@ 20 and K @-@ 37 hills . The two largest of these were equipped with porcelain in @-@ runs and plastic landing slops , allowing for their use during summer . 
 In 1990 , the venue was awarded the hosting of the 1995 Nordic World Ski Championships . This required a major upgrade to the infrastructure , including floodlights . World Cup tournaments were placed on hold after 1991 for the upgrades . The venue hosted the Pre @-@ World Championships , part of the World Cup , in 1994 . In the final jumping event in the 1995 World Championships , Tommy Ingebrigtsen set a hill record of 137 @.@ 0 meters ( 449 ft ) , 9 meters ( 30 ft ) beyond the previous hill record . 
 During the campaigning for the 1995 Ontario provincial election , Conservative Party leader Mike Harris deemed Big Thunder a " cash cow " as part of his Common Sense Revolution . Following the party 's victory in the election , the venue was closed . Even though the venue closed , it sill costs the province several hundred thousand dollars per year . The citizens group Friends of Big Thunder Bay announced on 1 March 2010 , following the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , that they had sent a letter of intent to the provincial government where they stated that they wished to re @-@ open the sports park . They intend to not only reopen the hill , but also the associated sports area and provide year @-@ round training of ski jumping , freestyle skiing , cross @-@ country skiing , mountain biking , event hosting and hiking . Ski Jumping Canada has asked the province to establish a training facility for ski jumping in Ontario , stating that lack a facilities make it difficult for Canada to produce ski jumpers for the world scene , and that this among other things will result in poor performances in the Olympics .

 Big Thunder was a regular site for the FIS Nordic Ski Jumping World Cup , and arranged a world cup round , typically with two jumps , every season from 1980 through 1991 . Nordic combined was , in addition to the World Championships , hosted twice , in 1989 and in 1994 . The last World Cup tournament was held in 1994 as a Pre @-@ World Championship tournament . 
 Contested between 9 and 19 March 1995 , the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships is the hallmark of the venue , and the only major world championship to be contested in Northern Ontario . The Nordic combined individual took place on 9 March , and was won by Fred <unk> Lundberg ahead of Jari <unk> . The following day saw Japan win ahead of Norway and Finland in the Nordic combined team event . In ski jumping , the individual normal hill event took place on 12 March , which saw a double Japanese victory with Takanobu Okabe winning ahead of <unk> Saito . The team event in the large hill on 16 March saw Finland win ahead of Germany and Japan . In the large hill individual event on 18 March , Tommy Ingebrigtsen set a new hill record and won ahead of Andreas Goldberger .

 The Battle of the Barracks ( Croatian : Bitka za <unk> ) was a series of engagements that occurred in mid @-@ to @-@ late 1991 between the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG , later renamed the Croatian Army ) and the Croatian police on one side and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) on another . The battle took place around numerous JNA posts in Croatia , starting when Croatian forces blockaded the JNA barracks , weapons storage depots and other facilities . It formally began on 14 September ; its objective was to neutralise the JNA positions in ZNG @-@ held territory and to secure arms and ammunition supplies to the poorly equipped ZNG . 
 The Battle of the Barracks was an escalation of the conflict between Croatian authorities and the Croatian Serbs who openly revolted in August 1990 and the JNA 's efforts to preserve the Yugoslav federation . At the same time , Croatia made moves towards achieving independence from Yugoslavia . The Battle of the Barracks briefly preceded the start of the JNA 's campaign in Croatia — itself amended in early September to add relief of the blockaded barracks to the operation plans . However , the JNA 's advance was largely curbed by the ZNG and it relieved few JNA facilities . 
 The ZNG and the police captured small , isolated JNA posts , and a number of large weapons depots and barracks — including the entire 32nd ( Varaždin ) Corps of the JNA . The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weapons — including 250 tanks , hundreds of artillery pieces and a large supply of small arms and ammunition — which proved crucial in defending against JNA advances in the early stage of the Croatian War of Independence . Some of the JNA facilities surrendered without fighting , while others put up armed resistance to the takeover . In some places , this caused civilian casualties because the barracks were situated in urban areas . Legal charges of abuse of or killing captured JNA personnel , and charges of war crimes against civilian populations were filed in Croatia , but most defendants remain at large . 
 In November , the JNA and Croatia reached several agreements to end the blockade and withdraw JNA from Croatia . The pullout was completed by 4 January 1992 , except in areas around Dubrovnik and on the islands of Vis and Lastovo . The JNA maintained its presence there until the summer of 1992 . As the JNA withdrew from the areas it controlled in Croatia , it was replaced by the UN peacekeepers agreed upon by the Vance plan . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , ethnic tensions betweens Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Hrvatska demokratska zajednica , HDZ ) . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of Croatian Serbs , centred in the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin ( approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) north @-@ east of Split ) , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA was denied on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated to the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia . The Government of Croatia viewed the area as a breakaway region . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . To bolster its defence , Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police deployed in twelve battalions and adopting military organization of the units . There were also 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organized reserve police set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies . The reserve force lacked weapons . As a response to the deteriorating situation , the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in May by merging the special police battalions into four all @-@ professional guards brigades together consisting of approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops subordinate to the Ministry of Defence headed by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj . The regional police , by then expanded to 40 @,@ 000 , was also attached to the ZNG and reorganized in 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions . The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully armed with small arms ; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was no command and control structure . The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to use of World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios . At the time , Croatian stockpile of weapons consisted of 30 @,@ 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 @,@ 000 previously owned by the police . A new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police was established then to replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Croatian views of the JNA 's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved in January – September 1991 . Croatian President Franjo Tuđman 's first plan was to win support from the European Community ( EC ) and the United States for Croatia ; he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country . Capture of the JNA barracks and storage depots was first advocated by Špegelj in late 1990 ; he again urged Tuđman to adopt the plan in early @-@ to @-@ mid 1991 while the JNA fought Slovenia 's TO in the Ten @-@ Day War in June – July 1991 . Špegelj 's calls were echoed by Šime Đodan , who succeeded Špegelj as the Defence Minister in July . Špegelj remained in command of the ZNG . 
 Tuđman 's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA . The ZNG was limited to defence , even though the actions of the JNA appeared to be coordinated with the Croatian Serb military . The impression was reinforced by buffer zones established by the JNA after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG — the JNA intervened after the ZNG lost territory , leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of areas they captured before the JNA arrived . The JNA provided weapons to the Croatian Serbs , although most of the weaponry was provided from Serbia 's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks . 
 In July 1991 , Špegelj and Đodan 's demands were backed up by a number of Croatian Parliament members during a parliamentary debate . This led Tuđman to dismiss Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister , and Špegelj resigned his post on 3 August . The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia — including JNA forces ' removal of the ZNG from Baranja , intermittent fighting around Osijek , Vukovar and Vinkovci — increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA actively supported the Croatian Serb revolt — forced Tuđman to act . On 22 August , he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks by the end of the month . The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply , Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action . On 1 September , the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by Tuđman — despite his ultimatum — and by the Yugoslav Presidency . The conference started on 7 September , but only four days later , the Croatian member and chair of the presidency Stjepan Mesić ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours . The move was motivated by Tuđman 's impression that the conference would continue while the ZNG lost ground . Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body , it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić proposed Tuđman to implement Špegelj 's plan . According to General Anton Tus , Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September , but rescinded the order the next day . The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with Tuđman to authorize the move , arguing that the ZNG was running out of time . The same day , the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to , beginning the Battle of the Barracks . The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia , and numerous smaller facilities , including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots . The blockade forced the JNA to amend its campaign in Croatia plans to accommodate the new development . Several JNA posts were attacked by the ZNG before the blockade was officially sanctioned , largely in response to local battlefield situations . The first such incident was a failed attack on JNA barracks in Sinj on 25 August , in response to the deterioration of ZNG positions in the nearby village of Kijevo . On 3 September , the ZNG captured a barracks in Sisak , and on 13 September a weapons storage depot in Gospić area was captured amid fighting for control of the city . In May , 21 M @-@ <unk> tanks were captured in a Đuro Đaković factory . The tanks were due to be shipped to Kuwait , but a part of the shipment was kept by Croatia . A train transporting JNA weapons from Slovenia to Serbia was captured in Slavonski Brod on 21 August . The ZNG seized its first anti @-@ aircraft weapons , anti @-@ tank weapons , and artillery pieces there while adding to its small stock of mortars . The ZNG forces besieging the JNA facilities were mainly drawn from the local populace ; reinforcements deployed from other cities were relatively few . 
 = = = September = = = 
 On 14 September — the day Croatian forces were ordered to blockade the JNA facilities — the ZNG and the police captured the JNA barracks in Ploče , one of several barracks in Gospić , and one in nearby Perušić . The JNA garrison in Otočac — north of Gospić — also came under attack as the ZNG started to assault the barracks in the town . The " <unk> " JNA depot near Zagreb and a JNA @-@ manned post on the Hungarian border near <unk> were captured that day . In response to the blockade of their barracks in Vukovar , the JNA dispatched a force to relieve the siege . The next day , the ZNG and the police captured a JNA depot near Popovec — west of Zagreb — and another depot near Slavonski Brod . At the same time , fighting erupted around JNA facilities in Varaždin , and two JNA border posts were captured north of Virovitica . 
 On 16 September , Croatian forces captured a JNA barracks and another storage depot in Slavonski Brod , and two barracks in Ogulin , while fighting erupted around a JNA post in <unk> . Croatian forces also captured the <unk> missile base and JNA weapons storage facilities near Daruvar , Otočac , Križevci and Virovitica . On 17 September , Croatian forces captured the JNA barracks in Daruvar , Ogulin , Čakovec , Križevci , Virovitica , Požega , two JNA barracks in the Šibenik – Rogoznica area and one in Varaždin . A JNA depot was captured near Zagreb ( <unk> Jarak ) . On 18 September , three additional barracks in Varaždin , one near Rogoznica and two in Đakovo — together with all remaining JNA facilities in Gospić , a nearby weapons storage facility , a communications facility near Garešnica and dozens of border posts — surrendered to Croatian forces . 
 On 19 September , the ZNG clashed with the JNA garrison at the Logorište barracks in Karlovac , captured a communications facility at <unk> near Rijeka an additional JNA barracks and a storage depot in Varaždin , restricting the JNA to the barracks housing headquarters of the JNA Varaždin Corps . By 20 September , when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG throughout Croatia , more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatia — including 15 barracks and 11 storage depots — had surrendered or were captured . The JNA barracks in Našice surrendered on 21 September . The JNA Varaždin Corps surrendered the next day , providing the ZNG with a major caché of weapons . In the first few days of the blockade , the Croatian forces also captured several small JNA posts in Split , but no large JNA facility in the city . 
 In mid @-@ September , seven JNA facilities in Zadar , including three barracks , were captured . The most significant captured facility was the " <unk> <unk> " barracks , which contained a large caché of small arms and ammunition . The Yugoslav Air Force carried out air strikes against the facility the next day — following a pattern that was established at the time — to hinder the removal of weapons from captured JNA facilities . On 23 September , a ZNG assault on a large JNA weapons storage site in Sveti Rok — located between Gospić and Zadar — failed . The two remaining JNA barracks under Croatian blockade — in Vinkovci and Osijek — were abandoned by the JNA by 26 September . The Osijek garrison managed to break out from its besieged barracks and joined the JNA troops south and east of the city , while the evacuation of the Vinkovci barracks was negotiated between Croatian authorities and the JNA . The negotiations were initiated after the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division reached Vinkovci on 25 September , forcing the ZNG to accept the evacuation . A JNA facility on the island of Korčula surrendered its equipment to the ZNG on 26 September . 
 On 29 September , Croatian forces captured two barracks and three storage depots in and around Bjelovar after a day @-@ long battle , while the fourth storage facility was blown up by its commanding officer , JNA Major Milan Tepić . The explosion killed Tepić and eleven members of the besieging force . It was heard 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) away and caused damage in nearby villages . The same day , a weapons storage facility in Koprivnica and a border post near Virovitica were captured by the ZNG and the Croatian police . The JNA 73rd Motorized Brigade surrendered in Koprivnica the next day . 
 On 14 / 15 September , Croatian forces seized a <unk> @-@ 612 landing craft from the Yugoslav Navy while it was undergoing repairs in Vela Luka shipyard ; they sailed the vessel the same night into the Cetina River . Between 16 and 22 September , Croatian forces captured the Kuline barracks in Šibenik and the 15 Yugoslav Navy vessels based there , as well as a further 19 vessels that were being overhauled in the " Velimir Škorpik " shipyard . The vessels , comprising approximately one @-@ quarter of the Yugoslav Navy 's assets , included : the Vlado Ćetković ( RTOP @-@ 402 ) Končar @-@ class fast attack craft ( renamed Šibenik ( RTOP @-@ 21 ) later on ) , the Velimir Škorpik ( RČ @-@ 310 ) Osa @-@ class missile boat , the Partizan II ( TČ @-@ 222 ) Shershen @-@ class torpedo boat and the Biokovo ( PČ @-@ 171 ) , Cer ( PČ @-@ 180 ) and Durmitor ( PČ @-@ 181 ) Mirna @-@ class patrol boats . Also , a ship in the final stages of construction was captured in the Kraljevica Shipyard the same month . She was launched in 1992 as <unk> Petar Krešimir IV ( RTOP @-@ 11 ) missile boat . In September , seven coastal artillery bases near Šibenik and on the islands of Šolta , Brač and Korčula were captured . 
 = = = October = = = 
 On 3 October , Croatian forces captured the " <unk> Vlahović " JNA barracks in Koprivnica , and a communications post and a border post near the city . The next day , the JNA barracks in Sinj and its nearby land mine storage facility were abandoned after a negotiated agreement . In early October , two JNA artillery regiments based in the " Šepurine " barracks near Zadar broke through a siege of their base and joined the JNA attack on the city . By 5 October , Zadar was completely surrounded by the JNA and the situation prompted Croatian authorities in the city to seek a ceasefire and negotiations . The ceasefire was arranged the same day , while the negotiations , held on 7 – 9 October , brought about the lifting of the JNA siege of Zadar and the evacuation of the remaining JNA garrison and its equipment from the city . The evacuation , involving seven JNA facilities , started on 11 October and took 15 days . The agreement stipulated that the evacuated units would leave Croatian soil and the JNA generally respected the obligation , even though twenty truckloads of weapons were left to the Serbian population in the hinterland around Zadar . 
 In the wake of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October , Croatian authorities instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible . The instructions did not result in attacks in Zagreb itself , but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces on the day of the bombing . The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day . 
 On 13 October , the JNA mostly destroyed and abandoned its barracks at <unk> , and a JNA weapons storage facility in Rijeka was damaged in a fire caused by a thunderstorm . The ZNG removed some weapons from the latter while the firefighters were called in to save individual storage structures . The next day , the JNA began moving the remaining weapons from the damaged storage to elsewhere in the city . While a convoy of 18 trucks was moving through Rijeka , 15 vehicles carrying weapons were diverted and captured by the ZNG . At the same time , personnel at the JNA 's Borongaj barracks in Zagreb were allowed to evacuate in return for free passage of a convoy carrying humanitarian aid to Vukovar , where the battle to control the city was in progress . 
 = = = November = = = 
 After a period of siege with little or no activity , the JNA forces in the Logorište barracks in the Karlovac area broke through the blockade towards the JNA @-@ held territory to the east of the city in the Battle of Logorište , which lasted from 4 to 6 November . The Croatian forces besieging the barracks were more numerous , but the JNA had superiority in armour and artillery . After it was abandoned by the JNA , the barracks still contained weapons which were taken away by the Croatian troops by November 13 . The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) in early November . It captured the <unk> barracks and storage facility in Karlovac on 4 November , while the fighting around the Logorište barracks was in progress . The following day , the HV captured JNA barracks and several weapons storage facilities in Delnice . The attacks were ordered to capture ammunition needed by the HV because its stockpile was running low . 
 On 8 November , <unk> Rudolf representing Croatian authorities , and Lieutenant Colonel General Marijan <unk> — JNA commanding officer of the 13th ( Rijeka ) Corps — agreed to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia . The agreement , made after negotiations supervised and supported by the European Community Monitor Mission ( ECMM ) would later serve as a model for similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia . <unk> made the agreement at his own initiative , with the support of the JNA Fifth Military District , after receiving an order from the JNA Chief of Staff Colonel General Blagoje Adžić to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and to attack industrial plants and infrastructure in or near the city . The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of the Draga barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November . The JNA 13th ( Rijeka ) Corps started to evacuate by sea to Montenegrin ports on 18 November . 
 Following negotiations , the JNA evacuated its Jastrebarsko barracks on 13 November . The garrison left , under ECMM escort , to Bosnia and Herzegovina . The next day , an agreement to evacuate the JNA from Šibenik was made in the village of Žitnić near Drniš . The Yugoslav Navy 's bombardment of Split , Šolta and Brač on 15 November — in response to the loss of a Mukos ( PČ @-@ 176 ) patrol boat — and the subsequent Battle of the Dalmatian channels appeared to have derailed the Žitnić agreement . 
 In Žitnić on 21 November , another agreement to evacuate the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy from the Šibenik – Split area and surrender of the confiscated TO weapons stored there was signed by Rudolf and the JNA Maritime @-@ Military District commanding officer Major General Nikola Mladenić . It was followed by another agreement to the same effect which was signed in Split two days later by Mladenić and Croatian Admiral Sveto Letica , defining that the pullout should be completed within 30 days . The agreement also provided for a cease @-@ fire in northern Dalmatia and the lifting of the Yugoslav Navy 's blockade of the Croatian coast . The agreement did not include evacuation of the Yugoslav Navy from its bases on the islands of Vis and Lastovo . Tensions remained high throughout the process and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to Šibenik and Split and relieve the siege of its forces there — these plans were codenamed Operation Coast @-@ 91 ( Operacija <unk> @-@ 91 ) and Operation Hurricane @-@ 91 ( Operacija Orkan @-@ 91 ) respectively . 
 Amid international pressure on Croatia to end the siege of the JNA garrison in Zagreb , Croatian authorities and the JNA signed an agreement on 22 November to evacuate all remaining JNA forces from Croatia . The agreement was signed in Zagreb , by HV Colonel Imra Agotić and Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in presence of the ECMM monitors . The agreement was confirmed the next day in Geneva when the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman , Milošević and the Yugoslav defence minister , JNA General Veljko Kadijević . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The ZNG quickly captured isolated JNA facilities , depots and several major posts , seizing a large quantity of weapons , including the entire stocks of the JNA 32nd ( Varaždin ) Corps and nearly all the weapons previously confiscated from the Croatia 's TO . The JNA lost control of eight brigades — including one armoured brigade , two mechanized brigades and three artillery regiments — and additional forces in the JNA Fifth Military District and the Military @-@ Maritime District remained pinned down by the blockade . The Significance of the Battle of the Barracks was reinforced by introduction of a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo on 25 September . The Battle of the Barracks resulted in a large increase of ZNG / HV capabilities — allowing complete arming of its existing units , raising of additional 40 – 42 brigades and fielding 200 @,@ 000 troops and 40 @,@ 000 police by the end of the year . In the battle , the ZNG / HV captured 250 tanks , 400 – 500 heavy artillery pieces , 180 @,@ 000 small arms and 2 million tonnes of ammunition . In addition , 3 @,@ 000 officers left the JNA and joined the HV . 
 While there is no information on the number of troops involved or casualties sustained on either side , the JNA garrisons in Croatia were significantly undermanned at the time . The JNA order of battle , developed in the 1980s , specified a handful of battalions at full combat readiness in Croatia . Those were elements of the 140th Mechanised Brigade in Zagreb , the 31st Armoured Brigade in Dugo Selo near Zagreb , the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade in Osijek , the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade in Šibenik and the 139th Marine Infantry Brigade in Pula . In 1990 , the " A " classification — requiring 60 – 100 % troop levels , — was assigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade in Jastrebarsko , a battalion of the 622nd Motorised Brigade in Petrinja , the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade in Rijeka , and the 265th Mechanised Brigade in Bjelovar and Koprivnica . The 221st Motorised Brigade based in Knin was reinforced with " A " class armoured and mechanised battalions . In addition , an armoured battalion was added to the 622nd Mechanised Brigade , and a mechanised battalion to JNA garrisons in Vinkovci and Vukovar each in May 1991 . Likewise , Croatian forces were strained between maintaining the blockade and manning the positions held against the JNA and Croatian Serb militias elsewhere . <unk> JNA troops were either transported to Serbia , exchanged for prisoners of war captured elsewhere , or were given civilian clothing and released . 
 Both in 1991 and years later , Špegelj criticised Tuđman 's decision to disregard his advice to attack the JNA barracks earlier than September — specifically during the Ten @-@ Day War in Slovenia in June – July 1991 . Špegelj said that an earlier move , preempting deterioration of the strategic situation in Croatia , would best serve Croatian defensive needs . Furthermore , he said that the JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise the required forces and that all prerequisites for a decisive victory against the JNA were met . Tus thought that Tuđman kept postponing the blockade because of the pressure applied by the international community against confrontation with the JNA . Zdravko Tomac , deputy prime minister of a national unity government in Croatia at the time , and later an opposition leader , stated that while Špegelj 's view was militarily correct , Tuđman 's position was politically better . Kadijević conversely said that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces had confronted it earlier because the JNA 's capabilities declined during the summer of 1991 . 
 = = = Vance plan = = = 
 The JNA campaign in Croatia ended in a stalemate , leading the belligerents to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire , formulated as the Vance plan — a result of a diplomatic mission by the Special Envoy of the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance , aided by United States diplomat Herbert Okun , and Under @-@ Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs Marrack Goulding , to Yugoslavia aimed at securing a negotiated end to hostilities in Croatia . The plan proposed a ceasefire , the protection of civilians in specific areas designated as UN Protected Areas and deployment of a UN force to Croatia . The Vance plan provided for the end of the Croatian blockade of the JNA barracks , the withdrawal of all JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of delivery of humanitarian aid . The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia , later initiated through the subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November . As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the last ceasefire agreement , the UN peacekeepers only started to deploy on 8 March 1992 . 
 = = = Evacuation of the JNA = = = 
 The JNA continued to evacuate following the Geneva Accord . The remaining seven JNA facilities in Rijeka area were evacuated during November , and the last barracks evacuated were those in Trsat on 10 December . In Šibenik , the JNA evacuated two barracks and four depots from 25 November until 24 December , turning the confiscated Croatian TO weapons over to the HV on 10 December — but the weapons remained in a sealed storage under ECMM supervision until 25 December as required by the Žitnić agreement . Most the evacuation took place by rail via Knin , and part of the force was moved by sea to Montenegro . The evacuation agreement required — as in case of the Zadar evacuation — the removal of the evacuated units from Croatian soil ; the JNA only partly fulfilled that criterion . The " Divulje " base of the JNA near Trogir started to evacuate by sea on 4 December , after an additional agreement signed by Rudolf and Mladenić regulating surrender of the TO weapons to the HV and the evacuation of the Lora naval base in Split . 
 The evacuation was halted again when it was determined that some of the TO weapons were missing from the JNA facilities in Split . The issue was resolved through an agreement of 18 December made between Rašeta and Agotić stipulating that the JNA would provide the HV with the missing weapons from its own stocks , and the evacuation resumed . Since the JNA did not have sufficient weapons to achieve that criterion in Split , a Yugoslav Navy ship delivered 250 tonnes ( 250 long tons ; 280 short tons ) of weapons and ammunition from Kumbor in Montenegro to Split on 1 January 1992 . The last JNA forces left the area of Split on 4 January . 
 The JNA also evacuated its facilities elsewhere in Croatia . <unk> from the <unk> Tito and <unk> barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November , and was completed by the end of 1991 . Istria was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December , handing over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV . The quantity of the TO weapons handed over in Istria — where the JNA evacuated 78 facilities — was enough to arm two combat brigades . In December 1991 , only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade , including a minor , unsuccessful HV attack on <unk> barracks in Karlovac . Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment , the JNA remained for seven to eight months . When its troops eventually withdrew from Croatia , the JNA left their equipment to the Republic of Serbian Krajina , established in the JNA @-@ held areas of Croatia on 19 December . The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo islands until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally . The JNA maintained positions near Dubrovnik until July , while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992 . 
 = = War crimes = = 
 Croatian authorities charged the deputy head of the Bjelovar police operations department and three special police force members with the deaths of five JNA prisoners and the shooting of a civilian following the surrender of the Bjelovar barracks . They were acquitted after 12 years of legal proceedings , after the Supreme Court of Croatia twice ordered a re @-@ trial . The Head of Bjelovar crisis centre was also charged with war crimes in 2012 , but as of 2013 his trial is still pending . Croatia also charged numerous JNA officers who held posts in the blockaded garrisons . In Osijek , 13 JNA officers were charged with war crimes against the civilian population , including causing the deaths of 307 persons and severe injuries to 171 persons , but none were arrested as of 2013 . 
 War crime charges were brought against JNA commander of the 32nd ( Varaždin ) Corps , General Vladimir Trifunović . He was charged by Croatia with the deaths of six individuals and the wounding of a further 37 . After a trial in absentia , he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1991 . Three years later , in 1994 , Trifunović was charged in Yugoslavia with treason because he surrendered the entire JNA corps to the ZNG . He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison . In early 1996 , he was pardoned and released , and the Yugoslav authorities paid him € 62 @,@ 000 compensation for spending nearly two years in a prison . In 2013 , Trifunović formally requested re @-@ trial in Croatia .

 Tomb of Horrors is an adventure module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) role @-@ playing game . It was originally written for and used at the 1975 Origins 1 convention . Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign , and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge . The module , coded S1 , was the first in the S @-@ series , or special series of modules . Several versions of the adventure have been published , the first in 1978 , and the most recent , published for the D & D fourth edition , in 2010 . It also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002 . 
 The module 's plot revolves around the tomb of the demi @-@ lich Acererak . The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps , with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak . Tomb of Horrors is considered one of the greatest Dungeons & Dragons modules of all time , as well as one of the most difficult . The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products , and was followed by three other ( unrelated ) modules in the S @-@ series : S2 White Plume Mountain , S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks , and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Tomb of Horrors is set in the World of Greyhawk , a D & D campaign setting . In Tomb of Horrors , the adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard . As the scenario begins , the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form . Originally a powerful lich , he has ( unbeknownst to the players ) become a demi @-@ lich , a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull . Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi @-@ lich 's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all . 
 The module is divided into thirty @-@ three encounters , beginning with two false entrances to the tomb , and ending with " The Crypt of Acererak the Demi @-@ Lich " . Example encounters are the " Huge Pit Filled with 200 Spikes " ( section 20 ) , or encounter 22 , " The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists " : " The mists are silvery and shot through with delicate streamers of golden color . Vision extends only 6 ' . There is a dim aura of good if detected for . Those who step into the mist must save versus poison or become idiots until they can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun . " The module ends with the destruction of Acererak , without any postscript .

Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien , one of his original AD & D playtesters , " and I admit to chuckling evilly as I did so . " Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes . First , Gygax explains , " There were several very expert players in my campaign , and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill — and the persistence of their theretofore @-@ invincible characters . Specifically , I had in mind foiling Rob Kuntz 's PC , <unk> , and Ernie Gygax 's PC , Tenser . " Second , so that he was " ready for those fans [ players ] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD & D game . " 
 Tomb of Horrors was revised in late 1977 for publication as an AD & D module . In 1978 , TSR , Inc. published the module with a monochrome cover , revised and updated for use with first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules . The module included a twenty @-@ page book , a twelve @-@ page book , and an outer folder ; the original printing featured a two @-@ color cover . The module features a book of illustrations to show to players as the adventure unfolds . Tomb of Horrors was republished in 1981 as a thirty @-@ two page booklet with identical text but a new , full @-@ color cover . The module has been described as the first of a series of high @-@ level scenarios , and was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987 . 
 In 1998 , the module was reprinted as part of the Return to the Tomb of Horrors module — a substantial expansion and sequel to the original adventure , written for 2nd Edition AD & D rules . Wizards of the Coast released an updated version of the original module as a free download for Halloween 2005 , retaining much of the original content ; the updated content is from the Dungeons & Dragons supplement book Libris Mortis . This updated version was designed for use with the Dungeons & Dragons 3 @.@ 5 Edition rules . Tomb of Horrors was also adapted into a novel of the same name by Keith Francis Strohm for the Greyhawk Classics series published by Wizards of the Coast in 2002 . 
 In July 2010 , Wizards of the Coast released two adventures bearing the Tomb of Horrors name . One is a hardcover super @-@ adventure written by Ari <unk> and Scott Fitzgerald Gray , which builds on and expands the legend of the original Tomb using the canon of Return to the Tomb of Horrors as a starting point . The second Tomb of Horrors is a conversion and update of the original module for 4th Edition rules , written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray and released to members of the RPGA as part of the DM Rewards program . 
 All four modules of the S @-@ series were included as part of the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection , released on March 19 , 2013 . Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword : " The dungeon of the demi @-@ lich Acererak was , for Gary , a kind of thought experiment : If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers , how would he do it ? The answer , of course , was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to kill them dead . And furthermore , to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give up and leave well enough alone . "

 Tomb of Horrors was ranked the 3rd greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004 . Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Tomb of Horrors as one of the ten best classic adventures , and posits that many of the adventure 's traps would kill a character just for making poor choices . Lawrence Schick , in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds , calls the adventure " A very difficult scenario " . 
 Don Turnbull reviewed Tomb of Horrors in issue No. 13 of the magazine White Dwarf , and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10 . Turnbull commented on the adventure 's difficulty , noting that the dungeon is " sprinkled extensively with subtle , insidious and carefully laid traps , and it will be a fortunate adventurer who manages to avoid them " . He felt that the illustration booklet would add a great deal to the adventure 's atmosphere and felt that the pre @-@ generated character roster was useful . Turnbull noted that the module is " very hard and will be hard for the DM to learn in advance , though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules " , and he said that this module has in common with those modules an " excellent format , for instance , and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced . TSR 's high quality has not been in any way compromised , and in S1 it has even been improved upon . " 
 Wayne MacLaurin of SF Site describes the module as " a classic " and a " must have " for gamers , saying that when he played the game in high school , most of his group 's characters quickly died . MacLaurin explains that Tomb of Horrors is a classic not because of its difficulty , but because it was the first module that did not involve killing large amounts of monsters ; it was a " collection of puzzles and maps . " Its focus on traps rather than monsters was a surprise to gamers at the time . One technique that some players used to get past the <unk> was to drive cattle ahead of them , which Lore Sjöberg of Wired described as " a bit less than heroic " , noting that in Lord of the Rings Gandalf did not send " 50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait . " David M. Ewalt , in his book Of Dice and Men , discussed the adventure 's reputation as " the deadliest game ever written " , noting that it " unloads a series of complicated puzzles and nightmarish traps " on characters , concluding that " Few survive long enough to collect any treasure , and even fewer manage to find their way back through the deadly maze and escape with their spoils . " 
 Something Awful presented a humorous article about the ways that Tomb of Horrors is the bane of gamers everywhere since it is basically a series of traps that kills off most of the characters . " One of the best ( worst ) things about this module is that Acererak the demi @-@ lich is a huge asshole . He 's an asshole for filling his tomb with traps AND treasure , he 's an asshole because he leaves little messages throughout his tomb bragging about how he 's going to kill the players . " 
 Tomb of Horrors has also influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products . Jason <unk> used the module , as well as Indiana Jones , as inspiration for some of the traps in the 2007 D & D supplement <unk> . The computer role @-@ playing game Icewind Dale , developed by Black Isle Studios , was influenced by the module ; Black Isle Studios division director Feargus Urquhart said , " We wanted something that reminded everyone of their first foray into dungeons like the Tomb of Horrors , with traps around every corner , and the undead crawling out of the walls . " 
 Tomb of Horrors is mentioned several times in the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline , which is set in a virtual reality world created by a man who was a fan of the module . 
 = Amanita exitialis = 
 Amanita exitialis , also known as the Guangzhou destroying angel , is a mushroom of the large genus Amanita . It is distributed in eastern Asia , and probably also in India where it has been misidentified as A. verna . Deadly poisonous , it is a member of section Phalloideae and related to the death cap A. phalloides . The fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) are white , small to medium @-@ sized with caps up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , a somewhat friable ring and a firm volva . Unlike most agaric mushrooms which typically have four @-@ spored basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) , the basidia of A. exitialis are almost entirely two @-@ spored . Eight people were fatally poisoned in China after consuming the mushroom in 2000 , and another 20 have been fatally poisoned since that incident . Molecular analysis shows that the species has a close phylogenetic relationship with three other toxic white Amanitas : A. subjunquillea var. alba , A. virosa and A. bisporigera . 
 = = Taxonomy , classification , and phylogeny = = 
 Zhu @-@ Liang Yang and Tai @-@ Hui Li discovered the species by reexamining various herbarium specimens of white Amanita typically referred to as either A. verna or A. virosa . They realized that collections referred to as these European species actually comprised three taxa new to science or the region . The holotype specimen of A. exitialis is located in the Mycological Herbarium of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology . 
 In 2005 , Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS sequences of several white @-@ bodied toxic Amanita species . Their results support a clade containing four lethal Amanita species with white fruit bodies . A. exitialis has two @-@ spored basidia similar to the North American species A. bisporigera , but A. exitialis has a closer phylogenetic relationship with Amanita subjunquillea var. alba , a four @-@ spored white lethal species from China . The specific epithet exitialis derives from the Latin word " destructive " , and refers to the lethally poisonous nature of the mushroom . 
 Amanita exitialis is classified in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita . Species of this section share the following characteristics : spores that are not strongly elongated , and never with a <unk> shape ; flesh not reddening upon bruising ; lamellulae ( short gills that do not reach the edge of the cap ) abruptly cut off ; a well @-@ formed <unk> or sac @-@ like membranous volva . All species of Phalloideae are ectomycorrhizal and contain amatoxins . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , initially egg @-@ shaped , then convex but flattening with age , and sometimes slightly depressed at the center . The cap surface is smooth , white , but cream @-@ colored in the center . The margin ( cap edge ) is non @-@ striate , non @-@ appendiculate ( without any partial veil remnants hanging along the cap margin ) ; the flesh white . The gills are free from attachment to the stem , white to whitish , crowded closely together , and up to 5 mm in height . The lamellulae are long and tapering , plentiful , and arranged in 2 – 3 tiers . The stem is 7 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) , roughly cylindrical or slightly tapering upward , with apex slightly expanded . The surface is white to whitish , smooth , or sometimes with fibrous small scales . The bulb at the base of the stem is roughly spherical and 1 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide . The volva is <unk> ( has a distinct edge ) , thin , membranous , with free limb up to 7 mm in height , and both surfaces are white . The ring is near the top of the stem , thin , membranous , white , persistent or may be torn from the stem during expansion of the cap . All tissues of the fruit body will turn yellow if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied . 
 The spores are spherical or nearly so , rarely broadly ellipsoid , and measure 9 @.@ 5 – 12 by 9 – 11 @.@ 5 µm . They are hyaline ( translucent ) and colorless , amyloid ( absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) , thin @-@ walled , smooth , and have a small apiculus . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia , are 27 – 55 by 10 – 15 µm , club @-@ shaped , and two @-@ spored ( rarely one @-@ spored ) . They have sterigmata ( slender projections that attach the spores ) that are 5 – 7 µm long . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Amanita exitialis is similar to A. bisporigera , a species originally described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States . In comparison to A. exitialis , A. bisporigera differs by its lower placement of the ring on the stem , smaller spores ( typically 8 – 9 @.@ 5 by 7 – 8 @.@ 5 µm ) , and different structure of the volva . American specimens of A. bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of A. exitialis . Two other white Asian species , A. <unk> and A. subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A. exitialis , but are four @-@ spored . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of A. exitialis grow solitarily or in groups on the ground in coniferous forests . It is known only from the type locality , Guangdong Province . In a 2003 survey of Indian Amanita species , the authors mention several collections identified as A. verna , from various locations in the Indian provinces Maharashtra , Orissa , and Rajasthan . As Bhatt et al. explain , the material collected by <unk> in Orissa and identified as A. virosa has two @-@ spored basidia , and his description matches that of A. exitialis . 
 Field observations suggest that the mushroom associates <unk> with the plant Castanopsis <unk> , a deciduous tree found only in the southern provinces of China , such as Guangdong , Yunnan and Hunan . Mushroom fruitings are abundant in the warm spring rains of March and April , although they are also seen in May to July . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 The content and distribution of the main amatoxins ( alpha @-@ amanitin , beta @-@ amanitin ) and phallotoxins ( phallacidin , <unk> , <unk> , phalloidin ) in the three tissues ( cap , stipe and volva ) of Amanita exitialis have been determined using high @-@ performance liquid chromatography . The cap had the highest content of total toxins , reaching over 8000 µg / g dry weight ( µg of toxin per gram of dried tissue ) , the toxins content in the stem was over 3700 µg / g dry weight , whereas the volva had the lowest content of total toxins , with about 1150 µg / g dry weight . Amatoxins content ( alpha @-@ amanitin and beta @-@ amanitins especially alpha @-@ amanitin ) in the cap , stem or volva of A. exitialis was higher than that of <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , but the content of phallotoxins ( especially phallacidin ) was gradually higher from cap to stem and to volva . A 2011 study reported the presence of additional toxins <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . A Chinese study concluded that this species had the highest mortality rate of all toxic mushrooms in China . It has been estimated that about 50 grams ( 1 @.@ 8 oz ) of fresh mushrooms contains sufficient toxin to cause the death of a 50 @-@ kilogram ( 110 lb ) adult . In March 2000 , nine people consumed the mushroom in Guangzhou , and only one survived . Since 2000 , another 20 people have died in the southern provinces of China from consuming the mushroom . 
 Toxic peptides from Amanita species have been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II , an enzyme essential for protein synthesis . However , these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats , and are consequently expensive . Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture . Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10 % of that in fruiting bodies , the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 The fruit bodies of Amanita exitialis contain a unique purine nucleoside that is coupled with an amino acid derivative named <unk> ( 1 @-@ <unk> ) guanosine . The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α @-@ amino nitrogen ( the nitrogen bonded to the α @-@ carbon ) to a nucleobase <unk> by a C @-@ N ( carbon to nitrogen ) bond . The new compound was determined to be toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test , but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines . Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β @-@ carboline and <unk> ( a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms ) . 
 = Knights of Columbus = 
 The Knights of Columbus is the world 's largest Catholic fraternal service organization . Founded by Father Michael J. McGivney in New Haven , Connecticut , in 1882 , it was named in honor of the mariner Christopher Columbus . Originally serving as a mutual benefit society to low @-@ income immigrant Catholics , it developed into a fraternal benefit society dedicated to providing charitable services , promoting Catholic education and Catholic public policy positions , and actively defending Roman Catholicism in various nations . 
 There are 1 @,@ 883 @,@ 598 members in nearly 15 @,@ 000 councils , with 302 councils on college campuses . Membership is limited to " practical " Catholic men aged 18 or older . Membership consists of four different degrees , each exemplifying a different principle of the Order . The Order is a member of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights . 
 Councils have been chartered in the United States ( including the territories of Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands and Guam ) , Canada , the Philippines , Mexico , Poland , the Dominican Republic , Panama , the Bahamas , Cuba , Guatemala , Saipan , South Korea , Ukraine , Lithuania , and on US military bases around the world . The Knights ' official junior organization , the Columbian Squires , has over 5 @,@ 000 circles and the Order 's patriotic arm , the Fourth Degree , has more than 2 @,@ 500 assemblies . 
 For their support for the Church and local communities , as well as for their philanthropic efforts , Pope John Paul II referred to the Order as a " strong right arm of the Church . " In 2014 , the Order gave over US $ 173 million directly to charity and performed over 71 @.@ 5 million man @-@ hours of voluntary service . Over 413 @,@ 000 US pints ( 195 @,@ 000 l ; 344 @,@ 000 imp pt ) of blood were donated in 2010 . 
 The Order 's insurance program has more than 2 million insurance contracts , totaling more than US $ 100 billion of life insurance in force . This is backed up by $ 21 billion in assets as of 2014 . Within the United States on the national and state level , the Order is active in the political arena lobbying for laws and positions that uphold the Catholic Church 's positions on public policy and social issues . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 Michael J. McGivney , an Irish @-@ American Catholic priest , founded the Knights of Columbus in New Haven , Connecticut . He gathered a group of men from St. Mary 's Parish for an organizational meeting on October 2 , 1881 , and the Order was incorporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut on March 29 , 1882 . Although the first councils were all in that state , the Order spread throughout New England and the United States in subsequent years . By 1889 , there were 300 councils comprising 40 @,@ 000 knights . Twenty years later , in 1909 , there were 230 @,@ 000 knights in 1 @,@ 300 councils . 
 The Order was intended as a mutual benefit society . These organizations , which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century , the so @-@ called " Golden Age of <unk> . " As a parish priest in an immigrant community , McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died , and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind . He also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died . However , Roman Catholics In the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions , popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Roman Catholics participating as lodge members within Freemasonry . McGivney wished to provide them an alternative . He also believed that Catholicism and <unk> were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their American @-@ Catholic heritage . 
 McGivney traveled to Boston to examine the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn to learn about the recently established Catholic Benevolent League , both of which offered insurance benefits . He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day . He expressed an interest in establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters , but the charter of Massachusetts Foresters prevented them from operating outside their Commonwealth . McGivney 's committee of St. Mary 's parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original . 
 The name of Columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to Anglo @-@ Saxon Protestant leaders , who upheld the explorer ( a Catholic Genovese Italian working for Catholic Spain ) as an American hero , yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent Catholic immigrants . In taking Columbus as their patron , they were expressing their belief that not only could Catholics be full members of American society , but were instrumental in its foundation . McGivney had originally conceived of the name " Sons of Columbus " , but James T. Mullen , who would become the first Supreme Knight , successfully suggested that " Knights of Columbus " would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization . 
 By the time of the first annual convention in 1884 , the Order was prospering . The five councils throughout Connecticut had a total of 459 members . Groups from other states were requesting information . The Charter of 1899 included four statements of purpose , including : " To promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper , and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best . " The new charter showed members ' desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society . 
 The original insurance system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight 's widow a $ 1 @,@ 000 death benefit . Each member was assessed $ 1 upon a death , and when the number of Knights grew beyond 1 @,@ 000 , the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase . Each member , regardless of age , was assessed equally . As a result , younger , healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older . There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work . Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $ 5 a week for 13 weeks ( roughly equivalent to $ 125 @.@ 75 in 2009 dollars ) . If he remained sick after that , the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him . 
 = = = Creation of the Fourth Degree = = = 
 From the very early days of the Order , members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members ; this issue was discussed at the National Meeting of 1899 . As early as 1886 Supreme Knight James T. Mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress . The K of C established the Grand Cross of the Knights of Columbus but awarded it only to Cristobal Colón y de La Cerda , Duke of Veragua and descendant of Columbus , when he visited the US in 1893 . 
 About 1 @,@ 400 members attended the first exemplification of the Fourth Degree at the Lenox Lyceum in New York on February 22 , 1900 . The event was infused with Catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that " celebrated American Catholic heritage " . The two knights leading the ceremony , for example , were the Expositor of the Constitution and the Defender of the Faith . The ritual soon spread to other cities . The new Fourth Degree members returned to their councils , forming assemblies composed of members from several councils . Those assemblies chose the new members . 
 In 1903 , the Board of Directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism Order @-@ wide , using the New York City model . There was from early on a " desire to receive within its ranks only the best " , and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received Holy Communion within the past two weeks . 
 = = = Persecution by the Ku Klux Klan = = = 
 Not long after the establishment of the Fourth Degree , during the nadir of American race relations , a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth Degree Knights swore to exterminate Freemasons and Protestants , as well as <unk> , burn alive , boil , kill , and otherwise torture anyone , including women and children , when called upon to do so by church authorities . " It is a strange paradox " , according to some commentators , that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti @-@ Americanism . 
 The " bogus oath " was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the Jesuits more than three centuries earlier . The Ku Klux Klan , which was growing into a powerful force through the 1920s , spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against Catholics . During the 1928 Presidential election , the Klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat Catholic Democratic candidate Al Smith . Thomas S. Butler , US Representative from Pennsylvania , read it into the Congressional Record . The bogus oath was refuted by the Committee of Public Information , a war @-@ time propaganda agency of the US Government . 
 Misunderstanding Catholicism , the Klan alleged that Knights were only loyal to the Pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the United States government . Across the country , local , state , and the Supreme Councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic . No one could , but that did not stop the Klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies . Numerous state councils and the Supreme Council believed that this " violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives " , and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed ; they began suing distributors for libel . This caused an end to such publication . As the Order did not wish to appear motivated by a " vengeful spirit " , it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders . 
 To help combat this misconception of what the Fourth Degree was about , the actual oath taken by Fourth Degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent non @-@ Catholic men around the country for them to examine . Many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the Knights . After examining the true oath , a committee of high @-@ ranking California Freemasons , a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath , declared in 1914 : 
 The ceremonial of the Order [ of the Knights of Columbus ] teaches a high and noble patriotism , instills a love of country , inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the Constitution of our Country as the richest and most precious possession of a Knight of the Order . 
 = = = Pierce v. Society of Sisters = = = 
 After World War I , many Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about " foreign " values ; they expected public schools to teach children to be American . Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture , and in 1922 , the voters of Oregon passed the Oregon Compulsory Education Act . The law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools , including Catholic schools . It was promoted by groups such as the Knights of Pythias , the Federation of Patriotic Societies , the Oregon Good Government League , the Orange Order , and the Ku Klux Klan . 
 The Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by 1926 . Roger Nash Baldwin , an associate director of the ACLU and a personal friend of then @-@ Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart , offered to join forces with the Order to challenge the law . The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $ 10 @,@ 000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it . 
 The case became known as Pierce v. Society of Sisters , a seminal United States Supreme Court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment . In a unanimous decision , the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents , not the state , had the authority to educate children as they thought best . 
 = = = Racial integration in the U.S. = = = 
 In the 1920s there was growing anti @-@ Semitism in the United States , a lingering anti @-@ German sentiment left over from World War I , and anti @-@ black violence was prevalent throughout the country . To combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities , including Catholics , the Order formed a historical commission which published a series of books , among other activities . The " Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series " of books included three titles : The Gift of Black Folk , by W. E. B. Du Bois , The Jews in the Making of America by George Cohen , and The Germans in the Making of America by Frederick Schrader . 
 As the 20th century progressed , some councils in the United States became integrated , but many were not . Church officials and organizations encouraged integration . By the end of the 1950s , Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates . In 1963 , Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders . A few months later , a Notre Dame alumnus ' application was rejected by a local council because he was black . Six council officers resigned in protest , and the incident made national news . Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention , but died before he could see it take place . 
 The 1964 Supreme Convention was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans . A few days before the Convention , new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue . The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order . The Convention amended the admissions rule to require one @-@ third of those voting to reject a new member . In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again , requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate .

 In 1997 , the cause for McGivney 's canonization was opened in the Archdiocese of Hartford , and then was placed before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2000 . The Father Michael J. McGivney Guild was formed in 1997 to promote his cause and currently has more than 140 @,@ 000 members . Membership in the Knights of Columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild , nor is membership restricted to Knights ; members must elect to join . 
 On March 15 , 2008 , Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney 's " heroic virtue " , significantly advancing the priest 's process toward sainthood . McGivney may now be referred to as the " Venerable Servant of God " . If the cause is successful , he would be the first priest born in the United States to be canonized as a saint . 
 = = Degrees and principles = = 
 The Order is dedicated to the principles of Charity , Unity , Fraternity , and Patriotism . A First Degree exemplification ceremony , by which a man joins the Order , explicates the virtue of charity . He is then said to be a First Degree Knight of Columbus ; after participating the subsequent degrees , each of which focuses on another virtue , he rises to that status . Upon reaching the Third Degree , a gentleman is a full member . Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do , but rather take the degree by observation . 
 The first ritual handbook was printed in 1885 , but contained only sections teaching Unity and Charity . Supreme Knight Mullen , along with primary ritual author Daniel Colwell , believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections " in accord with the ' Trinity of Virtues , Charity , Unity , and Brotherly love ' " . The third section , expounding Fraternity , was officially adopted in 1891 . 
 = = = Fourth degree = = = 
 After taking their third degree , knights are eligible to receive their fourth degree , the primary purpose of which is to foster the spirit of patriotism and to encourage active Catholic citizenship . Fourth degree members , in addition to being members of their individual councils , are also members of Fourth Degree assemblies which typically comprise members of several councils . As of 2013 , there were 3 @,@ 109 <unk> worldwide . 
 Fewer than 18 % of Knights join the Fourth Degree , which is optional , and whose members are referred to as " Sir Knight " . Of a total 1 @,@ 703 @,@ 307 Knights in 2006 , there were 292 @,@ 289 Fourth Degree Knights . This number increased to 335 @,@ 132 in 2013 . A waiting period of one year from the time the third degree was taken was eliminated in 2013 , and now any Third Degree Knight is eligible to join the Fourth Degree . 
 A new Military Overseas Europe Special District was established in 2013 to oversee assemblies of military personnel serving on that continent . Over 100 Department of Defense civilian employees and active @-@ duty personnel based in Germany , Italy , and Britain took part in a special Fourth Degree <unk> Ceremony at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany in 2013 , and in that year exemplifications were also held in Camp Zama , Japan , and Yongsan Garrison in Seoul , Korea , where there are existing assemblies . 
 Knights volunteer at 136 of the 153 Veteran 's Affairs Medical Centers . 
 = = = = Color corps = = = = 
 Fourth Degree Knights may optionally purchase and wear the full regalia and join an assembly 's Color Corps . The Color Corps is the most visible arm of the Knights , as they are often seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia . Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo , <unk> , white gloves , cape , and naval chapeau . In warm climates and during warm months , a white dinner jacket may be worn , if done as a unit . 
 <unk> are worn from the right shoulder to left hip and are color specific by nation . In the United States , Panama , and the Philippines , baldrics are red , white , and blue .

 Every day in 2012 more than $ 10 million was invested , for a total of $ 2 @.@ 7 billion on the year , and an annual income of $ 905 million . The Order maintains a two prong investment strategy . A company must first be a sound investment before stock in it is purchased , and secondly the company 's activities must not conflict with Catholic social teaching . The Order also provides mortgages to churches and Catholic schools at " very competitive rates " through its <unk> program . 
 Products include permanent and term life insurance , as well as annuities , long term care insurance , and disability insurance .

Only two other insurers in North America have received the highest ratings from both A. M. Best and Standard & Poor 's . Additionally , the Order is certified by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association for ethical sales practices . Standard & Poor 's downgraded the insurance program 's financial strength / credit rating from AAA to AA + in August 2011 not due to the Order 's financial strength , but due to its lowering of the long @-@ term sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA + . Additionally , the insurance program has a low 3 @.@ 5 % lapse rate of the 1 @.@ 7 million members and their families who are insured .

 In 1898 , Keane Council 353 was established at The Catholic University of America , though in later years it moved off campus . The University of Notre Dame Council 1477 was founded in 1910 , and was followed by the councils at Saint Louis University and Benedictine College . In 1919 , Mount St. Mary 's College and Seminary Council 1965 became the first council attached to a college and seminary , at what is now Mount St. Mary 's University . 
 In each autumn since 1966 , the Supreme Council has hosted a College Council Conference at their headquarters in New Haven , Connecticut . Awards are given for the greatest increases in membership , the best Youth , Community , Council , Family , and Church activities , and the overall Outstanding College Council of the year . The most recent winner of the Outstanding College Council Award was The Catholic University of America Council .

 Since its founding , the Knights of Columbus has been involved in evangelization . In 1948 , the Knights started the Catholic Information Service ( CIS ) to provide low @-@ cost Catholic publications for the general public as well as for parishes , schools , retreat houses , military installations , correctional facilities , legislatures , the medical community , and for individuals who request them . Since then , CIS has printed millions of booklets , and thousands of people have enrolled in CIS correspondence and on @-@ line courses . 
 = = Awards = = 
 The Order sponsors a number of international awards . The first , the Gaudium et <unk> Award , is named after the document from the Second Vatican Council , and is the highest honor bestowed by the Order . It " is awarded only in special circumstances and only to individuals of exceptional merit " and comes an honorarium of $ 100 @,@ 000 . Since its institution in 1992 , it has only been awarded five times . The award " recognizes individuals for their exemplary contributions to the realization of the message of faith and service in the spirit of Christ as articulated in the document for which it is named " . 
 The second international award , also only given " when merited " , is the Caritas Award . Named for the theological virtue alternatively translated as either charity or love , it recognizes " extraordinary works of charity and service " . It has been awarded once since its establishment in 2013 . The Saint Michael Award was established in conjunction with the Caritas Award to recognize members of the Order who have exemplified a lifetime of service on behalf of the Knights of Columbus . 
 Additionally , at its annual convention each year , the Order recognizes other individuals and councils with awards . These include the Family of the Year award , and prizes for the best activities in the categories of church , community , council , culture of life , family , and youth . Additionally , top selling general and field insurance agents are recognized , as are top recruiting individuals and councils . 
 = = Political activities = = 
 While the Knights of Columbus support political awareness and activity , United States councils are prohibited by tax laws from engaging in candidate endorsement and partisan political activity due to their non @-@ profit status . Public policy activity is limited to issue @-@ specific campaigns , typically dealing with Catholic family and life issues . The Order has adopted resolutions advocating a Culture of Life , defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman , in defense of religious liberty , and promoting faithful citizenship . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In 1926 , a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico . The Order subsequently launched a $ 1 million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the Church in the Cristero War . Twenty @-@ five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized , including six knights . 
 Several decades later , in 1954 , lobbying by the Order helped convince the U.S. Congress to add the phrase " under God " to the Pledge of Allegiance . President Dwight Eisenhower wrote to Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart thanking the Knights for their " part in the movement to have the words ' under God ' added to our Pledge of Allegiance " . Similar lobbying convinced many state legislatures to adopt October 12 as Columbus Day and led to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's confirmation of Columbus Day as a federal holiday in 1937 . 
 On April 9 , 2006 , the Board of Directors commented on the " U.S. immigration policy [ which ] has become an intensely debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. and Mexico " . They called " upon the President and the U.S. Congress to agree upon immigration legislation that not only gains control over the process of immigration , but also rejects any effort to criminalize those who provide humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants , and provides these immigrants an avenue by which they can emerge from the shadows of society and seek legal residency and citizenship in the U.S. " . 
 The Knights have also been active in political campaigns across the United States in the area of gay marriage , contributing over $ 14 million to help maintain the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman . In 2008 , they were the largest single donor in support of Proposition 8 . A financial contribution of over $ 1 million was made to support the successful initiative to define marriage within the California State Constitution as a union solely between a man and a woman . The Knights have also made financial contributions of $ 1 million to support similar ballot campaigns in Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , and Washington .

 In a 2005 attempt to stop the Canadian parliament from legalizing gay marriage , the Order funded a campaign that included 800 @,@ 000 postcards encouraging members of parliament to reject the measure . As it was in the United States , this effort was criticized by some gay marriage supporters . 
 Also in 2005 , a local Knights of Columbus council in Canada was fined $ 2 @,@ 000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal . The council 's Hall Manager signed a contract for the use of their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah <unk> , but canceled it and returned their money after they became aware that it was for a lesbian wedding reception . The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs , but " could have taken additional steps that would have recognized the inherent dignity of the complainants and their right to be free from discrimination " . Instead of simply canceling the appointment , the court said , the council could have directed the complainants to other halls and assisted them in finding another place to hold their event . 
 = = = Mexico = = = 
 Following the Mexican Revolution , the new government began persecuting the Church . To destroy the Church 's influence over the Mexican people , anti @-@ clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution , beginning a 10 @-@ year persecution of Catholics which resulted in the death of thousands , including several knights who were later canonized . 
 Leaders of the Order began speaking out against the Mexican government , and Columbia , the official magazine of the Knights , also ran articles critical of the regime . The November 1926 cover of Columbia portrayed <unk> carrying a banner of liberty and warning of " The Red Peril of Mexico " , the Mexican legislature banned both the Order and the magazine throughout the country . 
 = = = Heads of state = = = 
 The Knights of Columbus invites the head of state of every country they operate in to the Supreme Convention each year . In 1971 , U.S. President Richard Nixon gave the keynote address at the States Dinner ; Secretary of Transportation and Knight John Volpe was responsible for this first appearance of a U.S. President at a Supreme Council gathering . President Ronald Reagan spoke at the Centennial Convention in 1982 . President George H.W. Bush appeared in 1992 . President Bill Clinton sent a written message while he was in office , and President George W. Bush sent videotaped messages before he attended in person at the 2004 convention . President Barack Obama has also sent written messages during his term in office . 
 John F. Kennedy , the only Catholic to be elected President of the United States , was a Fourth Degree member of Bunker Hill Council No. 62 and Bishop <unk> General Assembly . Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart visited Kennedy at the White House on Columbus Day , 1961 . The president told Hart that his younger brother , Ted Kennedy , had received " his Third Degree in our Order three weeks before " . Hart presented Kennedy with a poster of the American Flag with the story of how the Order got the words " under God " inserted in the Pledge of Allegiance . 
 In 1959 , Fidel Castro sent an aide to represent him at a Fourth Degree banquet in honor of the Golden Jubilee of the Order 's entry into Cuba . Supreme Knight Hart attended a banquet in the Cuban Prime Minister 's honor in April of that year sponsored by the Overseas Press Club and later sent him a letter expressing regret that they were not able to meet in person . Reagan also presented the Order with a President 's Volunteer Action Award at the White House in 1984 . 
 The Knights of Columbus were among the groups that welcomed Pope Benedict XVI on the South Lawn of the White House on April 16 , 2008 , the pontiff 's 81st birthday , during his visit to the U.S.

 Many notable clerics are also Knights , including Cardinal William Joseph Levada , prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ; Cardinal Sean O 'Malley , Archbishop of Boston ; and Cardinal Jaime Sin , former Archbishop of Manila . In the world of sports , Vince Lombardi , the famed former coach of the Green Bay Packers ; wrestler Lou Albano ; James Connolly , the first Olympic gold @-@ medal champion in modern times ; Floyd Patterson , former heavyweight boxing champion ; and baseball legend Babe Ruth were all knights . 
 On October 15 , 2006 , Bishop Rafael <unk> Valencia ( 1878 – 1938 ) was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in Rome . In 2000 , six other Knights were declared saints by Pope John Paul II .

 = = = Emblem of the Order = = = 
 The emblem of the Order was designed by Past Supreme Knight James T. Mullen and adopted at the second Supreme Council meeting on May 12 , 1883 . Shields used by medieval knights served as the inspiration , and the emblem consists of a shield mounted on a <unk> cross , which is an artistic representation of the cross of Christ . This represents the Catholic identity of the Order . 
 Mounted on the shield are three objects : a fasces ; an anchor ; and a dagger . In ancient Rome , the fasces was carried before magistrates as an emblem of authority . The Order uses it as " symbolic of authority which must exist in any tightly @-@ bonded and efficiently operating organization " . The anchor represents Christopher Columbus , patron of the Order . The short sword , or dagger , was a weapon used by medieval knights . The shield as a whole , with the letters " K of C " , represents " Catholic Knighthood in organized merciful action " . 
 = = = Fourth Degree emblem = = = 
 The Fourth Degree emblem features a dove , a cross , and a globe . In the tradition of the Knights these symbols " typify the union of the three Divine Persons in one Godhead , referred to as the most Blessed Trinity " . The red , white , and blue are taken from the American flag and represent patriotism , the basic principle of the Fourth Degree . Styled with the continents of the western hemisphere in white , the blue globe represents God the Father . A red Isabella cross , for the queen who sponsored Columbus , serves as a symbol of God the Son . The white dove is a symbol of peace and God the Holy Spirit . Columbus ' name in Italian ( Colombo ) also means " dove " . 
 = = = Colombian Squires emblem = = = 
 The emblem of the Squires symbolizes the ideals which identify a squire . On the arms of a Maltese cross are the letters " P " , which represents the physical development necessary to make the body as strong as the spirit ; " I " , which stands for the intellectual development needed for cultural and mental maturity ; " S " , which represents the spiritual growth and practice of our faith ; and " C " , which stands for the development of citizenship and civic life . The larger letters : " C " , representing Christ and also Christopher Columbus ; " S " , the Squires ; and " K " , the Knights of Columbus , by whom the Squires program is sponsored , are intertwined in the center of the cross . They are the three foundations of the program . 
 The Latin motto , " Esto <unk> " , encircles the emblem . Translated into English , it means " Be Worthy " .

 Many councils also have women 's auxiliaries . At the turn of the 20th century two were formed by local councils and each took the name the Daughters of Isabella . Using the same name , both groups expanded and issued charters to other circles but never merged . The newer organization renamed itself the Catholic Daughters of the Americas in 1921 and both have structures independent of the Knights of Columbus . Other groups are known as the <unk> . In the Philippines , the ladies ' auxiliary is known as the Daughters of Mary Immaculate .

 The Knights ' official junior organization is the Columbian Squires . Founded in 1925 in Duluth , Minnesota , this international fraternity for boys 10 – 18 has grown to over 5 @,@ 000 circles . According to Brother Barnabas McDonald , <unk> , the Squires ' founder : " The supreme purpose of the Columbian Squires is character building . " 
 Squires have fun and share their Catholic faith , help people in need , and enjoy the company of friends in social , family , athletic , cultural , civic and spiritual activities . Through their local circle , Squires work and socialize as a group of friends , elect their own officers , and develop into Catholic leaders . When Squires process in a color guard , they wear blue cape , similar to those worn by members of the Fourth Degree , and black berets . 
 Each circle is supervised by a Knights of Columbus council or assembly , and has an advisory board made up of either the Grand Knight , the Deputy Grand Knight and Chaplain , or the Faithful Navigator , the Faithful Captain , and Faithful Friar . Circles are either council based , parish based , or school based , depending on the location of the circle and the Knight counselors .

 = It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) = 
 " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan and first released on his 1965 album , Bringing It All Back Home . It was written in the summer of 1964 , first performed live on October 10 , 1964 , and recorded on January 15 , 1965 . Described by Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as a " grim masterpiece , " the song features some of Dylan 's most memorable lyrical images . Among the well @-@ known lines sung in the song are " He not busy being born is busy dying , " " Money doesn 't talk , it swears , " " Although the masters make the rules , for the <unk> and the fools " and " But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked . " The lyrics express Dylan 's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy , commercialism , consumerism , and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture , but unlike those in some of his earlier protest songs , do not express optimism in the possibility of political or social solutions . Dylan 's preoccupations in the lyrics , nevertheless , extend beyond the socio @-@ political , expressing existential concerns , touching on urgent matters of personal experience . 
 Dylan has stated that " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " is one of his songs that means the most to him , and he has played the song often in live concerts . Since its original release on Bringing It All Back Home , live versions of the song have been issued on The Bootleg Series Vol . 6 : Bob Dylan Live 1964 , Concert at Philharmonic Hall , Before the Flood and Bob Dylan at Budokan . Dylan can also be seen performing the song in the film Dont Look Back and the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle . The song has been covered by a number of other artists , including Roger McGuinn , The Byrds , Billy Preston , Hugo Race , Terence Trent D 'Arby , Mick Farren , Caetano Veloso , Marilyn Scott , and The Duhks . 
 = = Bob Dylan 's version = = 
 Dylan wrote " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " in the summer of 1964 . Although he was prepared to take his time developing the song , as he did with " Mr. Tambourine Man " , he finished it in time for inclusion on the Bringing It All Back Home album , which was recorded in January 1965 . Dylan first performed " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " live on October 10 , 1964 at Philadelphia Town Hall . The version included on Bringing It All Back Home was recorded on January 15 , 1965 , the same day that the other three songs on side 2 of the album ( " Mr. Tambourine Man " , " Gates of Eden " and " It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue " ) were recorded , with Tom Wilson producing . 
 It was long thought that the four songs that make up side 2 of Bringing It All Back Home were recorded in one long take . This is not true , but " Gates of Eden " was recorded in a single take and " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " was recorded in one take after a single false start ( the false start can be heard on both the 6 @-@ disc and 18 @-@ disc versions of The Bootleg Series Vol . 12 : The Cutting Edge 1965 – 1966 , released in 2015 ) . 
 Dylan biographer Howard Sounes described " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " as a " grim masterpiece . " The only accompaniment is Dylan 's guitar , playing folk @-@ blues riffs and up and down chord progressions . Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song 's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers ' in their hit recording of " Wake Up Little Susie " . The lyrics of " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " express Dylan 's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy , commercialism , consumerism , and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture , but unlike those in his earlier protest songs , do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions . In his book Bob Dylan , Performing Artist , author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses " the possibility that the most important ( and least articulated ) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality , and it 's coming at us from every direction . " Williams goes on to say that the song successfully paints a portrait of an " alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its ' rules ' . " As such , a major target in the song is the old , established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted . 
 While it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with the previous song on the album , " Gates of Eden " , the critique in " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " is more direct and less allusive . Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs , " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " is a transitional song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions . Instead , Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would become his trademark . However , with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs , along with a more complex figurative language . Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan 's most memorable images . The opening lines begin the song 's torrent of apocalyptic images : 
 Darkness at the break of noon 
 Shadows even the silver spoon 
 The handmade blade , the child 's balloon 
 Eclipses both the sun and moon 
 To understand you know too soon 
 There is no sense in trying 
 Critic Andy Gill links the opening line of the song to the title of Arthur Koestler 's bleak novel Darkness at Noon , set in the Great Stalinist purge of 1938 in Soviet Russia . For Gill , Dylan is suggesting that the human spirit can be cast into darkness by the dead hand of communism as well as by American capitalism . 
 According to Seth Rogovoy , this opening echoes the Book of Ecclesiastes , where the author states ( 1 : 17 ) " I observed all deeds beneath the sun , and behold all is futile . There are echoes of Ecclesiastes throughout the song . Another example is : 
 The masters make the rules 
 For the wise man and the fools . 
 The author of Ecclesiastes laments ( 2 : 15 – 16 ) " The fate of the fool will befall me also ; to what advantage , then , have I become wise ? But I come to the conclusion that this , too , was futility , because the wise man and the fool are both forgotten . The wise man dies , just like the fool . " 
 One of the most famous lines from the song reminds listeners that even the most powerful people will ultimately be judged : 
 But even the president of the United States 
 Sometimes must have to stand naked 
 These lines seemed particularly prescient when Dylan performed the song on his 1974 tour with the Band , a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as President of the United States as a result of the Watergate crisis . After the song has confronted sex , religion and politics , it ends with the lines : 
 And if my thought @-@ dreams could be seen 
 They 'd probably put my head in a guillotine 
 But it 's alright , Ma , it 's life and life only 
 Dylan 's preoccupations in the lyrics extend beyond socio @-@ political commentary , and touch on urgent matters of personal <unk> challenge to live and grow in the face of uncertainty . 
 He not busy being born is busy dying 
 Jimmy Carter would later refer to the line in his presidential nomination speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention , though it addresses matters of the self which supersede politics , in the process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism . Throughout the song , the words pour out quickly , with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines , so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed : <unk> <unk> <unk> in the verses and AAB in the chorus . 
 Dylan has cited " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " as one of his songs that means the most to him . In 1980 he stated that " I don 't think I could sit down now and write ' It 's Alright , Ma ' again . I wouldn 't even know where to begin , but I can still sing it . " In 1997 , Dylan told The New York Times , " I 've written some songs that I look at , and they just give me a sense of awe . Stuff like , ' It 's Alright , Ma , ' just the alliteration in that blows me away . " 
 " It 's Alright Ma " song has featured in Dylan 's live concerts throughout his long career . Dylan 's website records that , as of March 2015 , the song has been performed 772 times by Dylan in live performance . Concert performances of the songs have been released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 6 : Bob Dylan Live 1964 , Concert at Philharmonic Hall ( recorded on October 31 , 1964 ) , Before the Flood ( recorded on February 14 , 1974 ) and Bob Dylan at Budokan ( recorded on February 28 , 1978 ) . Dylan also played the song on his Rolling Thunder Revue Tour in 1975 and 1976 , as well as on his 1978 tour and his Never Ending Tour from the late 1980s up to the present . Footage of Dylan playing " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " in May 1965 is included in the film Dont Look Back , and a live performance of Dylan playing the song with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on February 25 , 1986 is included in the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle . Dylan also sang this song at his October 16 , 1992 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration at Madison Square Garden , which was released on The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration album . The studio recording was re @-@ released on the 2008 compilation album Playlist : The Very Best of Bob Dylan ' 60s . 
 = = Cover versions = = 
 A widely known cover of " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding " ) is that performed by Roger McGuinn for the soundtrack of the 1969 film , Easy Rider . The film 's scriptwriter and star , Peter Fonda , had originally intended to use Dylan 's version of the song in the film but after failing to secure the appropriate licensing he asked McGuinn to record a cover of it instead . McGuinn 's version of the song included on the Easy Rider soundtrack album , features McGuinn on guitar and vocals , accompanied by his bandmate from The Byrds , Gene Parsons , on harmonica . 
 The Byrds also recorded a version of the song during the 1970 recording sessions for their album ( Untitled ) but it was not included in the final track listing . The Byrds occasionally performed the song in concert during 1970 and a live recording of it , from a March 1 , 1970 appearance at the Felt Forum , was included on the 2000 remaster of the ( Untitled ) album , which was re @-@ titled as ( Untitled ) / ( <unk> ) . This version also appears as a bonus track on the 2002 remastered version of the compilation album , The Byrds Play Dylan , and on the 2006 4 @-@ disc box set There Is a Season . 
 In 1971 , Nannie <unk> included " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " on her album I Thought About You and in 1973 Billy Preston included the song on Everybody Likes Some Kind Of Music . Bettina <unk> included a cover of the song on her 1975 album The Bitter Mirror . Artists who have covered the song since then include Hugo Race , Terence Trent D 'Arby , Mick Farren , Caetano Veloso , Marilyn Scott , The Duhks , and Ground Components . 
 In 2014 , Lee Abramson covered " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " on his band 's album Blood . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Clinton Heylin , in his biography Bob Dylan : Behind the Shades Revisited , wrote that the recording " opened up a whole new genre of finger @-@ pointing song , not just for Dylan but for the entire panoply of pop . " Heylin adds that " It 's Alright , Ma " probably contained more " memorable aphorisms " than any of Dylan 's songs . One of these lines is " he not busy being born is busy dying , " from the song 's second verse , which was used by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention . During his presidential campaign for in 2000 , Al Gore told talk show host Oprah Winfrey that this was his favorite quotation . Writer and journalist Christopher Hitchens quoted from the song 's lyrics in his last article for Vanity Fair , written shortly before his death from esophageal cancer . Hitchens posted at the top of his essay the verse of " It 's Alright Ma " that ends with the words " That he who is not busy being born is busy dying " . 
 Another memorable line is " Money doesn 't talk , it swears , " which appears in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations . In addition , the Columbia Dictionary of Quotations lists this as well as three other lines from the song : " Although the masters make the rules , for the <unk> and the fools , " " But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked " and " Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh @-@ colored Christs that glow in the dark , it 's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred . " Other well @-@ known lines include " Propaganda , all is phony " and " Advertising signs they con you into thinking you 're the one . " 
 In a 2005 reader 's poll reported in Mojo magazine , " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " was listed as the # 8 all @-@ time greatest Bob Dylan song , and a similar poll of artists ranked the song at # 21 . In 2002 , Uncut magazine listed it as the # 5 all @-@ time Dylan song . The song was featured in the final episode of The Sopranos . It has also been referenced by other songwriters . For instance , the indie @-@ rocker Stephen Malkmus quotes " It 's Alright Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) " at the end of his song " Jo @-@ Jo 's Jacket " from Malkmus ' debut solo album . 
 = Kinzie Street railroad bridge = 
 The Chicago and North Western Railway 's Kinzie Street railroad bridge ( also known as the Carroll Avenue bridge ) is a single leaf bascule bridge across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago , Illinois . At the time of its opening in 1908 it was the world 's longest and heaviest bascule bridge . Previous bridges on the same site included the first bridge to cross the Chicago River , Chicago 's first railroad bridge , and one of the first all @-@ steel bridges in the United States . 
 The Chicago Sun @-@ Times , the last railroad customer to the east of the bridge , moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in 2000 , and the bridge has been unused since . It was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007 . 
 = = Location = = 
 Kinzie Street railroad bridge is located at 41 ° 53 ′ 18 @.@ 7 ″ N 87 ° 38 ′ 21 ″ W , it runs in an east @-@ west orientation , spanning the north branch Chicago River between the Near North Side and Near West Side community areas of Chicago . To the south is the historic area of Wolf Point at the confluence of the main stem of the Chicago River with the north and south branches , and to the east is 350 West Mart Center and Merchandise Mart . The railroad track across the bridge is a spur line of the Union Pacific Railroad , that branches off from the route of the Union Pacific / North Line about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north @-@ west of the bridge . The railroad to the east of the bridge has been abandoned since 2000 . 
 = = Previous bridges = = 
 Through the 1820s a small settlement grew around Wolf Point , at the forks of the Chicago River . In June 1829 , Samuel Miller — who owned a tavern on the north shore of the river beside the forks — and Archibald <unk> were authorized to run a ferry across the mouth of the north branch of the river , just south of the present Kinzie Street . By 1832 the ferry had been replaced with a pedestrian bridge that was the first bridge to be constructed across the Chicago River . 
 On October 10 , 1848 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad — Chicago 's first railroad — began operating out of a depot on the west side of the Chicago River , near the corner of Canal and Kinzie Streets . Though the City of Chicago had authorized the railroad to construct a bridge across the north branch of the river as early as July 17 , 1848 , it was not until 1851 that the railroad began to purchase the land needed to build the Wells Street Station to the east of the river . In order to access the new station a floating pontoon bridge designed by Jenks D. Perkins was built across the north branch at roughly the same location as the earlier pedestrian bridge . This bridge — the first railroad bridge in Chicago — was completed in 1852 , allowing trains to access the railroad 's new Wells Street Station and subsequently industry on the north bank of the Chicago River as far as the Ogden Slip and Navy Pier . 
 The original railroad bridge was replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that , along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River , was one of the United States ' first all steel railroad bridges . This bridge was constructed from Bessemer steel , which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898 . The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position , allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27 ½ hours on March 13 and March 14 , 1898 . 
 = = Bascule bridge = = 
 River traffic and railroad traffic were increasingly in competition with each other . In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven @-@ coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time , ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river . Meanwhile , boats on the river were getting larger and finding it increasingly difficult to navigate the bridges at the mouth of the north branch , so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic . Therefore , in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river . 
 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 The bridge is designed to carry two railroad tracks across the river . Its superstructure consists of two spans constructed by the Strauss Bascule & Concrete Bridge Company : a 26 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) plate @-@ girder span on the west bank of the river and the 170 @-@ foot ( 52 m ) movable main span that rests on the east trunnion pier . The size and weight of the main span , which , when completed would be world 's longest and heaviest bascule span , required the trunnion pier to be constructed on foundations that extend to the bedrock 94 feet ( 29 m ) below the river bed . To achieve this caissons were sunk to a depth of 29 feet ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) below the river bed and then 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) diameter wells were sunk the remaining 65 feet ( 20 m ) . The substructure of the bridge was constructed by the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 The Chicago and North Western Railway originally planned for two bridges side @-@ by @-@ side that could carry four railroad tracks into the Wells Street Station . However , by the time that the first bridge opened on September 19 , 1908 an alternative scheme was already underway that led to the closure of Wells Street Station and its replacement with a new terminal on the west bank of the river . When the new station ( now the Ogilvie Transportation Center ) opened in 1911 , Kinzie Street railroad bridge was left to handle freight traffic only . In 1930 the Merchandise Mart was opened on the site of the old Wells Street Station . Merchandise Mart was built on air rights of the Chicago and North Western , and in the spring of 1932 the railroad opened a new freight house underneath the building that was designed to handle 1 @,@ 000 short tons ( 910 @,@ 000 kg ) of outbound and 600 short tons ( 540 @,@ 000 kg ) of inbound freight per day . 
 = = = Abandonment = = = 
 During the second half of the 20th century the number of companies using the railroad for shipping on Chicago 's near north side declined severely . In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant . The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned . Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s , and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer , the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , with only one train per day . The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position . On December 12 , 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks . 
 = = = Proposals for reuse = = = 
 Tests were conducted in 1953 to see if the spur could be used as a part of a commuter line with stops at Merchandise Mart , State Street , and Michigan Avenue , but the plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons . In the 1970s architect Harry Weese suggested a light rail line along the spur to connect Chicago 's downtown stations with the River North neighborhoods . In 2008 the City of Chicago Department of Transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis to look at a proposal to create a transit link from Union Station and the Ogilvie Transportation Center to Michigan Avenue using the Union Pacific train tunnel running under the Apparel Center , the Merchandise Mart and other buildings east toward North Michigan Avenue . The proposed Carroll Avenue Transitway would include the retrofitting of Kinzie Street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams . 
 = Sarcófago = 
 Sarcófago was an influential Brazilian extreme metal band . They were fronted by Sepultura 's original singer , Wagner Lamounier , and Geraldo Minelli . 
 The front cover of the band 's debut album , I.N.R.I. , is regarded as a great influence on black metal 's corpse paint style make @-@ up . That record is also considered one of the " first wave " albums that helped shape the genre . Their second LP , The Laws of Scourge , was one of the first technical death metal records to be released . 
 The band broke up in 2000 , after releasing the Crust EP . Former members , minus Wagner , played throughout Brazil in 2006 under the moniker Tributo ao Sarcófago ( Tribute to Sarcófago ) . In 2009 , rumors surfaced that the original I.N.R.I. line @-@ up were reuniting for a small , high @-@ profile tour , but proved to be a false . A reissue of their back catalogue is in the works , a joint effort between Cogumelo Records and American label <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early days ( 1985 – 1988 ) = = = 
 Sarcófago ( Portuguese and Spanish for ' sarcophagus ' ) was formed in 1985 in Uberlândia , Minas Gerais , Brazil . Equally indebted to early extreme metal groups such as Bathory , Celtic Frost , Slayer , and Finnish hardcore punk , Sarcófago 's goal was to create the most aggressive music ever . Wagner Lamounier , who parted acrimoniously from Sepultura in March of that same year , was invited to join the band . Although Sepultura never recorded anything with Lamounier , he contributed the lyrics to the song " Antichrist " on their <unk> Devastation EP . Sarcófago 's vinyl debut was on the Cogumelo <unk> split album Warfare Noise I , originally released in 1986 . Sarcófago contributed the three tracks " <unk> " , " The Black Vomit " and " <unk> " . Their music and lyrics were considered shocking at the time , something which brought them a considerable amount of attention . The band 's line @-@ up at that point consisted of " Butcher " ( guitars ) , " Antichrist " ( Lamounier ; vocals ) , " Incubus " ( Geraldo Minelli ; bass ) and " Leprous " ( Armando Sampaio ; drums ) . 
 With new drummer " D.D. Crazy " — hailed as a pioneer in the metal world for his extensive use of blast beats on this album — Sarcófago released <unk> in July 1987 . The band 's attire on the album 's cover — corpsepaint , leather jackets , and bullet belts — is considered the first definite statement of black metal 's visual presentation and style . The music has been equally influential , a milestone in the development of the genre . Despite the record 's now @-@ legendary status , Lamounier was unsatisfied with the end results , voicing complaints over the quality of the recording sessions and the band being plagued by inner strife . After the release of I.N.R.I. , Sarcófago briefly disbanded . Lamounier moved to Uberlândia to study economics on the Federal University of Uberlândia ( <unk> ) , while Butcher and his brother D.D. Crazy left the group . The latter would play drums on <unk> 's debut , 1989 's Sexual Carnage . 
 = = = Rotting ( 1989 – 1990 ) = = = 
 When Rotting first came out it stirred a huge amount of controversy due to its cover art — a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ 's face . It was based upon a medieval painting . The cover artist himself , Kelson Frost , refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man 's head , which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah . 
 Rotting musically differs from the raw , hyper @-@ speed black metal of I.N.R.I. Session drummer " Joker " brought a different set of influences to the band ( such as crossover thrash ) ; Wagner also learned to play guitar in record time , and contributed many of the album 's guitar riffs . Rotting also marked their first change of aliases : the group 's core duo renamed themselves " Wagner Antichrist " and " Gerald Incubus " . Their visual department went through changes as well — they dropped the arm and leg spikes because they made playing live difficult . 
 Rotting was Sarcófago 's first release to have international distribution , handled in Europe by British label Music for Nations , and by Maze / <unk> in America . Maze Records released a censored version of Rotting , blacking out the original cover and adding a sticker which read " Featuring the Original Lead Singer of Sepultura " without consulting the band . Infuriated by the label 's actions , Sarcófago sued them . 
 = = = The Laws of Scourge ( 1991 – 1993 ) = = = 
 Next came The Laws of Scourge ( 1991 ) , considered a " revolution " in the band 's career . A combination of better musicianship , improved production values , and more sophisticated songwriting landed them into technical death metal territory . Sarcófago 's new direction in music was partly influenced by new members Fábio " Jhasko " ( guitar ) and Lúcio Olliver ( drums ) , and inspired by a newer crop of extreme metal bands such as Godflesh , Paradise Lost , Bolt Thrower , Deicide , and Morbid Angel . 
 The Laws of Scourge became Sarcófago 's best selling record , and responsible for their most extensive touring schedule to this date . Their tour trek also included their first international dates : they visited South American countries such as Peru and Chile , and in Europe they played shows in Portugal and Spain . In Brazil , their most important gig was to open for Texas hardcore punk pioneers the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles in São Paulo . 
 = = = Hate ( 1994 – 1996 ) = = = 
 Musically speaking , Hate is notable for its stripped @-@ down , straightforward approach and the use of a drum machine , the latter sparking some controversy . Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device , on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes , which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine . 
 The band cut their hair short , in protest of the masculine long hair style becoming popular due to the massive success of grunge in the early 1990s . Men sporting long hair has traditionally been associated with counterculture groups , and it is especially present in the metalhead subculture . Wagner declared : 
 In late 1996 , Sarcófago released the Decade of Decay compilation which , amongst other things , featured demo versions of their early songs and rare backstage photographs . The band described the CD as a " gift " to their fans . 
 = = = The Worst ( 1997 – 2000 ) = = = 
 Sarcófago 's fourth and final album , The Worst ( 1997 ) , sees the band slowing down in relation to the speed @-@ oriented Hate , and having a better grasp of drum programming . Minelli and Lamounier saw this record as a " summation " of their career . 
 With the turn of the millennium came the Crust EP , Sarcófago 's swansong release . It was meant to be a preview of an upcoming album , but the band 's core duo parted ways before commencing its recording . 
 = = = Sarcófago Tribute tour ( 2006 – 2009 ) = = = 
 In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Warfare Noise split album , Cogumelo Records and Gerald Incubus organized a comeback show with Sarcófago in Belo Horizonte . Along with Minelli , the line @-@ up for that event was Fábio Jhasko on guitars , Manu Joker and old @-@ time friend Juarez " <unk> " on vocals . That performance was recorded and there are plans to release it in DVD format . Lamounier opted not to join this " Sarcófago Tribute " band for the lack in desire to play professionally . However , Wagner still pursues his musical interests — he plays in the crust punk band Commando Kaos . 
 In October 2007 , Sarcófago flew to Santiago , Chile to play in the Black Shadows Festival , alongside death metal pioneers Possessed . 
 In March 2009 , Wagner supposedly announced that Sarcófago would reunite , and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the Wacken Open Air and Hole in the Sky festivals , as well as dates in London , New York , Los Angeles and Tokyo . He stated it would be the original I.N.R.I. line @-@ up , but that this would be the only tour they would be doing and there would be no new material . A couple of days later , Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax . 
 = = Lyrical approach = = 
 Inspired by Venom and Hellhammer , Sarcófago 's early lyrics were openly Satanic . These lyrics frequently employed curse words and crude , obscene scenarios , such as in the case of " Desecration of ( the ) Virgin " , a blasphemous take on Mother Mary 's virgin birth . 
 Whilst still polemical , by 1989 's Rotting the band 's stance on Christianity was more agnostic than Satanic . The original vinyl release came with a lengthy manifesto written by Lamounier , in which he criticized the alienating effect that Catholicism had on Brazilian society . The band also questioned the divine nature of Christ , declaring he was just a regular man who died for his ideas . On a less serious note the album featured " Sex , Drinks and Metal " , a hedonistic ode to the headbanger lifestyle . 
 Their next album , The Laws of Scourge , continued their new @-@ found focus on more " reality @-@ based " themes , with lyrics generally covering such death @-@ related topics as suicide and homicide . The band had trouble again with American censors , with the lyrics of the re @-@ recorded version of " The Black Vomit " being forcibly omitted from the CD booklet as well as the entire " Prelude to Suicide " track . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The band left a widespread influence on black metal circles worldwide , particularly among the Scandinavian portion of the so @-@ called " second wave " of the genre . " It is sobering " , claimed Terrorizer magazine , " to think of what wouldn 't have happened had ' I.N.R.I. ' not been released " . 
 Fenriz , drummer of Darkthrone , included a Sarcófago track ( " Satanic Lust " ) in his The Best of Old @-@ School Black Metal compilation , released by <unk> Records . Of Sarcófago 's I.N.R.I. , he said it was an " album " that " you buy or die " . Euronymous , the deceased guitarist of Mayhem and erstwhile leader of the so @-@ called " Inner Circle " , traded correspondence with Lamounier in the early days of Norway 's scene . In the Lords of Chaos book , <unk> ( Slayer fanzine , ex @-@ Head Not Found ) stated that Euronymous was " obsessed with them because wore lots of spikes and corpsepaint . He said he wanted every band to be like this [ … ] . " Satyricon covered Sarcófago 's " I.N.R.I. " on their Intermezzo II EP , also featured on the Tribute to Sarcófago album , released by Cogumelo Records in 2001 . Key Gorgoroth members <unk> and King were also influenced by Sarcófago . 
 Notable black metal groups from neighbouring Finland were also affected by Sarcófago 's early output . <unk> founder Nuclear <unk> said Sarcófago was one of " the greatest influences " for the band ; Mika <unk> from Impaled Nazarene said that " nothing tops Slayer 's Reign in Blood or <unk> 's I.N.R.I. , you know " . Their version of " The Black Vomit " was included in Tribute to Sarcófago . 
 Lamounier , however , has been critical of several of the bands influenced by Sarcófago , especially bands from the Norwegian black metal scene , wondering how one of the wealthiest countries in the world could have produced such a scene . Although he liked Immortal , Wagner dubbed Euronymous a " nutcase " and considered Burzum " shit " . He also criticized black metal 's purposely lo @-@ fi recording aesthetic ; Lamounier said that Burzum 's guitar timbre " sounded like it was recorded through a transistor radio " . 
 = = Conflict with Sepultura = = 
 An oft @-@ cited aspect of Sarcófago 's history is their long @-@ lasting feud with Sepultura . Although former Sepultura drummer Igor Cavalera eventually dismissed the entire affair as " child 's play " , the music press fuelled their bitter rivalry for many years . Their conflict partially contributed to <unk> 's fame as the perennial " black sheep " of Brazilian heavy metal . 
 Tensions started after Lamounier parted ways with Sepultura , which led to a temporarily awkward situation . In Minelli 's assessment , " everybody had forgotten it " until two years later , when D.D. Crazy smashed a bottle over Andreas Kisser 's head , who had been recently recruited as Sepultura 's new lead guitarist . Kisser was being " too much of a douchebag " . <unk> " <unk> " Gomes , Sepultura roadie and co @-@ author of the band 's Toda a História biography , was one of the prime instigators of that fight . 
 During an interview from The Worst era , Lamounier was asked to comment on Sepultura 's well @-@ publicized break @-@ up , when Max Cavalera left the band in January 1997 . Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out the way they did as , in his words , " with what I knew of them , I think it 's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family , they don 't measure the consequences to get what they want . So , a brother backstabbing the other , deceiving their mother , cheating a friend ... For money , I 'll bet they 're capable of anything . " 
 Annoyed by Lamounier meddling in " private family business " , Max Cavalera 's answer came through " <unk> " , a song on Soulfly 's debut album . 
 Max explained that , in Jamaican patois , " <unk> " means " blood clot " and it is also " a big insult ... It means motherfucker or a piece of shit in Jamaica " . 
 The animosity between the two groups eventually reached another major Brazilian band , crossover thrash act Ratos de Porão . The band got involved in the affair after a 1987 Belo Horizonte gig , when a portion of the audience kept jeering at the band . One version of that story states that Lamounier and Ratos de Porão singer João Gordo were antagonizing each other during the show . Another one tells that when Gordo asked Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera who was " <unk> " at his band , Max accused Sarcófago . 
 Tensions flared up once again five years later when Sarcófago , instead of Ratos de Porão , were picked up to be the opening band of DRI 's first Brazilian shows . Ratos de Porão and friends from São Paulo thrash metal group <unk> invaded Sarcófago 's backstage area ; João Gordo then proceeded to sucker @-@ punch Lamounier while he was lying drunk on the floor , and Gordo 's friends attacked the rest with motorcycle chains . A massive brawl ensued , with a member of DRI 's road crew getting his arm broken .

 = That We Can Play = 
 That We Can Play is the debut EP of the American electronic @-@ music project Games , consisting of producers Daniel Lopatin and Joel Ford . Lopatin and Ford ( who had made electronic music together since their school days ) produced That We Can Play in an apartment studio , using vintage synthesizers and sequencers to recapture the sound and style of 1980s power pop . 
 That We Can Play contains six songs , including four original Games tracks ( one , the opener " Strawberry Skies " , with vocals by Laurel Halo ) . It also has two remixes : a remix of " Strawberry Skies " by the Chicago duo Gatekeeper and a reprise of a song by Canadian musician CFCF . The EP , released in November 2010 on the Hippos in Tanks label , was promoted with music videos and singles . It was well @-@ received by critics , who appreciated the duo 's use of its 1980s power @-@ pop influences , and made the top ten of MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear 's year @-@ end list .

 Ford and Lopatin , who met in a science class , began playing music together in high school . During their practice sessions they experimented with electronic music using a Roland Juno @-@ 60 ( belonging to Lopatin 's father ) and their high school 's Ensoniq SQ @-@ 2 , which Ford used as a drum machine . During these sessions , the two became serious about composing electronic music together . For a time they had separate careers , with Ford moving to New York City to play in soft @-@ rock group <unk> and Lopatin remaining in Boston to produce and compose music as Oneohtrix Point Never . In the summer of 2009 , they developed an idea for a group they called " Games " after what Lopatin described as " an intense 72 @-@ hour internet writing frenzy " . Lopatin and Ford spent a week recording demos at Ford 's home in Massachusetts , developing their sound with " a ridiculously sick collection of vintage synths " they collected during their years as musicians . Other musical commitments slowed the work , but by 2010 they had moved into an apartment ( lacking heat and hot water ) to focus on the project . 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 That We Can Play was recorded with a single stereo Pro Tools track and " outboard , secondhand vintage synths and sequencers " . Ford explained the process of making each song in an interview with XLR8R : " It 's almost like we just sit down with gear and are like , ' Whoa , this sounds sweet , ' and then we 'll make a beat , and be like , ' What if we do this ? ' and something comes out and we move from there . Where it gets really complex — and you can 't be a slacker — is you have to <unk> all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks — and it 's a lot of repetitive , careful @-@ listening kind of work .

 The writing , recording and mixing of That We Can Play is rooted in 1980s power pop . On a technical level , according to Steve Shaw of Fact magazine , Games 's instrumentation includes everything expected in 1980 's music and is executed correctly : bass lines , strings , keytar and <unk> . Instead of merely reproducing the sound from that era , the band pushes the music into unfamiliar territory . According to Pitchfork Media 's Joe Colly , the EP has a nostalgic sound – due , in part , to the analog synths ( " not just vintage but almost aged " instrumentation ) and their " glitchy electro jams . "

 That We Can Play 's opening track , " Strawberry Skies " , the only cut on the release that was produced in a real studio , was inspired by the theme of the American television show Law & Order . Critics compared it to Bananarama 's " Cruel Summer " . The track features dream @-@ like vocals by Laurel Halo , mixed with reverb ; according to Fact , it reflects the " cloud @-@ like " sounds of previous releases by Oneohtrix Point Never . In writing the lyrics to the song , Ford and Lopatin came up with several senseless phrases in writing the melody for the lead vocal , the former saying that he " made them about Shaq and Kobe and eating steak sandwiches and pies , " and the latter saying " Anything just to get the sounds . " " Strawberry Skies " is followed by " MIDI Drift " , which features an Italo bass line , " pitch @-@ bent keytar " and " square wave synths " , and was compared by Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe to the music of Ratatat . 
 The third track , " Planet Party " , called " Apple IIe funk " by Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media , contains " wailing guitar synths " , " fist @-@ pumping bass " , " scattergun freestyle drums " and " sudden , surprisingly violent orchestral stabs " . Produced in the summer of 2010 and the first song to be chosen for inclusion on That We Can Play , Ford recalled , " We were making this smooth @-@ rock , Alan Parsons Project @-@ style shit , and then it completely got sliced and diced , mistakes happened in Pro Tools , and it became something else . " " Shadows in Bloom " , a reprise of Secret Service 's " Flash in the Night " , is a melancholy , mid @-@ tempo power ballad featuring bass , snare and synth harmonies described by a reviewer as violent , cavernous , and harsh . 
 That We Can Play also includes two remixes ; Chicago duo Gatekeeper 's version of " Strawberry Skies " contains a sample of the PlayStation start @-@ up sound and , according to Fact 's Steve Shaw , " ups the ' 80s ante and slows the pace with their trademark industrial sex club character ( sampling Boards of Canada in the process ) , the result sounding far more like a real computer game than any of the UK club tracks currently referencing them " . The EP ends with Games 's version of CFCF 's " It Was Never Meant to Be " , which Shaw described it as a " lush affair " with " chopped DX7 pads and afro @-@ new age staccato melodies " .

 The first song released from That We Can Play was " Midi Drift " , which was posted on Games 's blog in April 2010 . " Shadows in Bloom " premiered on the MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear and Pitchfork Media 's Altered Zones website on September 29 , 2010 . On December 14 , a remix of " Strawberry Skies " by electronic musician Hudson Mohawke ( not included on the EP ) became available for download on Fact 's website ; according to the magazine , it " manages to be totally malevolent while also sounding like an amazing street party , which is quite an achievement " . A Stereogum writer called the Hudson Mohawke remix " nice " , but preferred Gatekeeper 's " strangulation " of the song . 
 That We Can Play was also promoted with several music videos . A video for " Planet Party " was released on Delicious <unk> in August 2010 , which Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media described as " a <unk> smooth , been @-@ around @-@ for @-@ a @-@ few @-@ minutes " production with " jet skis , killer whales , water slides , wind surfing , track racing , and tape @-@ warped women " . A video for " Shadows in Bloom " by <unk> was released on November 11 and , according to Fitzmaurice , " showcases a warped take on airline attendants and air travel that has to be seen to be believed . " On December 13 a video for " Strawberry Skies " , directed by Josef <unk> and described by Gorilla vs. Bear as an " ' 80s chat line @-@ shower montage " , premiered on the blog .

 In August 2010 , Games stated that That We Can Play would be released in late September or early October 2010 . However , when the release date and track list were announced on September 9 the release date had been pushed back to November 2 . The EP , distributed by Hippos in Tanks with cover artwork by Christian " <unk> " Oldham and cover design by Rasmus Emanuel Svensson , was positively received by critics . In a November 3 , 2010 review Steve Shaw praised That We Can Play for its accurate references to 1980s music , writing that the EP " resides in a both unsettled and an unsettling state , with hints of something very strong and unique perhaps being tied down by exploring more recognisable formats " . Shaw recommended it to his readers , giving it a rating of four out of five . In a Boston Globe review Michael Brodeur described the EP as " unrelentingly retro , but intriguingly interstitial " , with a smoothness which " sounds like a familiar future " . Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media called That We Can Play " a quirky and technical treat " but criticized the EP 's brevity , lamenting the omission of previous Games singles " Everything Is Working " and " Heartlands " . That We Can Play was ranked eighth on Gorilla vs. Bear 's list of the top 30 albums of 2010 ; according to Chris <unk> , " The run time here is slight , but the EP 's brevity works in its favor , as there 's not a wasted second on this thing .

 = 15th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 15th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army . Formed in 1914 as part of the all @-@ volunteer Australian Imperial Force from Queensland and Tasmanian recruits , the battalion fought during the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front during the First World War . It was disbanded after the war in 1919 , but later re @-@ raised as a part @-@ time Citizens Forces unit based in Queensland in 1921 , consisting of a mixture of volunteers and conscripts . Economic pressures and limited manpower resulted in the battalion being amalgamated with other battalions a couple of times during the inter @-@ war years . In mid @-@ 1939 , as rising tensions in Europe led to an expansion of the Australian military , the battalion was re @-@ formed in its own right . During the Second World War the 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before taking part in the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea and Bougainville in 1943 – 45 . The battalion was disbanded in 1946 and never re @-@ raised .

 = = = = Formation and service at Gallipoli = = = = 
 The 15th Battalion was originally raised as part of the all @-@ volunteer Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) in September 1914 . Drawing personnel from volunteers from Queensland and Tasmania , it formed part of the 4th Brigade , along with the 13th , 14th , and 16th Battalions . With an authorised strength of 1 @,@ 023 men , the battalion initially consisted of eight companies , of which six came from Queensland and two from Tasmania . The Queensland companies concentrated at Enoggera in September and began initial training , while the Tasmanians formed at Claremont in October . In late November , the battalion concentrated at Broadmeadows , Victoria , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Cannan , who later rose to become Quartermaster General during World War II . Many of the battalion 's officers and non @-@ commissioned officers had previously served in the Citizens Forces and a few had fought in South Africa during the Boer War or in India with the British Army . Following a short period of training , the battalion embarked for overseas on the transport ship SS Ceramic in late December 1914 , after marching through the streets of Melbourne . Initially it had been planned to send the Australians to fight against the Germans on the Western Front , but overcrowding and poor conditions in the training camps in the United Kingdom had resulted in the first Australian contingent , the 1st Division , being sent to Egypt instead . There they commenced training and briefly undertook defensive duties around Kantara , when Ottoman forces raided the Suez Canal . 
 Travelling via Albany , Western Australia , and then through the Suez Canal , the 4th Brigade disembarked at Alexandria on 3 February 1915 and moved into camp at Heliopolis , where it was assigned to Major General Alexander Godley 's New Zealand and Australian Division . Upon arrival , the battalion was reorganised by merging the eight companies into four larger companies , designated ' A ' through to ' D ' . Shortly afterwards , the battalion 's first draft of reinforcements arrived and an extensive period of training in the desert followed throughout February and March . Finally , on 10 April , the 15th Battalion was moved by train to Alexandria , where it embarked upon the troopships <unk> Bee and Australind , bound for Gallipoli . After leaving Alexandria , the 15th Battalion sailed to Mudros , where the Allied force assembled prior to the assault . Assigned to the follow @-@ up waves , the 15th Battalion landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April 1915 . As the Ottoman defenders checked the Allied advance inland , on arrival the 15th Battalion was rushed into the line on the left flank of the beachhead . As the advance inland stalled , the battalion became isolated and threatened with destruction until Cannan withdrew his force to a more tenable position . Later , they helped shore up the line before occupying positions around " Pope 's Hill " and " Russell 's Top " , where they joined an attack on 1 May . After that , they occupied " Quinn 's Post " , and defended it against a strong Ottoman counterattack on 19 May . Further fighting occurred around the battalion 's position as the Ottoman troops began tunnelling under the " no man 's land " that divided the two lines . Counter @-@ mining actions were undertaken , but on 29 May a significant attack was put in against the 15th Battalion 's position and they were briefly forced back before restoring the situation with a strong counterattack . 
 After this a period of stalemate fell across the peninsula . In early June , the 15th Battalion , its strength having fallen to below 600 men , was withdrawn from Quinn 's Post to recuperate in a quiet sector known as " Rest Gully " . Over the next two months , due to illness , the battalion 's personnel were almost completely replaced . It received several drafts of reinforcements , amounting to over 500 men , including its transport element , and by early August it had reached a strength of 720 men . On 6 August , the Allies launched an offensive in an effort to try to break the deadlock , during which the 15th Battalion attacked the Abdel Rahman Bair heights , which was known to the Australians as " Hill 971 " , before later supporting the 14th Battalion 's attack on " Hill 60 " . Casualties were heavy , and on 13 September the battalion was withdrawn for a brief rest on Lemnos , its strength having fallen to just 11 officers and 136 other ranks . They returned to Gallipoli early in November , occupying a position in Hay Valley , as winter began . They remained there until being evacuated on 13 December on the transport Carron , as part of the main Allied withdrawal . The battalion 's casualties during the campaign amounted to 10 officers and 380 other ranks killed , and one officer and 17 other ranks captured . 
 = = = = Fighting on the Western Front = = = = 
 Following the evacuation from Gallipoli , the AIF was re @-@ organised in Egypt . This saw the splitting of the veteran battalions to provide cadres for new battalions as the AIF 's infantry divisions in Egypt were doubled . As a part of this process , the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 47th Battalion , and the 4th Brigade became part of the Australian 4th Division . After a further period of training , in June 1916 the battalion sailed for France aboard the transport Transylvania . After landing at Marseilles , the 15th Battalion moved to northern France via rail to <unk> , moving into the line around Bois Grenier for a brief period on 15 June . Amidst the carnage of the Battle of the Somme which was launched in July , the following month , the 15th Battalion was committed to fighting on the Western Front for the first time , entering the line around Pozières on 5 August , as the 4th Division relieved the shattered 2nd . 
 During the relief , the battalion suffered heavy shelling , which , after it had moved into trenches in front of the village along the sunken road to <unk> , was followed by a brief German attack that was repulsed and resulted in the battalion capturing 20 Germans . In the days that followed , the battalion worked to improve their defensive line , digging saps towards the German trenches while patrols were sent out into no man 's land . Late on 8 August , the 15th put in an attack alongside a British battalion from the Suffolk Regiment , on their left . Amidst heavy shelling and machine @-@ gun crossfire , the attack stalled following the loss of almost all of the officers in the assaulting companies ; nevertheless , despite progress on their left , they succeeded in capturing part of the German line , but were ordered to withdraw the following day . On the night of 9 August , a second attack was put in , in concert with the 16th Battalion , which succeeded in securing part of the German line , despite heavy shelling . At noon the following day , the 15th was relieved as the 4th Brigade was withdrawn from the line and replaced by the 13th . Casualties during the battalion 's first battle on the Western Front were high : 90 killed and 370 wounded . 
 Following this , the 15th Battalion moved to Mouquet Farm , where they supported an attack by the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties . They remained there until early September , when they were withdrawn back to <unk> and then to <unk> , via <unk> . Before this occurred , on 30 August , the 15th experienced a change in command , as Cannan , who had been promoted to brigadier @-@ general , was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry . The remainder of the year was spent in the Ypres salient , around St Eloi and <unk> , before winter fell on the Western Front . It was the worst winter in Europe in 40 years , and the men suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated through the line , conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt , and then later Lagnicourt , in the new year . 
 As winter passed , in an effort to shorten their lines and move into prepared positions , the Germans fell back towards the Hindenburg Line . After the Allies advanced to follow up the withdrawal , the battalion fought its first major battle of 1917 in early April , around Bullecourt , where the 4th Brigade attacked as a complete formation for the first time since Gallipoli . Committed without the protection of an artillery barrage , expecting tank support to win the day , the 4th Brigade suffered heavy casualties ; on the first night , the tanks broke down and on the second , they had proven unable to breach the enemy defences , leaving the infantry to force their way through . After less than 10 hours of fighting , 2 @,@ 339 soldiers from the 4th lay dead or wounded , out of 3 @,@ 000 committed , including 400 from the 15th ; by the end of the attack , only 52 men from the battalion 's assault force remained uninjured . They were subsequently withdrawn from the line back to farmland around the village of <unk> where the battalion was rebuilt , eventually reaching a strength of 719 personnel of all ranks . 
 In mid @-@ 1917 , the Australians were moved to Belgium as the focus of British operations shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French . The first effort came around Messines , on the southern flank , where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines . On 7 June , 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting , the British captured Messines Ridge . Assigned a support role , the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack . The following day , it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack , relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm . The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September . In November 1917 , the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three @-@ month rest , spending the winter around <unk> @-@ la @-@ Fosse and Hollebeke . 
 In early 1918 , the collapse of Tsarist Russia enabled the Germans to transfer a significant number of troops to the Western Front and in March , having amassed 192 divisions , they launched an offensive against the British forces in the Somme . Heavily outnumbered , the British and Dominion troops were pushed back by the initial onslaught and the Australian Corps was thrown into the line in an effort to stem the tide . The 15th Battalion was moved initially to <unk> before securing <unk> late in the month , where they experienced a heavy artillery bombardment before turning back a German attack . Later , after being relieved by a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers , they moved to Rossignol Farm . Throughout April , while the 13th and 15th Brigades fought significant actions around Villers @-@ Bretonneux , the battalion received several drafts of reinforcements , bringing it up to a total of 57 officers and 955 other ranks as it prepared to move up to replace the 15th Brigade in late April . Following their arrival , they undertook a support role , constructing defences before moving on to <unk> on 22 May , remaining there until they marched at the end of the month to <unk> near Corbie , where they conducted several patrol actions . 
 As the German advance in the Amiens sector exhausted itself , in June the Allies began to prepare for their own offensive , conducting a series of small @-@ scale advances which became known as " peaceful penetrations " . That month , a number of American troops were assigned to the battalion to gain experience , as the United States began building up its forces on the Western Front . Lieutenant General John Monash , having taken over as commander of the Australian Corps from William Birdwood , decided to launch a combined arms attack to reduce the salient that had developed in front of Amiens around Hamel and straighten the line . 
 On 4 July , Australian and American forces attacked Hamel . Assigned the task of attacking a German strong point designated the " Pear Trench " , the 15th , with an attached company of Americans , suffered the highest losses of any Australian battalion committed to the battle , losing nine officers and 231 other ranks out of the 636 men committed . The losses began even before the assault , when some of the preparatory barrage dropped short on their forming @-@ up point . In the darkness the three tanks that had been assigned to support their attack temporarily became lost , and as a consequence , the 15th 's initial attack went in without armoured support . Coming up against strong resistance from well @-@ sited machine @-@ gun posts , the advance was held up until they were overcome by Lewis gun teams and section @-@ level fire and movement , which allowed the battalion to gain the Pear Trench . The 15th Battalion 's sole Victoria Cross recipient , Private Henry Dalziel , received his award for his actions during this time while serving as a " number two " within a Lewis @-@ gun team , rushing a German machine @-@ gun post with a revolver . After taking the Pear Trench , the battalion exploited the position moving into the Vaire Trench and Hamel Wood in concert with the tanks that had finally arrived . Following the capture of the village , the battalion defended the captured ground before being relieved by the 49th Battalion late on 5 July . 
 After Hamel , the battalion moved to <unk> Wood , and on 8 August the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive around Amiens . Two days before the advance , the battalion suffered a heavy setback when their commanding officer , McSharry , was mortally wounded in a bombardment around Vaire , while trying to rescue a wounded soldier . In his stead , Major Burford Sampson temporarily took command . Advancing from around Hamel , the battalion attacked the village of Cerisy , and despite enduring a gas attack they succeeded in capturing around 350 Germans . As further advances followed , more actions followed around Lihu Farm and Jeancourt as the 15th Battalion continued to fight around the " Hindenburg Outpost Line " until late September , by which time it had taken heavy casualties , with a strength of just over 300 men . On the eve of the battalion 's final battle , Sampson handed over command to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Johnston . The battles of 1918 had depleted the Australians , inflicting heavy casualties that they had been unable to replace as recruitment in Australia had fallen . In October , at the request of the Australian prime minister , Billy Hughes , they were withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation . They did not return to action before the armistice was signed in November 1918 , after which the battalion 's strength was slowly reduced as men were individually repatriated back to Australia as part of the demobilisation process . The battalion ceased to exist on 27 March 1919 , having been reduced to company strength . 
 During the war , the battalion lost 1 @,@ 194 men killed and 2 @,@ 187 wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : one Victoria Cross , one Companion of the Order of the Bath , two Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George , 13 Distinguished Service Orders ( DSOs ) , two Members of the Order of the British Empire , 30 Military Crosses ( MCs ) , 28 Distinguished Conduct Medals ( DCMs ) , 180 Military Medals ( MMs ) , nine Meritorious Service Medals ( MSMs ) , 64 Mentions in Despatches ( MIDs ) and eight foreign awards . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war years = = = 
 In 1921 , following the conclusion of the demobilisation process , the government undertook a review of Australia 's military requirements and decided to re @-@ organise its part @-@ time military forces to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF units . As a result , the 15th Battalion was re @-@ raised in Brisbane , Queensland , within the 1st Military District . Personnel were drawn from the 2nd Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment , which traced its lineage to the 8th Infantry ( Oxley Battalion ) that had been raised in 1912 from part of the 1 / 9th Australian Infantry Regiment . In 1927 , the battalion received its battle honours from the First World War . Territorial designations were introduced at this time , and the battalion became known as the " Oxley Regiment " in recognition of its connection to the Oxley region . It was also granted the motto <unk> <unk> and , the following year , the battalion became allied with the East Yorkshire Regiment . 
 Initially the strength of the Citizens Forces units was maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service ; in 1929 – 1930 , however , the newly elected Scullin Labor government terminated compulsory service and replaced the Citizens Forces with an all @-@ volunteer " Militia " . Funding was cut heavily , and training opportunities were also reduced . This , combined with economic pressure caused by the Great Depression , which made it difficult for part @-@ time soldiers to maintain their livelihoods while continuing their training commitments , meant that the number of volunteers fell sharply . Consequently , a number of infantry battalions were disbanded or amalgamated . As a result of this decision , the 15th Battalion was merged with the 9th to form the 9th / 15th Battalion . A memorial plaque to the battalion was unveiled in ANZAC Square , in Brisbane , in 1932 . In 1934 , the 9th / 15th was split and the 15th merged with the 26th Battalion to form the 15th / 26th Battalion . This formation was split in July 1939 , as part of a hasty expansion of Australia 's military force as tensions in Europe raised concerns about the country 's preparedness in the event of a future war . Upon re @-@ forming , the 15th Battalion established its drill hall near the Brisbane Cricket Ground . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 = = = = Garrison duty in Australia and service in New Guinea = = = = 
 After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , due to the provisions of the Defence Act , which precluded the Militia from being sent outside Australian territory to fight , the decision was made to raise an all @-@ volunteer force for overseas service known as the " Second Australian Imperial Force " ( 2nd AIF ) . This force was dispatched to the Middle East to fight against the Germans and Italians , while in Australia the compulsory service scheme was re @-@ established in January 1940 and the Militia was called up for short periods of continuous service – up to 90 days – on a rotational basis to improve the overall readiness of Australia 's military forces . The 15th Battalion was partially mobilised for continuous service in mid @-@ 1940 and , in August that year , the battalion sent a detachment of 200 men to undertake garrison duty in Territory of Papua . As part of the 7th Brigade , the detachment was stationed at " Three Mile Camp " near Port Moresby . Later in the year , the detachment was transferred to the 49th Battalion , which remained in Papua . 
 Meanwhile , the rest of the 15th Battalion remained in Brisbane , serving in a part @-@ time capacity . In November and December 1941 , the battalion received three large drafts of conscripts – consisting of several hundred individuals – who were attached to the battalion to receive three months of compulsory full @-@ time training as war loomed in the Pacific . Many of the conscripts received at this time were university students and most had no previous military experience , although some had served as volunteers in the Militia prior to their call up . Initially , these personnel were formed into separate training companies , receiving three months of continuous training at Chermside , with the university students completing a shorter period of just 60 – 70 days , to fit in with their semester break . Later , in February 1942 , once they had completed their period of mandatory training , the conscripts were either released from service , or moved into the battalion 's four rifle companies where they served alongside volunteers on full @-@ time service . 
 Following Japanese victories in Malaya , Singapore and elsewhere in the Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942 , the whole 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and tasked with undertaking defensive duties along the coast of south @-@ east Queensland , based at Caloundra , due to concerns of a potential invasion . The invasion did not occur and , in mid @-@ 1942 , the 15th Battalion was transferred to the 29th Brigade . Consisting of the 42nd and 47th Battalions , the 29th was part of the 5th Division , and was moved north to Townsville , where the battalion served as a garrison force . 
 In January 1943 , the 29th Brigade was deployed to New Guinea to serve as garrison troops in areas that had been recently secured by Allied forces . The 15th Battalion was initially sent to Milne Bay , remaining there for six months . It moved to Buna in July , but did not remain there long , transferring to Morobe a few weeks later . While there , the battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Jack Amies , appealed to the battalion to volunteer for service as part of the AIF . While some already had , the majority of the men were still classified as Militia personnel , which meant that the battalion was restricted in where it could serve and was liable to be broken up . To be classified as an AIF battalion , under the provisions of the newly passed Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 , 65 per cent or more of the personnel had to volunteer for service outside Australian territory . The response was considerable and , by August , the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion . Later that month , as the Australians fought to secure Komiatum , the battalion moved on barges to Nassau Bay , and was committed to combat for the first time , occupying a position around Mount Tambu , known as " Davidson 's Ridge " , before marching to Tambu Bay . Arriving on 23 August , the battalion was initially placed into divisional reserve , as the 29th Brigade was committed to the drive on Salamaua . 
 The campaign was to proceed in conjunction with the effort to capture Lae . As the Japanese garrison there was pressed by the 7th Division advancing from the Markham Valley and the 9th Division advancing along the coast from beaches east of the town , the Japanese hurriedly sought to reinforce Lae , moving about 6 @,@ 000 troops from Salamaua to the south . Sensing an opportunity , in early September the 3rd Division began a drive north on Salamaua from Wau . On 31 August , the battalion joined the fighting , advancing around the right flank of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment and attacking the junction between the <unk> and Scout Ridges . Over the course of 10 days of heavy fighting and hard going up the steep slopes , it gained the position , securing it by 9 September . The battalion had lost 10 men killed and 47 wounded in the process , but had killed 107 Japanese . The following day , the 15th advanced towards <unk> <unk> as Japanese resistance crumbled . Hard @-@ pressed , the Japanese garrison had begun to withdraw from Salamaua , completing the process just before the Allies entered the town on 11 September . The battalion 's total casualties in the fighting around Salamaua between April and September numbered 11 killed and 50 wounded . 
 Following the fall of the town , as the remainder of the 5th Division was rested , the 15th Battalion , which had seen less action due to being held in reserve , was committed to pursuing the withdrawing Japanese . The battalion advanced north towards the Markham River , and on 14 September two companies were transported by barge in an effort to get behind the fugitives and cut them off , but they arrived about an hour too late . On 17 September , the battalion established a large ambush site along the coast south of the river to prevent the fleeing Japanese from evacuating by the sea . The following day , the ambush was sprung as a platoon @-@ sized group attempted to get away . After being beaten back into the jungle , they launched an attack on one of the Australian positions that was blocking their escape . In the ensuing hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , 13 Japanese were killed and one prisoner taken . Further minor clashes followed as the 15th patrolled north and , by late October , it entered Lae . The battalion subsequently took up defensive duties around the town as the 29th Brigade was assigned the task of holding Lae to free up troops from the 7th Division for operations in the Finisterre Range further to the west . 
 = = = = Fighting on Bougainville = = = = 
 The battalion remained in the vicinity of Lae until June 1944 , when it was withdrawn to Australia . It established itself at Strathpine , before moving to Samford , in the greater Brisbane area . After a period of leave , the battalion was re @-@ organised in preparation for employment in the Bougainville campaign , remaining with the 29th Brigade , which was transferred to the 3rd Division . The 3rd had adopted the " jungle divisional " establishment , and the battalion 's authorised strength fell from 910 to 803 . 
 To free up US troops for service in the Philippines , the Australians took over from the US garrison on Bougainville , and the 3rd Division arrived around Torokina , on Bougainville , in November 1944 . Prior to their arrival , the US garrison had maintained a defensive posture , but the Australians launched a limited @-@ scale offensive on the island which evolved into three main drives in the north , south and in the centre of the island . The 15th Battalion embarked on the transport Cape Victory at <unk> on 23 November , and arrived on Bougainville on four days later . Along with the rest of the 29th Brigade , it relieved the US 182 Infantry Regiment , and was assigned to the southern drive towards Buin , where the main Japanese force was based . Its first involvement with the campaign came in December , when the 15th Battalion departed the Jaba River and led the 29th Brigade 's advance along the western coast towards the Tavera River . Upon reaching the river , in order to skirt around the thick jungle , a company was sent up the Adele River on a barge , while the rest of the battalion advanced inland along the <unk> Road . By January 1945 , the 15th was joined by the 29th Brigade 's other two battalions and together they fought through to Mawaraka , before being relieved by the 15th Battalion 's old formation , the 7th Brigade . They were subsequently sent back to Torokina for rest , remaining there until early July 1945 . 
 At that point , the 29th Brigade was committed to the fighting again , moving to the Mivo River , where it took over the advance from the 15th Brigade . As the 15th Battalion advanced to relieve the 57th / 60th Battalion , it clashed with Japanese units and , on 3 July , as a company from the 47th Battalion came under heavy attack , one the 15th Battalion 's platoons was dispatched with two tanks in support to provide assistance . Heavy fighting continued throughout the afternoon following their arrival , during which at least 20 Japanese were killed . The 15th Battalion occupied a position around <unk> and along Killen 's Track , in the southern sector of the brigade 's area , while the Australians made preparations to resume the advance towards the Buin stronghold . The most @-@ forward battalion , on 6 July it was subjected to heavy attacks as the Japanese sought to infiltrate the Australian forward positions and cut their lines of communication . As a result of these attacks , the plan to advance was cancelled temporarily . 
 Patrols from the 15th were sent out daily to wrest the initiative and frequent actions followed , sometimes involving contacts with Japanese forces up to 70 strong . These small @-@ scale actions culminated in a large @-@ scale attack on ' D ' Company on 9 July , in which 34 Japanese were killed and two captured for the loss of two Australians killed and four wounded . After this , patrols were sent out across the Mivo , but strong Japanese resistance , and heavy rain , frustrated the 15th 's efforts to carry out a detailed reconnaissance of the opposite bank , effectively halting the Australian advance and ending significant combat in the island 's south . The battalion was able to send patrols across the Mivo in early August , although at least one man was swept downstream in the swollen waters , and a number of clashes occurred between 3 and 5 August . On 3 August , a small patrol killed six Japanese after surprising a platoon to the east of the Mivo River , and the following day a further 19 Japanese were killed in clashes with the 15th Battalion , while one soldier from the battalion was killed and another wounded when the Japanese exploded a mine by remote control next to the Buin Road . On 5 August , a patrol from the 15th was able to penetrate as far as the <unk> River and preparations began for the battalion to resume the advance on 17 August . The advance was cancelled a week later in anticipation of a Japanese surrender , following news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and the battalion 's involvement in the fighting on Bougainville came to an end . Its battle casualties during the campaign are listed by Gavin Long , the Australian official historian , as five officers and 102 other ranks killed or wounded .

 The battalion concentrated around Torokina in October , in preparation for post @-@ war demobilisation . As its personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service , its strength dwindled . In mid @-@ December , the battalion 's remaining personnel embarked upon the transport River Loddon and sailed for Brisbane , arriving there on Christmas Eve . The demobilisation process continued at Chermside and the battalion was finally disbanded on 28 March 1946 . The Australian War Memorial lists the battalion 's casualties during the Second World War as 42 men killed and 105 wounded . Its personnel received the following decorations : two Officers of the Order of the British Empire , four MCs , two DCMs , 11 MMs and 35 MIDs . 
 Following its disbandment in 1946 , although other Militia battalions were re @-@ raised when the Citizens Military Force was established in 1948 , the 15th Battalion has remained off the Australian Army 's order of battle . In 1961 , the battalion was finally awarded its battle honours for the Second World War . At the same time , it was entrusted with those earned by its corresponding 2nd AIF battalion , the 2 / 15th Battalion . In May 2002 , Alec Campbell , the last surviving Australian veteran of Gallipoli , died at the age of 103 . A member of the 15th Battalion , Campbell had enlisted from Tasmania at the age of 16 and arrived on the peninsula as a reinforcement in the final stages of the campaign . He was later wounded , and evacuated due to illness prior to the final evacuation of all Allied forces in December 1915 .
