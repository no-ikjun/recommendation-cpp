 Houphouët @-@ Boigny and Thomas Sankara , the leader of Burkina Faso , had a highly turbulent relationship . Tensions reached their climax in 1985 when Côte d 'Ivoire <unk> accused authorities of being involved in a conspiracy to forcibly recruit young students to training camps in Libya . Houphouët @-@ Boigny responded by inviting the dissident Jean @-@ Claude <unk> to take refuge in Côte d 'Ivoire so that he could organise opposition to the Sankara regime . In 1987 , Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup . The coup may have had French involvement , since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France . Houphouët @-@ Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November , the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's participation . The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government . He contacted Blaise <unk> , the second @-@ most powerful man in the regime ; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona <unk> , Robert <unk> and Pierre <unk> to overthrow the Sankara regime . 
 Besides supporting policies pursued by France , Houphouët @-@ Boigny also influenced their actions in Africa . He pushed France to support and provide arms to warlord Charles Taylor 's rebels during the First Liberian Civil War in hopes of receiving some of the country 's assets and resources after the war . 
 = = = Opposition to the Soviet Union and China = = = 
 From the time of Côte d 'Ivoire 's independence , Houphouët @-@ Boigny considered the Soviet Union and China " malevolent " influences on developing countries . He did not establish diplomatic relations with Moscow until 1967 and then severed them in 1969 following allegations of direct Soviet support to a 1968 student protest at the National University of Côte d 'Ivoire . The two countries did not restore ties until February 1986 , by which time Houphouët @-@ Boigny had embraced a more active foreign policy reflecting his quest for greater international recognition . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny was even more outspoken in his criticism of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . He voiced fears of an " invasion " by the Chinese and a subsequent colonisation of Africa . He was especially concerned that Africans would see the problems of development in China as analogous to those of Africa , and see China 's solutions as appropriate to sub @-@ Saharan Africa . Accordingly , Côte d 'Ivoire was one of the last countries to normalise relations with China , doing so on 3 March 1983 . Under the principle demanded by Beijing for " one China " , the recognition by Côte d 'Ivoire of the PRC effectively disestablished diplomatic relations between Abidjan and Taiwan . 
 = = = Economic policies in the 1960s and 1970s = = = 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny adopted a system of economic liberalism in Côte d 'Ivoire in order to obtain the trust and confidence of foreign investors , most notably the French . The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90 % of their profits in their country of origin ( the remaining 10 % was reinvested in Côte d 'Ivoire ) . He also developed an agenda for modernising the country 's infrastructure , for example , building an American @-@ style business district in Abidjan where five @-@ star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen . Côte d 'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11 – 12 % from 1960 to 1965 . The country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978 , from 145 to 1 @,@ 750 billion CFA francs , while the trade balance continued to record a surplus . 
 The origin of this economic success stemmed from the president 's decision to focus on the primary sector of the economy , rather than the secondary sector . As a result , the agricultural sector experienced significant development : between 1960 and 1970 , cocoa cultivators tripled their production to 312 @,@ 000 tonnes and coffee production rose by nearly 50 % , from 185 @,@ 500 to 275 @,@ 000 tonnes . As a result of this economic prosperity , Côte d 'Ivoire saw an influx of immigrants from other West African countries ; the foreign workforce — mostly <unk> — who maintained indigenous plantations , represented over a quarter of the Ivorian population by 1980 . Both Ivorians and foreigners began referring to Houphouët @-@ Boigny as the " Sage of Africa " for performing what became known as " Ivorian miracle " . He was also respectfully nicknamed " The Old One " ( Le Vieux ) . 
 However , the economic system developed in cooperation with France was far from perfect . As Houphouët @-@ Boigny described it , the economy of Côte d 'Ivoire experienced " growth without development " . The growth of the economy depended on capital , initiatives and a financial framework from investors abroad ; it had not become independent or self @-@ sustaining . 
 = = = Crisis in Côte d 'Ivoire = = = 
 = = = = Economy on the brink of collapse = = = = 
 Beginning in 1978 , the economy of Côte d 'Ivoire experienced a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa . The decline was perceived as fleeting , since its impact on planters was buffered by the <unk> , the agricultural marketing board , which ensured them a livable income . The next year , in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods , Houphouët @-@ Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials . However , by applying only this solution , Côte d 'Ivoire lost more than 700 billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982 . From 1983 to 1984 , Côte d 'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400 @,@ 000 hectares of forest and 250 @,@ 000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants . To address this problem , Houphouët @-@ Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists ; by 1984 , the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d 'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis . 
 Even the production of the offshore oil drilling and petrochemical industries , developed to supply the <unk> , was affected by the 1986 worldwide economic recession . Côte d 'Ivoire , which had bought planters ' harvests for double the market price , fell into heavy debt . By May 1987 , the foreign debt had reached US $ 10 billion , prompting Houphouët @-@ Boigny to suspend payments of the debt . Refusing to sell off its supply of cocoa , the country shut down its exports in July and forced world rates to increase . However , this " embargo " failed . In November 1989 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny liquidated his enormous stock of cocoa to big businesses to jump @-@ start the economy . Gravely ill at this time , he named a Prime Minister ( the post was unoccupied since 1960 ) , <unk> Ouattara , who established a series of belt @-@ tightening economic measures to bring the country out of debt . 
 = = = = Social tensions = = = = 
 The general atmosphere of enrichment and satisfaction during the period of economic growth in Côte d 'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët @-@ Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions . His easygoing authoritarian regime , where political prisoners were almost nonexistent , was well accepted by the population . However , the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations . According to the World Bank , the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11 % in 1985 to 31 % by 1993 . Despite the implementation of certain measures , such as the reduction of the number of young French workers ( who worked abroad while serving in the military ) from 3 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 000 in 1986 , allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates , the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies . 
 Strong social agitations shook the country , creating insecurity . The army mutinied in 1990 and 1992 , and on 2 March 1990 , protesters organized mass demonstrations in the streets of Abidjan with slogans such as " thief Houphouët " and " corrupt Houphouët " . These popular demonstrations prompted the president to launch a system of democratization on 31 May , in which he authorised political pluralism and trade unions . 
 = = = = = Opposition = = = = = 
 Laurent Gbagbo gained recognition as one of the principal instigators of the student demonstrations during the protests against Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's government on 9 February 1982 , which led to the closing of the universities and other educational institutions . Shortly thereafter , his wife and he formed what would become the Ivorian Popular Front ( FPI ) . Gbagbo went into exile in France later that year , where he promoted the FPI and its political platforms . Although the FPI was ideologically similar to the Unified Socialist Party , the French socialist government tried to ignore Gbagbo 's party to please Houphouët @-@ Boigny . After a lengthy appeal process , Gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in France in 1985 . However , the French government attempted to pressure him into returning to Côte d 'Ivoire , as Houphouët @-@ Boigny had begun to worry about Gbagbo 's developing a network of contacts , and believed " his stirring opponent would be less of a threat in Abidjan than in Paris " . 
 In 1988 , Gbagbo returned from exile to Côte d 'Ivoire after Houphouët @-@ Boigny implicitly granted him forgiveness by declaring that " the tree did not get angry at the bird " . In 1990 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny legalised opposition parties . On 28 October , a presidential election was held . For the first time , Houphouët @-@ Boigny actually faced an opponent : Gbagbo . He highlighted the President 's age , suggesting that he was too old for a seventh five @-@ year term . Houphouët @-@ Boigny countered by broadcasting television footage of his youth , and he was re @-@ elected to a seventh term with 2 @,@ 445 @,@ 365 votes to 548 @,@ 441 — an implausible 81 @.@ 7 percent of the vote . 
 = = = = Displays of wealth = = = = 
 During his presidency , Houphouët @-@ Boigny benefited greatly from the wealth of Côte d 'Ivoire ; by the time of his death in 1993 , his personal wealth was estimated to be between US $ 7 and $ 11 billion . With regards to his large fortune , Houphouët @-@ Boigny said in 1983 , " People are surprised that I like gold . It 's just that I was born in it . " The Ivorian leader acquired a dozen properties in the metropolitan area of Paris ( including Hotel <unk> on <unk> Street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris ) , a property in Castel Gandolfo in Italy , and a house in Chêne @-@ Bourg , Switzerland . He owned real estate companies , such as Grand Air SI , SI <unk> and <unk> , and had many shares in prestigious jewelry and watchmaking companies , such as Piaget SA and Harry Winston . He placed his fortune in Switzerland , once asking if " there is any serious man on Earth not stocking parts of his fortune in Switzerland " . 
 In 1983 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny moved the capital from Abidjan to Yamoussoukro . There , at the expense of the state , he built many buildings such as the Institute Polytechnique and an international airport . The most luxurious project was the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace , which is currently the largest church in the world , with an area of 30 @,@ 000 square metres ( 320 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and a height of 158 metres ( 518 ft ) . Personally financed by Houphouët @-@ Boigny , construction for the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace was carried out by the Lebanese architect Pierre <unk> at a total cost of about US $ 150 – 200 million . Houphouët @-@ Boigny offered it to Pope John Paul II as a " personal gift " ; the latter , after having unsuccessfully requested it being shorter than St. Peter 's in Rome , consecrated it all the same on 10 September 1990 . Due to a collapse of the national economy coupled with lavish amounts spent on its construction , the Basilica was criticized : it was called " the basilica in the bush " by several western news agencies .

 = = = Succession and death = = = 
 The political , social , and economic crises also touched the issue of who would succeed Houphouët @-@ Boigny as head of state . After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe <unk> in 1980 , who , as president of the National Assembly , was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent , Houphouët @-@ Boigny delayed as much as he could in officially designating a successor . The president 's health became increasingly fragile , with Prime Minister <unk> Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards , while the president was hospitalised in France . There was a struggle for power , which ended when Houphouët @-@ Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan <unk> , the President of the National Assembly . In December 1993 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny , terminally ill with prostate cancer , was urgently flown back to Côte d 'Ivoire so he could die there . He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined . After his family consented , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6 : 35 am GMT on 7 December . At the time of his death , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was the longest @-@ serving leader in Africa and the third in the world , after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny left no written will or legacy report for Côte d 'Ivoire upon his death in 1993 . His recognised heirs , especially Helena , led a battle against the government to recover part of the vast fortune Houphouët @-@ Boigny had left , which she claimed was " private " and did not belong to the State . 
 = = = Funeral = = = 
 Following Houpouët @-@ Boigny 's death , the country 's stability was maintained , as seen by his impressive funeral on 7 February 1994 . The funeral for this " doyen of francophone Africa " was held in the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace , with 7 @,@ 000 guests inside the building and tens of thousands outside . The two @-@ month delay before Houpouët @-@ Boigny 's funeral , common among members of the <unk> ethnic group , allowed for many ceremonies preceding his burial . The president 's funeral featured many traditional African funerary customs , including a large chorus dressed in bright batik dresses singing " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( Baoulé : " Lord , it is you who has made all things " ) and village chiefs displaying strips of <unk> and <unk> cloth . <unk> are traditionally buried with objects they enjoyed while alive ; Houpouët @-@ Boigny 's family , however , did not state what , if anything , they would bury with him . 
 Over 140 countries and international organisations sent delegates to the funeral . However , according to The New York Times , many Ivorians were disappointed by the poor attendance of several key allies , most notably the United States . The small United States delegation was led by Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O 'Leary and Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose . In contrast , Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's close personal ties with France were reflected in the large French delegation , which included President François Mitterrand ; Prime Minister Édouard <unk> ; the presidents of the National Assembly and of the Senate , Philippe Séguin and René <unk> ; former President Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing ; Jacques Chirac ; his friend Jacques Foccart ; and six former Prime Ministers . According to The New York Times , " Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's death is not only the end of a political era here , but perhaps as well the end of the close French @-@ African relationship that he came to symbolize .

 = Siege of Inabayama Castle = 
 The Siege of Inabayama Castle ( <unk> , Inabayama @-@ jō no Tatakai ) of 1567 was the final battle in Oda Nobunaga 's campaign to defeat the Saitō clan in their mountaintop castle and conquer Mino Province , Japan . It was a short two @-@ week siege , fought between 13 and 27 September 1567 , or in the Japanese calendar : from the 1st to 15th day of the 8th month , in the 10th year of the <unk> era , according to the Nobunaga Chronicle . The siege ended in a decisive battle and victory of Nobunaga 's combined forces , and resulted in the subjugation of the Saitō clan , their vassals , and allies . This victory was the culmination of Nobunaga 's Mino campaign , waged intermittently over the previous six years , and brought an end to a rivalry between the Oda clan of Owari province and the Saitō clan of Mino , which began over twenty years earlier between Nobunaga 's father , Oda <unk> and Saitō Dōsan . 
 Due to the weak leadership of the Saitō , many samurai leaders defected to Nobunaga before the battle , while others willingly submitted afterward . With this victory , Nobunaga took control of the expansive and fertile Mino Province and gained numerous supporters and resources . Nobunaga had the former Saitō castle repaired and renamed it Gifu Castle , a firm base from which to expand north into the <unk> region and to make his drive toward Kyoto . Gifu Castle functioned as his primary residence and military headquarters until he moved to the partially completed Azuchi Castle in 1575 . 
 Nobunaga 's young retainer Kinoshita Tōkichirō ( later known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi ) played an important role in attaining the victory at Inabayama . In the years leading to the battle , he negotiated for the support of local warlords , which ensured a ready @-@ made army by the time of the attack , and built a castle on the edge of the enemy 's territory to serve as a staging point for the attack . In addition to these preparations , Tōkichirō devised and led a bold plan , something of a commando raid , to break into the castle and open the gates for the attacking army . As a result of his efforts and the victory , his standing with Nobunaga rose considerably . Thus , in addition to the battle 's immediate importance to Nobunaga 's plans , it was also an important step in Toyotomi Hideyoshi 's rise to power . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1549 young Oda Nobunaga ( 1534 – 1582 ) , who would later become a major daimyo of Owari province , Japan and would initiate the unification of 16th century Japan , was married to <unk> , the daughter of Saitō Dōsan , leader of the rival Saitō clan of neighboring Mino Province . Nobunaga was the second son of Oda <unk> , head of the Oda clan , who was at that time fending off opponents on the northern and eastern borders of Owari province , matters that were complicated by internal dissent . Saitō Dōsan , lord of Mino , was a strong and ruthless leader , but internal strife had begun to split the Saitō into factions . Both clans needed some respite to deal with more pressing problems and thus the political marriage of Nobunaga and <unk> brought an end to the clans ' rivalry and their border skirmishes . 
 In 1555 Saitō Yoshitatsu , eldest son of Dōsan , came to believe his inheritance would be taken away and murdered his two younger brothers . The following year he rallied troops loyal to him and openly rebelled against his father . Dōsan indeed changed his will and named his son @-@ in @-@ law , Oda Nobunaga , his legal heir . Shortly thereafter Dōsan was killed by one of Yoshitatsu 's retainers at the Battle of <unk> . At the time Nobunaga was not in a position to help his father @-@ in @-@ law and the Saitō civil war soon ended before any active intervention could be mounted . In 1561 Yoshitatsu died of leprosy and his son , Saitō Tatsuoki , succeeded to the leadership of the clan . At the time Tatsuoki was young but , as he attained adulthood , he was eventually considered incapable of effective leadership by his peers and retainers , viewed with contempt by his subordinates , and even despised by the local peasantry . After the Oda and Matsudaira clans allied and then defeated the Imagawa clan at the 1560 Battle of <unk> , Nobunaga was in a more secure position to focus on their northern neighbor , the Saitō clan . Nobunaga 's plans for an invasion of Mino were ostensibly motivated by revenge for the death of his father @-@ in @-@ law , Saitō Dōsan , but Yoshitatsu died before Nobunaga could attack . As a result , Nobunaga reasoned that Yoshitatsu 's heir , Tatsuoki , likewise benefited from Dōsan 's demise , and thus continued with his plans for invasion , using revenge as a pretext . 
 = = Mino campaign = = 
 Oda Nobunaga mounted forays into Mino territory in 1561 and 1563 , which resulted in brief battles . In each expedition Nobunaga and his 700 troops were outnumbered by rapidly assembled forces under local daimyo , who would muster up to 3 @,@ 000 men . Caught in the open and unable to organize a defense , he fell back each time to his home territory . The local history of Gifu city states that in 1564 Nobunaga went so far as to attack Inabayama Castle , the headquarters of the Saitō clan . The castle was situated atop Mount Inaba , which had a ruggedly steep northern face with the bank of the Sunomata River at its foot , and accessed by a winding avenue up the southern slopes . Although it was considered nearly impregnable , Tatsuoki fled the parapets and hid within the castle while his retainers Takenaka Shigeharu ( called Hanbei ) and Andō <unk> commanded the defense . Nobunaga then left or was driven out soon afterward . In later years Nobunaga had this setback expunged from records and omitted from the Nobunaga Chronicles . 
 Starting in 1564 , Oda Nobunaga began dispatching his loyal retainer , Kinoshita Tōkichirō , to convince , with liberal bribery , many of the warlords in the Mino area to defect to the growing alliance under the Oda clan . Kinoshita even approached Takenaka Hanbei , who was considered a brilliant strategist but lived in pious seclusion , to persuade him to defect . Although the Saitō retainer was frustrated by the ignominious behavior of Tatsuoki , he did not want to appear capricious with his loyalty , and declined Kinoshita 's offers on behalf of his lord . Kinoshita was impressed with the integrity of the retainer and invited him to an extended stay in his home , as a guest . Hanbei admitted that the Saitō clan could not survive for much longer under Tatsuoki , and accepted Kinoshita 's invitation in exchange for a promise of leniency if ever the Saitō leadership fell into Kinoshita 's hands . 
 In 1566 , in anticipation of the upcoming campaign , Kinoshita proposed that a castle should be built somewhere near Inabayama Castle to serve as a staging point for the Oda forces . Nobunaga agreed and charged Kinoshita with the task . To this end Kinoshita built Sunomata Castle on the bank of the Sai River opposite Saitō territory . The advantage of the castle 's proximity to the enemy was also a problem during construction . Until the castle was complete , Kinoshita 's men and the construction site were vulnerable to an amphibious attack from across the river . According to legend , Kinoshita built the castle in one night ; however it is more likely that it was the tower 's skeleton with a facade that was seen from the opposite bank . The result of the hasty construction was meant to give his own men a vantage point and to surprise and impress the enemy . <unk> by the enemy 's caution , Kinoshita 's men were able to quickly transform the fragile framework into a functioning fortification , and then into a complete castle . Nobunaga then ordered Kinoshita to remain as steward of the castle , and bestowed upon him the name Hideyoshi . 
 = = Siege = = 
 In 1567 , Oda Nobunaga led an attack against the Saitō clan of Mino Province . The clan headquarters and administrative center for Mino Province was Inabayama Castle , a mountain fortress atop Mount Inaba ( in present @-@ day Gifu city ) . As Saitō Tatsuoki , the daimyo of the clan , had shown himself to be a cowardly and ineffective ruler , Takenaka Hanbei had staged a coup and took command of the castle and its garrison . Although Tatsuoki was allowed to remain the titular head of the clan , he contributed nothing to the outcome of the battle . When the Oda army entered Mino , Hanbei prepared the garrison for the defense of the castle . 
 According to the <unk> <unk> ( or The Nobunaga Chronicles ) , preparations for the battle began on 13 September 1567 ( <unk> @-@ 10 year , 8 @-@ month , 1 @-@ day ) . Nobunaga entered the area , made contact with allies , and the core of Nobunaga 's army of about 5 @,@ 000 troops crossed the Kiso River . As the troops assembled on the far shore , Nobunaga sent two messengers , Murai <unk> and Shimada Hidemitsu , to three of the Saitō clan 's top vassals , known as the Mino Triumvirate , asking for their cooperation in the upcoming battle . Mino warlords that Kinoshita Hideyoshi had persuaded to defect brought additional troops to Nobunaga 's banner . 
 As the forces loyal to Nobunaga moved across the plain , several skirmishes were fought in a futile effort to turn the invading forces . Nobunaga 's forces then entered the town of Inoguchi , which lay below Inabayama Castle . To clear the field of view and provide space for the besieging army , Kinoshita Hideyoshi 's vanguard set fire to the town . As some soldiers took positions on Mount Inoguchi and a nearby ridgeline , the main army positioned itself before Mount Inaba to begin the siege . The greatly augmented army , now bristling with the flags of the Saitō clan 's former vassals and allies , bewildered the castle 's defenders . During the days that followed , Kinoshita dispatched men to gather intelligence , especially from peasants willing to help . Kinoshita met with a local resident , Horio Yoshiharu , who showed him a little @-@ known path that led up the north slope of the mountain . The north slopes below the castle were so steep that assault by a large force was considered impossible , and was thus effectively ignored by the defenders at the advent of battle . 
 = = = Final assault = = = 
 It is uncertain exactly what happened on the battlefield between 14 – 25 September . Given what is known of Nobunaga 's aggressive fighting style , the prevailing siege tactics of the day , the layout of the Japanese castle , and the events that followed , it can be inferred that Nobunaga 's forces pressed their attack and probably breached the outer defenses of Inabayama Castle . It is known , however , that Kuroda Kanbei , considered a talented strategist , was charged with directing and coordinating the main attack . It is also certain that Kinoshita Hideyoshi devised a plan in which a small force would scale the north face of the mountain , enter the castle , and rush to open the gates for the besieging army . Nobunaga approved and charged Kinoshita with leading the raid . For his team Kinoshita selected Horio Yoshiharu , Hachisuka <unk> , and five or six other men to accompany him . On 26 September Nobunaga was so confident of Kinoshita 's plan and the outcome of the battle that he had an heraldic partition erected on the battlefield where he held a meeting with his top officers and allotted tasks pertaining to the re @-@ construction of the castle following the battle . He also greeted the daimyo of the Mino Triumvirate , who were stunned by his audacity , and offered them sake . 
 On the night of 26 September Kinoshita gathered his team and , concerned over the late summer heat and the exertions in store , provided them with gourds of fresh water . Horio Yoshiharu then guided Kinoshita Hideyoshi and the small assault force around to the back of the mountain , where they climbed the steep slopes by the light of a full moon . At dawn , while Kinoshita 's mission was in progress , the main force under Kuroda Kanbei proceeded with its attack on the castle . 
 Sometime after dawn , Kinoshita 's team infiltrated the castle , set fire to a storehouse and the powder magazine , and then rushed to open the front gates , cutting down whomever got in their way . With explosions erupting from the powder magazine and the other building burning fiercely , the castle defense quickly devolved into chaos , as the shocked and exhausted defenders thought they were under a full @-@ scale attack from behind . Kinoshita 's men , filthy from the night 's exertions and brandishing bloody swords as they rushed across the main courtyard , added to the impression . The castle garrison was thrown into complete disarray as men were pulled from the parapets to face the nonexistent assault , while others threw down their weapons and surrendered . When Kinoshita 's team had attained the gatehouse they tied their gourds to spears and waved them to their allies below to signal they were in position , whereupon Kuroda 's infantry charged the open gates and overran what was left of the castle 's garrison . While Kuroda 's men mopped up the last of the resistance , Kinoshita 's team found a place to rest while Horio Yoshiharu passed around a large gourd of sake he had taken from the castle 's supply . By the end of 27 September 1567 Inabayama Castle had fallen and the remaining lords of Mino province formally surrendered to Nobunaga . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In about two weeks ' time Nobunaga had entered the sprawling Mino Province , raised an army , and conquered the ruling clan in their mountaintop castle . Following the battle the Mino Triumvirate , awed by the speed and skill of Nobunaga 's conquest , permanently allied themselves to Nobunaga . Nobunaga had the castle repaired and renamed it Gifu Castle . The castle @-@ town of Inoguchi was likewise renamed Gifu , after the mountain from which Wu Wang launched his campaign to unify China . Nobunaga had a lavish manor built at the base of the castle mountain . He then transferred his primary base and residence from Komaki Castle to Gifu , from which he would launch his historic march on Kyoto the following year . He continued to use Gifu Castle as his primary residence and headquarters until he moved into the partially completed Azuchi Castle in 1575 . 
 Saitō Tatsuoki survived the battle , though there are at least two accounts of how he managed this . In one account , Tatsuoki abandoned the castle the night before the final attack , took a boat , and fled down the Sunomata River . In another account , following the breach of the main gate , Hideyoshi dispatched a messenger to the main tower , where Tatsuoki and his entourage were cornered , with assurances of leniency if the Saitō holdouts would surrender . Tatsuoki accepted the offer and , with Nobunaga 's troops forming two lines , Tatsuoki marched out of the main tower with his family and retinue . In any event , Tatsuoki eventually found his way to Nagashima , Ise Province . He lived in exile for a while , but eventually sought refuge with Asakura <unk> . He was killed in the Battle of <unk> , at the age of 26 , in 1573 . 
 The efforts of Kinoshita Hideyoshi as the mastermind of the victory were recognized by Nobunaga and his status rose accordingly . After the battle Kinoshita was promoted in rank and made lord of three districts in the northern part of the newly conquered Mino province , and not long afterward took the surname Hashiba . When Nobunaga later gave him a field command , Hideyoshi used an image of a golden gourd as his battle standard , in commemoration of his success at Inabayama Castle . In time he would change his surname again , to Toyotomi . Kuroda Kanbei , who led the frontal attack , and Takenaka Hanbei , who directed the castle 's defense , would both eventually serve Toyotomi Hideyoshi .

 The 1940 Nova Scotia hurricane swept through areas of Atlantic Canada in mid @-@ September 1940 . The fifth tropical cyclone and fourth hurricane of the year , it formed as a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on September 7 , though at the time weather observations in the area were sparse , so its formation was inferred . The disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages , attaining tropical storm strength on September 10 ; further strengthening into a hurricane north of Puerto Rico occurred two days later . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane recurved northward , and reached peak intensity the following day as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of at least 988 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) . The cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on Nova Scotia on September 17 with winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that day , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnant system curved eastward and passed over Newfoundland before dissipating over the Atlantic on September 19 . 
 While off of the United States East Coast , the hurricane caused numerous shipping incidents , most notably the stranding of the Swedish freighter Laponia off of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on September 16 . Two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths . The hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm @-@ force and snow over areas of New England . In Atlantic Canada , a strong storm surge peaking at 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities . In New Brunswick , the waves hurt the lobster fishing industry . In Nova Scotia , strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services . The winds also severely damaged crops . Roughly half of apple production in Annapolis Valley was lost during the storm , resulting in around $ 1 @.@ 49 million in economic losses . Strong winds in New Brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage , and additional damages to crops occurred there . Overall , the hurricane caused three fatalities , with two off of the United States and one in New Brunswick .

 The origins of the system can be traced to a tropical depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa at 1800 UTC on September 7 . Though initially believed to have developed on September 11 , the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post @-@ season reanalysis , based on data from the International Comprehensive Ocean @-@ Atmosphere Data Set . In its early developmental stages , the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity . At 0600 UTC on September 10 , it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles . Closer to the islands , ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures , strong winds and heavy thunderstorms , although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center . 
 At 1800 UTC on September 12 , the storm intensified into the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 1 hurricane to the north of Puerto Rico . The following day , the hurricane began to recurve northward , attaining Category 2 intensity at 1200 UTC . Numerous vessels in its vicinity reported hurricane @-@ force winds ; the S.S. Borinquen observed a minimum peripheral pressure of 988 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) , the lowest observed pressure associated with the hurricane . At the time , the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , which it maintained throughout its duration as a Category 2 system . Progressing rapidly into more northerly latitudes , the storm weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by 1800 UTC on September 15 . By the next day , two warm fronts began extending eastward from the cyclone as the wind field expanded in size , indicating the start of an extratropical transition . At 0200 UTC , the hurricane made landfall near Lockeport , Nova Scotia , with winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . The storm fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by 1200 UTC on September 17 . In the gulf , the system turned eastward , causing it to move ashore Newfoundland just north of Cape Race during the evening of September 18 . After passing over the island , the extratropical storm reentered the Atlantic Ocean , where it gradually weakened before dissipating on September 19 .

 Though initially perceived to be a potential threat to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion , the hurricane curved northward on September 13 , mitigating any evacuation procedures . Despite the storm 's change in track , the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas . Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm . After the hurricane recurved , the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast , particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod , Massachusetts , where strong winds and waves were anticipated . Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras , North Carolina to Eastport , Maine on September 16 . The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas . 
 On September 16 , strong waves produced by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia , which at the time was located 300 mi ( 480 km ) east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company . As a result of the stranded ship , the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid . The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago ( <unk> @-@ 42 ) and USCGC <unk> ( WAT @-@ 55 ) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance . In addition , a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City , North Carolina . The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship back to shore . Two fishing vessels capsized off of Barnegat and Edgemere , New York , with both incidents resulting in a fatality . A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off of Edgemere , though it was also disrupted by rough seas . The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members . Numerous other small craft off of Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore . Eventually passing east of New England , the storm 's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island , Massachusetts . A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . In Eastport , Maine , a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 33 inHg ) and wind speeds of 33 mph ( 53 km / h ) . In Maine , power lines were downed , damaging communications . In Bar Harbor , strong winds caused five fires , which were later extinguished . The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port 's coast . The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state . 
 = = = Nova Scotia = = = 
 Most of the hurricane 's damage occurred in Nova Scotia , where the storm made landfall early on September 17 . As was the case off the United States East Coast , rough seas generated by the hurricane caused various ship incidents . Tides were 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) above average . The abnormally high sea level inundated areas of Lockeport , isolating it from the rest of Nova Scotia and creating a temporary island in the process . One home in the city was flooded by the waves . Off of Shelburne , a breakwater was destroyed by rough seas . In Halifax , two yachts were damaged . Another boat in East Ferry was destroyed . The strong waves grounded a schooner in Bridgewater , damaging a wharf . In Jordan Bay , two boat houses and a barn were toppled , while a wharf was washed away . Further north near Anticosti Island , the British steamer Incemore became stranded . Though not directly a result of the storm surge , ten boats in Lake Milo near Yarmouth were severely damaged . 
 Strong winds were also felt throughout Nova Scotia . Winds peaked at 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) in Lockeport , the strongest winds observed in the Canadian province . In Yarmouth , the storm 's gusts were clocked at 60 mph ( 100 km / h ) in Yarmouth . Trees were uprooted as a result of the strong winds . One tree fell into a home in Melville Cove , damaging the home 's roof . Cabins were damaged in Summerville , and the garage of a lodge in Digby was blown out . A barn and associated equipment were destroyed in Pembroke . The strong winds also blew down numerous communication lines , disrupting telecommunication services across Nova Scotia . Downed wires in Halifax caused a fire which scorched five buildings . Traffic in the city was also disrupted by the winds . In addition to infrastructure , crops were also heavily damaged . In Digby County , grain and corn plantations were damaged . Grain crops in Cumberland County also saw heavy losses . In Annapolis Valley , an important agricultural region in western Nova Scotia , 600 @,@ 000 barrels of apples were lost , resulting in CA $ 1 @.@ 5 million in damages . The lost apple production accounted for roughly half of the entire apple yield for the agricultural region . Despite the hurricane 's rapid movement through the Canadian Maritimes , the storm still produced heavy rainfall . In Halifax , 3 in ( 75 mm ) of rain was reported over the duration of the hurricane . However , 3 @.@ 5 in ( 90 mm ) of rain fell in Yarmouth in a 24 @-@ hour period . 
 = = = New Brunswick = = = 
 Damage from the hurricane was comparatively less in New Brunswick than in Nova Scotia , but was still considerable . The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province , disrupting the lobster industry . Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait ; they were later found . Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait . Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well . Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost . A man in Dixon Point lost CA $ 1 @,@ 000 of live lobsters due to the storm . A wharf in Shediac was washed away . Fifty boats were sunk off of Cap @-@ Pelé , while in Greville , four <unk> were destroyed . The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the <unk> River under 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) of water . A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged . Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged , resulting in thousands of dollars in damages . Further inland , winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage . Winds peaked at 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) at <unk> Airport . The strong winds disrupted power and telecommunication services in Moncton . Streets were blocked by trees blown down by strong winds . Offshore , three yachts were destroyed . A tree fell onto the Gagetown United Church as a result of the winds , causing considerable damage . Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown . In Saint John , chimneys were toppled . Flying debris injured several people , and power outages also greatly affected the city . High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River . Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed . The hurricane 's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people . Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick , a person went missing in Bathurst , who was later presumed dead . 
 = Deva Victrix = 
 Deva Victrix , or simply Deva , was a legionary fortress and town in the Roman province of Britannia . The settlement evolved into Chester , the county town of Cheshire , England . The fortress was built initially by the Legio II Adiutrix in the AD 70s as the Roman army advanced north against the Brigantes , but completed over the next few decades by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix . 
 Several factors including the presence of an elliptical building unique in legionary fortresses , the method of construction , and the unusual size of the fortress – 20 % larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain – suggest that it may have been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland , and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome . The fortress contained barracks , granaries , military headquarters , military baths , and an unusual elliptical building that may have acted as the governor of Britain 's headquarters . The fortress was rebuilt in stone at the end of the 1st century AD when it was occupied by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix , and again in the early 3rd century . The legion probably remained at the fortress until it eventually fell into disuse in the late 4th or early 5th century . 
 A civilian settlement – or canabae – grew around the fortress and was one of the factors leading to the construction of an amphitheatre to the south east of the fortress . Chester Roman Amphitheatre could have seated between 8 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 people , the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain . The civilian settlement remained after the Romans departed , eventually becoming the present @-@ day city of Chester . There were peripheral settlements around Roman Deva , including Boughton , the source of the garrison 's water supply , and <unk> , the site of a sandstone quarry and the Minerva Shrine . The shrine is the only in situ , rock @-@ cut Roman shrine in Britain . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Foundation = = = 
 According to the 1st and 2nd century geographer Ptolemy , Deva was in the lands of the Celtic Cornovii . The Cornovii were a tribe whose lands bordered the Brigantes in the north and the Ordovices in the west and included parts of what is now Cheshire , Shropshire , and north Wales . When the Romans ' treaty with the Brigantes – the Celtic tribe occupying most of what is now Northern England – failed , the Romans decided the best way to ensure long term peace was by military conquest . The campaigns were led first by Sextus Julius Frontinus , and later by Gnaeus Julius Agricola . Their expansion into the north of Britannia during the reign of Vespasian meant that the Romans needed a new military base , close to the new frontiers . Chester was a strategic site for a fortress , commanding access to the sea via the River Dee and dividing the Brigantes from the Ordovices . Legio II Adiutrix was despatched to Chester and began the construction of a legionary fortress in the mid AD 70s . 
 The fortress was positioned on a sandstone bluff , dominating the bridge over the river and close to the natural harbour , today occupied by the <unk> racecourse ; the bend in the river provided protection from the south and the west . The river was navigable up to the sandstone ridge , so positioning the fortress beyond it would have made access to the harbour difficult . The fortress may have required as much as 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 litres ( 530 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water a day , supplied by fresh water piped in from natural springs in the suburb of Boughton 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 0 mi ) to the east . 
 Lead ingots discovered in Chester indicate that construction was probably under way by AD 74 . There may already have been military buildings on the site , but if so they were demolished to allow the construction of the fortress . The first buildings were built of wood , probably for convenience . They were gradually replaced by more permanent structures built from locally quarried sandstone . Defence was provided by a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide rampart and a ditch 3 metres ( 10 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 5 ft ) deep . The rampart was made from turf laid over sand , clay , rubble , and layers of logs . 
 The fortress was in the traditional ' playing card ' shape – rectangular with rounded corners – and had four gates : north , east , south and west . It covered 25 hectares ( 62 acres ) , making it the largest constructed in Britain during the 70s . An estimated 24 @,@ 664 metric tons ( 24 @,@ 274 long tons ; 27 @,@ 187 short tons ) of timber was used in the first phase of the fortress ' construction ; buildings outside but associated with the fortress , such as the harbour and the amphitheatre , would have required an additional 31 @,@ 128 metric tons ( 30 @,@ 636 long tons ; 34 @,@ 313 short tons ) . The fortress contained barracks , granaries ( <unk> ) , military headquarters ( principia ) , and baths . The barrack blocks were wattle and daub buildings , each of which was 82 @.@ 5 metres ( 271 ft ) long and 11 @.@ 8 metres ( 39 ft ) wide . 
 The name Deva Victrix derives from ' goddess ' , and the Roman fortress was named after the goddess of the River Dee ; the Latin for ' goddess ' is dea or diva . There is an alternative source for the naming of the settlement which suggests that the Roman name for the fortress was adopted directly from the British name of the river . It is thought that the title ' victrix ' in the name of the fortress was taken from the title of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix who were based at Deva ; victrix is Latin for victorious . The name for the city of Chester derives from the Latin word castrum ( plural : castra ) , meaning " fort " or " army camp " : " <unk> " and " <unk> " are common suffixes in the names of other English cities that began as Roman camps . 
 = = = Under Legio XX Valeria Victrix = = = 
 In 88 AD , the Emperor Domitian ordered the Legio II Adiutrix to the lower Danube . The Legio XX Valeria Victrix was deployed to garrison Deva Victrix , abandoning the fort they had been building in Scotland , at Inchtuthil . On their arrival they began to rebuild Deva , first in timber and from the end of the 1st century in stone . The new stone fortress walls were 1 @.@ 36 metres ( 4 @.@ 5 ft ) thick at the base and 1 @.@ 06 metres ( 3 @.@ 5 ft ) thick at the top . Located at regular intervals , approximately 60 metres ( 200 ft ) apart , along the walls were 22 towers about 6 @.@ 5 metres ( 21 ft ) square . The defensive ditch was re @-@ dug and was 7 @.@ 5 metres ( 25 ft ) wide and 2 @.@ 45 metres ( 8 @.@ 0 ft ) deep . An estimated 55 @,@ 452 metric tons ( 54 @,@ 576 long tons ; 61 @,@ 125 short tons ) of stone were used to build the new fortress defences . The timber barracks were replaced with stone buildings of a similar size . 
 During the 2nd century , at least part of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix took part in the construction of Hadrian 's Wall , leading to some sections of the fortress being abandoned and others being allowed to fall into disrepair . The Legio XX Valeria Victrix probably went on campaign in 196 under Decimus Clodius Albinus into Gaul , leaving Deva under @-@ garrisoned . They would have suffered heavy losses in Gaul before returning to Britain . 
 Following attacks against barbarians in the early 3rd century under Septimius Severus , the fortress at Deva was again rebuilt , this time using an estimated 309 @,@ 181 metric tons ( 304 @,@ 298 long tons ; 340 @,@ 814 short tons ) of stone . Although both Gildas and Bede located the early 4th @-@ century Roman martyrs , Julius and Aaron , in the " City of the Legions " , generally identified as being Isca Augusta ( Caerleon ) rather than Deva . During the 4th century the size of the legion , and therefore of the garrison , may have diminished in line with the rest of the empire 's forces . 
 = = = Decline and abandonment = = = 
 Most of the fortress ' major buildings were still being maintained in the second half of the 4th century and the barracks were still inhabited . Up to 383 soldiers at Chester were being paid by coins from the imperial mints ; after this the soldiers may have been removed by Magnus Maximus when he invaded Gaul in 383 . The Notitia Dignitatum , written in around 395 , does not record any military units garrisoned at Deva , indicating the fortress was no longer used by the military at this stage . If it was still used by the military , this would have ended by 410 when the Romans retreated from Britannia and the Western Roman Emperor Honorius told the cities of Britain to look to their own defences against invaders . The civilians probably continued to use the fortress and its defences as protection from raiders in the Irish Sea . 
 <unk> of Chester continued on a lesser scale once the legions had left . Buildings would have fallen into disrepair , although some of the larger structures are known to have survived for some time . The town nevertheless probably remained the military and administrative centre of the region . After the arrival of the Anglo @-@ Saxons , the settlement became known as <unk> , meaning " City of the Legions " in Old English . Medieval chroniclers believed the church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul – later the site of Chester Cathedral – to be of Roman origin , although no evidence has been discovered to support this . When Chester became an Anglo @-@ Saxon burh in 907 , the walls of the fortress were repaired and incorporated into the defences . Much of the Roman masonry was stolen and reused in later periods . 
 In the 14th century Ranulf Higdon , a monk in Chester , described some of the Roman remains , including the sewers and tombstones . Antiquarians began to take interest in the remains in the 17th century and interest continued to grow in the 18th century , fed by accounts of Roman Chester and discoveries such as an altar to Jupiter <unk> . Jupiter <unk> – also Taranis – was the Romanised version of the Celtic god Taranis who was the equivalent of Jupiter the god of thunder . In 1725 , William Stukeley recorded the Roman arches of the east gate ; they were demolished in 1768 . Over the next century , accidental discoveries continued , such as parts of the Roman bath complex outside the fortress which were destroyed by a late @-@ 18th @-@ century housing development . The Chester Archaeological Society , founded in 1849 , acquired artefacts discovered in Chester and undertook excavations where possible ; the Grosvenor Museum was opened in 1886 to allow the public to view the society 's collection . The society continued to work in Chester , recording information on the fortress and its surrounding settlement , often as building works destroyed the sites . Between 1962 and 1999 , about 50 excavations were carried out in and around the fortress , revealing new information about Deva Victrix . Between 2007 and 2009 , excavations are in progress at the amphitheatre on behalf of Chester City Council , in association with English Heritage . 
 = = <unk> legionis = = 
 A civilian settlement ( canabae legionis ) was gradually established outside the walls of the fortress ; it probably began as a collection of traders who became prosperous from dealing with the fortress . The settlement was administered by an elected council rather than by the legion . As legionaries retired many settled in the canabae legionis , effectively making it a veteran colony . Cemeteries were located alongside the roads leading to the settlement , beyond built @-@ up areas . The Grosvenor Museum has over 150 tombstones , the largest collection of Roman tombstones from a single site in Britain . Most of them were used to repair the north wall in the 4th century . Settlement extended around the fortress to the east , south , and west ; shops fronted the roadside for about 300 metres ( 980 ft ) beyond the fortress walls . To the east was the legion 's parade ground , civilian baths were built to the west , and to the south was a mansio , a large coaching house for travelling government officials . The buildings of the canabae legionis were originally timber , but during the early 2nd century began to be replaced by stone @-@ built structures . The settlement expanded throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries as the population increased . Once the legion had left , the civilian settlement continued , eventually becoming part of the town of Chester . 
 Indeed , scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from 410 AD when Roman legions withdrew , to 597 AD when St. Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved a sub @-@ Roman society that was able to survive the attacks from the Anglo @-@ Saxons and even use a vernacular Latin ( called British Latin ) for an active culture . There is even the possibility that this vernacular Latin lasted to the late 7th century in the area of Chester , where amphorae and archaeological remnants of a local Romano @-@ British culture at Deva Victrix have been found . 
 = = Legionary quarry = = 
 The Roman fortress of Deva was constructed from local sandstone , which was quarried across the river to the south of the fortress . Traces of the quarry are visible in <unk> . In the 2nd century , a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the quarry for protection , perhaps by the quarry workers . Despite heavy weathering , the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom . There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left . The only rock @-@ cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain , the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building . 
 = = Legionary baths = = 
 Deva Victrix had a large legionary bath complex ( thermae ) for the soldiers to maintain good hygiene and to use for leisure time . The baths were sited near the south gate and measured 82 @.@ 6 metres ( 271 ft ) by 85 @.@ 5 metres ( 281 ft ) . They were completed towards the end of Vespasian 's reign . The complex was constructed from concrete and faced with stone . The walls were 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) thick and the barrel @-@ vaulted buildings rose as high as 16 @.@ 1 metres ( 53 ft ) . 
 The bath complex featured an entrance room ( <unk> ) , an exercise hall ( basilica <unk> ) , a sweating room ( <unk> ) , a cold room with a cold pool ( frigidarium ) , a warm room ( tepidarium ) , and a hot room with a hot plunge bath ( caldarium ) . An unsheltered exercise yard ( <unk> ) also formed part of the complex . The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under @-@ floor system connected to three furnaces . Such furnaces required several metric tons of wood each day . 
 The baths would have been in operation 24 hours a day , using an estimated 850 @,@ 000 litres ( 190 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water each day . The water was supplied from the springs in Boughton through underground lead pipes linked to the main aqueduct near the east gate . The water was then held in large tanks with concrete foundations , before being fed through the complex . 
 A large area of the baths was destroyed by building works in 1863 and during the construction of the Grosvenor Shopping Mall in 1963 . Sandstone columns from the exercise hall of the baths , measuring 0 @.@ 75 metres ( 2 @.@ 5 ft ) in diameter , are present in the " Roman Gardens " off Pepper Street ; the columns would originally have stood 5 @.@ 9 metres ( 19 ft ) high . A section of hypocaust remains in situ and is on display in the cellar of 39 Bridge Street . 
 = = Market Hall inscription = = 
 This is a fragment of a much larger inscription , finely carved onto Welsh slate , which was discovered close to the fort 's principia . Archaeologist David J.P. Mason has said that : 
 ... Inscriptions of this type are comparatively scarce ... it therefore seems likely to belong to the administrative class of inscription , generally written out in full ... which were set up as a public record of official decisions taken at the highest level of government . 
 Examples of important inscriptions of this nature include treaties with local tribes and declarations of rights . The text of this inscription cannot be reconstructed from this small fragment , but it appears to talk about the ' fortress ' , an ' amicable conclusion ' , and someone being ' against the regime ' . 
 = = Amphitheatre = = 
 The amphitheatre was discovered in 1929 , and protected by the Chester Archaeological Society – with support from then Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald – from the construction of a road over the site . Excavations have revealed traces of late Iron Age cultivation , and they show that Deva 's amphitheatre had two phases of construction . The first amphitheatre was constructed from timber soon after the building of the fortress and measured 75 metres ( 246 ft ) along the major axis and 67 metres ( 220 ft ) along the minor axis . There are several factors indicating that the timber phase may have only intended to be temporary ; there is no evidence of repairs to the structure , the building was not substantially built , with 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) deep foundations , and that it was smaller than the later stone phase . It was replaced in the Flavian period by another made from stone , measuring 95 @.@ 7 metres ( 314 ft ) along its major axis and 87 @.@ 2 metres ( 286 ft ) along its minor axis . Although the amphitheatre grew , it was only the seating that was extended , not the arena itself . The latest excavations indicate that it was a two @-@ tiered structure , capable of accommodating between 8 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 spectators . Its size has been used as an indicator of Deva 's large civilian population , and of the presence of wealthy citizens . The second phase of building produced the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain . It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument . 
 The amphitheatre served a variety of purposes . Owing to its proximity to the fortress , it would have been used as a venue for weapons training as well as hosting spectacular entertainments involving acrobats , wrestlers , and professional gladiators . The walls of the amphitheatre were 0 @.@ 9 metres ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) thick and may have stood as high as 12 metres ( 39 ft ) . The buttresses were too insubstantial to be structural , so must have been decorative . 
 Part of a slate frieze depicting a retiarius , or net @-@ fighter , was discovered in 1738 , most likely dating to the 2nd century ; it was probably used to decorate the tomb of a gladiator . Other finds included a small bronze statuette of a gladiator , parts of a Roman bowl depicting scenes from a gladiatorial contest , and part of a gladius sword handle . Much of the masonry from the amphitheatre was reused in the construction of the St John 's Church and the monastery of St Mary . 
 = = Elliptical building = = 
 In 1939 some paving and the walls of two unusual elliptical buildings were discovered , one atop the other . These ' elliptical ' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester 's market hall , and no similar buildings have been found in other legionary fortresses . The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside . The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths . Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping , which served a central water feature or fountain , which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian . The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework , and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress . Technically speaking it was not elliptical , but arcuate , with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs , and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire . Its function is unknown . There was no seating within the arcs , which precludes a theatre , and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods , with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon . Or , alternatively , the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world , but there is no supporting evidence for this . 
 The completed building measured 52 @.@ 4 metres ( 172 ft ) by 31 @.@ 45 metres ( 103 @.@ 2 ft ) , and had an oval courtyard with a water feature at its centre , 14 metres ( 46 ft ) by 9 metres ( 30 ft ) , surrounded by 12 " wedge @-@ shaped " rooms . Traces of the concrete foundation for the water feature and its lead pipe work have been excavated . The 12 rooms surrounding the courtyard had large arched entrances , 4 metres ( 13 ft ) wide and at least 5 @.@ 5 metres ( 18 ft ) high . It is not certain if the first building was ever completed , but it had certainly been destroyed by the AD 90s and the site was subsequently used as the fortress rubbish dump for many decades . 
 The second elliptical building was built on top foundations of the first , and although the architect must have been aware of the exact layout of the previous building , the design of the second was slightly modified . Although the it looks very similar to the first , it used different diameters of arc to achieve a slightly ' fatter ' design . The second ' elliptical ' building was not constructed until about AD 220 , and this was confirmed by a coin of Emperor Elagabalus under one of the pavement slabs . It is thought that the second building may have survived until the end of Roman rule and influence in Britain . 
 The foundations of these buildings were destroyed during the construction of the Forum shopping centre . 
 = = Capital of Britannia ? = = 
 The elliptical building is one of several differences between the fortress at Chester and other Roman fortresses in the province . Deva was 20 % larger , 5 hectares ( 12 acres ) , than the fortresses of Eboracum ( York ) – later capital of Britannia Inferior – and Isca Augusta ( Caerleon ) . Also , the stone curtain wall at Chester was constructed without mortar , using large sandstone blocks ; this required greater skill and effort than the methods used to build the walls of Eboracum and Isca Augusta , and was usually reserved for the most important structures such as temples or city walls rather than town walls . The presence of unusual buildings at the heart of the fortress – accounting for the 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) by which Deva was larger than other fortresses – has been taken as evidence that their construction was specifically ordered by the provincial governor . The governor ( Legatus Augusti pro <unk> ) when construction first started was Gnaeus Julius Agricola . Lead piping found in the elliptical building bears his name , the only evidence in Britain of a building under his direct control . These differences suggest that Deva may have been Agricola ’ s administrative headquarters – in effect the capital of Britannia . This was speculated on in a Timewatch investigation . 
 Another factor pointing to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital is the presence of a port . From Deva , Ireland ( Hibernia ) was also accessible , a land which Agricola had plans to conquer ; he even launched an expedition to Ireland , though where from is unclear . Also , the Flavian dynasty was expansionist , and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front , making administration quicker and easier . Furthermore , historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at the centre of the British isles , being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland , the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel . 
 Regardless of the empire 's plans for Deva , Londinium , the province 's economic and trading centre , emerged as the capital of Britannia , reflecting a change in imperial policy from expansionism to consolidation .

 The Fifth Element ( French : Le <unk> <unk> ) is a 1997 English @-@ language French science fiction action film directed and co @-@ written by Luc Besson . It stars Bruce Willis , Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich . Primarily set in the 23rd century , the film 's central plot involves the survival of planet Earth , which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas ( Willis ) , a taxicab driver and former special forces major , after a young woman ( Jovovich ) falls into his cab . Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against an impending attack . 
 Besson started writing the story that became The Fifth Element when he was 16 years old ; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas . Besson wanted to shoot the film in France , but suitable locations could not be found ; filming took place instead in London and Mauritania . Comics writers Jean " Moebius " Giraud and Jean @-@ Claude Mézières , whose comics provided inspiration for parts of the film , were hired for production design . Costume design was by Jean Paul Gaultier . 
 The Fifth Element received mainly positive reviews , although it tended to polarize critics . It has been called both the best and worst summer blockbuster of all time . The film was a financial success , earning more than $ 263 million at the box office on a $ 90 million budget . At the time of its release it was the most expensive European film ever made , and it remained the highest @-@ grossing French film at the international box office until the release of The <unk> in 2011 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1914 , aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect , for safekeeping , the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5 @,@ 000 years . The weapon consists of four stones , representing the four classical elements , and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element in the form of a human , which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil . The Mondoshawans promise their human contact , a priest from a secret order , that they will come back with the element stones in time to stop the great evil when it returns . 
 In <unk> , the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire , and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship . The Mondoshawans ' current contact on Earth , priest Vito Cornelius ( Ian Holm ) , informs the President of the Federated Territories ( Tom Lister Jr . ) of the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it . As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores , a race hired by the industrialist Jean @-@ Baptiste Emanuel Zorg ( Gary Oldman ) , who has been instructed by the great evil to acquire the stones . 
 The Mondoshawans ' spacecraft is destroyed , though the stones are not on board ; the only item recovered is a hand of The Fifth Element . Scientists take it to a New York City laboratory and use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo ( Milla Jovovich ) . Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings , she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge , crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas ( Bruce Willis ) , a former major in the special forces . 
 Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice , David ( Charlie Creed @-@ Miles ) , whereupon Cornelius learns that the Mondoshawans entrusted the four element stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna ( Maïwenn Le Besco ) , an opera singer . Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones , but their compatriots determine to seize the artifacts for themselves . Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna 's possession , General Munro ( Brion James ) , Dallas ' former superior , <unk> Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury intergalactic cruise ; Dallas takes Leeloo with him . Meanwhile , Cornelius instructs David to prepare the ancient temple designed to house the stones , then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner . 
 Plavalaguna is killed when the Mangalores attack the ship , but Dallas succeeds in retrieving the stones from the Diva . During his struggle with the Mangalores he kills their leader . Meanwhile , Zorg shoots and seriously wounds Leeloo , before finding a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones and takes it back to his spacecraft , leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner 's occupants to evacuate . Discovering the case to be empty , Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb , but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device , destroying the ship and killing Zorg . Dallas , Cornelius , Leeloo , and talk @-@ show host Ruby Rhod ( Chris Tucker ) escape with the stones aboard Zorg 's spacecraft . 
 The four join up with David at the weapon chamber in the Egyptian temple as the great evil approaches . They arrange the stones and are able to activate them with their corresponding elements , but having witnessed and studied so much violence , Leeloo has become disenchanted with humanity and refuses to cooperate . Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her . In response , Leeloo combines the power of the stones and releases the divine light on the great evil and destroying its power , causing the planet to be proclaimed dead by Earth scientists as it becomes another moon in Earth orbit .

 = = Themes = = 
 In an interview Besson stated The Fifth Element was not a " big theme movie " , although the film 's theme was an important one . He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states " What 's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ? " , and agree with her . Jay P. Telotte , writing in the book Science Fiction Film , credited the film with exploring the theme of political corruption . 
 An article by Brian Ott and Eric Aoki in the feminist journal Women 's Studies in Communication considered gender to be one of the film 's main themes . The authors accused the film of erasing women from the introductory scenes , noting that Leeloo 's reconstruction marked only the second appearance of a female in the film 's first 20 minutes ; the other is an androgynous , mostly speechless presidential aide . When females appear in the film , they do so as passive objects , such as the sexualised flight and McDonald 's attendants ; or stripped of their femininity , such as the " butch " Major <unk> . Stefan Brandt , in the book <unk> Masculinity , also said that the film " echoes stereotypical beliefs about gender " of all females in the film , including Leeloo , who leaves her passive role in the film during the times she is defending herself and during her fight with the Mangalores . With the exception of Tiny Lister 's portrayal of the President , all males in the film were considered to be as unmanly as possible in various ways , such as Ruby Rhod 's effeminacy , Vito Cornelius 's clumsy form of speech , and General Munro 's stupidity ; their purpose was to make Korben 's masculinity appear " god @-@ like " by comparison . 
 In the book The Films of Luc Besson , Susan Hayward considered The Fifth Element to be a classic story of a man " making his break from the tribe , proving his manhood , over @-@ throwing the malevolent forces and killing the chief , finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage " . Korben 's journey , however , is under threat not only from the Mangalores and Zorg , but also from Leeloo , who relents and helps him only at the last minute , accepting his declaration of love . The love story within The Fifth Element was considered to be one of the main narratives in the film , and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline . Hayward also considered the issue of environmental damage , in so far as waste and pollution are visible throughout the film . Whereas science fiction films often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity , The Films of Luc Besson included The Fifth Element amongst the minority of science fiction films that " hold up a mirror " and show humankind as responsible . The film was said to be skeptical of capitalist consumerism , in so far as the gadgets in Zorg 's office make an unhealthy obsession of his lust for technology . The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution .

 As a teenager , Besson envisioned the world of The Fifth Element in an attempt to alleviate boredom . He began writing the script when he was 16 , though it was not released in cinemas until he was 38 . The original storyline was set in the year 2300 , and was about a " nobody " named Zaltman <unk> ( later renamed Korben Dallas ) who wins a trip to the Club Med resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise . There he meets Leeloo , a " sand @-@ girl " who has the " beauty of youth " despite being over 2 @,@ 000 years old . Besson continued to work on and modify the storyline for years ; by the time his film Atlantis was released in 1991 he had a 400 @-@ page script . Nicolas Seydoux and Patrice Ledoux from Gaumont were the first people to take on the project . In November 1991 , while looking for actors for the film , Besson met French comics creators Jean Giraud and Jean @-@ Claude Mézières and recruited them for the film 's production design . Giraud and Mézières 's comics were a major source of inspiration for Besson 's futuristic New York City . Mézières wrote the book The Circles of Power , which features a character named S 'Traks , who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air traffic of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis . Mézières showed images of the flying taxi to Besson , who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis @-@ inspired futuristic New York . Five other artists were hired for the project , and Jean Paul Gaultier was hired to design the film 's costumes . The team spent a year creating over 8 @,@ 000 drawings , during which time Besson approached both Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the lead role . Willis expressed interest , though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films , Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate , had been received poorly ; Gibson eventually turned down the role . While the team impressed film companies with their designs , they struggled to find one willing to take on the film 's budget of almost $ 100 million . In December 1992 production of the film stopped without any prior warning , and the team disbanded . 
 Besson went on to direct the commercially successful film Léon : The Professional , which was released in September 1994 . While shooting and releasing Leon , he continued to work on the script for The Fifth Element , shortening it and reducing the film 's budget to $ 90 million before attempting to find a studio willing to produce it . Columbia Pictures , who had a partnership in Leon , agreed to finance the film . By this time Besson had decided to go with a lesser @-@ known lead actor in order to save on production costs . Besson was in Barry Josephson 's office when Willis called regarding a different film . Besson asked to speak to Willis " just to say hello " , and told him that The Fifth Element was finally going ahead , explaining the decision to go with a less @-@ expensive actor . After a short silence , Willis stated " If I like the film , we can always come to an arrangement " ; he agreed to take on the role after reading the script . Production of the film commenced in early August 1995 . Besson traveled to various places for casting , including Paris , London and Rome . He chose to hire Gary Oldman , who had starred in Léon , for the role of Zorg , describing Oldman as " one of the top five actors in the world . " For the character Leeloo , Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200 to 300 applicants he met in person . The " Divine Language " spoken in the film by Leeloo is a fictional language with only 400 words , invented by Besson . Jovovich and Besson held conversations and wrote letters to each other in the language as practice . Besson was in a relationship with Maïwenn Le Besco , who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna , for six years when filming commenced ; however , he left her for Jovovich during filming . Jovovich and Besson later married , but divorced in 1999 . 
 Despite wishing to shoot the film in France , Besson could not find suitable facilities and " with a heavy heart " instead filmed in London . It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 Stage . Construction of sets began in October 1995 . The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House . Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania ; the first shoot for the film , a background shot of the desert , occurred there on 5 January 1996 . Filming with actors began in late January , and was completed 21 weeks later . Willis finished filming on 16 May , while Oldman only commenced filming the following week ; the film 's protagonist ( Korben ) and antagonist ( Zorg ) never actually share any screen time . Despite being filmed in London , The Fifth Element was a French production , and went on to become the costliest European film ever made at the time . The buildings in New York were derived from both <unk> @-@ inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s , and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant 'Elia in the 1910s . Besson demanded that most of the action shots in the film take place in broad daylight , as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films , and wanted a brighter " cheerfully crazy " look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one . Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the film 's Fhloston Paradise scenes , and checked each costume every morning . His designs , described as " intellectually transgressive " , were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms . A single jacket he designed for the film cost $ 5 @,@ 000 . 
 The original name of the character Ruby Rhod was Loc Rhod . The name appears in both the original script and in the novelisation of the film . Speculation has been raised that the name change was a play on information in the periodic table . Rubidium is the first of the Period 5 elements , and exactly halfway down that row is the element Rhodium . Taking the first half of each element yields " Rubi Rhod " . Others have speculated his name is a play on his gender bending personality ; having a feminine first name and phallic surname . The term " ruby rod " also refers to the essential component of the first working laser design . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Three different teams handled the three different types of special effects used in the film . Nick Allder was placed in charge of mechanical and pyrotechnical effects , Nick Dudman was placed in charge of ' creature ' effects and Mark Stetson headed the visual effects team . Visual effects company Digital Domain was hired for the film , and Karen <unk> was given the role of digital effects supervisor . Alias , Autodesk Softimage , Arete , Side Effect 's <unk> , RenderMan , as well as in @-@ house software , were used by Digital Domain to create effects . Some individual shots used a combination of live action , scale models , computer @-@ generated imagery and particle systems . The lanes of traffic in the scenes in New York City were created with particle systems : 
 We had maybe 80 cityscape shots with CG cars hurtling around , and you couldn 't animate them all by hand because there were just too many of them in each scene ... When the cars turned a corner , the velocity changes were automatic , so the animator didn 't have to worry about that . They just planned the moves in a very blocky way , and the mathematics smoothed out the rest . 
 Amongst the scale models used for filming were the buildings seen in New York City . Dozens of apartment blocks and 25 skyscrapers , some 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high , were constructed in 1 / 24th scale . It took a team of 80 workers five months to build the models used in the film . The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time @-@ consuming tasks , along with details behind the windows , such as furniture , blinds , <unk> and tiny pieces of flat artwork . Virtual sets built within digital environments were created to enhance the use of miniatures . Motion control cameras moved throughout the scale sets , and the data they collected was exported to track and generate the CG animation and particle systems . Other techniques used in the film included digital matte paintings for backgrounds and the <unk> mathematical model for certain animations , including the sequence in which Leeloo 's body is reconstructed . 
 = = = Soundtrack = = = 
 The Fifth Element is one of Besson 's films which have been described as " intrinsically musical " ; some kind of music is playing during about 90 percent of the film . The film 's score was composed by Éric Serra . He relies heavily on the use of orchestral textures , such as the oboe and strings heard as the surgeons prepare to regenerate Leeloo , and the pizzicato as she is reconstructed . Serra also used many exotic influences , such as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport sequence , the reggae piece played in preparation for the flight , and the hula music that greets the passengers as they arrive in Fhloston . More conventional scoring techniques are present in the leitmotif that first appears when professor <unk> mentions the fifth element , the militaristic snares as the warship prepares to attack the dark planet , and the <unk> funereal piece heard when Leeloo learns about war . The music used for the taxicab chase scene , titled " <unk> <unk> " by Algerian performer Khaled , is excluded from the film soundtrack , but is available on Khaled 's album N <unk> N <unk> . 
 The Diva Dance opera performance featured music from Gaetano Donizetti 's Lucia di Lammermoor : " Il dolce <unk> " , the mad scene of Act III , Scene 2 . It is one of the few pieces of music in the film that is diegetic . It was sung by Albanian soprano <unk> Mula , while the role of Plavalaguna was played by French actress Maïwenn Le Besco . Part One ( titled " Lucia di Lammermoor " ) and Part Two ( titled " The Diva Dance " ) of this piece are included as separate tracks on The Fifth Element soundtrack , but are sequenced to create the effect of the entire performance seen in the film . The end of Part One blends into the beginning of Part Two , creating a smooth transition between the two tracks . 
 Released as an album under Virgin Records , the soundtrack peaked at No. 99 on the Billboard 200 . More than 200 @,@ 000 copies of the lengthy soundtrack were sold in France alone . Rodney <unk> of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars , stating it was " diverse and accomplished , and it is just as effective outside of the film as it is within it . " A review from Filmtracks.com also awarded the album three out of five stars .

 The Fifth Element holds a 71 % approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes , based on 58 reviews . The site 's consensus reads : " Visually inventive and gleefully over the top , Luc Besson 's The Fifth Element is a fantastic piece of pop sci @-@ fi that never takes itself too seriously . " It has a weighted score of 52 / 100 at Metacritic , based on 22 professional reviews , indicating " mixed or average " reviews . 
 The Fifth Element polarised critics on release . Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as an " elaborate , even campy sci @-@ fi extravaganza , which is nearly as hard to follow as last year 's Mission : Impossible . " He concluded that The Fifth Element was " a lot warmer , more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated , witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see . " On film review show At the Movies , both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a " thumbs up " ; in his own review for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4 , calling it " One of the great goofy movies " , and concluding , " I would not have missed seeing this film , and I recommend it for its richness of imagery . But at 127 minutes , which seems a reasonable length , it plays long . " 
 The film was , however , subject to a number of harsh reviews that expressed disapproval of its overblown style . Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote , " A largely misfired European attempt to make an American @-@ style sci @-@ fi spectacular , The Fifth Element consists of a hodgepodge of elements that don 't comfortably coalesce . " David Edelstein of Slate was even more critical , saying , " It may or may not be the worst movie ever made , but it is one of the most unhinged . " 
 Chris Tucker 's performance as Ruby Rhod also polarised critics . He was praised in the Los Angeles Times and in Time ; the latter called him " the summer 's most outrageous special effect . " Josh Winning of GamesRadar , however , singled out Tucker 's performance as the low point of the film , ranking it as No. 20 on his 2011 list , " 50 Performances That Ruined Movies . "

 The film has been described by CBS News , Rotten Tomatoes , and <unk> as a science fiction cult classic . However film critic Mark Kermode reported that The Fifth Element was one of the most divisive films among his readers , regarded as both the best and the worst summer blockbuster of all time . Kermode recalled his own experience : " I remember very clearly being in Cannes when [ The ] Fifth Element was first played , and it really divided the audience . " Stephen Cass of Discover ranked the film the third @-@ best science fiction movie on subscription service Hulu , writing , " People seem to either like or loathe The Fifth Element ... Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis , Milla Jovovich , and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching . " In some circles the film has gained a " so @-@ bad @-@ it 's @-@ good " status ; Meredith Woerner of io9 listed The Fifth Element as one of " The 20 Best Worst Science Fiction Movies of All Time " . In 2007 the Visual Effects Society placed The Fifth Element at No. 50 , tied with Darby O <unk> and the Little People , on their list of the 50 most influential visual effects films of all time . In 2014 , Time Out listed the film at No. 42 on their " 100 best sci @-@ fi movies " list . 
 Willis spoke favourably of the film in a 1999 interview , concluding " it was a real fun movie to make . " Tucker and Jovovich also spoke favourably of both their experiences making the film and working with Besson in interviews on the Ultimate Edition DVD ; Jovovich described Besson as " the first really amazing director I had worked with " . Asked in a 2014 interview if he liked the film , Gary Oldman stated , " Oh no . I can 't bear it . " He had explained in 2011 : " It was me singing for my supper because Luc had come in and partly financed [ my film ] Nil by Mouth . " 
 Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jean Giraud sued Besson after the film was released , claiming The Fifth Element had plagiarised their comic The <unk> . Giraud sued for 13 @.@ 1 million euros for unfair competition , 9 million euros in damages and interest and two to five percent of the net operating revenues of the film . Jodorowsky sued for 700 @,@ 000 euros . The case was dismissed in 2004 on the grounds that only " tiny fragments " of the comic had been used and also because Giraud had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made . 
 A novel adaptation of The Fifth Element , written by Terry Bisson , was published by <unk> in 1997 . There were rumors after the film 's release that it would be followed by a sequel , tentatively titled Mr. Shadow . In 2011 , Besson stated that a sequel was never planned , and that he has no desire to make one . 
 A video game adaptation of The Fifth Element was created by Activision for the PlayStation game console and PC in 1998 . The PlayStation version was generally met with negative reviews , though the PC version was better received . Lauren Fielder from GameSpot called the PlayStation version " quite possibly the worst game I 've ever played . " Doug Perry from IGN commented : " Take Tomb Raider , add in Leeloo <unk> and boring puzzles , and you 've got Fifth Element . " A racing game based on the film , New York Race , was released in 2001 . Eurogamer gave the game 6 out of 10 , concluding : " New York Race is a fun little arcade racer which oozes style , but it 's something you 'll grow tired of extremely quickly and as such remains fun only in short bursts .

 The original home video release of The Fifth Element took place in North America on 10 December 1997 , on VHS , LaserDisc , and DVD . The original DVD presented the film in its original 2 @.@ 39 : 1 anamorphic widescreen format though carried no special features . The film was released in Sony 's Superbit format in October 2001 . In his review , Conrad Jeremy from IGN gave the picture quality of the original DVD release 9 out of 10 , though awarded the Superbit version a perfect score for picture quality . Overall the Superbit version was given 8 out of 10 ; the final score was brought down by the version 's complete lack of special features . 
 An " Ultimate Edition " set of two DVDs was released on 11 January 2005 . The only difference between the Superbit version and the Ultimate Edition disc one is the addition of a " fact track " , which when turned on displays trivia about the film , cast and crew as the film plays . The second disc provides various special features , focusing on visual production , special effects , fashion in the film , featurettes and interviews with Willis , Jovovich , and Tucker , as well as featurettes on the four different alien races in the film and Diva Plavalaguna . Ian Jane of DVD Talk praised the Ultimate Edition for its special features . 
 The first Blu @-@ ray Disc release of the film on 20 June 2006 was criticised as having poor picture quality by Blu @-@ ray standards , and for its lack of special features . In what has been called " an extremely rare move " Sony responded to complaints by making a remastered Blu @-@ ray version available , released on 17 July 2007 , and also offered a replacement exchange program for customers unhappy with the original Blu @-@ ray release .

 = Dugong = 
 The dugong ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / ; Dugong dugon ) is a medium @-@ sized marine mammal . It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia , which also includes three species of manatees . It is the only living representative of the once @-@ diverse family Dugongidae ; its closest modern relative , Steller 's sea cow ( <unk> gigas ) , was hunted to extinction in the 18th century . The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal . 
 The dugong is the only <unk> in its range , which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo @-@ West Pacific . The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats which support seagrass meadows , with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide , shallow , protected areas such as bays , mangrove channels , the waters of large inshore islands and inter @-@ <unk> waters . The northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong 's contemporary stronghold . 
 Like all modern sirenians , the dugong has a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs . The forelimbs or flippers are paddle @-@ like . The dugong is easily distinguished from the manatees by its fluked , dolphin @-@ like tail , but also possesses a unique skull and teeth . Its snout is sharply downturned , an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities . The molar teeth are simple and peg @-@ like unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees . 
 The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil . Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range , particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands . The dugong 's current distribution is fragmented , and many populations are believed to be close to extinction . The IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction , while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species limits or bans the trade of derived products . Despite being legally protected in many countries , the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fishing @-@ related fatalities , habitat degradation and hunting . With its long lifespan of 70 years or more , and slow rate of reproduction , the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction . 
 = = Etymology and taxonomy = = 
 The word " dugong " derives from the Tagalog term dugong which was in turn adopted from the Malay <unk> , both meaning " lady of the sea " . Other common local names include " sea cow " , " sea pig " and " sea camel " . 
 Dugong dugon is the only extant species of the family Dugongidae , and one of only four extant species of the Sirenia order , the others forming the manatee family . It was first classified by Müller in 1776 as Trichechus dugon , a member of the manatee genus previously defined by Linnaeus . It was later assigned as the type species of Dugong by Lacépède and further classified within its own family by Gray and subfamily by Simpson . 
 Dugongs and other sirenians are not closely related to other marine mammals , being more related to elephants . Dugongs and elephants share a monophyletic group with hyraxes and the aardvark , one of the earliest offshoots of eutherians . The fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the Eocene , where they most likely lived in the Tethys Ocean . The two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the mid @-@ Eocene , after which the dugongs and their closest relative , the Steller 's sea cow , split off from a common ancestor in the Miocene . The Steller 's sea cow became extinct in the 18th century . No fossils exist of other members of the Dugongidae . 
 Molecular studies have been made on dugong populations using mitochondrial DNA . The results have suggested that the population of Southeast Asia is distinct from the others . Australia has two distinct maternal lineages , one of which also contains the dugongs from Africa and Arabia . Limited genetic mixing has taken place between those in Southeast Asia and those in Australia , mostly around Timor . One of the lineages stretches all the way from Moreton Bay to Western Australia , while the other only stretches from Moreton Bay to the Northern Territory . There is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear boundaries between distinct groups . 
 = = Anatomy and morphology = = 
 The dugong 's body is large with a cylindrical shape that tapers at both ends . It has thick , smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth , but darkens dorsally and laterally to brownish @-@ to @-@ dark @-@ grey with age . The colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of algae on the skin . The body is sparsely covered in short hair , a common feature among sirenians which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment . These hairs are most developed around the mouth , which has a large horseshoe shaped upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle . This muscular upper lip aids the dugong in foraging . 
 The dugong 's tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of dolphins . These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward , and can be twisted to turn . The forelimbs are paddle @-@ like flippers which aid in turning and slowing . The dugong lacks nails on its flippers , which are only 15 % of a dugong 's body length . The tail has deep notches . 
 A dugong 's brain weighs a maximum of 300 g ( 11 oz ) , about 0 @.@ 1 % of the animal 's body weight . With very small eyes , dugongs have limited vision , but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds . Their ears , which lack pinna , are located on the sides of their head . The nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves . Dugongs have two teats , one located behind each flipper . There are few differences between sexes ; the body structures are almost the same . A male 's testes are not externally located , and the main difference between males and females is the location of the genital aperture in relation to the umbilicus and the anus . The lungs in a dugong are very long , extending almost as far as the kidneys , which are also highly elongated in order to cope with the saltwater environment . If wounded , a dugong 's blood will clot rapidly . 
 The skull of a dugong is unique . The skull is enlarged with sharply down @-@ turned premaxilla , which are stronger in males . The spine has between 57 and 60 vertebrae . Unlike in manatees , the dugong 's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement . The dugong has two incisors ( tusks ) which emerge in males during puberty . The female 's tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty , sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla . The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong , and the cheekteeth move forward with age . The full dental formula of dugongs is 2 @.@ 0 @.@ 3 @.@ 33 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 , meaning they have two incisors , three premolars , and three molars on each side of their upper jaw , and three incisors , one canine , three premolars , and three molars on each side of their lower jaw . Like other sirenians , the dugong experiences <unk> , a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow . These heavy bones , which are among the densest in the animal kingdom , may act as a ballast to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water 's surface . 
 An adult 's length rarely exceeds 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . An individual this long is expected to weigh around 420 kilograms ( 926 lb ) . Weight in adults is typically more than 250 kilograms ( 551 lb ) and less than 900 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 984 lb ) . The largest individual recorded was 4 @.@ 06 metres ( 13 @.@ 32 ft ) long and weighed 1 @,@ 016 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 240 lb ) , and was found off the Saurashtra coast of west India . Females tend to be larger than males . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa , along an estimated 140 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 86 @,@ 992 mi ) of coastline between 26 ° and 27 ° degrees to the north and south of the equator . Their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the <unk> and <unk> families . The full size of the former range is unknown , although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range , which is highly fractured . Today populations of dugongs are found in the waters of 37 countries and territories . Recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers , due to a lack of accurate surveys . Despite this , the dugong population is thought to be shrinking , with a worldwide decline of 20 per cent in the last 90 years . They have disappeared from the waters of Hong Kong , Mauritius , and Taiwan , as well as parts of Cambodia , Japan , the Philippines and Vietnam . Further disappearances are likely . 
 Dugongs are generally found in warm waters around the coast with large numbers concentrated in wide and shallow protected bays . The dugong is the only strictly @-@ marine herbivorous mammal , as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree . Nonetheless , they can tolerate the brackish waters found in coastal wetlands , and large numbers are also found in wide and shallow mangrove channels and around leeward sides of large inshore islands , where seagrass beds are common . They are usually located at a depth of around 10 m ( 33 ft ) , although in areas where the continental shelf remains shallow dugongs have been known to travel more than 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) from the shore , descending to as far as 37 metres ( 121 ft ) , where deepwater seagrasses such as Halophila spinulosa are found . Special habitats are used for different activities . It has been observed that shallow waters are used as sites for calving , minimising the risk of predation . Deep waters may provide a thermal refuge from cooler waters closer to the shore during winter . 
 = = = East Africa and South Asia = = = 
 In the late 1960s , herds of up to 500 dugongs were observed off the coast of East Africa and nearby islands . Current populations in this area are extremely small , numbering 50 and below , and it is thought likely they will become extinct . The eastern side of the Red Sea is the home of large populations numbering in the hundreds , and similar populations are thought to exist on the western side . In the 1980s , it was estimated there could be as many as 4 @,@ 000 dugongs in the Red Sea . The Persian Gulf has the second @-@ largest dugong population in the world , inhabiting most of the southern coast , and the current population is believed to be around 7 @,@ 500 . Dugong populations in Madagascar are poorly studied , but due to widespread exploitation it is thought they may have severely declined , with few surviving individuals . In Mozambique , most of local populations remaining are rather very small where the largest ( about 120 individuals ) occur at Bazaruto Island , but they have become rare in historical habitats such as in Maputo Bay and on <unk> Island . In the Seychelles , dugongs had been regarded as extinct until a small number of dugongs was discovered around the Aldabra Atoll . This population may belong to different group than that distributed among the inner isles . 
 A highly isolated breeding population exists in the Marine National Park , Gulf of Kutch , the only population remaining in western India . It is 1 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 932 mi ) from the population in the Persian Gulf , and 1 @,@ 700 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 056 mi ) from the nearest population in India . Former populations in this area , centred on the Maldives and the Laccadive Islands , are presumed to be extinct . A population exists in the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka , but it is seriously depleted . Dugongs are also found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and is the state animal of this territory . Once distributed throughout the coastal belt in Sri Lanka , the dugong number declined in last two decades due to heavy hunting by the fishermen . Now only the north @-@ eastern coastal belt is home for the rest of dugong population around Sri Lanka . It is listed as an endangered species on the southern coast of Pakistan . The population around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are known only from a few records , and although the population was large during British rule , it is now believed to be small and scattered . 
 = = = Southern Pacific outside of Australia = = = 
 A small population exists today along the southern coast of China , where efforts are being made to protect it , including the establishment of a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna ranging in <unk> . Despite these efforts , numbers continue to decrease , and in 2007 it was reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of Hainan . Historically , dugongs were also present in the southern parts of the Yellow Sea . In Vietnam , dugongs have been restricted mostly to the provinces of Kiên Giang and Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu , including Phu Quoc Island and Con Dao Island , which hosted large populations in the past . Con Dao is now the only site in Vietnam where dugong are regularly seen , protected within the <unk> <unk> National Park . Nonetheless , dangerously low levels of <unk> for conservation of marine organisms in Vietnam and Cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catches , and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugongs . On Phu Quoc , the first ' Dugong Festival ' was held in 2014 , aiming to raise awareness of these issues . 
 In Thailand , the present distribution of dugongs is restricted to 6 provinces along the Andaman Sea , and very few dugongs are present in the Gulf of Thailand . The Gulf of Thailand was historically home to large number of the animals , but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent years , and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining . Dugongs are believed to exist in the Straits of Johor in very small numbers . The waters around Borneo support a small population , with more scattered throughout the Malay archipelago . All the islands of the Philippines are believed to have once provided habitats for dugongs , which were common until the 1970s . Populations exist around the Solomon Islands archipelago and New Caledonia , stretching to an easternmost population in Vanuatu . A highly isolated population lives around the islands of Palau . 
 A singe dugong lives at Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands although the animal is thought to be a vagrant . 
 = = = Northern Pacific = = = 
 Today , possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugongs exists around the Ryukyu islands , and a population formerly existed off Taiwan . An endangered population of 50 or fewer dugongs , possibly as few as only three individuals , <unk> around Okinawa . A single individual was recorded in Amami Oshima , at the northernmost edge of the dugong 's historic range , more than 40 years after the last previous recorded sighting . A vagrant strayed into port near Ushibuka , Kumamoto , and died due to poor health . Historically , the Yaeyama Islands held a large concentration of dugongs , with more than 300 individuals . On <unk> Island , large quantities of skulls are preserved at an <unk> that outsiders are strictly forbidden to enter . Dugong populations in these areas were reduced by historical hunts as payments to the Ryukyu Kingdom , before being wiped out because of large @-@ scale illegal hunting and fishing using destructive methods such as dynamite fishing after the Second World War . 
 Populations around Taiwan appear to be almost extinct , although remnant individuals may visit areas with rich seagrass beds such as Dongsha Atoll . Some of the last reported sightings were made in Kenting National Park in 1950s and 60s . There had been occasional records of vagrants at the Northern Mariana Islands prior to 1985 . It is unknown how much mixing there was between these populations historically . Some theorise that populations existed independently , for example that the Okinawan population were isolated members derived from the migration of a Philippine subspecies . Others postulate that the populations formed part of a super @-@ population where migration between Ryukyu , Taiwan , and the Philippines was common . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 Australia is home to the largest population , stretching from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland . The population of Shark Bay is thought to be stable with over 10 @,@ 000 dugongs . Smaller populations exist up the coast , including one in Ashmore reef . Large numbers of dugongs live to the north of the Northern Territory , with a population of over 20 @,@ 000 in the gulf of Carpentaria alone . A population of over 25 @,@ 000 exists in the Torres Strait such as off Thursday Island , although there is significant migration between the strait and the waters of New Guinea . The Great Barrier Reef provides important feeding areas for the species ; this reef area houses a stable population of around 10 @,@ 000 , although the population concentration has shifted over time . Large bays facing north on the Queensland coast provide significant habitats for dugong , with the southernmost of these being Hervey Bay and Moreton Bay . 
 = = = Extinct Mediterranean population = = = 
 It has been confirmed that dugongs once inhabited the water of the Mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilizations along the inland sea . This population possibly shared ancestry with the Red Sea population , and the Mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factors and climate changes . The Mediterranean is the region where the Dugongidae originated in the mid @-@ late Eocene , along with Caribbean Sea . 
 = = Ecology and life history = = 
 Dugongs are long lived , and the oldest recorded specimen reached age 73 . They have few natural predators , although animals such as crocodiles , killer whales , and sharks pose a threat to the young , and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb . A large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs . Detected pathogens include helminths , <unk> , different types of bacterial infections , and other unidentified parasites . 30 % of dugong deaths in Queensland since 1996 are thought to be because of disease . 
 Although they are social animals , they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations . Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen , but they last only for a short time . Because they are shy , and do not approach humans , little is known about dugong behaviour . They can go six minutes without breathing ( though about two and a half minutes is more typical ) , and have been known to rest on their tail to breathe with their heads above water . They can dive to a maximum depth of 39 metres ( 128 ft ) ; they spend most of their lives no deeper than 10 metres ( 33 ft ) . Communication between individuals is through chirps , whistles , barks , and other sounds that echo underwater . Different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies , implying different purposes . Visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight , and is mainly used for activities such as lekking for courtship purposes . Mothers and calves are in almost constant physical contact , and calves have been known to reach out and touch their mothers with their flippers for reassurance . 
 Dugongs are semi @-@ nomadic , often travelling long distances in search of food , but staying within a certain range their entire life . Large numbers often move together from one area to another . It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability . Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels . Dugong movements mostly occur within a localised area of seagrass beds , and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement . Daily movement is affected by the tides . In areas where there is a large tidal range , dugongs travel with the tide in order to access shallower feeding areas . In Moreton Bay , dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters . At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter . Occasionally individual dugongs make long @-@ distance travels over many days , and can travel over deep ocean waters . One animal was seen as far south as Sydney . Although they are marine creatures , dugongs have been known to travel up creeks , and in one case a dugong was caught 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) up a creek near Cooktown . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Dugongs , along with other sirenians , are referred to as " sea cows " because their diet consists mainly of sea @-@ grass . When eating they ingest the whole plant , including the roots , although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves . A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents , and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce . Although almost completely herbivorous , they will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish , sea squirts , and shellfish . Dugongs in Moreton Bay , Australia , are omnivorous , feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases . In other southern areas of both western and eastern Australia , there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates . This does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas , in which faecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eaten . 
 Most dugongs do not feed from lush areas , but where the seagrass is more sparse . Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed . The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass is important , and the grass species most often eaten are low in fibre , high in nitrogen , and easily digestible . In the Great Barrier Reef , dugongs feed on low @-@ fibre high @-@ nitrogen seagrass such as Halophila and <unk> , so as to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating . Seagrasses of a lower seral are preferred , where the area has not fully vegetated . Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption , due to the dugong 's highly specialised diet . There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels . Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass . Feeding trails have been observed as deep as 33 metres ( 108 ft ) , and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as 37 metres ( 121 ft ) . Dugongs are relatively slow moving , swimming at around 10 kilometres per hour ( 6 @.@ 2 mph ) . When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins . 
 Due to their poor eyesight , dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants . They also have a strong tactile sense , and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles . They will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it . They have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them . The flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants . This leaves furrows in the sand in their path . 
 = = = Reproduction and parental care = = = 
 A dugong reaches sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen , older than in most other mammals . The way that females know how a male has reached sexual maturity is by the eruption of tusks in the male since tusks erupt in males when testosterone levels reach a high enough level . The age when a female first gives birth is disputed , with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years , while others place it as early as six years . There is evidence that male dugongs lose fertility at older ages . Despite the longevity of the dugong , which may live for 50 years or more , females give birth only a few times during their life , and invest considerable parental care in their young . The time between births is unclear , with estimates ranging from 2 @.@ 4 to 7 years . 
 Mating behaviour varies between populations located in different areas . In some populations , males will establish a territory which females in heat will visit . In these areas a male will try to impress the females while defending the area from other males , a practice known as lekking . In other areas many males will attempt to mate with the same female , sometimes inflicting injuries to the female or each other . During this the female will have copulated with multiple males , who will have fought to mount her from below . This greatly increases the chances of conception . 
 Females give birth after a 13 – 15 month gestation , usually to just one calf . Birth occurs in very shallow water , with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore . As soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath . Newborns are already 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 4 ft ) long and weigh around 30 kilograms ( 66 lb ) . Once born , they stay close to their mothers , possibly to make swimming easier . The calf nurses for 14 – 18 months , although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth . A calf will only leave its mother once it has matured . 
 = = Importance to humans = = 
 Dugongs have historically provided easy targets for hunters , who killed them for their meat , oil , skin , and bones . As the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn has noted , they are often considered as the inspiration for mermaids , and people around the world developed cultures around dugong hunting . In some areas it remains an animal of great significance , and a growing ecotourism industry around dugongs has had economic benefit in some countries . 
 There is a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old wall painting of a dugong , apparently drawn by neolithic peoples , in <unk> Cave , Ipoh , Malaysia . This was discovered by Lieutenant <unk> Rawlings in 1959 while on a routine patrol . During the Renaissance and the Baroque eras , dugongs were often exhibited in <unk> . They were also presented as Fiji mermaids in sideshows . 
 Dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable foods of Australian aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders . Some aborigines regard dugongs as part of their <unk> . Dugongs have also played a role in legends in Kenya , and the animal is known there as the " Queen of the Sea " . Body parts are used as food , medicine , and decorations . In the Gulf states , dugongs served not only as a source of food , but their tusks were used as sword handles . Dugong oil is important as a preservative and conditioner for wooden boats to people in around the Gulf of Kutch in India , who also believe its meat is an aphrodisiac . Dugong ribs were used to make carvings in Japan . In Southern China dugongs were traditionally regarded as a " miraculous fish " , and it was bad luck to catch them . A wave of immigration beginning at the end of the 1950s resulted in dugongs being hunted for food . In the Philippines dugongs are thought to bring bad luck , and parts of them are used to ward against evil spirits . In areas of Thailand it is believed that the dugong 's tears form a powerful love potion , while in parts of Indonesia they are considered reincarnations of women . In Papua New Guinea they are seen as a symbol of strength . 
 Dugongs ' or sea cows ' hides have been thought to have been used as coverings in the building of the Old Testament portable worship tent known as the Tabernacle . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Dugong numbers have decreased in recent times . For a population to remain stable , 95 per cent of adults must survive the span of one year . The estimated percentage of females humans can kill without depleting the population is 1 – 2 % . This number is reduced in areas where calving is minimal due to food shortages . Even in the best conditions a population is unlikely to increase more than 5 % a year , leaving dugongs vulnerable to over @-@ exploitation . The fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity . Research on dugongs and the effects of human activity on them has been limited , mostly taking place in Australia . In many countries , dugong numbers have never been surveyed . As such , trends are uncertain , with more data needed for comprehensive management . The only data stretching back far enough to mention population trends comes from the urban coast of Queensland , Australia . The last major worldwide study , made in 2002 , concluded that the dugong was declining and possibly extinct in a third of its range , with unknown status in another half . 
 The IUCN Red List lists the dugong as vulnerable , and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulates and in some areas has banned international trade . Regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal , and in 1998 there was strong support for Southeast Asian cooperation to protect dugongs . Kenya has passed legislation banning the hunting of dugongs and restricting trawling , but the dugong is not yet listed under Kenya 's Wildlife Act for endangered species . Mozambique has had legislation to protect dugongs since 1955 , but this has not been effectively enforced . Many marine parks have been established on the African coast of the Red Sea , and the Egyptian Gulf of Aqaba is fully protected . The United Arab Emirates has banned all hunting of dugongs within its waters , as has Bahrain . The UAE has additionally banned drift net fishing . India and Sri Lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugongs and their products . Japan has listed dugongs as endangered and has banned intentional kills and harassment . Hunting , catching , and harassment is banned by the People 's Republic of China . The first marine mammal to be protected in the Philippines was the dugong , although monitoring this is difficult . Palau has legislated to protect dugongs , although this is not well enforced and poaching persists . The dugong is a national animal of Papua New Guinea , which bans all except traditional hunting . Vanuatu and New Caledonia ban hunting of dugongs . Dugongs are protected throughout Australia , although the rules vary by state ; in some areas indigenous hunting is allowed . Dugongs are listed under the Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable . Most currently live in established marine parks , where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted . 
 In Vietnam , an illegal network targeting dugongs had been detected and was shut down in 2012 . 
 = = = Human activity = = = 
 Despite being legally protected in many countries , the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include hunting , habitat degradation , and fishing @-@ related fatalities . Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths , although there are no precise statistics . Most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low , with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters . As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period , they are highly prone to deaths due to entanglement . The use of shark nets has historically caused large numbers of deaths , and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks . Hunting has historically been a problem too , although in most areas they are no longer hunted , with the exception of certain indigenous communities . In areas such as northern Australia , hunting remains the greatest impact on the dugong population . 
 Vessel strikes have proved a problem for manatees , but the relevance of this to dugongs is unknown . Increasing boat traffic has increased danger , especially in shallow waters . Ecotourism has increased in some countries , although effects remain undocumented . It has been seen to cause issues in areas such as Hainan due to environmental degradation . Modern farming practise and increased land clearing have also had an impact , and much of the coastline of dugong habitats is undergoing industrialisation , with increasing human populations . Dugongs accumulate heavy metal ions in their tissues throughout their lives , more so than other marine mammals . The effects are unknown . Socio @-@ political needs are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing countries . The shallow waters are often used as a source of food and income , problems exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing . In many countries , legislation does not exist to protect dugongs , and if it does it is not enforced . 
 Oil spills are a danger to dugongs in some areas , as is land reclamation . In Okinawa the small dugong population is threatened by United States military activity . Plans exist to build a military base close to the Henoko reef , and military activity also adds the threats of noise pollution , chemical pollution , soil erosion , and exposure to depleted uranium . The military base plans have been fought in US courts by some Okinawans , whose concerns include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitats . It was later revealed that the government of Japan was hiding evidence of the negative effects of ship lanes and human activities on dugongs observed during surveys carried out off Henoko reef . 
 = = = Environmental degradation = = = 
 If dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young . Food shortages can be caused by many factors , such as a loss of habitat , death and decline in quality of seagrass , and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity . Sewage , detergents , heavy metal , hypersaline water , herbicides , and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows . Human activity such as mining , trawling , dredging , land @-@ reclamation , and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it . This is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrass . 
 One of the dugong 's preferred species of seagrass , Halophila ovalis , declines rapidly due to lack of light , dying completely after 30 days . Extreme weather such as cyclones and floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometres of seagrass meadows , as well as washing dugongs ashore . The recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of seagrass into new areas , or areas where it has been destroyed , can take over a decade . Most measures for protection involve restricting activities such as trawling in areas containing seagrass meadows , with little to no action on pollutants originating from land . In some areas water salinity is increased due to wastewater , and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstand . 
 Dugong habitat in the <unk> bay area of Henoko , Okinawa , Japan , is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by Japanese Government in order to build a US Marine base in the area . In August 2014 , preliminary drilling surveys were conducted around the seagrass beds there . The construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population 's habitat , possibly leading to local extinction . 
 = = = Capture and captivity = = = 
 The Australian state of Queensland has sixteen dugong protection parks , and some preservation zones have been established where even aborigines are not allowed to hunt . Capturing animals for research has caused only one or two deaths ; dugongs are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mothers and calves spend together , and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugongs eat in an aquarium . Only one orphaned calf has ever been successfully kept in captivity . 
 Worldwide , only four dugongs are held in captivity . A female from the Philippines lives at Toba Aquarium in Toba , Mie , Japan . A male also lived there until he died on 10 February 2011 . The second resides in Sea World Indonesia , after having been rescued from a fisherman 's net and treated . The last two , a male and a female , are kept at Sydney Aquarium , where they have resided since they were juveniles . 
 Gracie , a captive dugong at Underwater World , Singapore , was reported to have died in 2014 at the age of 19 , from complications arising from an acute digestive disorder . 
 = Star Trek ( 2013 video game ) = 
 Star Trek is a third @-@ person action @-@ adventure Star Trek video game . It was developed by Digital Extremes and co @-@ published by Namco Bandai Games and Paramount Pictures in association with CBS Studios International . The game was first released in the United States on April 23 , 2013 , for PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Microsoft Windows platforms . It took three years to produce , and was the first in @-@ house video game development by Paramount Studios , who opted not to license development to a third party . The production team aimed for it to be a collaboration with those working on the Star Trek films to avoid the typical pitfalls associated with film tie @-@ in video games . Video games which influenced Star Trek included the Mass Effect series , Uncharted and Metroid Prime , and certain elements of Star Trek reflected episodes of Star Trek : The Original Series such as " Arena " and " Amok Time " . 
 The game is set in the Star Trek universe , between the events of the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness , and follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise . The player takes control of either Kirk or first officer Spock , and investigates the theft of a terraforming device from the colony of New Vulcan by the Gorn . Together , Kirk and Spock engage the Gorn on away missions , travel to another universe and re @-@ take Enterprise when it is captured by alien forces . This two @-@ character gameplay was seen as a unique element , referred to as " bro @-@ op " . 
 The Gorn , who previously appeared in The Original Series and Star Trek : Enterprise , were heavily redesigned , with fifteen different classes of creatures created . A replica of the Gorn costume from " Arena " appeared in a viral advertisement alongside William Shatner , which was intended as a homage to the fight between Kirk and the Gorn from that episode . The game was first launched at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 , but was panned by critics upon launch in 2013 and sales were poor . Following an issue with the co @-@ operative mode on the PC upon launch , reviewers also criticised a number of issues such as poor lip syncing , clipping and bad camera angles . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Star Trek is a single @-@ player third person shooter action game with cooperative gameplay elements , which allow two players to control Kirk and Spock . When playing in the single @-@ player mode , Kirk and Spock have different paths through the missions in order to encourage re @-@ playability . The game does not allow players to switch between Kirk and Spock during a chapter , although this ability was included in preview versions of the game shown to reviewers prior to launch . It also does not allow for fellow players to " drop @-@ in " to play alongside co @-@ operatively . In a similar manner to the Gears of War series , the game includes a cover system , which protects the player characters from enemy fire . 
 The two characters show different gameplay techniques , with Kirk being the more typical shooter while Spock has stealth techniques and can use the Vulcan nerve pinch and mind meld . Each character is equipped with weapons to reflect their gameplay style , with Kirk armed with a phaser equipped with a stun setting , while Spock 's weapon is quieter to reflect his stealthier style of play and freezes enemies instead . As players progress through the game , they gain experience allowing them to unlock additional settings for those weapons . In addition to the weapons , the player characters are also equipped with <unk> , which are used to interact with the environment and progress plot points . 
 During the course of the game , players have to fight their way across a number of environments . The first mission sees Kirk and Spock land on the planet New Vulcan ; a colony created by Vulcans following the destruction of their homeworld in the 2009 film . There are further types of gameplay in Star Trek seen in the mini @-@ games that appear throughout , such as those featuring " space dives " as seen in both 2009 's Star Trek and 2013 's Star Trek Into Darkness . Other elements of the game break from the third @-@ person shooter style . These include swimming levels that have Spock and Kirk move past obstacles using a teleportation gun , and levels featuring turret @-@ based shooting on board Enterprise . Climbing and platforming are built into the terrain exploration elements of the main game .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The game takes place within the Star Trek reboot universe , following 2009 's Star Trek film and before Star Trek Into Darkness . It follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk ( voiced by Chris Pine ) and his crew on board the Starfleet starship , the USS Enterprise . The first film showed Kirk becoming Captain of the Enterprise for the first time and the formation of the crew , and so the video game shows one of their early missions . The rebooted universe was developed by director J.J. Abrams along with writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman from the 1960s American television series Star Trek : The Original Series and the six films which followed the crew 's adventures .

 In <unk> , Enterprise receives a distress call from a space station harvesting the power of a binary star . There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard , so Kirk and Spock ( voiced by Zachary Quinto ) take a shuttle to rescue the crew . They encounter T 'Mar , a childhood friend of Spock , who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device , which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan ; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space . <unk> to New Vulcan , Kirk and Spock meet with T 'Mar 's father Surok , who explains the station 's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures — who call themselves the Gorn — from the rip . The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus that makes them aggressive . Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors , but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok . 
 Kirk opts to take the infected to a nearby starbase instead of pursuing the Gorn Commander 's ship through the Rip . At the starbase , Kirk , Spock , and T 'Mar meet with the Commodore Daniels , who implies he gave T 'Mar the specifications for the device as he knew it would create a wormhole . Suddenly , the Gorn attack the starbase and kidnap T 'Mar . Just as he is about to be beamed back aboard Enterprise , Spock tackles the Gorn Henchman , bringing him aboard the ship . Kirk and Spock pursue him to the <unk> before he can commandeer a shuttle . Spock <unk> with the Henchman , learning Surok was killed after confessing he has no insight into the device , but that his daughter would . Kirk has the Henchman imprisoned . 
 Kirk resolves to enter the Rip . After Enterprise enters the Gorn 's galaxy , Kirk and Spock take a shuttle with Sulu ( voiced by John Cho ) and Dr. McCoy ( Karl Urban ) to a nearby planet . When their shuttle is shot down , Kirk and Spock use <unk> to glide to a Gorn outpost and blow it up before infiltrating a base to rescue T 'Mar . They find Daniels , who is killed in an ensuing firefight . The Gorn bring Kirk and Spock to the Commander , who has them taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death . Angered by their besting of his champion , the Commander has Spock infected with the virus and pits him against Kirk . Sulu 's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with an antidote , while the Commander flees to his ship with T 'Mar and the device . 
 The shuttle returns to Enterprise , which has been taken over by the Gorn . Kirk and Spock space dive to engineering and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board . They help Scotty ( voiced by Simon Pegg ) and <unk> reactivate the warp core , and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal . The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura ( voiced by Zoe Saldana ) hostage , demanding Kirk give them control of the ship . Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view @-@ screen , decompressing the Gorn into space . With only an hour before the Rip closes , Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander 's ship , where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance , and enter the core where T 'Mar and the device are being held . Kirk and Spock destroy the device , defeat the Commander , and are beamed back to Enterprise with T 'Mar . Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes ; in their closing logs , Kirk and Spock state T 'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan , and that they have been ordered to Nibiru .

 Production of Star Trek began three years before release under Tom Lesinski at Paramount Digital Entertainment . <unk> had a background in video game production , having previously worked at companies such as Crystal Dynamics , Ion Storm and Kuju Entertainment . He made the decision to produce a game in @-@ house , rather than licensing it out to a third party as had previously been the case under the previous ten @-@ year Activision contract . As a result , the game was the first ever to be produced and released by Paramount Studios directly . 
 Lesinski was terminated by Paramount in September 2011 and the project was passed to Brian Miller , Vice President of Paramount Digital Entertainment . Miller later explained that he wanted the production to avoid the mistakes typically made in movie tie @-@ in games involved a lack of time devoted to the production , and excluding the people working on the film from work on the game . Miller hoped that they had rectified these issues with Star Trek , and explained that they hadn 't produced a similar game to tie @-@ in with 2009 's Star Trek film because it would have suffered from those problems . He also expressed disappointment at the quality of previous in @-@ universe games and wanted the new Star Trek to be " a triple @-@ A game " and something that the franchise deserved . 
 The idea for the game came out of a brainstorming session in which it was decided that the game should allow the gamer to play as Kirk and Spock , and therefore should featuring co @-@ op style game @-@ play . During his E3 pitch , Steve Sinclair described the game 's genre as " bro @-@ op " . It was created by Digital Extremes , who had previously created video games such as Unreal and BioShock . The Evolution graphics engine was used for Star Trek , having previously been used for Dark Sector and The Darkness II . 
 The plot of the game was written by Marianne Krawczyk , who had previously worked on games such as God of War and Shank . She developed the plot in conjunction with the producers of the film , Alex Kurtzman and Bob Orci , as well as writer Damon Lindelof . In an interview in 2011 , Orci explained that the storyline of the game was designed to be canon for the new Star Trek universe . He clarified in 2013 that it was " as close to canon as any Star Trek game will ever come " as the mission described by the game could have taken place between 2009 's Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness . Concept design work for the game was created by artist Fernando Acosta . 
 While developing the game , the production team sought to use elements of other games as influences on how to create a Star Trek based game that was along the same lines as the 2009 film . Digital Extremes creative director Sheldon Carter described this as " It 's like someone spliced Metroid Prime into my Uncharted " . Miller explained that it was due to the success of the Mass Effect series of games that allowed for space @-@ based adventure games such as Star Trek to be made , although they were not seeking to include the role @-@ playing game elements seen in that series . Miller explained that there was a " circular influence " with each franchise influenced by the other . Further influences were found in The Original Series , as one level which pits Spock against Kirk was inspired by a similar scene in the episode " Amok Time " , originally broadcast on television just under 457 years before the launch of the game . While it was intended to be a cross platform launch , the producers decided not to incorporate hands free gaming using either Kinect or the PlayStation Move . 
 = = = The Gorn = = = 
 It was decided early on in the development to include the Gorn as the main enemies in the new game . At the same time , J.J. Abrams had joked that he was planning to include the aliens in his second Star Trek film . They had previously been seen in The Original Series episode " Arena " and the Star Trek : Enterprise episode " In A Mirror , Darkly " , and the producers saw the game as an opportunity to redevelop the lizard race including the addition of fifteen different classes / species . 
 The official Star Trek website previewed several of these new types of Gorn , releasing information on a " Gorn Day " each week . The first to be featured were the Gorn Commander and the Sentinel class . These were described as the elite of the Gorn , with only one Commander appearing in the game , while the Sentinels were slightly shorter versions of the same type of Gorn , armed with different weapons . The Gorn Henchman is one of the main antagonists , and reports directly to the Commander . He first appears on the New Vulcan level , and is one of the Gorn along with the Scout class that can hide their appearance . 
 The Gorn champion in the arena sequence was based on the Gorn Captain seen in " Arena " . This particular character was intended to be different to all others , and thought to be " abnormal " compared to other members of his race . Other elements of the version of the Gorn seen in The Original Series , such as the eye design , were including in the class known as <unk> . However the Rusher class are different to other types of Gorn seen in the game , as they are quadrupeds and unarmed with the exception of their claws and teeth . Similar to <unk> , <unk> are also unarmed , but they are more heavily armoured and have the ability to destroy obstacles that supply cover for the player . 
 The more typical soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates , Warriors and Guardians . The former are the basic troops of the Gorn forces , and while they can run on four legs , they fight on two with an automatic rifle called the Ravager . The Warriors are more advanced , and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor . The Guardian type differs in that it is a melee type , armed with a large energy axe . However , the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well . They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only . Of these fifteen classes , three were created to appear female .

 Paramount secured the likeness rights of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in the summer of 2011 for an upcoming game based on the universe of the film Star Trek ( 2009 ) . It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair , and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting of the rest of the main cast from the film had been secured . Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances . Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio , and said that " it was nice to be able to play the character and not have to do all this physical stuff " . 
 The game was scored by Chad Seiter , who had previously worked with Michael Giacchino , the composer for the music in the 2009 film and Star Trek Into Darkness . The duo had worked together on the Star Trek film , with Seiter being one of Giacchino 's additional orchestrators . For the video game , Seiter used Digital Performer , a Digital Audio Workstation / Sequencer software package published by Mark of the Unicorn . The game also featured music from Giacchino 's score for the 2009 film .

 Upon the game 's release , there was an issue with the co @-@ operative mode on the PC . Reviewers were sent a Steam download code to play the game while waiting for their console versions to arrive in the mail and upon attempting to launch the co @-@ op mode , players were given the error message " Could not join . The game session is no longer available . " However , this affected a number of gamers playing via Steam on the PC , resulting in a statement being issued by the official Twitter account for the game and an email being sent to customers , stating the company was looking into the problems . At the same time , players of Dead Island : Riptide were having similar issues on Steam . 
 Following enquiries by the media , Paramount and Namco released a joint statement explaining that it was an issue with the Steam system , and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly . While others stated issues with co @-@ op gameplay on the PS3 , the companies stated that they were not aware of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter . After the PC issue was rectified , a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay . A day after the co @-@ op issues with Star Trek were resolved , the Dead Island : Riptide problems were also corrected , with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games .

 The game made its debut at the 2012 E3 convention in 2011 , where it was revealed that the Gorn would be the game 's antagonists . Reviewers viewed a twenty @-@ minute excerpt of footage from the game in 3D and with surround sound . The game was scheduled for release three weeks before Into Darkness premiered in theaters on May 17 , 2013 . Brian Miller was heavily involved in promoting the game , and regularly featured in interviews with websites and magazines . Following E3 there were concerns from fans that the game would be a straight forward shooter in the Star Trek universe , Miller said , " You will have elements of a shooter . You 'll have elements of exploration , and adventure , and discovery . That is what the new Star Trek is about . " 
 An in @-@ browser flash social strategy game entitled Star Trek : New Vulcan Reborn was made by <unk> to promote the game . It was set on New Vulcan with the player helping to develop the planet by " building landing pads , founding water treatment centres , establishing mining rigs and more . " An IGN competition took place where players with the most points could win prizes . The game is no longer available to play .

 The first trailer for the game made its début at the Namco Bandai Global Gamer Day in Las Vegas in April 2012 and showed gameplay footage in 3D . In order to promote the new video game in 2013 , a trailer was produced which featured William Shatner and a man in a Gorn suit playing it on a console . The idea had come from an idea by Brian Miller and Gene Augusto , who initially went back and forth on the idea in an attempt to create something that would go viral . They joked about using the line " not your father 's Star Trek " , and sought to recreate the fight between Shatner and the Gorn from the episode " Arena " . 
 The trailer featured Shatner using some classic Kirk fighting moves , including a judo chop and an ear clap , and in a homage to the original it had the Gorn throw couch cushions rather than the polystyrene rocks in the original episode . The Gorn outfit worn by a stuntman was a replica of the original , which had mostly been destroyed with the exception of the head , which was sold at auction in 2006 .

 Star Trek was released in the United States on April 23 , 2013 , and three days later in Europe . This release was designed to coincide with the theatrical launch of the latest Star Trek film , Star Trek Into Darkness . The game sold poorly ; after three weeks on sale , 140 @,@ 000 copies had been sold across all platforms . It failed to reach the top 100 best video games list of 2013 . Critics described it as a flop . It is now considered to be one of the worst video games of all time . 
 Star Trek received mostly negative reviews . The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 edition of the game a score of 42 percent , the PC edition 43 percent , and the PS3 version was given a score of 45 percent . Fellow aggregator website Game Rankings gave Star Trek on PS3 an average score of 48 @.@ 57 percent , while the Xbox 360 edition had an average of 43 @.@ 69 percent and the PC version had 37 @.@ 27 percent . 
 Dan Stapleton for IGN described it as " a barely serviceable , paint @-@ by @-@ numbers third @-@ person shooter " . He wrote that both playable characters were too similar , the combat was " completely generic " and that errors in the animation looked clumsy with " objects clipping through each other ; crazy , badly lip @-@ synced dialog ( not that syncing it with this corny writing would fix it ) ; and general <unk> make Star Trek play like a blooper reel . " Stapleton was surprised that the game continued to be playable , as he noted that several scripted events during the game failed to start as scheduled . He also felt that the mini @-@ games throughout the game were " so mind @-@ numbingly simple and repetitive and / or frustrating they made me eager to get back to just being bored . " He said that the game seemed unfinished , and gave it an overall score of 4 @.@ 2 out of ten . Edge magazine said that the game " more bugs crawling on it than a Fear Factor contestant " , and mentioned issues such as the characters running through walls , enemies becoming immortal and camera angles showing the inside of Kirk or Spock 's skull . Star Trek was otherwise described as bland , even running through to the achievements with boring titles and the co @-@ op system " succumbs to awkward banter and gimmicky co @-@ op puzzles " . 
 Mark Walton , while writing for GameSpot , thought that the general idea for the game was good , but that the gameplay was " tiresome " and failed to excite . He said that the animation was " woefully bad " , and there were several bugs such as the cover taking mechanism failing to work on several occasions . An attempt to bring variety to the game through minigames was seen as " a poor mishmash of those from other games " , and compared those sections to other games such as Portal and the Uncharted series . Walton explained that the game made " small wins " by including the voice acting from the same cast as the movie , but said that there were " too many glaring problems " with the game to find something to like . He gave it a score of 3 @.@ 5 out of ten for the version on PC . 
 Star Trek Into Darkness director J.J. Abrams stated in September 2013 that he was hurt by the game 's poor reception and quality , saying that it was " obviously a big disappointment " . He also claimed it hurt Star Trek Into Darkness by being released shortly before the film . Later , in November 2013 , Digital Extremes creative director Stephen Sinclair said to IGN that he was " kind of surprised [ ... ] to see one of the most awesome , popular and successful film directors working today slagging on that project " . Video game insiders linked the poor reception of the game to the departure of Brian Miller in his role as the Senior Vice President of Paramount , as he had been heavily involved in the marketing for the game . Insiders had specifically attributed issues with the game to the " ego " of both Miller and his predecessor Lesinski , " insisted this hallowed and cherished franchise was a key brand extension in the gaming vertical only to be compromised by disastrous results and reviews " .

 Can 't Be Tamed is the third studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus . It was released on June 18 , 2010 , by Hollywood Records ; it would become her final album with the label after signing with RCA Records in 2013 . Cyrus wrote the project in 2009 , while travelling internationally for her Wonder World Tour , and recorded it in 2010 . Described by Cyrus as a " good [ record ] to blast in your car " , Can 't Be Tamed represents a musical departure from her earlier work , which she had grown to feel uninspired by . As executive producers , Tish Cyrus and Jason Morey enlisted partners including Devrim Karaoglu , Marek Pompetzki , Rock Mafia , and John Shanks to achieve Cyrus ' desired new sound . Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance @-@ pop record , which Cyrus ' record label acknowledged differed from the original plans for the project . Its lyrical themes revolve largely around breaking free of constraints and expectations , which are largely mentioned in the context of romantic relationships . 
 Upon its release , Can 't Be Tamed received generally mixed reviews from music critics , who were ambivalent towards perceived lack of musical focus and a failure to fully establish Cyrus ' maturing public image ; additional criticism was placed on her vocals sounding over @-@ processed and lacking emotional depth . It debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first @-@ week sales of 100 @,@ 000 copies . It is Cyrus ' lowest @-@ peaking and lowest @-@ selling record in the United States . The album has sold 350 @,@ 000 copies in the country . Can 't Be Tamed charted moderately on record charts in internationally , reaching the top @-@ ten in countries including Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom . 
 Two singles were released from Can 't Be Tamed . Its title track " Can 't Be Tamed " was released on May 14 , 2010 , and peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 , and performed moderately worldwide . Follow @-@ up single " Who Owns My Heart " was released October 22 , 2010 and was only released in selected European countries , failing to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting poorly on European singles chart . Promotional efforts for Can 't Be Tamed began to associate Cyrus with an increasingly provocative image , an effort continued with her fourth studio album Bangerz ( 2013 ) . The record was primarily promoted through a series of television appearances and Cyrus ' headlining Gypsy Heart Tour in 2011 . Can 't Be Tamed is Cyrus first album to not be certified platinum in the US .

 In December 2009 , Cyrus announced that she had begun planning her third studio album and intended to begin a musical hiatus after its completion . She expressed concerns that her newer material " doesn 't truly inspire me " and worried that should would be " blending in with everyone else " , although she later commented that the final product was inspired by techno music qualities commonly used by recording artist Lady Gaga . Abby Konowitch from Cyrus ' label Hollywood Records admitted that the record drew more inspiration from dance @-@ pop music than she originally intended , but maintained that it " feels very comfortable for her , and it feels very comfortable in terms of the state of contemporary music . " 
 The majority of Can 't Be Tamed was recorded abroad during Cyrus ' her headlining Wonder World Tour in 2009 and 2010 . She collaborated with John Shanks during its production ; he frequently traveled to London for Cyrus ' recording sessions , and returned to Los Angeles to finalize their material . Cyrus also collaborated with the production team Rock Mafia , consisting of Antonina Armato and Tim James ; they notably produced her earlier singles " See You Again " and " 7 Things " from her first and second studio albums Meet Miley Cyrus ( 2007 ) and Breakout ( 2008 ) , respectively . Cyrus stated that Can 't Be Tamed contained a variety of dance beats and synths , but believed that its sound was secondary to the personal lyrics therein .

 In February 2010 , Cyrus announced that her then @-@ untitled third studio album would be released later that summer , which she felt was appropriate because it is " good to blast in your car . " Later that April , it was announced that the record would be titled Can 't Be Tamed , and would be released on June 22 , 2010 in the United States . Consequently , it became the first project from Hollywood Records to be released under the " day @-@ and @-@ date " format , which allowed the project to be released nearly simultaneously worldwide instead of traditionally " staggering " its launch to accommodate " the availability of the artist " internationally . On May 7 , Cyrus unveiled the album artwork through her website ; it depicts Cyrus dressed in a leather jacket , pants , and midriff @-@ baring shirt while standing against a black @-@ and @-@ white background . It was noted for establishing an increasingly provocative public image for Cyrus ; her stylist Simone <unk> stated that it was inspired by singer Joan Jett and the band Blondie , and was " basically a strong statement saying in the most simple way , that she can ’ t be tamed – literally and metaphorically . " A deluxe version of the record was simultaneously released , which included the audio disc packaged with the standard version in addition to a bonus DVD that includes previously unseen footage from Cyrus ' performance at The O2 Arena during the Wonder World Tour .

 Can 't Be Tamed is primarily a dance @-@ pop record ; it contains " several bass @-@ heavy , slickly produced dance numbers " that Ann Donahue from Billboard joked " thunder in such a catchy , accessible way that it may make Kesha down another bottle of Jack out of envy . " Its opening track " Liberty Walk " describes an individual who leaves a harmful relationship , which Cyrus felt leaned towards more meaningful lyrical content instead of the " super shallow " current mainstream music . " Who Owns My Heart " details the excitement in possibly finding a lover at a nightclub , while Cyrus herself commented that the title track " Can 't Be Tamed " bears a theme of " breaking out and feeling free . " It is followed by a cover version of " Every Rose Has Its Thorn " , originally performed by the band Poison for their second studio album Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) ; she stated that the modern @-@ day music industry " shelters kids [ from ] songs as honest and real as this one " , and added that a consultation with the band 's lead singer Bret Michaels helped her to incorporate her " own flare and edge " . 
 " Two More Lonely People " was described by Evan Sawdey of PopMatters as " one moment of carefree dance @-@ pop joy " that was reminiscent of material from her earlier Hannah Montana soundtracks ; he also stated that the lyrics delivered in " Forgiveness and Love " were among the " more over @-@ the @-@ top cutesy moments " throughout the record , specifically commenting that the lines " The only thing that / Our hearts are made of / Are the acts of forgiveness and love " were " so unbelievably saccharine that Hallmark would ultimately have to turn them down " . Robert Ham from Christianity Today felt that " Permanent December " discussed the story of " the devoted girlfriend pushing aside the ' sexy boys ' vying for her affections " , while " Stay " addressed the difficulties in maintaining a long @-@ distance relationship . 
 Writing for AllMusic , Heather Phares noted that " Scars " exemplified Cyrus ' equating of " grown @-@ up with joyless " , adding that the track fails to find the " emotional depth " Cyrus was likely intending . She also described " Take Me Along " as one of the more " overwrought ballads " where Cyrus ' delivery seemed more comfortable than others on the record . Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that " Robot " highlighted the theme of defiance and rebellion seen throughout Can 't Be Tamed , specifically noting the lyrics " Stand here , sell this , and hit your mark / I would scream but I 'm just this hollow shell " . The record closes with the twelfth track " My Heart Beats for Love " , which according to Ham , describes " the more universal ideal of love for all " ; Greenblatt also recognized the integration of organ instrumentation .

 Hollywood Records focused on television appearances when further promoting Can 't Be Tamed , which they expected would accommodate Cyrus ' schedule more effectively than traditional interviews with the press and radio stations . She first performed " Can 't Be Tamed " on May 18 , 2010 during the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars in the United States .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , Can 't Be Tamed received an average score of 48 , which indicates " mixed or average reviews " , based on nine reviews . Heather Phares from AllMusic shared a similar sentiment in regards to its production , suggesting that the excessive use of Auto @-@ Tune limited Cyrus ' ability to express genuine emotion , adding that several tracks were similar to " Tik Tok " by Kesha " minus that song 's mindless fun " . A writer for Billboard also noted Cyrus ' a lack of emotion in Cyrus ' vocals , but considered the " delightfully robo @-@ country " cover version of " Every Rose Has Its Thorn " as the standout track from the record . 
 Writing for The Boston Globe , James Reed questioned the need to " tame " Cyrus , given that " this stuff is already pretty innocuous " . However , he acknowledged that Can 't Be Tamed contained " the catchiest Top 40 hits money can buy . " Referencing the lyrics in " Every Rose Has Its Thorn " , Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that Cyrus was " just not ( yet ) that thorny a girl " despite visible efforts of rebellion . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian thought that Cyrus lost sight of her target audience with the project , noting that " if you 're old enough to stay up after 9 : 00 PM without asking permission , it 's not intended for you " while also commenting that children that may be interested in the record had likely " transferred their affections " to the then @-@ teenage Justin Bieber . Writing for Rolling Stone , Rob Sheffield opined that the production used throughout Can 't Be Tamed felt too generic for its goal of rebellion . 
 Theon Weber of The Village Voice felt that Cyrus ' attempts of maturity were too similar to those of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears in their earlier years , and commented that the album itself was " sadly wan " . Evan Sawdey from PopMatters shared the same concern , additionally noting the irony that Cyrus ' first project after Hannah Montana was released through the Disney @-@ owned Hollywood Records . Elysa Gardner from USA Today opined that Cyrus had successfully " made the full leap from tween queen to pop tart " with the music video for " Can 't Be Tamed " , but failed to maintain this image with " generic , anonymous tunes " on the parent album .

 Axe to Fall is the seventh studio album released by American metalcore band Converge . It was released on October 20 , 2009 , through Epitaph Records and was released later on in the year through <unk> Inc. as a vinyl record . It is their second most commercially successful to date , peaking at number 74 in the Billboard 200 . The album was produced by guitarist Kurt Ballou , who previously produced Converge 's Jane Doe ( 2001 ) , You Fail Me ( 2004 ) and No Heroes ( 2006 ) , and features artwork created by lead singer Jacob Bannon . Axe to Fall is a collaborative album , which features a large number of guest musicians , including members from Cave In , Neurosis and The Red Chord among others . 
 Axe to Fall was met with widespread critical acclaim . It has been referred to as the band 's most accessible album to date , and was compared with Converge 's widely lauded Jane Doe . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Converge began writing Axe to Fall in November 2008 . With Jacob Bannon , Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within a half a mile of each other in Boston , and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn , Converge could easily practice for weeks at a time . Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton , all members had equal input on the writing process , with each member proposing different songs . Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall , but were scrapped because they were slower than the rest of the songs , and did not fit the energy of the album . 
 Following a short tour in March 2009 with Ceremony , Coliseum , Pulling Teeth , Rise and Fall , Converge entered the studio to begin recording in May 2009 . During this short tour , the band debuted a few new songs live , and footage could be seen online . The album was self @-@ produced by Converge 's guitar player , Kurt Ballou , in his own GodCity Studios located in Massachusetts . Ballou has produced and co @-@ produced several Converge albums , including 2001 's Jane Doe , 2004 's You Fail Me and 2006 's No Heroes . He has also produced a number of independent metal and hardcore bands , including Genghis Tron 's Board Up the House , <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> 's Live the Storm . Ballou has a degree in aerospace engineering , and prior to devoting his time and effort with Converge , he worked at a biomedical firm for six years . The money he received from his severance package was used to fund and create his home studio . His experiences and knowledge in engineering carry over to his recording work . In regards to Ballou 's technical precision as a producer Bannon has stated , " nothing gets by him — it is inspiring to watch him work . " Throughout the recording process , the band updated their fans via Twitter of their progress in the studio . 
 = = = Guest collaboration = = = 
 While creating Axe to Fall , Converge tried to challenge themselves creatively as artists . Ballou stated that with each new Converge album , he " always [ wants ] to create a new listening experience " and continued with the concept of " pushing [ themselves ] forward and not repeating [ themselves ] . " Lead singer Jacob Bannon stated , " We appreciate our past albums , but we 're very much about forward movement and challenging ourselves musically and expressing ourselves emotionally . " Bannon has stated that he felt that the main artistic difference between Axe to Fall and previous albums was the large number of guest musicians included on the record . Axe to Fall features various members from Cave In , Neurosis , and Genghis Tron among others . Most of the guest musicians already had an existing relationship with one or more band members of Converge prior to recording , or the band had " admired in some way . " Converge had previously thought of the idea of creating a collaborative album with many guest artists for a number of years , but the band felt that the " time to execute it [ had ] never been there . " Bannon has stated that working with a number of different artists was difficult and something the band was not used to , however the finished product was " an extremely focused album . " 
 Though writing did not officially begin until November 2008 , work on some songs from Axe to Fall began four to five years earlier . In 2004 , Converge collaborated with Cave In and recorded some songs together . The material from these recording sessions , dubbed the " Verge In " sessions , was never released and the project later dissolved . The instrumental parts that Cave In contributed to " Effigy " were from the original recordings in 2004 . Converge took the parts they contributed to the project to create the foundation for what would become " Cruel Bloom " and " Wretched World . " While producing Board Up the House , Ballou gave Genghis Tron a rough mix of " Wretched World " to contribute their talents . According to Ballou , Genghis Tron " embellished it and created a whole new melodic structure on top of the song that we would 've never come up with . " Brad <unk> from The Red Chord also later added his own drum track to " Wretched World " . Much of the song " Plagues " from No Heroes also originated from the Verge In sessions . With the release of Axe to Fall , everything Converge contributed to the sessions has been released in some form .

 In August 2009 , two months prior to the release of Axe to Fall , Converge made the opening track " Dark Horse " available for streaming and as a free download . It can also be found on the soundtrack for the horror movie Saw VI . The song was noted for being one of the few tracks lacking guest musicians , and was also met with a very positive reaction from reviewers . The title track , " Axe to Fall , " was also made available for free download in September 2009 . The entire album was available for streaming one week before the official release date on Converge 's MySpace page . Axe to Fall was released in the US through Epitaph Records on October 20 , 2009 , in digital and CD formats . The vinyl edition of the album was released through Jacob Bannon 's own independent record label , <unk> Inc . , shortly after the release of the CD version .

 On October 4 , 2009 , a digitally watermarked advance copy of Axe to Fall had leaked onto the internet . The watermark was linked to the advance copy given to Shaun Hand , a staff member of the music news and reviews website <unk> Converge posted a number of Twitter messages regarding the leak , one of which read , " Special thanks to Shaun Hand at Metal Sucks for leaking our album , " and another one was posted shortly thereafter directed at MetalSucks ' Twitter account stating , " have fun with that . " The source of an album leak is rarely discovered or publicly announced . Converge 's method of dealing with their album leaking , referred to as " street justice " by Every Time I Die and Jamey Jasta , avoided a costly lawsuit yet still inflicted damages upon MetalSucks by means of viral negative publicity . The staff at MetalSucks issued a formal apology , stating that the leak was completely unintentional and the first incident since the website 's inception . They went on to say :

 The artwork for the cover and liner note booklet of Axe to Fall was designed and created by Jacob Bannon ( who graduated from The Art Institute of Boston ) . The booklet features a different piece of artwork for each song on the album . Bannon tried to create images that " encapsulated some of the emotion of each song " in contrast to more literal imagery , such as avoiding an axe literally falling for the song " Axe to Fall . " He also experimented with a technique where a single image would be repeated within a frame , but the copies would be distressed or slightly different . This could be seen in the cover art where a single image of a woman 's profile was broken down within the repetition , and some of the copies showed the woman 's teeth through her cheek . Bannon stated that for the cover art , he " just wanted to have something that felt timeless and sort of embodied the whole emotional gamut of the record , something that was explosive and powerful but also something that felt poetic and soft at the same time . It could look violent and beautiful at the same time . "

 A music video was directed by Craig Murray for the album 's title track and was released in October 2009 . The short video ( 1 : 40 in duration ) shows a man and a woman strapped to a machine , a television that gives birth to a bio @-@ mechanical creature and several disturbing clips in between . The video features stop motion animation influenced by horror films and has been referred to as " terrifying , " " seizure @-@ inducing , " " nightmarish , " " excruciating " and " gross " by various sources . It was filmed in Ronda , Spain with the intent of making " a film in which we see a cycle . This cycle will study an idea of new creation without pleasure and the art of numbing for progression . " Murray was inspired and influenced by artists Chris Cunningham , Gaspar Noé , Nine Inch Nails and the films Ringu , A Clockwork Orange and Hardware while making the music video . On November 7 , the " Axe to Fall " video debuted on MTV2 's heavy metal music program , Headbangers Ball .

 Converge 's first tour in support of Axe to Fall was the Metalocalypse tour in late 2009 sponsored by Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim . Alongside High on Fire , Converge held an opening slot for co @-@ headliners Mastodon and Dethklok . Axe to Fall was released mid @-@ way through the tour . Converge 's first headlining tour in support of the album took place starting in April 2010 , with Coalesce , Harvey Milk , Gaza , Lewd Acts and Black Breath . The first week of the tour also featured Thursday and Touche Amore . Converge began the European leg of their world tour in July 2010 with <unk> , Gaza and <unk> . For this tour , the band released a limited @-@ edition 7 @-@ inch vinyl single called " On My Shield " which was recorded between the US and European legs . 
 = = Musical style and theme = = 
 Converge took their music in a more progressive direction with Axe to Fall . Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock over the last few years , and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar . He went on to say that he was getting the " more straightforward , raw punk aggression out in a yet @-@ to be named hardcore side project that I started . So that leaves me free to get weird and progressive with Converge . " Ballou considers the band 's previous three albums ( Jane Doe , You Fail Me and No Heroes ) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound , and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall . The tracks on the album have been noted to range from " drone @-@ and @-@ pummel " to atmospheric . Bannon believes this album is " not about being as loud and vicious as possible . " Feeling that 40 – 50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some , Converge used softer tracks , or " slow jams , " such as " Damages " and " Wretched World " to take the listener " to some other places . " 
 Unlike previous Converge releases , the songs on Axe to Fall do not have a central and consistent lyrical theme throughout the record . Each song was meant to be a " standalone song " about Bannon 's life between this album and No Heroes . Bannon has said that he uses his lyrics and Converge to " vent about things in a healthy way so I 'm not a person that walks around with a lot of negative energy . " The opening track , " Dark Horse , " was written about the passing of a close friend of Jacob Bannon , and how he died while trying to succeed as the " underdog " .

 Axe to Fall was met with widespread critical acclaim . Metacritic , an aggregate review website , scored the album with 77 out of 100 or " generally favorable " based on ten reviews . Citing a wider range of music styles on Axe to Fall , many reviewers found the album to be Converge 's most accessible album to date . The album features songs like the " doomy [ and ] noisy " track " Worms Will Feed / Rats Will Feast , " the " synth @-@ drenched shoegazing " track " Wretched World " and " Kerry King @-@ admiring solos " on " Reap What You Sow " in addition to hardcore tracks like " Effigy " and " Cutter . " Andrew Parks of Decibel commented on the album 's wide range of sounds , stating " it strikes the perfect balance between dry @-@ heaved hardcore — blunt trauma tracks that bleed into one another and hover around the 1 : 40 mark — and post @-@ metal <unk> that embrace Converge 's experimental impulses . " Juan Diniz of Mammoth Press noted that the album flowed really well , stating that " every track compliments and balances out the one prior and after . To skip tracks would be foolish as it 's a compendium of aggression , frustration , beauty , and brutality , " and that the album " demands to be taken in as a whole . " Cosmo Lee of Pitchfork Media referred to Converge as " this generation 's Black Flag " , and compared Axe to Fall to Black Flag 's 1984 second studio album My War . Lee noted that Converge combined abrasiveness with " slower , abstract sludge " , much like how Black Flag mixed " equal parts lightning and Black Sabbath " on My War . Several reviewers compared the Axe to Fall to Converge 's highly praised 2001 album , Jane Doe . 
 Axe to Fall received little negative criticism . Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic ( who had previously given No Heroes a 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 ) gave the album a score of 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 , citing his distaste for the large number of guest musicians . Dillon stated that Converge " seems out of ideas as they enlisted a group of musicians associated with the band to fill in at various points of the record " and rhetorically asked , " why replace the band on a decent portion of their new record with far less talented , less interesting musicians ? " He also criticized the album 's longer and slower track , " Wretched World . " When compared to Converge 's similar previously released @-@ tracks , ( No Heroes 's " Grim Heart / Black Rose " and Jane Doe 's " Jane Doe " ) Dillon claimed that the song " never builds to anything " and " cuts off seemingly just as it should 've started . " Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound also found Axe to Fall 's two closing tracks underwhelming and felt that it " would have been a better album for finishing at track 11 . " Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press criticized both the lyrics and overall sound of Axe to Fall as sounding too familiar , " when it could 've been more alien " and that " in many aspects , Converge took the road most traveled for the majority of Axe to Fall .

 = Mogador @-@ class destroyer = 
 The Mogador @-@ class large destroyers ( contre @-@ torpilleurs ) of the French Navy were laid down in 1935 and commissioned in 1939 . They were extremely fast , very large destroyers intended to act as scouts for the two fast Dunkerque @-@ class battleships . The design evolved from the extremely fast Le Fantasque class , being 300 tons heavier and carrying eight guns in semi @-@ enclosed twin turrets rather than five guns in single open mounts . With their eight 138 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns they approached a light cruiser in firepower . 
 Both Mogador and her sister Volta were present during the British attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir on 3 July 1940 , but only Volta managed to escape to Toulon . Mogador was struck by a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) shell in the rear hull that detonated her ready depth charges despite not actually detonating itself . This destroyed most of her stern above water , but she remained afloat and was repaired enough to be sent to Toulon on 1 November 1940 for reconstruction . Both ships were scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize them on 27 November 1942 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Mogador class was authorized in the 1932 Estimates as an improved version of the Fantasque class with three new twin mounts carrying the same Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1929 gun as the earlier ships , but construction was suspended for a period while France and Italy negotiated some limits on their fleets and because the shipyards were already at full capacity . During this pause time was taken to modify the design to deal with the severe weather and conditions of the North Atlantic and to incorporate developments in propulsion technology that indicated that a larger hull could be used without any requiring any increase in weight . After a proposal for a catapult was abandoned because of insufficient reserve stability , an extra twin turret was decided upon to boost the ship 's firepower . Volta was authorized in the 1934 Estimates together with the second Dunkerque @-@ class battleship . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Their construction was strengthened to handle the severe weather conditions of the North Atlantic as one of the requirements for their intended role as scouts and escorts for the Dunkerque @-@ class battleships of the Force de Raid . Longitudinal construction was used throughout with frames spaced 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) apart and subdivided by twelve transverse compartments . Stress @-@ bearing parts of the hull used 60 kg / m ² grade steel while the remainder of the hull used 50 kg / m ² grade steel . To save weight all internal partitions used Duralumin as did the sides of the superstructure . The hull was entirely riveted , but all other joints were welded . Despite these efforts , top @-@ weight was higher than on earlier classes of contre @-@ torpilleurs because of the weight of the twin @-@ gun turrets . 
 Accommodations were even more cramped and poorly ventilated than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces , a problem for ships intended for long @-@ endurance sorties into the North Atlantic . The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship . There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate , but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium . 
 The ships proved to be excellent sea @-@ boats and were very capable in high seas as they could sustain 34 knots ( 63 km / h ; 39 mph ) in Sea State 4 . " They were very steady ships , with a gentle roll period of seven seconds ; they heeled only 2 @-@ 3 ° with a strong cross @-@ wind , and at only 7 @-@ 8 ° at full rudder — a marked improvement over earlier contre @-@ torpilleurs . Their comparatively high length to beam ratio , however , gave them a high coefficient of inertia , which made maneuvers in formation difficult . " 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Mogador @-@ class ships retained the unit arrangement of their propulsion spaces used in earlier contre @-@ torpilleurs . They used a new high @-@ pressure Indret boiler rated at 3 @,@ 500 kilopascals ( 510 psi ) . While this gave more power for its weight and size , it proved to be fragile and difficult to maintain . Each set of Rateau @-@ Bretagne geared turbines was rated at 46 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 34 @,@ 000 kW ) and consisted of four main turbines , a high @-@ pressure , a medium @-@ pressure and two low @-@ pressure with a reversing turbine in each of the main low @-@ pressure turbine cases . There were also two small cruise turbines operating in parallel in each engine room . At low speeds , steam was directed to the cruise turbines , but at higher speeds it was diverted to the high @-@ pressure turbine . At 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) the cruise turbines were decoupled entirely using a Vulcan clutch . This didn 't work properly and several ship 's captains recommended that the cruise turbines be deleted from future classes entirely . Each of the two shafts was driven by single reduction gearing . The port shaft was driven by the rear engine room and was significantly shorter than the starboard shaft which was driven by the forward engine room . This caused a significant disparity between the turning circle , depending on which direction the ship was turning . 
 Each shaft drove a three @-@ bladed screw propeller that was 3 @.@ 94 m ( 12 @.@ 9 ft ) in diameter . They suffered from severe cavitation at speed . The single semi @-@ balanced rudder was chosen to reduce high speed resistance . It had an area of only 14 @.@ 95 square metres ( 160 @.@ 9 sq ft ) and was moved by a weak steam @-@ driven servomotor . On trials , the turning circle was measured at 800 – 850 metres ( 870 – 930 yd ) at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . In service it took 25 – 30 seconds to turn the rudder to its maximum 32 ° at speed and the ship 's turning circle was approximately double that demonstrated on trials . The ships were so unhandy that the captain of the Volta cautioned in his log that " great care was needed when operating in company with the battleship Strasbourg , because the latter ship was far more maneuverable . " 
 The Mogador @-@ class ships were designed for a speed of 39 knots ( 72 km / h ; 45 mph ) , but this was comfortably exceeded on trials when Mogador achieved a top speed of 43 @.@ 45 knots ( 80 @.@ 47 km / h ; 50 @.@ 00 mph ) from 118 @,@ 320 shp ( 88 @,@ 230 kW ) for one hour . This was at " Washington " standard displacement so her earlier performance of 41 @.@ 67 knots ( 77 @.@ 17 km / h ; 47 @.@ 95 mph ) with 108 @,@ 424 shp ( 80 @,@ 852 kW ) at a load displacement of 3 @,@ 731 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 672 long tons ; 4 @,@ 113 short tons ) was even more impressive . 
 At normal displacement they carried only 120 tonnes ( 120 long tons ; 130 short tons ) of oil , but carried 360 tonnes ( 350 long tons ; 400 short tons ) of oil at normal load and 710 tonnes ( 700 long tons ; 780 short tons ) at deep load . Endurance was estimated during their trials at 4 @,@ 345 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 047 km ; 5 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) using the cruise turbines and 2 @,@ 664 nmi ( 4 @,@ 934 km ; 3 @,@ 066 mi ) at a speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) with the main turbines . This was never attained during service because the consumption by the auxiliary machinery was underestimated . 
 Arguably the greatest weakness of these ships lay in their inability to generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent . Their DC electrical supply was only 115V , whereas larger cruisers with power @-@ operated turrets had a <unk> system . Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo @-@ generators rated at only 120 kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44 / <unk> for use when the ship was alongside . The latter provided only for the ship 's minimum lighting and electricity needs , and fires had to be lit in at least one of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance . Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered , particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings ( which were slow to train and elevate ) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship 's poor maneuverability . In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer ; the contre @-@ torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities .

 The Mogador @-@ class ships were designed to use four newly designed twin @-@ gun Modèle 1934 " pseudo @-@ turrets " that used the same Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1929 as the preceding Le Fantastaque @-@ class destroyers . The guns were housed in separate cradles that could be coupled together and could elevate to a maximum of 30 ° and depress 10 ° . The underpowered electric motors gave a maximum training speed of 10 ° per second and a maximum elevating speed of 14 ° per second . The motors were initially installed within the mountings , but were moved to the outer sides of the turrets to free up room inside the turrets . 
 The pusher @-@ type ammunition hoists ran up a fixed shaft in the center of the mount . The shells and their powder charges were transferred to a tipping drum that was rotated to match the bearing angle of the guns and then loaded . This system was adapted from that used for the fixed 130 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) ammunition used in the Hardi @-@ class destroyers . Unfortunately it was not well suited for separate @-@ loading ammunition . Each gun had its own separate shell and powder hoist , for a total of four hoists . The tipping drum had four matching separate trays to move the ammunition to the gun . Each shell was power @-@ rammed , but the propellant charges had to be hand @-@ rammed . Theoretically the guns could be loaded at any angle , but the power rammer was so weak that it could not ram shells at angles above 10 ° . This problem , coupled with the " poor quality of manufacture of the guns , the unsatisfactory profile of the breech , resulted in a firing cycle of only 3 @-@ 4 rounds per minute during the early trials with jams and failures frequent " , rather than the planned 10 rounds per minute . A further problem was that there only two loaders assigned to the gun crew ; they tired quickly during prolonged firing . 
 Gunnery trials were conducted when Volta was on her sea trials in mid @-@ 1939 and were " an unmitigated disaster " for the reasons given above . Some fixes were identified , notably modifications to the breech , installation of split loading trays and reinforcement of the catapult rammers , but they had to wait until the ships ' next refit to be implemented . But even these modifications were only stop gaps and an entirely new loading system was deemed necessary , but since this was expected to take 10 – 12 months to develop the current system would have to be used in the meantime . Both Volta and Mogador were refitted in January 1940 and had their turrets modified , although loading still could not be done at angles higher than 10 ° . The surrender of France in June 1940 ended any work on a new loading system . Five @-@ round ready racks for each gun were added to the sides of the turrets during the refit to compensate for any problems with the loading systems . The magazines were designed to store 1440 138 mm shells , 180 rounds per gun , plus there was a separate magazine for 85 <unk> which supplied turret Nr. 2 . 
 = = = Anti @-@ aircraft suite = = = 
 A single 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) twin @-@ gun Modèle 1933 anti @-@ aircraft mount was installed on the rearmost deckhouse forward of turret Nr. 3 . It used the 50 @-@ caliber semi @-@ automatic Canon de 37 mm Modèle 1925 gun . It had a conventional sliding breech and used six @-@ round cartridge boxes which gave it a maximum rate of fire of only 30 @-@ 40 rounds per minute . This mount was used in lieu of the intended power @-@ driven Modèle 1935 twin @-@ gun mount which was to use a new 48 @-@ caliber , fully automatic 37 mm gun that was expected to be able to fire at a rate of 165 rounds per minute , but the new gun was still in development when the ships were commissioned . 250 rounds were stored near the mount , but the main magazine , which held an additional 1 @,@ 250 rounds , was adjacent to the forward 138 mm magazines . This required a loader to move forward 50 metres ( 55 yd ) to pick up each 12 @.@ 8 kilograms ( 28 lb ) cartridge box and carry it back to the waiting gun crew . 
 Two twin 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) Hotchkiss machine gun mounts were fitted as anti @-@ strafing weapons . These had a high rate of fire at 450 rpm , but this was hampered by the awkward 30 @-@ round magazine feed . Initially they were mounted on each side of the forward superstructure at deck level and fitted with gun shields to protect them against the spray . Trials revealed the limitations of these positions with poor arcs of fire and the gun shields obstructed the aimer 's view of the target . Following the completion of the trials the guns were relocated to a new deckhouse between the bridge and turret Nr. 2 and their gun shields removed . 2500 rounds per barrel were stored in the forward magazines . 
 = = = Underwater weapons = = = 
 The Mogador @-@ class ships were designed for anti @-@ surface warfare rather than anti @-@ submarine work and they were given a large torpedo battery in consequence . Two triple Modèle <unk> torpedo launchers were fitted on each beam between the funnels and two twin Modèle <unk> launchers were located on the beam , abaft the second funnel . The placement of each launcher on the beam significantly increased each launcher 's arc of fire ( 25 ° to 150 ° ) in comparison to the Le Fantastaque 's centerline mount ( 60 ° -100 ° ) . However this was not without cost as her torpedo broadside was weaker by one tube than the older class , but the extra launchers positioned close to the ship 's side imposed , more importantly , a weight and stability penalty . 
 All of her mounts used the 550 @-@ millimeter ( 22 in ) Modèle <unk> torpedo with a 308 kg ( 679 lb ) warhead . This 2 @,@ 068 kg ( 4 @,@ 559 lb ) torpedo used a four @-@ cylinder , radial Brotherhood alcohol engine to power it at two set speeds . The fast speed was 39 knots ( 72 km / h ; 45 mph ) to a range of 9 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 yd ) while the slow speed setting was 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) to a range of 13 @,@ 000 metres ( 14 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 Twin depth charge tunnels were built into the rear hull of the Mogador @-@ class ships . Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges , with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine . They were launched by remote control in patterns of four using a chain system . Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine . 
 Fixed pairs of mine rails were mounted above the stern and each pair could carry five Bréguet B4 mines . These could be extended using removable section stowed between decks to carry another thirty mines if necessary .

 The centralized fire control system was similar to that of the Le Fantastaque @-@ class with 12 × 72 target designation binoculars on each side of the bridge linked by Granat transmitters to the director control towers located atop the bridge and abaft the second funnel . Each DCT had a 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft ) OPL Modèle 1935 stereoscopic rangefinder and sent the range to the post central ' <unk> ' where it was fed into a modernized Modèle 1929 electro @-@ mechanical computer which calculated the firing solution and transmitted it to the turrets . The turrets could also be controlled locally if necessary . 
 The torpedo control system was much the same , although entirely separate from the gunnery system . 8 × 30 target designation binoculars were mounted on each side of the bridge and transmitted the target 's bearing to the torpedo director located above the primary gunnery DCT above the bridge . It used a separate 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft ) OPL Modèle 1935 stereoscopic rangefinder to provide the bearing and range to a Modèle 1933 mechanical computer which calculated the torpedo firing angle . This was sent to the remotely controlled torpedo tubes , and the command to fire could be given by either the torpedo director or either of the secondary positions on the wings of the bridge .

 This class only consisted of Mogador ( <unk> ) and Volta ( <unk> ) . Steel was cut on both contre @-@ torpilleurs beginning in late 1934 , Mogador at the Arsenal de Lorient and Volta at At . & <unk> de Bretagne , Nantes , although assembly did not begin until the autumn of the following year . Industrial unrest disrupted their construction and it was not until January 1938 that Mogador was handed over to the French Navy for sea trials . Volta followed three months later . However , neither ship was formally accepted by the French Navy for another year . Mogador was not commissioned ( <unk> d <unk> ) until 8 April 1939 and Volta on 6 March 1939 . 
 Four improved Mogador @-@ class ships were ordered in 1939 to be named Kléber , Desaix , Hoche and Marceau , but their construction was suspended due to the start of World War II . Their design was continually modified in light of wartime experience , but the original plan for dual @-@ purpose 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) guns had to shelved when it became apparent that they could not be developed in a timely manner , and they reverted to the main armament of the <unk> . The anti @-@ aircraft armament was reinforced with the substitution of four 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns for the single twin 37 mm mount . But these plans came to nought when France surrendered in June 1940 . 
 = = History = = 
 Mogador and Volta comprised the 6th Large Destroyer Division ( 6e Division de contre @-@ torpilleurs ) and were assigned to the Force de Raid based at Brest when the war began . This group 's purpose was to hunt German blockade runners and raiders and to escort convoys that might be in danger from the same . From 21 to 30 October 1939 the Force de Raid escorted the KJ.4 convoy to protect it against the German cruiser Deutschland which had sortied into the North Atlantic before the war began . A sortie by the German battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst into the North Atlantic on 21 November prompted the Force de Raid to sail from Brest to rendezvous with the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and patrol the area south of Iceland , but the German ships were able to return safely under the cover of heavy weather without being engaged . 
 Both ships were refitted in early 1940 and a number of minor changes were made . The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented , the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door , new radios were installed , and shields were fitted to the anti @-@ aircraft machine guns and the searchlights . A SS @-@ 6 sonar was fitted in June 1940 , but proved to be ineffectual . 
 During the British attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir on 3 July 1940 , Mogador was severely damaged during by a hit from a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) shell in the rear hull that detonated her ready depth charges . Volta was also present , but managed to escape in company with the battleship Strasbourg and other ships . Mogador was repaired enough to reach Toulon several months later , but was still undergoing repairs and modifications in Toulon in November 1942 . Both Mogador and Volta were scuttled in Toulon Harbour on 27 November 1942 to prevent their capture by Germany . Both were refloated in 1943 by the Italians , but neither was repaired and both were eventually broken up . 
 = South Park ( season 1 ) = 
 The first season of animated television series South Park ran for 13 episodes from August 13 , 1997 to February 25 , 1998 on the American network Comedy Central . The creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wrote most of the season 's episodes ; Dan Sterling , Philip Stark and David Goodman were credited with writing five episodes . The narrative revolves around four children — Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick — and their unusual experiences in the titular mountain town . 
 South Park originated from Parker and Stone 's 1992 animated short , Jesus vs. Frosty . The low @-@ budget , crudely made film featured prototypes of South Park 's main characters and was followed in 1995 by another short film , Jesus vs. Santa . The latter became popular and was widely shared over the Internet , which led to talks for a series with representatives from Fox Network and Comedy Central . It debuted on the latter with an initial run of six episodes ; due to its success , an additional seven episodes were quickly produced . The complete season was released on DVD in November 2002 . 
 The first season was a ratings success for Comedy Central . The Nielsen ratings rose from 1 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 4 from the first to the tenth episode . Several episodes received award nominations , including for a 1998 Emmy Award in the " Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming Less Than One Hour ) " and a GLAAD Award in the " Outstanding TV – Individual Episode " category for the episode " Big Gay Al 's Big Gay Boat Ride " . During the season , South Park won a CableACE Award for " Best Animated Series " and was nominated for a 1998 Annie Award in the " Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program " . 
 The show was a financial success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into " a cable industry power almost overnight " . Despite this , critics gave the season mixed reviews . Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it " shouldn 't have been made " : " it doesn 't just push the envelope ; it knocks it off the table " , while another critic thought of it as " coming pretty damn close " to being a " perfect " television series season .

 The idea for South Park originated in 1992 when creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in a film class as students at the University of Colorado . They discussed filming a three @-@ minute short film involving a boy who befriended a talking piece of feces named Mr. Hankey . Although such a short was never made , Parker and Stone created a Christmas @-@ related animated short commonly known as " Jesus vs. Frosty " . The crude , low @-@ budget animation featured prototypes for the main characters of South Park , including Cartman , Stan and Kyle . Fox Broadcasting Company executive Brian Graden saw the film and in 1995 commissioned Parker and Stone for $ 1 @,@ 200 to create a second short film that he could send to his friends as a Christmas video @-@ card . Titled The Spirit of Christmas , but also known as " Jesus vs. Santa " , the short resembled the style of the later series more closely . In 1997 , the The Spirit of Christmas would end up winning the Los Angeles Films Critics Association award for " Best Animation " , thus further bringing the two filmmakers to the attention of industry representatives . 
 The " Jesus vs. Santa " video was widely copied and shared over the Internet . George Clooney was reported to have made 300 copies for his friends , and the short was subsequently regarded as likely the first viral video . When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series , Parker and Stone conceived the idea of a South Park @-@ like show with four child characters but planned to call it The Mr. Hankey Show by featuring a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the main protagonist . They pitched the idea , but Brian Graden rejected it and said , according to Stone , " I 'm not putting poo on my network . " Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around four children in the South Park town , dropping Mr. Hankey as a protagonist but planning to use the character in the future in a minor supporting role . 
 Later , Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa short and considered it to be " literally the funniest thing [ he ] ' d ever seen , " and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network . During the negotiations , Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode , with Parker claiming to have asked " one thing we have to know before we really go any further : how do you feel about talking poo ? " The network 's executives were receptive to the idea , which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel . The first episode of the series , " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " , debuted on Comedy Central on August 13 , 1997 , while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " . 
 The pilot episode received poor results from test audiences . Parker later conceded that regarding the language , he and Stone felt pressure to live up to their previous two shorts and " tried to push things ... maybe further than we should [ have ] . " In contrast , they allowed subsequent episodes to " be more natural " , focusing more on making fun of topics considered taboo " without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there . " After the poor results from the test audience , Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order additional episodes after " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " . However , when buzz began to generate on the Internet about the two original shorts , the network commissioned Parker and Stone to write one more episode without committing to a full series until they had seen the script . While working on the 1997 film Orgazmo , Parker and Stone wrote the script for what would later become the episode " Weight Gain 4000 " . The duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of how the series would be and how each episode could differ from the others . The network liked the script , and when Parker and Stone refused to write another script before signing off on at least six episodes , the executives agreed to commit to a series . 
 Comedy Central originally ordered only these six episodes , but when the show proved successful , they requested an additional seven , which Parker and Stone had to produce quickly . " Pinkeye " , the first of these new episodes , would air on October 29 , 1997 , only two and a half months after the show 's premiere . There were three holiday episodes — " Pinkeye " , " Starvin ' Marvin " and " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " — which aired at intervals of three weeks , while the remaining four aired later in February 1998 . 
 " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " was the only episode animated almost completely with traditional cut paper , stop @-@ motion animation techniques . All subsequent episodes would be fully computer @-@ animated using Power Animator or Maya . By the eighth episode , " Damien " , much of the drawing and animation responsibilities handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators . This would be the only episode aside from " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " to receive a TV @-@ 14 ( unsuitable for children under the age of 14 ) rating instead of the show 's customary TV @-@ MA ( unsuitable for under the age of 17 ) . Parker and Stone credit the fourth episode , " Big Gay Al 's Big Gay Boat Ride " , with helping to raise the ratings during the early part of the season . They felt that the show 's first official Christmas special , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , brought South Park to a new level of popularity , and Parker said this episode " just vaulted everything . "

 South Park 's first season was a ratings success for Comedy Central . " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " earned a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 3 , translating to 980 @,@ 000 viewers , which was considered high for a cable program in the United States at the time . It increased slightly by the third episode , " Volcano " , and by the sixth episode , " Death " , the show had reached a rating of 1 @.@ 7 . The ratings continued to rise rapidly from then on , to 3 @.@ 8 ( " Pinkeye " ) , 4 @.@ 8 ( " Starvin ' Marvin ' " ) , 5 @.@ 4 ( " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " ) , 6 @.@ 4 ( " Damien " ) , and 6 @.@ 9 ( " Mecha @-@ Streisand " ) respectively . This corresponded to an increase to 5 @.@ 4 million viewers in 3 @.@ 2 million households . The season finale , " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " , received a Nielsen rating in the 8 @.@ 0 range and gained over 300 @,@ 000 viewers when first aired in Canada in August 1998 . 
 South Park became one of the first television series to be bootlegged via the Internet , just as The Spirit of Christmas had been before it . College students digitized many episodes from the first season and streamed them online for friends who were unable to receive Comedy Central . 
 = = = Critics = = = 
 Despite high ratings , reviews from television critics for the season were mixed . Both The Washington Post and The New York Times had three articles mentioning the show , usually in terms of " class @-@ based taste arguments . " " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " , the first episode of the series , received generally negative reviews after airing . Brent Bozell , founder and then @-@ president of the Parents Television Council , gave an unfavorable review to the episode , stating that the show " is so offensive that it shouldn 't have been made . It doesn 't just push the envelope ; it knocks it off the table . " Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters , lampooning that " if only the kids ' jokes were as fresh as their mouths " and that " it might help if the South Park kids had personalities , but they 're as one @-@ dimensional as the show 's cut @-@ and @-@ paste animation . " Calling the series " sophomoric , gross , and unfunny , " Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel reckoned that the episode made " such a bad impression that it 's hard to get on the show 's strange wavelength . " Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered that " most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self @-@ conscious and self @-@ congratulatory in its vulgarity : flatulence jokes , repeated use of the word ' dildo ' ( in the literal as well as pejorative sense ) , and a general air of malicious unpleasantness . " 
 When " Weight Gain 4000 " aired , many writers in the mainstream media were still debating the longevity and the overall quality of South Park . With the series still in its earliest stages , the episode continued to shock many due to the characters frequent use of profanities . Nevertheless , several reviewers felt " Weight Gain 4000 " was a significant improvement over " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " and felt that it went in a much more satirical direction . Several media outlets described the fifth episode of the season , " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " , as one of the most popular early episodes . Tom Carson of Newsday said it was the most outrageous South Park episode until " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " aired three months later . Many reviewers also said this mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park . 
 Due to its impact , South Park made the cover of Rolling Stone in February 1998 , and of Newsweek in March 1998 . It was discussed in five different New York Times articles in 1998 . Franck Rich of The New York Times mentions the show 's " ability to engage political topics with far more success than other ( more obviously political ) shows " and considered that the show " is hilariously candid about faith , family and death as well " and " is neither politically correct nor incorrect ; it 's on a different , post @-@ ideological comic map altogether . " In 2002 , Jeremy Conrad of IGN wrote in a DVD review that it is rare when a television season is " perfect " , but " the first season of South Park comes pretty damn close " and that " almost every single episode in this three @-@ disc set is a classic and each is still funny as hell even after so many viewings over the years . " 
 In 2008 , scholar Stephen Groening argued that the show appeared as part of a reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States , in which issues such as Murphy Brown 's motherhood , <unk> Winky 's sexuality , and The Simpsons ' family values were extensively debated . The culture wars , and political correctness in particular , were driven by the belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life . Groening explained that South Park " made a name for itself as rude , crude , vulgar , offensive , and potentially dangerous " . Its critics argued that the Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show 's defense of free speech . 
 = = = Impact on Comedy Central = = = 
 In 2006 , Devin Leonard of Fortune regarded that the launch of South Park transformed Comedy Central from a " not @-@ so @-@ funny " network to " a cable industry power almost overnight . " The impact the show had ended up surprising everybody involved . At the time , the cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers . Comedy Central marketed the show aggressively before its launch , billing it as " that 's why they invented the V @-@ chip . " The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $ 30 million in T @-@ shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired . 
 South Park became immediately one of the most popular shows on cable television , averaging consistently between 3 @.@ 5 and 5 @.@ 5 million viewers . The Denver @-@ based Tele @-@ Communications Inc . , the largest cable operator in the U.S. at the time , had just dropped Comedy Central , but when South Park debuted , Denver newspapers and radio stations heavily criticized the operator for not carrying the hit show of the two local filmmakers — Parker and Stone . Doug Herzog , Comedy Central 's president at the time , said that the public " went nuts " as the network received about ten million new subscriptions through Tele @-@ Communications Inc. alone , " which at that time was unheard of . " 
 An affiliate of the MTV Network until then , Comedy Central decided , in part due to the success of South Park , to have its own independent sales department . By the end of 1998 , Comedy Central had sold more than $ 150 million worth of merchandise for the show , including T @-@ shirts and dolls . Over the next few years , Comedy Central 's viewership spiked largely due to South Park , adding 3 million new subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries .

 = Leif J. Sverdrup = 
 Leif Johan Sverdrup ( 11 January 1898 – 2 January 1976 ) was a Norwegian @-@ born American civil engineer and general with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the first half of the 20th century . He is best known for his service in the Southwest Pacific Area during World War II where he was Chief Engineer under General of the Army Douglas MacArthur . 
 The son of a distinguished Norwegian family , Sverdrup emigrated to the United States in 1914 . After serving with the US Army in World War I , he earned a degree in civil engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1921 . He worked for a time for the Missouri State Highway Department before founding Sverdrup & Parcel , a civil engineering firm specializing in bridge construction , with John Ira Parcel , his former University of Minnesota engineering professor . His firm was involved in the construction of a number of important bridges , including the Washington Bridge and Amelia Earhart Bridge over the Missouri River and the Hurricane Deck Bridge over the Lake of the Ozarks . 
 In 1941 , Sverdrup became involved with the construction of a chain of airstrips across the Pacific Ocean to enable heavy bombers to be delivered to the Philippines . He was re @-@ commissioned in the US Army as a colonel in 1942 and became Chief of the Construction Section in General MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area . In 1942 he made three treks across the Owen Stanley Range in Papua and New Guinea on engineer reconnaissance missions into enemy @-@ occupied territory , for which he was decorated with the Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Medal . In 1944 he became the theater 's Chief Engineer . 
 After the war he commanded the 102nd Infantry Division of the US Army Reserve from 1947 to 1958 . Sverdrup & Parcel went on to design and oversee the construction of many major projects , including the Arnold Engineering Development Center and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge @-@ Tunnel , the latter being named one of the Seven Engineering Wonders of the Modern World after its completion in 1964 . The firm 's reputation was later tarnished by the collapse of the I @-@ 35W Mississippi River bridge on 1 August 2007 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Leif Johan Sverdrup was born in Ytre Sula , Norway , on 11 January 1898 , the son of Edvard Sverdrup , a high school teacher and Lutheran minister , and his second wife Agnes née Vollan . The family was a distinguished one in Norway : Leif was the great @-@ nephew of Johan Sverdrup , the former Prime Minister of Norway ; the grandson of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup , the politician ; the cousin of Otto Sverdrup , the Arctic explorer ; the half @-@ brother of the oceanographer and meteorologist Harald Sverdrup ; and the brother of the mining engineer and businessman Einar Sverdrup and women 's rights activist Mimi Sverdrup Lunden . 
 Leif was educated at Nordstrand Middle School and Aars and Voss School in Oslo . Following a quarrel with his father , Leif left Norway for America to stay with his relatives in Minnesota , the family of his cousin George Sverdrup , the son of the theologian Georg Sverdrup , who had settled in Minneapolis in 1874 . Arriving in New York City on 7 December 1914 , he entered Augsburg College , Minneapolis , in September 1916 , and graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in May 1918 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Sverdrup enlisted in the US Army at Fort Snelling , Minnesota on 26 July 1918 . He was posted to Camp Devens , Massachusetts for training with the 36th Division . While there he took advantage of a regulation waiving the normal five @-@ year residency requirement for members of the armed services seeking to take out US citizenship . Sverdrup formally took the oath as a citizen in Boston on 30 September 1918 . The US Army then sent him to the Field Artillery 's Officer Training Center at Camp Zachary Taylor , near Louisville , Kentucky , where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 18 January 1919 . The war having ended , Sverdrup was immediately placed in the inactive reserves . He was honorably discharged after nominally serving two five @-@ year terms on 17 January 1929 . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Sverdrup decided to become an engineer and enrolled in a civil engineering course at the University of Minnesota in 1919 . During the 1921 Spring break he returned to Norway , where he was reconciled with his father , accompanying his parents on a short holiday in Germany . He graduated with his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree in June 1921 . While at the University of Minnesota he met Helen Laura ( Molly ) <unk> , a recent immigrant from Norway like himself . She agreed to marry him , but only after she had graduated , worked for a year , and taken a trip to Europe . They were finally married on 26 November 1924 . Their union produced two sons , Johan Norman ( Jack ) Sverdrup , born in 1926 , and Ralph Lee Sverdrup , born in 1928 , who died of encephalitis in 1932 . In the meantime , Sverdrup took a job with the Missouri State Highway Department . His first major project involved supervising the construction of a bridge for U.S. Route 50 in Missouri over the Gasconade River . Around this time , frustrated by Americans who pronounced his name " leaf " instead of " <unk> " , he started calling himself " Jack " . 
 In 1928 , Sverdrup joined with his former University of Minnesota engineering professor John Ira Parcel in the formation of Sverdrup & Parcel , a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges . Parcel had tenure at Minnesota for a long time and was reluctant to sever his ties completely , but eventually he decided to join the new company , taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year . Sverdrup owned 60 % and Parcel 40 % of the new firm , which opened its doors on 1 April 1928 . The company 's headquarters was located in St. Louis , Missouri . Sverdrup & Parcel 's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann , Missouri , for which it received a fee of $ 33 @,@ 000 . While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant , and he asked them if they would join the company . Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri 's leading supplier of bridge components . By 1936 , all three would become partners in the firm . 
 Initially the young firm struggled , with no contracts for major jobs lined up after the Hermann bridge , and by early 1929 it faced insolvency . However neither Sverdrup nor Parcel wished to let well @-@ trained employees go , something which became an informal company policy over the years . A $ 17 @,@ 000 fee for the design and supervision of the construction of the 7th Street <unk> Bridge in Kansas City , Kansas , and then a $ 32 @,@ 000 one for the Fairfax Bridge over the Missouri River helped Sverdrup & Parcel weather the worst of the Great Depression . The subsequent New Deal involved a major program of public works . Sverdrup & Parcel applied to the Public Works Administration for the design commissions for the Washington Bridge over the Missouri River at Washington , Missouri and the Hurricane Deck Bridge over the Lake of the Ozarks in Camden County , Missouri . Sverdrup & Parcel was awarded both contracts , valued at $ 42 @,@ 000 and $ 43 @,@ 000 respectively . During 1934 , it was awarded the contract for what is now known as the Amelia Earhart Bridge over the Missouri River between Atchison , Kansas and Buchanan County , Missouri . Sverdrup & Parcel was now becoming involved in projects further afield . A project to generate electricity from tidal power at Passamaquoddy Bay brought Sverdrup into contact with Captain Hugh J. ( Pat ) Casey of the US Army Corps of Engineers , the chief engineer on the project . The project folded when federal funding was withdrawn in 1936 , but Sverdrup and Casey became friends . In 1940 , Sverdrup was appointed to the board of inquiry that investigated the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge .

 = = = Airbase construction = = = 
 In October 1941 , the War Department ordered work to commence on a chain of airstrips to enable heavy bombers to be flown from the United States to the Philippines . The existing route , via Midway Atoll , Wake Island and Guam was considered to vulnerable to disruption by Japanese forces located on nearby islands . A more secure route via Christmas Island , Canton Island , Fiji , Noumea , Rockhampton , Darwin and Fort Stotsenburg was urgently required . An initial sum of $ 5 million was allotted to construct three 7 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) runways at each site , along with appropriate fuel and maintenance buildings . The project was given the highest possible priority rating . On 16 November , Sverdrup arrived in Honolulu , Hawaii and signed a cost @-@ plus @-@ fixed @-@ fee contract for architectural and engineering services in connection with the construction of the airstrips on the route that lay in British , French and Australian territory . The contract was soon expanded to include the supervision of the construction . 
 Sverdrup flew to Fiji , and was able to report that work had started at Nadi , Fiji on 21 November . When he discussed progress on Nandi Airport in Fiji which New Zealand had agreed to extend , Walter Nash , then New Zealand Minister of Finance , recalled Sverdrup saying when he was leaving that there was no formal agreement for payment by America . So on the back of one of his cards Sverdrup drew a cross representing the airfield , wrote " £ 250 @,@ 000 " and initialled it " <unk> " The extension was actually estimated to cost £ 750 @,@ 000 . 
 On Noumea he found that hills obstructed the approaches to <unk> . Accordingly , he arranged for the Australian workmen there to complete it as an emergency field only and for development of the major airbase to be carried out at Plaine Des <unk> Airfield . Sverdrup was working in Suva when he heard the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . 
 The Pan American Airways facility for its Clippers at Noumea had included the yacht Southern Seas , formerly owned by Cyrus H.K. Curtis as <unk> , converted to a floating luxury hotel ship . With the start of the Pacific war Pan American abandoned its commercial facilities in the war zone and requested they be taken over by the U.S. military . Southern Seas , along with other company property , was taken over by the U.S. Army and Sverdrup recommended the ship be operated to support the airbase construction in the islands , including doing required survey work . On 30 December 1941 the Southern Seas was purchased from Pan American Airways by the U.S. Army Hawaii District Engineer for the sum of one dollar while settlement was reached on value of the ship . 
 Captain Norman Miller in I Took The Sky Road describes a meeting with Sverdrup during a stop in Nouméa harbor on the return flight of XPBS @-@ 1 from Java where the seaplane had delivered high priority supplies including torpedo <unk> : 
 The luxury of the Southern Seas was a far cry from the cramped quarters of the old XPBS , and I remained aboard over night , reveling in comforts previously enjoyed by Pan Am 's customers . But the yacht was of no further use to Pan Am . Their service to New Zealand had been discontinued . The yacht was to be turned over to Sverdrup to serve him as a floating office which could follow him around among the islands . 
 They decided Sverdrup would fly with Miller in XPBS @-@ 1 from Nouméa to Suva , Fiji , Sverdrup 's headquarters , with the Southern Seas following . He arrived in Sydney on 30 December . In January 1942 Sverdrup signed a cost @-@ plus @-@ fixed @-@ fee contract to provide architectural and engineering services to US Army Forces in Australia ( USAFIA ) . The contract remained in force until 15 May , when it was terminated by mutual agreement and Sverdrup & Parcel employees in Australia became civilian employees of the US Army . On 16 April , Sverdrup boarded the first of a series of aircraft that would return him to the United States .

 In Australia , meanwhile , Brigadier General Pat Casey , now the Chief Engineer at General Douglas MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( GHQ ) Southwest Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , obtained MacArthur 's permission to appoint Sverdrup as the chief of his Construction Section , with the rank of colonel . On 8 May 1942 , in Washington , DC , Sverdrup was directly commissioned as a colonel in the US Army . He was soon on his way back to Australia . Initially , the construction effort focused on bases in northern Australia but after the Battle of the Coral Sea , MacArthur was convinced that the Japanese would make another attempt to capture Port Moresby and ordered improvements to the airfields there and the construction of new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay in order to cover the approaches to Port Moresby . The July 1942 decision to attack the Japanese base at Rabaul altered priorities and added a requirement for the development of bases on the northern coast of Papua around Buna . The commander of Allied Air Forces , Lieutenant General George Brett called for 12 additional airstrips : four each at Port Moresby , Milne Bay and Buna . Sverdrup estimated that this would take a year , and suggested that either Brett lower his requirements or Casey obtain more engineer units . Casey ordered every available engineer unit to Papua and attempted to reduce the workload by cutting back on airbase facilities , shortening runways from 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) , and substituting Marsden mat for pavement . 
 In September 1942 , MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the Kokoda Trail by sending an American regimental combat team over the Owen Stanley Range . Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible . One , the Kapa Kapa Trail was known to climb to elevations above 9 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) and present formidable obstacles . The other , known as the Abau Trail held the possibility . Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail . They reached Abau on 18 September . Casey explored the harbor , taking depth soundings from a native canoe . Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American , two Australians from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit , ten native police from the Royal Papuan Constabulary and 26 native carriers . After eight days on the trail , scaling heights of 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) , Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back , reaching Abau on 3 October . Meanwhile Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for lighters . However , the trip was not a total loss , for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range that he believed could be suitable for airstrips , allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range . His opinion was supported by Cecil Abel , a missionary who knew the area well , who recommended establishing an airstrip at Fasari in the Musa River valley . Abel was flown to Fasari to make a start on an airstrip on 11 October , while Sverdrup set out from Abau with 190 men , including Flight Lieutenant M. J. Leahy , an expert on Papua , who knew many of the tribal chiefs personally . They reached Fasari on 18 October . Abel had cleared the site by burning and all that remained was some stumping and grubbing . A DC @-@ 3 was able to land the next day on the strip , which became known as Abel 's Landing . Sverdrup and Leahy set out on 20 October to explore further north and found another suitable airstrip site near the village of <unk> and <unk> , which Sverdrup had cleared . A message dropped by air instructed him to go to Pongani , where he found troops of Company C , 114th Engineer Battalion that had flown to Wanigela airstrip and had made their way to Pongani by travelling along the coast by boat . Sverdrup supervised the construction of Pongani airstrip . All three airstrips were soon in use . In December 1942 , Sverdrup made a third trip , from the Australian base at Bena Bena through the Markham Valley to the vicinity of the Japanese base at Lae . On each expedition he submitted detailed reports on the possibility of construction in the area . Sverdrup was awarded the Silver Star . His citation read : 
 For gallantry in action near Abau , New Guinea [ sic ] from 18 September 1942 to 6 October 1942 . Colonel Sverdrup led reconnaissance party into enemy @-@ occupied territory , far in advance of friendly troops , and thereby secured information of great value to the command . 
 Sverdrup was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Medal . His citation read : 
 For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a position of great responsibility in Papua , New Guinea , during the period 23 July 1942 to 23 January 1943 . During the Papuan campaign , Colonel Sverdrup personally executed numerous reconnaissance missions in New Guinea , over difficult mountains and through swamp and jungle , far forward of the areas occupied by our troops , in order to secure vital information needed for engineering operations . Utilizing native labor , which he recruited and trained , equipped only with hand tools , he constructed with great rapidity a series of air fields urgently needed for the transport by air of troops and supplies to distant and otherwise inaccessible areas . His success in completion of these essential advance airfields , accomplished under severe physical hardship and at great personal risk , made possible the effective coordination of land and air forces and contributed materially to the success of the Papuan campaign .

 Sverdrup was promoted to brigadier general in May 1944 . In July , Casey was appointed to head the Army Service Command ( ASCOM ) , a special force designed to provide logistical support , establish bases , and run them until the US Army Services of Supply ( USASOS ) was ready to take over . Sverdrup became acting Chief Engineer , GHQ SWPA in Casey 's absence . On 12 January 1945 , MacArthur personally decorated Sverdrup with the Distinguished Service Cross . His citation read : 
 For extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy at Lingayen , Luzon , Philippine Islands , on 9 January 1945 . Landing with the first wave of assault troops and with complete disregard for his own safety , he proceeded immediately to render invaluable assistance in the seizure of the vital Lingayen airfield . General Sverdrup 's exceptional courage , initiative determination contributed immeasurably to the success accomplishment of the mission . 
 Sverdrup became the first American to be decorated for the Luzon campaign . MacArthur , in making the presentation , said : " This is the engineer soldier at his best . " <unk> & Ely 1980 , p . 210 Sverdrup was promoted to major general in March 1945 . On 6 March 1945 , the Engineer Construction Command ( ENCOM ) was formed under USASOS to handle all military and civilian construction in the Philippines and Sverdrup was appointed to command it . Later in 1945 MacArthur made a more personal gesture . He presented Sverdrup with his personal Gold Castles insignia , a gift from his father , Arthur MacArthur , Jr . , on his graduation from the U.S. Military Academy . MacArthur had not worn them since he had transferred to the infantry . He told Sverdrup that " they deserved to be worn by a real engineer " and made him promise that they would not end up in a museum . 
 = = = Occupation of Japan = = = 
 In August 1945 , Sverdrup flew home on MacArthur 's private aircraft , the Bataan , accompanying Lieutenant General Richard K. Sutherland to Washington , DC for a series of meetings at The Pentagon before going on leave . The Surrender of Japan caused Sverdrup to cut short his leave and return to GHQ in Manila . On 29 August 1945 , Sverdrup landed in Japan . He entered Tokyo the next day with Casey to find a site for GHQ , which they decided to locate in the Imperial Hotel , Tokyo . On 2 September , Sverdrup attended the formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri . He received the Legion of Merit on 21 September before departing for home again the next day . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 On 3 June 1947 , the 102nd Infantry Division was activated as part of the Organized Reserve , with Sverdrup in command . Sverdrup retired from the Army on 31 January 1958 , at the age of 60 . He attended annual reunions of MacArthur 's key officers , held on MacArthur 's birthday , starting in 1949 . That year Sverdrup was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the Australian Ambassador to the United States , Norman Makin , in a ceremony at the Embassy of Australia in Washington , D.C. When Sverdrup heard that MacArthur was returning from Japan after being relieved by President Harry S. Truman in April 1951 , Sverdrup flew to greet him on arrival , along with Hanford MacNider and William C. Chase . On 2 May 1975 , Sverdrup attended the Engineer Dinner at Fort Belvoir , Virginia which marked the US Army Corps of Engineers ' 200th anniversary and presented MacArthur 's Gold Castles insignia to the Chief of Engineers , Lieutenant General William C. Gribble , Jr .. 
 Sverdrup returned to Sverdrup & Parcel , but with much less personal involvement than before , as Grant was now running the company , which was incorporated in 1946 . That year it was awarded the contract for a complex of wind tunnels at the Arnold Engineering Development Center , with a fee in excess of $ 1 million . Sverdrup & Parcel continued , becoming Sverdrup Civil , and more recently Jacobs Sverdrup , a portion of one of the world 's largest civil engineering groups . In the 1960s , Sverdrup Civil oversaw the successful design and construction of the additional " parallel trestles " of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge @-@ Tunnel ( CBBT ) , doubling the non @-@ tunnel sections , adding the capacity of two more lanes and adding emergency turnouts to the bridge @-@ tunnel facility . The CBBT was still the longest in the world 30 years after Leif Sverdrup and his company completed the original project . However the company image was tarnished in August 2005 by the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the Louisiana Superdome , which Sverdrup & Parcel had been involved in designing , and the collapse of Sverdrup & Parcel 's I @-@ 35W Mississippi River bridge across the Mississippi River at Minneapolis , Minnesota , on 1 August 2007 .

 Leif J. Sverdrup died on 2 January 1976 and was interred in Valhalla Cemetery in Hanley Hills , a suburb of St Louis , with full military honors . A number of professional organizations also began annual award programs in his honor and memory . The John I. Parcel – Leif J. Sverdrup Civil Engineering Management Award is awarded annually by the American Society of Civil Engineers . In 1976 , he was elevated to National Honor Member by Chi Epsilon national civil engineering honor society . Since 1980 , the Sverdrup Medal of the Society of American Military Engineers has been awarded annually in his memory . At Augsburg College , the annual Sverdrup Visiting Scientist Program is endowed by the Sverdrup family and by NASA through the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium .

 Brandon <unk> Roy ( born July 23 , 1984 ) is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Minnesota Timberwolves in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He was selected sixth in the 2006 NBA draft , having completed four years playing for the Washington Huskies . His nickname was " B @-@ Roy " , but he was also referred to as " The Natural " by Trail Blazers announcer Brian Wheeler . On December 10 , 2011 , Roy announced his retirement from basketball due to a degenerative knee condition , though he returned in 2012 to play five games for the Timberwolves . 
 Born in Seattle , Washington , Roy became known for his immediate impact on the Trail Blazers . Zach Randolph , then the team captain , was traded to the New York Knicks at the end of Roy 's first season in 2006 – 07 , which cleared the way for Roy to take on a leadership role on the team . That season , Roy won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in a near @-@ unanimous vote . He was selected as a reserve to the 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 All @-@ Star games . Roy played the most minutes of any Western Conference player , and tied for the most points in the West in the 2008 season , and he played the most minutes of any player during the 2009 season . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Roy was born in Seattle , Washington , on July 23 , 1984 , and attended the African @-@ American Academy elementary school . He first started taking basketball seriously while playing for the Amateur Athletic Union , one of the largest sports organizations in the United States . He attended Garfield High School in Seattle , and was considered one of the state 's best high school players . He was an early @-@ entry candidate for the 2002 NBA draft straight out of high school , but he withdrew his name after consideration . 
 Roy attended Nate McMillan 's basketball camp in the 1990s when the future Blazer coach was still playing for the Seattle SuperSonics . 
 Considered a four @-@ star recruit by Scout.com , Roy was listed as the No. 6 shooting guard and the No. 36 player in the nation in 2002 . 
 = = College career = = 
 Roy faced challenges before entering college . His parents and his older brother had not attended college , and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT ; his reading comprehension was slow , which increased the time he needed for tests . He had taken the test four times ( with tutors ) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements . Unsure whether he would be able to attend a four @-@ year college , Roy worked on the Seattle docks , cleaning shipping containers for $ 11 / hour . 
 In 2002 , Roy started to play for the University of Washington ( UW ) . He remained there for four years under head coach Lorenzo <unk> . He majored in American Ethnic Studies . After his junior year , Roy considered entering the draft , but changed his mind when he learned that teammate Nate Robinson and high school senior and UW signee Martell Webster intended to enter the draft . He saw an opportunity to rise in the ranks on his college team , and improve his draft position . 
 On December 29 , 2005 , Roy led the Huskies to victory over the Arizona State Sun Devils with a college career @-@ high 35 points and became the 31st Washington player to score 1 @,@ 000 points in a career . The following game he equalled his career @-@ high of 35 points in a double overtime loss to the Arizona Wildcats . 
 During his senior year Roy averaged 20 @.@ 2 points per game while leading the Huskies to a 26 – 7 season and a second straight Sweet Sixteen appearance . Roy was named Pac @-@ 10 player of the year and received All @-@ American honors at the end of the season , while also being a finalist for the Wooden , Naismith , Oscar Robertson , and Adolph Rupp awards . Roy had a 2006 pre @-@ draft workout with the Trail Blazers prior to being selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves as the sixth overall pick . However , he was immediately traded to the Trail Blazers for the draft rights of Randy Foye . On January 22 , 2009 , before a University of Washington Husky home game versus the USC Trojans , his number 3 uniform was retired .

 On April 11 , 2010 , Roy injured his right knee . Magnetic resonance imaging that night confirmed a right knee bone contusion ( bone bruise ) and on April 12 , further examination of the MRI showed a slight meniscus tear . Roy underwent surgery on April 16 and was expected to miss at least the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs , but returned for Game 4 after eight days of recovery time to lead the Blazers to a win . 
 Roy was named to the All @-@ NBA Third Team on May 6 , and this was his second season in a row to be named to an All @-@ NBA Team .

 Roy started the first month of the season scoring at his normal rate , but by December it started showing that his knees , which have bothered him since college and were injured in April , were ailing due to lack of cartilage . He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers announced that he would be out indefinitely . It was widely speculated that Roy would not be able to play at an All @-@ Star level again . This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews . 
 On January 17 , 2011 , Roy underwent arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees . He returned to the lineup on February 25 , scoring 18 points off the bench , including a clutch three @-@ pointer to force overtime , and helping the Blazers win the game 107 @-@ 106 . Roy then took on a reserve role for the rest of the season , scoring inconsistently to finish with a career @-@ low season average of 12 @.@ 2 points , 2 @.@ 6 rebounds , 2 @.@ 7 assists and 28 minutes in 47 games . 
 The Blazers then faced the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs . Roy shot 1 @-@ for @-@ 8 the first 2 games , including a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless . The Blazers lost both games and trailed 0 @-@ 2 in the series . He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters , and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1 .

 = Battle of Cartagena de Indias = 
 The Battle of Cartagena de Indias was an amphibious military engagement between the forces of Britain under Vice @-@ Admiral Edward Vernon and those of Spain under Admiral Blas de Lezo . It took place at the city of Cartagena de Indias in March 1741 , in present @-@ day Colombia . The battle was a significant episode of the War of Jenkins ' Ear and a large @-@ scale naval campaign . The war later was subsumed into the greater conflict of the War of the Austrian Succession . The battle resulted in a major defeat for the British Navy and Army . 
 The defeat caused heavy losses for the British : mostly due to disease that also took its toll among the Spanish forces , especially yellow fever . 
 = = Background = = 
 The War of Jenkins ' Ear was a conflict between Great Britain and Spain that lasted from 1739 to 1748 . Under the 1729 Treaty of Seville , the British had agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies except under limited conditions , under the <unk> de Negros slave trade and the Annual Ship under the Navio de <unk> . The <unk> allowed Britain a monopoly to supply 5 @,@ 000 slaves a year to the Spanish colonies . The Navio de <unk> permitted a single yearly trading ship , the Annual Ship , which could carry 1000 tons of imports to the yearly trade fair in Porto Bello . Upon receiving these concessions from Spain , the British government granted a monopoly for both to the South Sea Company . The merchants and bankers in Britain , who were the driving force behind Britain 's international commerce and trading , demanded more access to the lucrative Spanish markets of the Caribbean Basin . In turn , the Spanish colonists desired British @-@ made goods , so a burgeoning black market of smuggled goods developed . 
 By the terms of the treaty , the Spanish were permitted to board British vessels in Spanish waters . After one such boarding in 1731 , Robert Jenkins , captain of the ship Rebecca , claimed that a Spanish coast guard officer had severed his ear . The legend that Jenkins exhibited his pickled ear to the House of Commons appears to have no basis in fact . This served to heighten the " war fever " developing against Spain , which was also driven by the British desire for commercial and military domination of the Atlantic basin . To much cheering , the British Prime Minister , Robert Walpole , reluctantly declared war on October 23 , 1739 , reportedly saying , " They may ring their bells now ; they will be wringing their hands before long . "

 The Spanish Caribbean trade had a network of four main ports : Vera Cruz , Mexico ; Cartagena , Colombia ; Porto Bello ( now Portobelo ) , Panama ; and the main port through which all the trade of those three ports came , Havana , Cuba . On November 22 , 1739 the British captured Portobelo in the Viceroyalty of New Granada . The British attack was part of an attempt to damage Spain 's finances . The poorly defended port was attacked by six ships of the line under Vice @-@ Admiral Edward Vernon . The relative ease of this capture , although it was quickly recaptured by the Spanish after Vernon 's fleet departed , caused jubilation in Britain . 
 Vernon was given command of the very large naval force , which was one quarter of the British Royal Navy , of a major land and sea amphibious expedition under the overall command of Lord Cathcart . The first goal of the expedition was to capture Havana , the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and , by 1740 , it had become Spain 's largest and most active shipyard . Lord Cathcart died en route and it remained unclear who was in command overall . Cathcart 's untimely demise resulted in dissension in the British command , preventing the coordination needed for this complex operation . 
 The despatch of the large fleet and troop contingent had been demanded by the public led by the merchant class lobbies , especially , and the South Sea Company , in particular , which refused to accept the compromise agreements made by the governments of Spain and Britain . The Duke of Newcastle advocated the public 's demands before Parliament . Vice @-@ Admiral Vernon was an active and ardent supporter of war against Spain and advocated offensive action both in Parliament and before the Admiralty . The decision to mount a large West Indies expedition was reached in December 1739 . Walpole , who opposed the war categorically , and Vernon , who favored small squadron actions , were dissatisfied with the situation . Vernon , despite his earlier failed small squadron raid on Cartagena , was not convinced that a large @-@ scale attack on a heavily fortified city would prove to be as successful as his smaller Portobello assault had been . He feared , particularly , that a prolonged siege would lead to heavy attrition from disease , a typical situation given the limited medical knowledge of the time . 
 = = = Objectives = = = 
 Britain 's objective was to capture and permanently retain Spain 's four ports of the Caribbean basin . By taking control of these ports , the British would effectively control the entry and exit routes to South America . The British would have bases from which to launch attacks into the interior , and Spain would have limited access to deep water ports on the eastern coast of their American colonies and therefore be unable to resupply their inland forces . Control of these ports would provide the British with a key control of the area and allow them , in time , to acquire the whole of Spain 's American empire . However , Britain had no place to build and refit ships in the Caribbean , as Spain did with the dockyards at Havana , and without a dockyard no fleet could remain in the area for any length of time without breaking down . Quick capture of Havana and its dry dock was imperative and it was the favored objective of Newcastle and Sir Charles Wager , First Lord of the Admiralty , but Britain 's divided ministry left the course of the campaign up to Vernon and others at a Council of War held in Jamaica . They followed Vernon , who preferred Cartagena as their initial objective as it was a good port and to windward of Britain 's existing Caribbean bases and Vernon thought Havana too well defended to be the initial target . 
 = = = The city of Cartagena de Indias = = = 
 Cartagena of Indies , in the eighteenth century , was a large and rich city of over 10 @,@ 000 people . It was the capital of the province of Cartagena and the main town had significant fortifications that had been recently repaired , increased and improved with outlying forts , batteries and works . Its harbor was considered one of the finest in the world and it served the galleons of the commercial fleet , <unk> a Tierra Firme y Perú , that annually conveyed through Havana to Spain the immense revenues of gold and silver from New Granada and Peru . 
 Founded by Pedro Heredia in 1533 , it had been the target of conquest in the past and was captured by the English , under Francis Drake , in 1585 and by the French , under Baron de Pointis in 1697 . The city faces the Caribbean to the west , to the south its bay has two entrances : Boca Chica ( Little Mouth ) and Boca Grande ( Big Mouth ) . Boca Chica was the only deep water entrance and was so narrow it allowed the passage of only one ship at a time . This entrance was defended on one side by the Fort San Luis with a couple of small outworks on the peninsula of Terra Bomba and on the other side by the <unk> battery <unk> . Beyond Boca Chica was the great lagoon of the outer harbor with an entry channel into the inner harbor between two peninsulas , each defended by a fort . The walls of the city itself mounted some 160 cannon and the suburbs 140 guns . The city was surrounded by a water @-@ filled ditch and its gates supported by recently built bastions . The suburbs were also surrounded by a wall and ditch . About a quarter mile south from the city on a hill was Fort San Lazaro , a square fifty feet on a side with three demi @-@ bastions . The position of Fort San Lazaro commanded the city itself and the plain around the hill . There was also a small hill nearby that commanded Fort Lazaro , but there was no fresh water source available outside Cartagena and the fort . The road from the best landing point , the beach at <unk> de Gracias , to Fort Lazaro was three miles long . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The Battle of Cartagena pitted a British invasion force of 186 ships including : 29 Ships of the Line ; 22 frigates , 2 hospital ships , various fire ships and bomb ships armed with a total of some 2 @,@ 000 cannon ; 80 troop transports and 50 merchant ships . There were at least 27 @,@ 400 military personnel , of which the land force totaled 12 @,@ 000 including : two British regular infantry regiments , the 15th Foot and 24th Foot , 6 @,@ 000 newly raised marines and some 3 @,@ 600 American colonial troops , commanded by Colonel William Gooch ( the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia ) , in four battalions designated as the 43rd Regiment of Foot , arriving from the North American colonies on another 40 transports . 
 The Spanish force defending Cartagena was composed of 2 @,@ 700 to 3 @,@ 000 Spanish regulars from the regiments Aragon , España and that of Toledo , Lisboa and Navarra just arrived in October 1740 , brought by Vice @-@ admiral Torres ; a colonial regiment from Cartagena ; an unspecified number of sailors ; 5 companies of militia and 600 Indian archers , perhaps 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 defenders , manning six Ships of the Line and strategic fortifications — under the command of the Governor General of Cartagena , Don Blas de Lezo and the Viceroy of New Granada , Sebastián de Eslava . Blas de Lezo , a Basque , was an experienced , wily and tenacious Spanish Naval commander , whose previous career was as daring and spectacular as any naval officer of his day . Lezo , who had lost an arm , a leg and an eye in the service of Spain , made use of every advantage , strategy and tactic available to him . 
 = = = Preliminary maneuvers = = = 
 The expedition was very slow leaving Britain . Initially , contrary winds delayed the sailing until most of the shipboard provisions were consumed and a steep increase of sickness occurred among the ship crews . Then news of the sailing of the French squadrons and a Spanish squadron caused further delay while the British fleet was reinforced in response . The expedition suffered from manpower shortages in the navy , which required drafting two full infantry regiments , the 34th and 36th , to fill crew requirements Cathcart was ordered by the government to transfer 600 of his marines to provide marines for the men of war . These delays cost the British three months of valuable campaign time . The 3 @,@ 600 Americans were transported to Jamaica from New York on 40 transports escorted by some British men of war and arrived much sooner on December 3 , 1740 . The Americans were originally under the command of General Spotswood , Governor of Virginia , who was to be second @-@ in command under Cathcart , however Spotswood died and was replaced by Gooch as commander of the Americans . They found on their arrival that no arrangements had been made by the British government for their provisions . The lack of provision and climate immediately began to take a toll on the Americans , while the fleet from Britain was suffering from typhus , scurvy and dysentery ; by January 1741 the land forces had already suffered 500 dead , including Lord Cathcart the commander in chief , and 1 @,@ 500 sick . With both Cathcart and Spotswood dead , command of the land forces went to Thomas Wentworth , who had no previous combat command experience . In Jamaica , 300 African slaves , called ' Macheteros ' , were added to the expedition as a work battalion . Additional delays before and after embarking from Jamaica cost more precious time , including a brief skirmish with a French squadron . Both the British and the Spanish were well aware that with onset of the two @-@ month rainy season in May , the so @-@ called ' sickly season ' , which would last from May to November , would also begin . 
 The Spanish had received reinforcements but were already suffering severely from diseases as well . Similar to the British , but not as disruptive to operations , there was dissension between Lezo and Eslava . In particular , Lezo favored a very strong , all @-@ out defense of Boca Chica channel ; Eslava 's opposition led to an under @-@ manning of some of the forward defenses , allowing the British an easier initial landing . 
 = = = Attack on Fort San Luis at Boca Chica = = = 
 The British expedition arrived off Cartagena on March 4 with no overall commander but with decisions being made by councils of war , with General Wentworth commanding the land forces and Vernon the sea forces . The navy had lost so many sailors by this time as a result of the epidemics that one third of the land forces were needed to fill out the crews . Although the city of Cartagena was fronted on one side by the ocean , the shore and surf were so rough as to preclude any attempt to approach it from sea . The other access channel , Boca Grande , was too shallow to allow the passage of ocean @-@ going ships . The channel of Boca Chica was the only deep @-@ draft passage into the harbor of Cartagena . It ran between two narrow peninsulas and was defended on one side by the fort of San Luis , Boca Chica Castle , with four bastions having some 49 cannons , 3 mortars and a garrison of 300 soldiers under the command of the chief engineer , Carlos <unk> . A boom stretched from the island of La Bomba to the southern peninsula on which was Fort San Jose with 13 cannon and 150 soldiers . Also supporting the entrance were the 6 Spanish line ships . 
 After a week of bombardment , the British planned to land near the smaller access channel , Boca Chica , with 300 grenadiers . The Spanish defenders of two small , nearby forts , San Iago and San Philip , were driven off by a division of three ships of the fleet under Chaloner Ogle which suffered some 120 casualties with the Shrewsbury alone losing 100 killed and wounded as well as taking serious damage from cannon fire from Fort San Luis . The grenadiers landed that evening and were followed on March 22 by the whole of the British land forces : the two regular regiments and the six regiments of marines . Of the American land forces only 300 were allowed ashore as most of the American troops of the four battalions had been dispersed to serve aboard the Ships of the Line to replace Vernon 's losses in sailors and were not available for amphibious operations . They were followed in a few days by the artillery . After the army made camp , the Americans and the Jamaicans constructed a battery in two weeks and its twenty 24 pounder guns began battering the fort . A squadron of five ships , consisting of the Boyne , Prince Frederick , Hampton Court , Tilbury , and Suffolk , led inshore by Commodore Lestock , also attempted to batter the fort into submission for two days but had the worst of it , making no impression on the fort and having many men killed and three ships heavily damaged and disabled . 
 The British artillery on land , after three days of firing night and day , made a breach in the main fort while part of the fleet assisted . Another part of the fleet engaged the Spanish ships , two of which Lezo scuttled and another , the Galicia , he set on fire . The two scuttled Spanish ships partially blocked the channel and the Galicia was captured by the British before it could sink . The British attacked Fort San Luis by land and sea on April 5 . The infantry advanced on the breach ; however , the Spanish had already retreated to fortifications in the inner harbor . Over the following week , the landing force re @-@ embarked and entered the harbor . The operation against Boca Chica cost the British army 120 killed and wounded , additionally 250 died from the diseases of yellow fever and malaria , and 600 sick were hospitalized . 
 = = = Attack on Fort San Lazaro = = = 
 The next council of war decided to attempt to isolate Cartagena from the land side by an assault of Fort San Lazaro , called in some accounts San Felipe de Barajas . With the capture of San Luis and other outlying defensive works , the fleet passed through the Boca Chica channel into the lagoon that made up the harbor of Cartagena . The Spanish withdrew to concentrate their forces at Fort San Lazaro and the city . Vernon goaded Wentworth into an ill @-@ considered , badly planned assault on the fort , an outlying strong @-@ point of Cartagena , which Vernon refused to support with the fleet making specious excuses about the depth of the harbor . The ships cleared the beach with cannon fire and Wentworth landed on April 16 at <unk> de Gracias . 
 After the British gained the inner harbor and captured some outlying forts , de Lezo strengthened the last main bastion of Fort San Lazaro by digging a trench around it and clearing a field of fire on the approach . He had to hold the fort as it commanded the city and , in British hands , a bombardment would force Cartagena to surrender in a short time . Lezo defended the trench with some 650 soldiers and garrisoned the fort with another 300 , while keeping in hand a reserve of 200 marines and sailors . The British advanced from the beach and had to pass a narrow defile . There they met a Spanish force that briefly contested that passage before giving way . 
 The only British engineer with the expedition had been killed at fort San Luis ; no one could construct a battery to breach the walls . The British decided to storm the fort outright in a coup de main , walls <unk> , during a night attack . The night attack would allow the assault of the northern side of the fort facing Cartagena because , in the dark , the guns of Cartagena would not be able to give supporting fire . The southern side had the lowest and most vulnerable walls and the grenadiers would attempt to quickly storm and carry the parapets . But the attack started late and the initial advance on Lazaro was made near dawn at 4 am April 20 by a forlorn hope of 50 picked men followed by 450 grenadiers commanded by Colonel Wynyard . The main body was 1 @,@ 000 men of the 15th and 24th regiments commanded by Colonel Grant , then a mixed company from the 34th and 36th regiments and some unarmed Americans carrying scaling @-@ ladders for the fort 's high walls and wool packs to fill in the trench . Finally , there was a reserve of 500 marines under Colonel Wolfe . 
 The column was led by two Spanish deserters as guides who misled the British on the southern low walled side . Wynyard was led to a steep approach and , as the grenadiers scrambled up the slope , they were received with a deadly volley of musket fire at thirty yards from the Spanish in the entrenchments . The grenadiers deployed into line and advanced , slowly trading fire . On the north face , Grant fell early and the leaderless troops traded fire with the Spanish . Most of the Americans dropped the ladders they carried and took cover . Those ladders brought forward were too short by ten feet . After an hour , the sun rose and as the guns of Cartagena opened fire on the British , casualties mounted . At eight o 'clock , when a column of Spanish infantry coming from the gates of Cartagena threatened to cut the British off from their ships , Wentworth ordered a retreat . The assault failed , with a loss of 600 casualties from a force of approximately 2 @,@ 000 . Sickness and disease increased the casualties of the expedition . During the period surrounding the attack on Fort San Lazaro , Wentworth 's land forces were reduced from 6 @,@ 500 effectives to 3 @,@ 200 . 
 = = = British withdrawal = = = 
 Don Blas de Lezo 's plan had been that , given the overwhelming force against him , he would attempt to conduct a fighting withdrawal and delay the British long enough until the start of the rainy season at the end of April . The tropical downpours would delay campaigning for another 2 months . Further , the longer the enemy had to remain mostly crowded on ships at sea and in the open on land , the more likely that insufficient supply , discomfort and especially disease would become his allies and the deadly enemies of the British . De Lezo was aided by the contempt that Vernon and Wentworth had for each other , which prevented their cooperation after the initial landing . 
 Another important factor in the defeat of the British force was the fact that Cartagena 's defensive fortifications had been repaired and improved over the past year . Although De Lezo was pressed to the limit , his plan worked and the Spanish prevailed . The rains came and the British had to board their ships , where close quarters made disease even more deadly . By April 25 , Vernon and the council decided to retreat to Jamaica , and by mid @-@ May they were gone . By May 7 , only 1 @,@ 700 men of the land forces were fit for service and no more than 1 @,@ 000 in condition to land against the enemy ; within a month of leaving Cartagena , another 1 @,@ 100 died . British strength was reduced to 1 @,@ 400 and American to 1 @,@ 300 . 
 The expedition and battle lasted for 67 days and ended with the British fleet withdrawing in defeat , with 18 @,@ 000 dead or incapacitated , mostly by disease . The Spanish also suffered severely from disease including Blas de Lezo himself , who died a few weeks after falling ill from the plague from unburied bodies . In addition a total of 50 British ships were lost , badly damaged , disabled or abandoned for lack of crews . There were nineteen ships of the line damaged , four frigates and twenty @-@ seven transports lost . Of the 3 @,@ 600 American colonists , who had volunteered , lured by promises of land and mountains of gold , most died of yellow fever , dysentery , and outright starvation . Only 300 returned home , including Lawrence Washington , who renamed his Virginia plantation , Mount Vernon after Admiral Vernon . 
 During the early stage of the battle , when the Spanish forces had retreated from different defense points to regroup in the larger fortress of San Lazaro , feeling victory in his hands Vernon dispatched a messenger , Captain Laws , to Britain to inform King George of the British forces ' entry to the inner bay on May 17 . The souvenir industry , in expectation of a triumph that never came , had been busily manufacturing commemorative medals for the occasion . They were mainly made by button @-@ makers , who copied a few basic designs and are generally of very poor quality . The largest collections of these medals can be found in the UK and the US . Commemorative china was also produced but its survival has been rarer . In one of the medals Admiral Vernon was shown looking down upon the " defeated " Spanish admiral Don Blas de Lezo who appeared kneeling down . A contemporary song was composed by a sailor from the Shrewsbury that prematurely celebrated the victory : 
 <unk> 'S GLORY ; OR , THE <unk> <unk> . 
 Being an account of the taking of Carthagena by Vice @-@ Admiral Vernon ... " ... and the town surrender [ ed ] 
 To Admiral Vernon , the scourge of Spain " . 
 The main reasons for the British defeat were the failure of the British to find united leadership after the commander in chief , General Charles Cathcart , died of dysentery en route ; the logistic inability to land siege artillery and ammunition near to Cartagena ; the impediments made by Vernon that prevented involvement of his line ships to support the infantry forces ; and the effective Spanish maneuvers carried out by the viceroy Sebastián de Eslava , Admiral Blas de Lezo and Colonel Carlos <unk> . 
 After the defeat , Admiral Vernon sent a letter to Blas de Lezo : " We have decided to retreat , but we will return to Cartagena after we take reinforcements in Jamaica " , to which Blas de Lezo ironically responded : " In order to come to Cartagena , the English King must build a better and larger fleet , because yours now is only suitable to transport coal from Ireland to London " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the news of the disaster Robert Walpole 's government soon collapsed . Spain retained control over its most strategically important colonies , including the vitally crucial port in the Caribbean that helped secure the defense of the Spanish Main and its trans @-@ Atlantic trade with Spain . 
 News of Britain 's defeat reached Europe at the end of June , 1741 and had immense repercussions . It caused George II of Great Britain , who had been acting as mediator between Frederick the Great of Prussia and Maria Theresa supporting Austria over Prussian seizure of Silesia in December 1740 , to withdraw Britain 's guarantees of armed support for the Pragmatic Sanction . That encouraged France and Spain , the Bourbon allies , revealed to also be allied with Prussia , to move militarily against a now isolated Austria . A greater and wider war , the War of the Austrian Succession , now began . 
 The staggering losses suffered by the British compromised all the subsequent actions by Vernon and Wentworth in the Caribbean and most ended in acrimonious failure despite reinforcements of 1 @,@ 000 troops from Jamaica and 3 @,@ 000 regular infantry from Britain . Vernon and Wentworth were both recalled to Britain in September 1742 , with Chaloner Ogle taking command of a very sickly fleet that had less than half its sailors fit for duty . By the time the Caribbean campaign ended in May 1742 ninety percent of the army had died from combat and sickness . Several other British attacks took place in the Caribbean with little consequence on the geopolitical situation in the Atlantic . The weakened British forces led by Charles Knowles made raids upon the Venezuelan coast , attacking La Guaira in February 1743 and Puerto Cabello in April , though neither operation was particularly successful . 
 The failure to take Cartagena caused what was left of the naval forces assigned to Vernon to remain in the Caribbean longer . This resulted in the weakened Mediterranean squadron being unable to prevent the Spanish from twice convoying troops totalling 25 @,@ 000 to Italy in November and December 1741 . It was not until Commodore Richard Lestock , commander of one of Vernon 's divisions at Cartagena , returned to Europe with ships from the Caribbean fleet , that Britain reinforced its presence in the Mediterranean . 
 Historian Reed Browning describes the British Cartagena expedition as " stupidly disastrous " and quotes Horace Walpole , whose father was Vernon 's bitter enemy , writing in 1744 : " We have already lost seven millions of money and thirty thousand men in the Spanish war and all the fruit of all this blood and treasure is the glory of having Admiral Vernon 's head on alehouse signs . " 
 In spite of his defeat the inscription on Vernon 's marble memorial in Westminster Abbey credits him for victory in Cartagena in a deliberately elliptical style : " He subdued <unk> , and at Carthagena conquered as far as naval forces could carry victory " that probably also reflects ironically his conflict with Wentworth .
