 Cody played two seasons at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in <unk> , Mississippi as a defensive tackle . As a freshman he recorded 48 tackles with 2 @.@ 5 sacks and an interception . In his sophomore year , he added 31 tackles and 3 @.@ 5 sacks while anchoring a Bulldog defense that ranked number one in the state in rushing defense and total defense . Mississippi Gulf Coast finished the season with a 12 – 0 season record and a NJCAA Co @-@ National Championship . Cody was named to the NJCAA All @-@ American first team . 
 Despite his dominance , he had trouble drawing scholarship offers , as his weight of 410 pounds ( 190 kg ) scared off many teams . “ A lot of people are just wary of guys that big , ” Mississippi Gulf Coast coach Steve Campbell said . “ You know when people say that if things seem too good to be true that they usually are . A big guy like that who 's that athletic , you just don 't believe what you 're seeing . ” Particularly noted for his lower body strength , Cody had a squat max of 660 pounds ( 300 kg ) in junior college . 
 However , after Cody had his weight down to 385 lb ( 175 kg ) , a number of schools offered him scholarships , including Tennessee , Ole Miss , and Florida State . He was heavily recruited particularly by Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban , who was in need of a true nose tackle for his 3 – 4 defense . Cody recalls Saban telling him , " We need a body like yours in the middle , to stop the run , to change the rhythm of the game . " 
 Considered a three @-@ star recruit by <unk> , Cody was listed as the No. 39 junior college prospect in 2008 . 
 Cody committed to the Crimson Tide on November 29 , 2007 .

 Cody made an immediate impact for the Crimson Tide defensive line , recording four tackles — one for loss — in a 34 – 10 rout of the Clemson Tigers . He and the rest of the defense also held the Tigers , which included running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller , to zero net rushing yards . With his presence in the middle of the Crimson Tide defensive line , Cody earned himself the nickname of “ Mount Cody . ” By mid @-@ season he was already considered the No. 1 nose tackle prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft by league scouts . 
 Against Arkansas , Cody dominated Razorbacks center Jonathan <unk> — the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner — and helped the Crimson Tide to a 49 – 14 win . In a memorable play on a fourth @-@ and @-@ goal from the 1 @-@ yard line late in the first half , Cody blasted past <unk> and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before he could reach the end zone . In Alabama 's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium , Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate <unk> Moreno to just 34 yards rushing . In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss , he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks . 
 In the annual Iron Bowl versus rival Auburn , Cody and teammate Bobby Greenwood sacked quarterback Kodi Burns , giving Cody his first half @-@ sack of the season . He also recovered a fumble , which set up an Alabama touchdown . In the 2008 SEC Championship Game versus Florida , Cody recorded three tackles in a 31 – 20 loss . In the loss , the Crimson Tide allowed 142 yards rushing — the second most in the 2008 season . In the season finale , he recorded one assisted tackle , while holding the Utah Utes to 13 yards rushing . However , Alabama went on to lose the game 31 – 17 , finishing the season 12 – 2 . 
 Alabama ′ s rush defense considerably improved in 2008 . After giving up 128 @.@ 4 rushing yards a game in 2007 , the Crimson Tide only allowed 78 @.@ 8 yards per game in 2008 . “ As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any , you ’ d have to go with Terrence , ” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said . Cody was subsequently given the team ’ s Defensive Achievement Award for a newcomer who has played a critical role in the effectiveness of his unit . 
 Despite being commonly regarded as a top prospect , Cody decided to pass on from the 2009 NFL Draft . On Christmas Day of 2008 , an " announcement " on his Facebook page said that he was leaving early , but turned out to be a joke by his girlfriend .

 Prior to the 2009 season Cody dropped about 10 pounds and worked on his conditioning , hoping to keep himself in the game on third @-@ down passing situations . He was often replaced by Josh Chapman on passing downs in 2008 . Nick Saban stated Cody needed to reduce his weight to 340 pounds ( 150 kg ) in order to become an every @-@ down player and pass @-@ rusher ; he reported for fall practice at 354 pounds ( 161 kg ) , set a goal to reach 345 pounds ( 156 kg ) by the season opener , and eventually dropped his weight to 349 pounds ( 158 kg ) . Only a couple of days before the first game , Cody and a few of his teammates were sidelined with flu @-@ like symptoms . Cody returned after a three @-@ day absence . 
 Cody was named to the 2009 Lombardi Award , Lott Trophy , and Outland Trophy pre @-@ season watch lists . Rivals.com ranked him as the No. 1 defensive tackle in college football in 2009 . On October 14 , 2009 , Cody and teammate Rolando McClain were announced as two of the twelve finalists for the 2009 Lombardi Award . Cody was also named to The Sporting News and CBS Sports midseason college football All @-@ American teams . 
 In a game against Tennessee on October 24 , Cody blocked his first two field goals of his career , including a 44 @-@ yard attempt in the game 's final seconds , to secure Alabama 's 12 – 10 win . According to Yahoo ! Sports ' national columnist Dan Wetzel , Cody earned himself Heisman Trophy consideration with his performance against the Volunteers . A couple of weeks later , Mike <unk> of the Los Angeles Times also called for Heisman consideration for Cody , describing him as " the best player on what might be college football 's top defense . " 
 On November 10 , Cody was named one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award , alongside Jerry Hughes , Gerald McCoy , and Ndamukong Suh . He was the seventh Crimson Tide player to be named a finalist and the second in a row , joining offensive tackle Andre Smith , who was a finalist for the award in 2008 . Former All @-@ American linebacker Cornelius Bennett was the only Alabama player to win the Lombardi Award , capturing the honor in 1986 . In the end , Nebraska 's Ndamukong Suh won the award . On November 19 , Cody joined Pat Angerer , Eric Berry , Jerry Hughes , and Ndamukong Suh as the five finalists for the 2009 Nagurski Trophy , but was again beat out by Suh for the award . On November 23 , Cody , Brandon Spikes and Suh were announced as the three finalists for the 2009 Bednarik Award , which was eventually won by Suh as well . 
 In his two seasons at Alabama , Cody helped the Crimson Tide to lead the Southeastern Conference in rushing defense , allowing opponents a rushing average of only 78 @.@ 8 and 78 @.@ 1 yards per game in 2008 and 2009 , respectively . No individual player reached the 100 @-@ yard rushing mark against the Crimson Tide in those two seasons ; Anthony Dixon of Mississippi State came closest with 81 yards in 2009 . Cody 's presence improved Alabama 's pass rush despite his not being an effective pass rusher himself . Wrote Michael Casagrande : " The power that comes with his size typically forces opposing lines to focus two players on blocking him , thus creating favorable rushing lanes for unblocked linebackers . " 
 Prior to the 2009 BCS National Championship Game , Cody drew awestruck praise from Texas players and coaches . " They call him Mount Cody . Mount Cody is for a reason . He plays like he ’ s 450 pounds . He can move like he ’ s Sergio Kindle , " said Longhorns guard Charlie Tanner . Alabama 's defense held Texas to 81 yards rushing — more than 70 yards below their season average — on 28 attempts , and helped the Crimson Tide to their first national title since 1992 . 
 Along with Crimson Tide teammates Javier Arenas , Mike Johnson , Leigh Tiffin , and Colin Peek , Cody participated in the 2010 Senior Bowl on January 30 , 2010 . In the Senior Bowl weigh @-@ in at the Mobile Convention Center , Cody tipped the scales at 370 pounds , which hurt his draft status according to NFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock .

 Frequently drawing comparisons to Ted Washington and Shaun Rogers , Cody was considered one of the rare two @-@ gap defensive tackles that NFL teams covet for their 3 – 4 type defenses . Many NFL experts therefore projected Cody to be selected in the first @-@ round of the 2010 NFL Draft . One of the teams interested in Cody was rumored to be his near @-@ hometown Miami Dolphins , who lost their veteran defensive tackle Jason Ferguson to injury during the 2009 season . 
 Some pro scouts , however , were concerned about Cody 's weight and said he needed to reduce it to 340 pounds ( 154 kg ) in order to be an effective NFL player . They questioned whether he had the stamina to be a three @-@ down player , or the quickness to be an effective pass rusher , at his college weight of about 360 pounds ( 163 kg ) . ESPN ′ s K. C. Joyner analyzed Cody 's relative playing time in a four @-@ game SEC stretch in October 2009 ( at Kentucky , at Mississippi , vs. South Carolina , vs. Tennessee ) , and found that Cody was in the Alabama defensive lineup on only 122 of 281 plays . Joyner also discovered that during that stretch Cody drew an impressively high amount of double @-@ teams : 63 @.@ 6 percent , compared to NFL player Albert <unk> 's 2007 double @-@ team mark of 51 @.@ 3 percent . 
 At the 2010 Senior Bowl , Cody disappointed a lot of NFL scouts when he weighed in at 370 pounds ( 168 kg ) , 16 pounds ( 7 kg ) above his official weight according to the 2009 Alabama media guide . In the game , however , Cody " moved pretty well for a 370 @-@ pound behemoth " and used " his hands well to create a little space to get penetration " . He finished with 1 @.@ 5 tackles for loss . Cody worked out at API in Pensacola , Florida , along with Sam Bradford , Jason Worilds , and former Alabama teammates Mike Johnson and Roy Upchurch . He made pre @-@ draft visits to the Baltimore Ravens , the New York Jets , the San Diego Chargers , and the Kansas City Chiefs . 
 At the NFL Combine , Cody weighed in at 354 pounds ( 161 kg ) , making him the heaviest combine participant since Aaron Gibson in 1999 . He had managed to shed some weight since the Senior Bowl , but according to Mike Mayock he was still not worthy of a first @-@ round pick . Cody ran a 5 @.@ 62 sec 40 @-@ yard dash , the slowest by an eventually drafted defensive tackle since Corey <unk> , a seventh round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft . Cody was selected in the 2nd round ( 57th overall ) by the Baltimore Ravens . He was the highest picked Alabama Crimson Tide defensive tackle since Cornelius Griffin was drafted 42nd overall by the New York Giants in the 2000 NFL Draft . 
 = = = Baltimore Ravens = = = 
 At Baltimore , Cody was projected to strengthen a Ravens defense that allowed the fewest rushing yards per carry ( 3 @.@ 4 ) of any NFL team in 2009 and had a streak of 39 consecutive games without allowing a 100 @-@ yard rusher — broken when Cincinnati 's Cedric Benson rushed for 120 yards on October 11 , 2009 . Regarded by Ravens director of player personnel Eric DeCosta as a first @-@ round prospect " from an ability standpoint , " Cody competed against Kelly Gregg for the starting defensive tackle spot in 2010 . The combination of Cody and 345 @-@ pound defensive tackle Haloti Ngata gave Baltimore the AFC North ’ s heaviest interior line , reminiscent of the Sam Adams and Tony <unk> tandem on the 2000 – 2001 Ravens teams . 
 Cody signed a four @-@ year , $ 3 @.@ 385 million maximum value contract with the Ravens on July 26 , 2010 . In training camp at McDaniel College , Cody — along with veteran cornerback Walt Harris — failed their conditioning test for the Ravens , and were thus placed on the physically unable to perform ( <unk> ) list . He eventually passed the conditioning test on his third try , allowing him to go to training camp for the Ravens . 
 In his professional debut , a preseason game against the Carolina Panthers , Cody had a solid performance , finishing with five tackles ( four solo ) . His most impressive play came in the first half , when he tackled DeAngelo Williams single @-@ armed for a loss while holding off Panthers center Ryan Kalil with the other . On November 21 , he made his first official start , debuting against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium . Unlike his preseason performance , he was criticized for his poor performance from fans and head coach John Harbaugh . During a play , the Panthers offensive lineman pushed Cody out of the way , allowing Mike Goodson to have a 45 @-@ yard run . Cody finished the game without any tackles , as the Ravens defense allowed 120 rushing yards . As a rookie in 2010 , Cody played 13 games with 13 tackles . 
 Later in the 2010 season , and especially in the playoffs , he stepped up his play though . So much so , in fact , that in the 2011 off @-@ season , the team parted ways with their long @-@ time starting defensive tackle Kelly Gregg . Cody spent the entire 2011 season as a full @-@ time starter , registering 34 tackles and helping lead the Ravens defense to be ranked 2nd in the league against the run , ranked 3rd overall . In 2011 , Cody eventually started all 16 games as the 3 @-@ 4 type defensive tackle and finished the year with 39 tackles and 1 pass defended . 
 With the acquiring of Ma <unk> Kemoeatu in the off @-@ season , Cody 's playing time was limited after a rough preseason and the Ravens using a 3 @-@ 4 type defense . In 15 games ( 3 starts ) of 2012 , Cody made 25 tackles with 3 passes defended . With the Ravens clinching an AFC North title on a 10 @-@ 6 record , the team eventually won Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers , giving Cody his first NFL championship title . 
 Despite Kemoeatu being released following the Super Bowl victory , Haloti Ngata took over as the starting defensive tackle , again limiting Cody 's playing time . In 2013 , Cody appeared in 12 games with 1 start making 15 tackles . 
 On April 4 , 2014 , Cody was re @-@ signed by the Ravens . He only appeared in 1 game of 2014 and did not record a single stat that year . 
 On January 23 , 2015 , the Ravens announced they had released Cody .

 On February 2 , 2015 , Cody was indicted on animal cruelty and drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury . The indictment included 15 charges : Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog , five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the same dog , one count of illegal possession of an alligator , five counts of animal abuse or neglect involving the alligator , one count of possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia , and one count of possession of marijuana . Cody 's agent , Peter Schaffer , denied his client 's guilt and said that Cody 's dog died of worms and that there was no animal cruelty . The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and starved to death . 
 On November 16 , 2015 , Cody was found not guilty of two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty but he was convicted of five other counts related to failing to provide care for his dog , Taz . He was also found guilty of illegally possessing an alligator and of neglecting the alligator , and also two misdemeanor drug charges related to marijuana and paraphernalia that police found in his former home . The alligator was confiscated , and relocated to a sanctuary . Prosecuting state attorney Adam Lippe alleged Taz suffered more than four weeks of starvation in a cage in Cody 's garage . 
 On January 4 , 2016 , Cody 's sentencing was delayed because a psychological evaluation of Cody was being completed at the time . 
 On March 24 , 2016 , Cody was sentenced to nine months in jail for his role in the dog 's starvation death and neglecting the illegal alligator . His girlfriend was acquitted of the aggravated animal cruelty , drug and alligator charges but found guilty of five counts in connection with neglecting Taz .

 By his own description of his early family life , Cody grew up poor . His mother worked two jobs , as a traveling nurse and a bus driver , to care for him and his seven younger siblings . His parents were not married , but his father , a construction worker , was a big part of his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11 . At the end of his junior year of high school , Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate . 
 In his two years at Alabama , Cody became the Tide 's most popular player because of his outsized personality and body . Says quarterback Greg McElroy : " He 's an enjoyable person to have on our team , have in the locker room , and ( he ) has great charisma . He has fun when he plays the game , and that 's a big reason why he 's so popular . "

 = U.S. Route 395 in California = 
 In the U.S. state of California , U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) is a 557 @-@ mile ( 896 km ) route which traverses from Interstate 15 near the southern city limits of Hesperia , north to the Oregon state line in Modoc County near Goose Lake . The route clips into Nevada , serving the cities Carson City and Reno , before returning to California . 
 Prior to truncation , US 395 served the metropolitan areas of San Diego and San Bernardino . The highway serves as a connection to the Los Angeles area for the communities of the Owens Valley , Mammoth Lakes and Mono Lake . The highway is used as an access for both the highest point in the contiguous United States , Mount Whitney , and the lowest point in North America , Death Valley . 
 The corridor has been used since the California gold rush , and before numbering was known by several names including El Camino Sierra . This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the Scenic Highway system . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The route of US 395 in California is split into two segments , as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada . The southern segment crosses the Mojave Desert and Owens Valley and passes east of the Sierra Nevada . The northern segment also follows the Sierra Nevada and crosses the Modoc Plateau . 
 = = = Mojave Desert = = = 
 U.S. Route 395 begins in Hesperia at a partial interchange with Interstate 15 as it heads north . The road enters into <unk> , on the western edge of Victorville . Victorville , founded by the Santa Fe Railroad to take advantage of water along the Mojave River , and for most of its history home to George Air Force Base , was the second fastest growing city in the United States for July 2006 to July 2007 . Although US 395 was once a rural road passing to the side of these cities , with growth these cities are encroaching on the highway and changing the character from rural to suburban . 
 After leaving the Victorville area the scenery changes , as suburban neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert . While crossing the desert , the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base . Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction . This is currently an at @-@ grade intersection ; however , SR 58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway . After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station . US 395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains , where the highway crosses into San Bernardino – Kern county line , near Johannesburg . While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line , now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad ( UP ) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave . Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station , US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine . 
 On the other side of the mountains is Indian Wells Valley , US 395 passes between the cities of Ridgecrest and Inyokern , where US 395 Bus. is located and is routed on South China Lake Boulevard . US 395 follows the western boundary of the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake , not far from Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons , where <unk> People created prolific rock art and traded with distant tribes using tools crafted of stone . The highway proceeds diagonally across the valley , until merging with State Route 14 . Prior to July 1 , 1964 , the part of State Route 14 between Interstate 5 and US 395 was part of US 6 that continued south to Long Beach . 
 Between Mojave and its junction with Route 395 , Route 14 follows the edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains . Formerly US 6 and US 395 ran concurrent from this junction north to Bishop . US 395 follows the valleys along the eastern edge of the Sierra as the mountains gradually increase in altitude until reaching their peak at over 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) near Lone Pine . After passing by three small lakes , Little Lake , North and South Haiwee Reservoirs , the highway enters the Owens Valley . 
 = = = Owens Valley = = = 
 US 395 traverses the entire length of the Owens Valley , entering the valley near the former site of the Owens Lake . The valley , named for one of explorer John C. Fremont 's guides , was primarily home to Timbisha and Paiutes before European settlement . Formerly a fertile lake and valley , Owens Lake and the southern portion of the valley are now dry . Water from the valley is channeled for use by the City of Los Angeles , via the Los Angeles Aqueduct , in what is commonly called the California Water Wars . 
 Along the shores of Owens Lake , the highway passes by Cartago and Olancha . Just north of the lake is Lone Pine . Lone Pine is noted as an access for both the highest point in the contiguous United States , Mount Whitney , and the lowest point in North America , Death Valley . Both Mount Whitney and the mountains surrounding Death Valley are visible from US 395 . From Lone Pine to Bishop , the US 395 corridor loosely follows another abandoned rail line , the Carson and Colorado Railroad , although for most of this run the rail line runs on the eastern edge of the valley , while the road mostly runs on the west edge . The US 395 corridor from Lone Pine north to the Nevada state line is noted for a high concentration of natural hot springs leading to area being known as the " hot springs jackpot " . 
 Past Lone Pine , the highway passes by Manzanar National Historic Site , a concentration camp where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II . The next community is Independence , the county seat of Inyo County and the home to the Eastern California Museum . Just north is the small Fort Independence Indian Reservation and the <unk> Reservoir . Nearby is where the Los Angeles Aqueduct is tapped from the Owens River ; with more vegetation visible north of this point . In this portion of the valley is Big Pine and the Big Pine Indian Reservation . 
 From here to Bishop the highway is overlapped with SR 168 . 
 At the north end of the valley sits Bishop , the largest city in the Owens Valley . Bishop serves as a gateway for the recreation areas of the Sierra Nevada , including Mammoth Mountain . At the north end of Bishop is the former separation with , and current terminus of , U.S. Route 6 , a 3 @,@ 205 @-@ mile ( 5 @,@ 158 km ) route which can take motorists ultimately to Provincetown , Massachusetts on the east coast . This point is also where the route of US 395 departs from former rail corridors , with the former Carson and Colorado grade following the modern US 6 corridor towards Hawthorne and Tonopah , Nevada . 
 The scenery changes dramatically past Bishop as the highway reaches the end of the valley and with a single ascent , gains over 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) in elevation . From here to <unk> , the highway is routed across spur ranges of the Sierra Nevada mountains . 
 = = = Sierra Nevada = = = 
 US 395 scales the Sierra Nevada on a ridge between the canyons of the Owens River and Rock Creek . Sherwin Summit , at 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , is the first of five mountain passes crossed by US 395 in the Sierra Nevada . The highway enters Mono County midway up the ascent , called the Sherwin Grade . 
 After cresting Sherwin Summit , the highway travels along the west shore of Crowley Lake . Crowley Lake is a reservoir for the City of Los Angeles 's <unk> , supplied by the Owens River . However US 395 does not resume following the river , instead cutting across the Long Valley Caldera to serve the ski resort area of Mammoth Lakes and Mammoth Mountain via SR 203 , after paralleling the runway of the Mammoth Yosemite Airport . 
 Eight miles past the junction leading to Mammoth , the highway crests the second summit , Deadman Summit , at 8 @,@ 036 feet ( 2 @,@ 449 m ) . This summit separates the Owens River watershed from that of Mono Lake , a salt lake with approximately three times the concentration of salt as the Ocean . 
 Along the descent towards Mono Lake , the highway passes near the community of June Lake , a recreation area where there are several freshwater lakes famous for trout fishing , and the June Mountain Ski Area . The June Lake area is served from June Lake Junction by the June Lake Loop Road ( SR 158 ) 
 Just before arriving at Mono Lake , US 395 has a brief concurrency with SR 120 ; the two routes separate at the southern end of Lee Vining . At this junction US 395 is 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Tioga Pass , along route 120 , the highest paved through route in California , and the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park . 
 Visible for miles , the highway finally passes Mono Lake , squeezed between the lake and the Sierra crest . The next geographic feature is Conway Summit . At 8 @,@ 138 feet ( 2 @,@ 480 m ) in altitude , this is the highest point along US 395 , and the highest point along a U.S. Highway in California . This Summit also separates the Mono Lake watershed from that of the East Walker River . 
 The highway descends Conway Summit via the tributaries of the East Walker River , heading towards Bridgeport and Bridgeport Reservoir . Along the descent the highway passes by Bodie , a ghost town which the state park system has preserved , including items still on the shelves in the abandoned stores . 
 The fourth summit crossed by US 395 in California is Devil 's Gate Pass , elevation 7 @,@ 519 feet ( 2 @,@ 292 m ) , which separates the East and West Walker Rivers . The winding descent from Devil 's Gate follows the West Walker River , exiting near the towns of Walker and Coleville in the Antelope Valley , a few miles south of Topaz Lake which is on the California @-@ Nevada State Line . 
 = = = Nevada = = = 
 Topaz Lake is where US 395 leaves California , to serve the Reno and Carson City metropolitan areas . The highway runs for 87 miles ( 140 km ) in Nevada . While in Nevada , the highway crosses one more pass , <unk> <unk> Summit , before exiting the mountains . The highway returns to follow the receding escarpment of the sierra . 
 = = = Honey Lake = = = 
 US 395 returns to California as a freeway , but is soon downgraded to a divided highway just past the state line . The road follows Long Valley Creek along the edge of the sierra towards Honey Lake . From this point north , the highway follows a rail line originally built by the Nevada @-@ California @-@ Oregon Railway ; the line is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad . 
 The highway enters the state in a corner of Sierra County , entering Lassen County just 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) later . A short segment in Lassen County is a freeway with one exit , SR 70 at the Hallelujah Junction . This exit is numbered 8 , even though it resides hundreds of miles from the origin of the highway ; the exit number instead uses the distance from the point of re @-@ entry to California . Though SR 70 does not directly serve any major cities , the highway is noted as an all @-@ weather crossing of the Sierras . Just less than 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from Hallelujah Junction is Beckwourth Pass , the lowest pass in the Sierra , used by both SR 70 and the Feather River Route . SR 70 was at one time numbered U.S. Route 40 Alternate , using US 395 from this junction south to Reno to connect with the mainline US 40 ( now Interstate 80 ) . Though driving route 70 and US 395 is a much longer route between Reno and Sacramento than mainline US 40 ( 130 miles ( 210 km ) versus 226 miles ( 364 km ) ) , the alternate route was more likely to be open during winter storms than US 40 , which crested the sierra at Donner Pass . 
 The highway proceeds towards and around the west side of 73 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 190 km2 ) Honey Lake while en route to Susanville . Although Susanville is used as a control city , US 395 does not technically enter the city . In a T @-@ intersection with State Route 36 just before Susanville , US 395 makes a sharp turn avoiding the city , making a near complete loop around the Susanville Municipal Airport . 
 = = = Modoc Plateau = = = 
 North of Susanville , the highway bends around Shaffer Mountain and crosses the Modoc Plateau . While en route , the highway serves the towns of <unk> , <unk> , and Madeline in Lassen County , as well as Likely in Modoc County . Here US 395 parallels the South Fork of the Pit River until the confluence with the north fork in Alturas . Past the confluence , the highway follows North Fork Pit River across Modoc County toward Goose Lake . The last junction in California is with SR 299 , former U.S. Route 299 , in Alturas . SR 299 can be used to travel west all the way to the western side of California at US 101 in Arcata , and east to Nevada State Route 8A at the Nevada state line . The two highways are briefly concurrent from Alturas to the XL Ranch Indian Reservation . US 395 travels in a north @-@ northeast direction for some last 50 miles ( 80 km ) in California , paralleling the east shore of Goose Lake just before crossing the Oregon state line at New Pine Creek , Oregon . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Camino Sierra = = = 
 The Camino Sierra was a trail from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe loosely paralleling modern State Route 14 , US 395 , and State Route 89 . The trail was first believed to be used by Jedediah Smith in 1826 . The trail was in common use by prospectors passing through the area because of the California gold rush and Comstock Lode . Though this area was not directly affected by the gold and silver rushes , the Owens Valley was more fertile than the areas around the strikes in Nevada . Farmers and ranchers raised cattle and other goods to trade with the mining boom towns nearby . The town of Bishop was established to trade goods with the mining town of Aurora . By 1860 , the Camino Sierra was an established trail appearing in maps and guides . After these mining rushes died down , the Camino Sierra saw a revival because of the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct beginning in 1908 . The route was promoted for its scenic value by the Southern Pacific Railroad , as a side trip from its rail lines , as far back as 1912 . By 1918 , the Camino Sierra had been included in the Blue Book , an early road atlas of the United States . 
 = = = Rail lines = = = 
 Both the northern and southern segments of the US 395 corridor were used by railroads built in the 1880s branching from the First Transcontinental Railroad in Nevada . Both lines where intended to connect the main Southern Pacific Railroad line in Nevada with other lines , but were never completed . 
 On May 20 , 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed , with the intent of extending a rail line from the existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne , Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River . Though the rail line was never finished , it did bring economic development to the valley . The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake . This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900 . There were plans to connect this narrow gauge line with SP 's standard gauge lines in the area , however these plans never materialized and the narrow gauge line was scrapped in 1959 . 
 The corridor for the northern segment was first used by the Nevada @-@ California @-@ Oregon Railway , a line also started in 1880 , at Reno , to connect with the Great Northern Railway in Oregon . This line also was never completed , ending at Lakeview , Oregon . A portion of this line is still active , through a series of acquisitions , the Union Pacific Railroad now owns this line . The portion from Reno to Hallelujah Junction is used as a connection between the Union Pacific 's two main lines in northern California / Nevada , the Overland Route ( First Transcontinental Railroad ) and the Feather River Route . 
 = = = U.S. Route 395 = = = 
 As first commissioned in 1926 , US 395 was a minor spur route of U.S. Route 195 connecting Spokane , Washington with Canada . During the 1930s , US 395 was extended from Spokane to San Diego , over the Camino Sierra , using several existing state routes . The extension first appeared on the Official Nevada Highway map in 1935 . By 1937 , US 6 had been extended to California , concurrent with US 395 between Bishop and Inyokern . 
 The new southern terminus of US 395 was at Pacific Highway ( former US 101 ) in San Diego . Traveling north , US 395 traversed much of the path of modern SR 163 and I @-@ 15 to Poway Road , where it routed to the east along much of today 's <unk> Road to Lake Hodges , with various realignments over the years . Portions of <unk> Road today are signed " Historic US 395 " . At Lake Hodges the highway crossed a now @-@ replaced bridge to Escondido . 
 Past Escondido the route passed through Fallbrook using portions of what is now SR 78 and SR 76 before returning to I @-@ 15 near Temecula . This portion was straightened to the route of modern I @-@ 15 , by 1960 . Past Temecula , the route followed SR 79 , SR 74 , I @-@ 215 and I @-@ 15 until reaching the modern terminus in Hesperia . This part would also be straightened with the construction of what is now I @-@ 215 . In 1969 , the portion south of Hesperia was removed and assigned to other routes . 
 Over time the road was paved , upgraded and straightened . Some parts are now built to freeway standards . Among the more notable upgrades , the Los Peñasquitos Creek Arch Bridge , along the portion of former US 395 now used by I @-@ 15 , was built in 1949 , and replaced in 1964 , with a second span built in 1977 . Today , US 395 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System .

It overhangs the front and back facades by 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) , but does not project the sides . At the time of the National Historic Register of Places nomination , the roof used wooden shingles . The interior has a single brick chimney that was used for the forge . The main floor was originally open , with only a single supporting post in the center , but this was later partitioned into several rooms . Modern additions to the shop include modern doors , electric lighting and heat , and a disappearing overhead stairway that leads to the attic . The shop 's cellar was not described in the survey . In 1915 , the house passed out of the Carpenter family , and it was restored by Norman Isham in 1916 . In 1956 , the building came into the ownership of the " Society of the Founders of Norwich , Connecticut , Inc . " . According to the 1966 edition of Fodor 's Modern Guides , the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop was " still furnished as it was when Mr. Carpenter plied his trade . " The National Historic Register of Places noted that the partitioning was " recent " at the time of its 1970 nomination . In 1997 , a $ 5000 grant was used to replace the roof .

 = Hurricane Kenna = 
 Hurricane Kenna is tied as the third @-@ most intense Pacific hurricane to strike the west coast of Mexico in recorded history . Kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression , thirteenth tropical storm , seventh hurricane , sixth major hurricane , and third Category 5 hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season . After forming on October 22 to the south of Mexico from a tropical wave , forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did . Moving into an area of favorable upper @-@ level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures , Kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) on October 25 while located about 255 mi ( 410 km ) southwest of Puerto Vallarta , Jalisco . Weakening as it turned to the northeast , the hurricane struck near San Blas , Nayarit , with winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) before dissipating on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains . 
 The name " Kenna " was retired from the list of Pacific hurricane names due to its effects on Mexico , which included US $ 101 million in damage and four deaths . The worst of the hurricane 's effects occurred between San Blas in Nayarit and Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco , where over 100 people were injured and thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed . 95 % of the buildings in San Blas were damaged , and hundreds of buildings were destroyed along coastal areas of Puerto Vallarta . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origin of Hurricane Kenna can be traced to a tropical wave moving westward through the Caribbean Sea on October 16 , possibly the same wave that passed near Barbados two days earlier . The wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 19 , and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized . Conditions favored continued development , and Dvorak classifications began late on October 20 . Early on October 22 , the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E while located about 375 mi ( 605 km ) south of Manzanillo , Colima . Initially the depression was disorganized , with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection . Computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60 hours ; as such the National Hurricane Center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) before weakening . 
 The depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center , and six hours after forming it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kenna . Upper @-@ level outflow and banding features improved in organization , as well . With warm water temperatures of over 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear , forecasters predicted Kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) within 72 hours of October 22 . The storm moved to the west @-@ northwest around the periphery of a mid @-@ level high @-@ pressure system , and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands . On October 23 , the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center , which coincided with a steady increase in strength . Late on October 23 , Kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380 mi ( 615 km ) southwest of Manzanillo . 
 Shortly after becoming a hurricane , Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17 mi ( 27 km ) wide eye located within its well @-@ defined central dense overcast . Early on October 24 Kenna became a major hurricane , and in a 24 ‑ hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) winds to 145 mph ( 235 km / h ) . After turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper @-@ level trough , Kenna attained peak winds of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) early on October 25 while located about 255 mi ( 410 km ) southwest of Puerto Vallarta , the third Category 5 hurricane of the season . A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913 mbar ( hPa ) , the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane . 
 Quickly after peaking , wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane , and by six hours after reaching peak intensity , the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) after the eye nearly dissipated . Despite a 27 mbar increase in pressure in 12 hours , convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall . On October 25 Hurricane Kenna struck near San Blas in the state of Nayarit with estimated winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico , and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains . The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 About 27 hours before landfall , Mexican officials issued a hurricane watch from Mazatlán to Cabo Corrientes , with a tropical storm watch issued further south to Manzanillo . Six hours later when its track became more apparent , the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to La Fortuna , with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo . 
 Roughly 8 @,@ 800 of the 9 @,@ 000 residents in the landfall location , San Blas , evacuated , which ultimately contributed to a low death toll . Officials ordered for the evacuation of 50 @,@ 000 residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of Mexico , including 3 @,@ 000 in the Islas Marías , 10 @,@ 000 near Mazatlán , and 15 @,@ 000 near flood @-@ prone areas . Civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas . The Mexican Red Cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215 tonnes of relief supplies such as food , water , clothing , and medicine to the Red Cross branch in Jalisco . Assistance from the Yucatán Peninsula delivered 10 tonnes of food and water , as well . The Mexican Red Cross prepared 20 emergency shelters in the state of Nayarit . Officials took security measures in Los Cabos , Baja California Sur , where the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane . Early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting , causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate site . Officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe conditions . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Few official surface observations are available for the passage of the hurricane . Upon making landfall , Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16 foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) storm surge in San Blas . The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta , with reports of 10 foot ( 3 m ) waves rushing inland from the bay . The hurricane dropped about 1 @.@ 38 inches ( 35 mm ) of precipitation while passing about 60 mi ( 95 km ) east of the offshore archipelago , Islas Marías . There , sustained winds reached an estimated 106 mph ( 170 km / h ) . On land , Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18 @.@ 91 inches ( 480 mm ) at San Ignacio , Sinaloa , and 12 @.@ 89 inches ( 327 mm ) near Manzanillo , Colima . The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) at Tepic , Nayarit , with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero , Michoacán , Colima , and Jalisco , and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas . 
 In San Blas , strong winds from the hurricane damaged or destroyed 95 % of the homes , with 1 @,@ 540 houses damaged and 8 @,@ 800 people affected . There , large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900 feet ( 275 m ) inland from their docks . An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her . Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean . Elsewhere in Nayarit , flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla . There , two elderly men drowned , one by falling into a river . Both were believed to have been killed during the storm as they fled their homes . In Santiago <unk> , the hurricane damaged 3 @,@ 770 homes , and throughout Nayarit , strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses . Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30 Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane . Kenna destroyed the entire banana , tobacco , and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas , <unk> , and <unk> , leaving more than 700 subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food . 
 In Puerto Vallarta , about 100 mi ( 164 km ) southeast of the landfall location , the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US $ 5 million , primarily to hotels . The surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas , and extended up to 330 feet ( 100 m ) inland . Waist @-@ deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars , ruining several vehicles . The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150 stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels . Damage to the city 's port was minor . 
 The hurricane injured at least 52 in Puerto Vallarta and dozens in San Blas from widespread flying glass and other forms of debris , with two people seriously injured due to the hurricane . Ten municipalities suffered substantial damage , with insured damage in Mexico totaling US $ 96 million . Rainfall from the hurricane spread across northern Mexico , causing minor flash floods and mudslides . 
 The remnants of Kenna entered the south @-@ central United States , resulting in enhanced rainfall in various locations . 
 = = Retirement , aftermath and records = = 
 After the season had ended , the World Meteorological Organization , retired the name Kenna and replaced it with Karina . 
 The Mexican government declared the region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area , allowing for the usage of emergency funds . Immediately after the passage of the hurricane , the Mexican Red Cross prepared 180 technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125 MT of food , medicine , and clothes to the areas most affected . The Mexican government deployed the Mexican Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population . The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area , and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food . Grupo Modelo , brewers of Corona beer , sent 6 @,@ 600 gallons ( 25 @,@ 000 liters ) of drinking water and 1000 food sets for the San Blas area . 
 <unk> and dump trucks gradually removed the debris and sand from San Blas . Dozens of <unk> , municipal employees , and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked to clear the debris caused by the storm . The remaining stores , bars , and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town . By about two months after the hurricane , most hotels , restaurants , and shops were reopened . 
 Hurricane Kenna is currently tied with a hurricane in 1957 and the 1959 Mexico hurricane as the third most intense Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico . The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at a greater intensity were Patricia of 2015 and Madeline of 1976 . Kenna is the third most intense October tropical cyclone to have occurred in the East Pacific , and is the fourth most intense East Pacific hurricane on record , behind Hurricane Patricia of 2015 , Hurricane Linda of 1997 and Hurricane Rick of 2009 . 
 = 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team = 
 The 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1997 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season . In its third year under head coach Lloyd Carr , Michigan compiled a perfect 12 – 0 record , won the Big Ten Conference championship , defeated Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl , and was declared the national champion by the Associated Press and numerous other polls . The Nebraska Cornhuskers , who also went undefeated and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl , captured the top spot in the final Coaches ' Poll . 
 Michigan 's defense was led by cornerback and Heisman Trophy @-@ winner Charles Woodson . Woodson , who intercepted eight passes and also scored touchdowns via pass receptions , runs from scrimmage and punt return , became the first primarily defensive player to win the Heisman . Woodson and defensive end Glen Steele were both first @-@ team selections on the 1997 College Football All @-@ America Team . Other standouts on defense included linebackers James Hall with 8 @.@ 5 quarterback sacks , Sam Sword with 91 tackles , and Dhani Jones with 90 tackles and six sacks . The defense allowed no fourth quarter points or second half touchdowns in the first eight games of the season . The unit 's performance across all games in total defense ( 222 @.@ 8 yards per game ) and scoring defense ( 9 @.@ 5 points per game ) are the lowest marks by any Big Ten Conference football team since the 1985 season . 
 On offense , the 1997 Michigan team had neither a 1000 @-@ yard rusher nor a 500 @-@ yard receiver . Tai Streets was the leading receiver with 476 receiving yards , and Chris Howard led the team in rushing with 938 rushing yards . Quarterback Brian Griese set Michigan single @-@ season records with 193 pass completions and 307 pass attempts . Tight end Jerame Tuman , who was the only player on the offensive unit selected as a first @-@ team All @-@ American , totaled 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns . 
 Ten members of the team were honored as All @-@ Big Ten Conference selections , and running back Anthony Thomas was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year . Thirty @-@ one members of the 1997 Wolverines football team went on to play in the NFL . Prior to 1997 , the Wolverines had compiled four consecutive four @-@ loss seasons and had not won a national championship since the 1948 Michigan team .

 Pre @-@ season ranking 
 Going into the 1997 season , the Wolverines were ranked No. 17 in the pre @-@ season Coaches ' Poll and had experienced four consecutive four @-@ loss seasons for the first time since the 1934 – 1937 Michigan Wolverines football teams . Michigan had not won a national championship in nearly 50 years and had not played in a Rose Bowl Game since the 1992 season . The 1997 Michigan team was the first since the 1969 team to have no Rose Bowl veterans . In early September 1997 , The Columbus Dispatch wrote off Michigan , noting that " the longtime beast of the Big Ten ... has lost much of its aura " and predicting that Michigan 's 1997 schedule " doesn 't create a feeling that the pendulum is about to swing back . " 
 Quarterback competition 
 The months before the 1997 season opener featured uncertainty over the quarterback position . Junior Scott Dreisbach had started 11 games for the 1996 team , but fifth @-@ year senior Brian Griese had relieved Driesbach in the Ohio State game after Driesbach was injured and helped the team recover from a 9 – 0 deficit . Dreisbach and Griese also faced competition from sophomore and future Super Bowl MVP , Tom Brady . Shortly before the season opener , head coach Lloyd Carr announced his selection of Griese as the starting quarterback . 
 Receiving corps 
 Despite uncertainty at quarterback , Michigan entered the 1997 season with a solid group of receivers , including Tai Streets and Russell Shaw , as well as returning All @-@ Big Ten tight end Jerame Tuman . Analysts believed that a solid season by any of the Michigan quarterbacks could lead to a productive season in the passing game . Moreover , it was anticipated that Charles Woodson , who was regarded as one of the most versatile athletes in college football , would play on offense . 
 Offensive line 
 The offensive line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team . Three linemen from the 1996 team had been selected in the 1997 NFL Draft : center Rod Payne ( 3rd round , 76th overall ) , offensive guard Damon Denson ( 4th round , 97th overall ) and defensive tackle William Carr ( 7th round , 217th overall ) . As a result , Michigan began the season with only one offensive lineman , offensive tackle Jon Jansen , who had started a game . Jansen , a junior , had 25 consecutive starts entering the season . The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle , Jeff Backus , suffered a ruptured appendix . In spring practice , offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting , searching for talent to fill in on the line . To fill the holes on the offensive line , two defensive linemen , Steve Hutchinson and Chris <unk> were moved to the offensive line . 
 Strength of schedule 
 Adding to the challenges facing the 1997 team , Michigan entered the season with the toughest schedule among the 112 NCAA Division I @-@ A schools based on records from the previous year . Days before the season opener , Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest . Carr noted , " It 's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest . But Mount Everest has been climbed . And with great preparation and determination , and great attitude , which I think our players have , I can assure you we 're looking forward to it . "

 Michigan opened the 1997 season with a home game against Colorado . Three years earlier , Colorado had defeated Michigan in a game nicknamed " The Miracle at Michigan " on Kordell Stewart 's 64 @-@ yard Hail Mary pass to Michael Westbrook as time ran out . 
 Michigan won the 1997 game 27 to 3 , a margin that eliminated the possibility of another last @-@ minute miracle . Griese completed 21 of 28 forward pass attempts for 258 yards and two touchdowns . Tight end Jerame Tuman had five receptions for 126 yards . Defensively , Michigan intercepted four passes thrown by Colorado 's John Hessler , while holding him to 141 yards on 15 of 39 passing . 
 Throughout the game , Michigan relied on man @-@ to @-@ man defense from cornerbacks Woodson and Andre Weathers , blitzes and pressure from the four @-@ man defensive line . Colorado only threw against Woodson five times , and one of those passes was intercepted by Woodson at Michigan 's 45 @-@ yard @-@ line . Griese and Tuman connected for 53 yards on the very next play . Two plays later Chris Floyd executed a one @-@ yard dive for the first points of the day . Late in the second quarter , Griese completed a 29 @-@ yard pass to Woodson , and Kraig Baker kicked a field goal on the final play of the first half to give Michigan a 10 – 0 lead at halftime . 
 Michigan opened the second half with an 89 @-@ yard , 11 @-@ play drive that included a 20 @-@ yard pass from Griese to Tuman followed by a roughing the passer penalty . The drive ended in a five @-@ yard touchdown pass from Griese to Chris Howard . In the third quarter , Michigan scored 14 points in a span of one minute and 44 seconds ; the second touchdown followed a Clint Copenhaver interception that was returned to the Buffaloes ' 14 @-@ yard line . The touchdown was scored on a 6 @-@ yard pass from Griese to Shaw . Baker closed out the scoring with a 19 @-@ yard field goal in the fourth quarter . 
 The loss was Colorado 's worst defeat under head coach Rick Neuheisel , its lowest point total in 101 games , and fewest yards of total offense ( 224 ) in five years .

Michigan took the lead with 5 : 39 remaining in the first quarter on a 10 @-@ yard wide receiver screen play from Griese to Woodson . Chris Howard added two touchdowns in the second quarter to give Michigan a 21 – 3 lead at halftime . Howard 's second touchdown capped a 14 @-@ play , 92 @-@ yard drive that consumed four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes . 
 True freshman Anthony Thomas scored on a two @-@ yard run in the third quarter to complete Michigan 's second 92 @-@ yard drive of the day . In the fourth quarter , Woodson had a 34 @-@ yard touchdown catch called back due to a false start penalty , but Jay Feely kicked a 51 @-@ yard field goal .

 Michigan outgained Baylor 532 – 154 in total offense . The Wolverines totaled 344 rushing yards , including 112 yards by Howard and 122 yards by Thomas . Clarence Williams added 129 yards of total offense , including 77 yards rushing . Griese completed 13 of 22 passes for 169 yards and no interceptions , and Woodson had two receptions for 45 yards . 
 On defense , the Wolverines held Baylor to 32 yards in the second half , allowing three plays on its first four possessions of the second half . Woodson allowed no catches and made five unassisted tackles ( three for a loss ) . He played 46 downs on defense , six on special teams and five on offense . The win improved Michigan to 16 – 6 – 2 against the Big 12 Conference and 9 – 0 in September under Carr . 
 = = = Week 3 : Notre Dame = = = 
 For the third game of the season , Michigan faced Notre Dame in the 27th match between college football 's winningest programs . Michigan won the game 21 – 14 in front of a crowd of 106 @,@ 508 , the sixth largest in the history of Michigan Stadium at that time . Under first year coach Bob Davie , Notre Dame had lost consecutive games to Purdue and Michigan State , and entered Michigan Stadium unranked for the first time since the creation of the AP Poll in 1936 . Notre Dame ended the day with its first three @-@ game losing streak in 12 years . 
 In the first quarter , Notre Dame scored first on a 15 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Ron <unk> to Bobby Brown , culminating a 12 @-@ play , 78 @-@ yard drive . In the second quarter , the Wolverines tied the game on a 4 @-@ yard touchdown run by Clarence Williams to complete an 11 @-@ play , 68 @-@ yard drive . Notre Dame regained the lead late in the second quarter on a 98 @-@ yard drive ending in a two @-@ yard run by Tony Driver with 18 seconds left in the half . 
 Within the first 24 seconds of the second half , Griese and Streets connected on back @-@ to @-@ back passes of 15 and 41 yards to tie the game at 14 . Michigan scored again just over five minutes later on a 14 @-@ yard run by Floyd . Michigan 's defense overcame three fourth @-@ quarter turnovers and held Notre Dame scoreless in the second half to preserve the 21 – 14 lead . After Aaron Shea lost a fumble at the Michigan 47 @-@ yard line , cornerback Tommy Hendricks made a diving interception in the end zone with 10 : 34 remaining in the game . When Notre Dame recovered a loose ball two minutes later at the Wolverines 42 @-@ yard line , Michigan 's defense forced a punt after a three @-@ and @-@ out . The Wolverines suffered a third turnover late in the fourth quarter when Griese and Chris Howard botched a handoff that Notre Dame recovered at the Michigan 28 @-@ yard line . Notre Dame drove to the 20 @-@ yard line , but Glen Steele and James Hall made a key stop on fourth down . Howard helped Michigan run out the final 3 : 26 with runs of 27 , seven , nine and eight yards . 
 Notre Dame outgained Michigan in total offense by a margin of 354 yards to 345 yards .

 = John Evelyn Duigan = 
 Major General Sir John Evelyn Duigan , KBE , CB , DSO ( 30 March 1883 – 9 January 1950 ) was an officer who served with the New Zealand Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars . He was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1937 to 1941 . 
 Born in Wanganui , New Zealand , in 1883 , Duigan joined a unit of colonial volunteers during the Boer War . He was wounded and repatriated to New Zealand , but later returned to South Africa with the 10th New Zealand Contingent . After the war , he joined the New Zealand Military Forces as a professional soldier . During the First World War , he commanded the New Zealand Tunnelling Company and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service . From 1917 to 1918 he served in staff and training positions . He also served in staff positions in the postwar military , eventually rising to the rank of colonel and commanding Northern Command by 1930 . In 1937 , he was promoted to major general and appointed the Chief of the General Staff . He oversaw a reduction in the size of the New Zealand Territorial Force and did little to prevent the New Zealand Government from directing its attention on the Royal New Zealand Air Force to the detriment of the army . Overlooked for command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force , which was raised for service abroad during the Second World War , he retired from the military in 1941 . He died nine years later at the age of 66 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Evelyn Duigan was born in Wanganui , New Zealand , on 30 March 1883 . His father , James Duigan , worked as a miller at the time of his son 's birth but later became the editor of the local newspaper . Duigan was educated at Wanganui Collegiate . After leaving school , he went to South Africa , where he joined Brabant 's Horse , a local unit of colonial volunteers raised to fight in the Boer War . 
 Within weeks of Duigan 's arrival in South Africa , he was seriously wounded during the siege of <unk> . Although he recovered , he was later injured when his horse fell on him . He was repatriated to New Zealand in December 1900 but rejoined his volunteer unit in South Africa once he had recovered . After returning to New Zealand for a second time at the end of 1901 , he enlisted in the 10th Contingent , a New Zealand unit destined for service in the Boer War , as an officer . The fighting was largely over by the time the contingent arrived in mid @-@ 1902 and it saw no fighting . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Duigan joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1903 as a cadet and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal New Zealand Engineers in 1905 . After attending courses in England on engineering and signalling , he became an instructor at the Defence Department in Wellington . He was transferred to the New Zealand militia and then to the New Zealand Staff Corps in January 1911 . From 1912 , Duigan spent two years at the Staff College in Quetta , India . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 In late 1914 , Duigan was seconded to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) , which was then preparing to depart for service overseas . After the NZEF reached the Middle East , Duigan suffered a nervous breakdown . He returned to New Zealand in June 1915 , after a period of recuperation in England . In late 1915 he was promoted to major and appointed commander of the recently formed New Zealand Tunnelling Company . The company arrived in France in March 1916 and served on the Western Front in the vicinity of Arras . In late June , Duigan was involved in a motor vehicle accident that left him in hospital for over a month . His service with the company was later recognised with an award of the Distinguished Service Order . 
 From 1917 , Duigan held a series of staff officer positions . He had a short stint with the headquarters of the New Zealand Division , and then VI Corps . He was mentioned in despatches for his service while attached to VI Corps . By mid @-@ 1917 , Duigan 's health was declining and he was transferred to England for service with the New Zealand Infantry Reserve Group as brigade major . He then held an instructor position at an officers ' training school in England . In March 1918 , he was sent to the United States to assist in the promotion of war bonds , and returned to New Zealand in October 1918 . 
 = = = Interwar period = = = 
 His service with the NZEF terminated , Duigan returned to the New Zealand Staff Corps . He was posted as a staff officer in the Auckland Military District , and by 1930 was in overall command of the district ( later reorganised as Northern Command ) . The following year he was promoted to colonel . In 1935 , he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal . On 1 April 1937 , Duigan was promoted to major general and appointed Commandant and General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) of the New Zealand Military Forces , the first New Zealand @-@ born soldier to achieve this position . When the Commandant and GOC role was restructured shortly after commencement of his term , he remained in the senior leadership role in the New Zealand Military Forces as its first Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) . He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath . 
 As CGS , Duigan proved to be an undistinguished appointment and was not particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day . He implemented several organisational changes , one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military . When the board was established in November 1937 , it included Fred Jones , the Minister of Defence , and Duigan as first military member . Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time , and this affected morale within the army . 
 One of Duigan 's most significant changes resulted in the downsizing of the Territorial Force ( TF ) , which was already in a state of decline . Current recruitment was insufficient to support the theoretical infantry division and three mounted rifle brigades that the TF mobilisation plans called for . Duigan downsized the division to a brigade group and three lots of fortress troops centred around Auckland , Wellington , and Lyttelton . Many infantry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted as battalions , while the mounted regiments were each reduced to the size of a squadron . Several senior officers were placed in retirement as well . The morale of the TF declined as the remaining senior officers raised concerns — disregarded by Duigan — over the state of the army . Four TF colonels publicly protested the reforms in the press in what became known as the Four Colonels ' Revolt . This was a breach of military regulations , which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do so . Instead of a court @-@ martial , which he feared would generate public sympathy for the colonels , Duigan placed all four officers on the retired list as punishment . The revolt did result in greater public awareness of the poor state of New Zealand 's military but little was done to rectify the situation . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) , which was to be raised for service in Europe . Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that he was not a popular choice within the military or the New Zealand Government . Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF , and Duigan 's term as CGS was extended . Throughout 1940 , Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF , and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription . He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India , and made tours of the 2NZEF while it was in the Middle East . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Duigan retired from the military in May 1941 , having been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire the previous year . He died in Havelock North on 9 January 1950 , survived by his second wife , who he had married in 1947 , and two sons from his first marriage ( which ended upon the death of his wife in 1940 ) . A third son , also from his first marriage , was killed while serving with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War . 
 = One Child ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " One Child " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her second Christmas album / thirteenth studio album , Merry Christmas II You ( 2010 ) . It was written and produced by Carey in collaboration with Broadway composer Marc Shaiman . Backed by a children 's choir , the lyrics are about the birth of Jesus . " One Child " received a mixed to negative response from critics , many of whom disapproved of the overbearing sentiment . In the United States , the track peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Gospel Digital Chart , and on the lower regions of the South Korea international single 's charts . Carey performed the song at the Christmas in Washington event in November 2010 . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 Carey wrote and produced " One Child " with Broadway composer Marc Shaiman . It was reported by Showbiz411 in August 2010 that Carey had enlisted Shaiman to work on the then untitled album ; the magazine described the pairing as " unusual " but noted that the outcome could be " colossal " . Lasting for a duration of four minutes and twenty @-@ five seconds , the song is one of two original ballads included on Merry Christmas II You . It encompasses a range of genres , including Christmas , adult contemporary , urban contemporary and religious music . 
 The music and Carey 's vocals recorded by Brian Garten at several recording studios , which included Henson Studios and 20th Century Fox Scoring Stage in Los Angeles , Guardian Angel Studios Bel Air , Germano Studios New York City and Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood . It was mixed by Phil Tan at The Ninja beat Club in Atlanta . Damien Lewis served as his assistant . " One Child " was arranged by Shaiman , and he carried out the orchestration with Brad <unk> . The song , in the key of C major , has a " tenderly " feel and a tempo of 64 beats per minute . The track is backed by a children 's chorus , which was recorded by Martin Cooke . Assisted by Kenta Yonesaka , Alex <unk> , Peter Stanislaus , Charlie <unk> , Tim Lauber , Tom Steel , Greg <unk> and Denis St. Amand . The children who participated in the chorus were Mariah Britt , Joshua Britt , <unk> Johnson , <unk> Johnson , Mason Johnson , Delaney Meyer , Elsie Moon and <unk> <unk> ; their voices span from G3 to F ♯ 5 . Carey provided her background vocals alongside Melonie Daniels , Sharlotte Gibson , Sherry McGhee and Nicki Richards . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " One Child " garnered a mixed to negative response from critics . Andy Gill for The Independent thought that the children 's choir gave the song a " Jackson 5 @-@ esque glutinous " feel . A reviewer for Sputnikmusic described the song as a rewrite of " Jesus Born on This Day " , written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff for the singer 's first Christmas album , Merry Christmas ( 1994 ) . Mike Diver for BBC wrote that although the song is " bogged down in sentiment " , " any unpleasantness in the mouth is soon washed clean by the arrival of that hit " , while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration as " gooey " . Jack Foley of IndieLondon echoed Diver 's observation about its sentiment , writing that the " more serious songs " on the album such as " One Child " , " Oh Come All Ye Faithful " and " Auld Lang Syne " are " stifling " and makes the album an " endurance test " . He continued with " Hence , Auld Lang Syne , One Child and Oh Come All Ye Faithful literally make your skin crawl and howling for the nearest slice of Linkin Park to add some musical grit to your life . " The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak was critical of the song , describing it as a " needless retelling " of the birth of Jesus that does not add anything new or original to the story of his birth . He continued to write that he was not surprised at the outcome of the song as Carey is not a historian .

 Accompanied by a gospel choir , Carey performed " One Child " and " O Come All Ye Faithful " at the Christmas in Washington event at the National Building Museum in Washington , D.C .. The performance aired on December 17 , 2010 , on TNT . Wearing a " billowy red dress adorned with a bow , " it was noted by Idolator that Carey decided not to perform her " modern yuletide staple " " All I Want for Christmas Is You " or the first single from the album " Oh Santa ! " in favor of " subdued and graceful tracks " .

McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay ( Ashleigh Brewer ) had given Rebecca Robinson ( Jane Hall ) a false alibi , Lyn Scully ( Janet Andrewartha ) points out that Diana Marshall ( Jane Badler ) earring was found at the crime scene and Andrew Robinson ( Jordan Smith ) did not help himself with his attitude towards the investigation .

" McGregor later explained that it had been " great " to be involved in the storyline , even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis , as he was in a hospital bed . Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit . However , Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis .

 = = = Relationship with Kate Ramsay = = = 
 In November 2010 , it was announced that Mark would begin a relationship with Kate Ramsay ( Ashleigh Brewer ) . Mark interviewed Kate while he was investigating who pushed Paul . Of their first meeting , McGregor commented " [ He ] thinks she 's pretty cute but not a lot comes of it later , but there 's a bit of a spark there . " McGregor opined that Kate and Mark were a good match . Mark asked Kate to dinner , but she turned him down . She later changed her mind when he rescued her from lawyers , Toadfish Rebecchi ( Ryan Moloney ) and Samantha Fitzgerald ( Simone Buchanan ) . Brewer welcomed the storyline , believing that her character was ready to move on from her previous relationship with Declan Napier ( Erin Mullally ) . When Declan appeared during Kate and Mark 's date , Kate was " furious " that he still had a hold on her life . Despite Kate telling Declan that she was over him , Declan saw Mark as a threat . McGregor commented that Mark put Declan 's nose out of joint . Declan became a nuisance and tried to control Kate by telling her that Mark had threatened and attacked him . Kate initially believed Declan , but when she discovered the truth she had to work to get Mark back . 
 The incident helped push their romance into " top gear " . Kate went to the police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues . McGregor called his first on @-@ screen kiss with Brewer " awkward " . Mark liked Kate as she was " a pretty easy @-@ going girl who doesn 't let too much get to her " , but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work . He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them . McGregor told Holy Soap , " Kate 's 19 and my character is about 25 . It 's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it , but I think it 's because of what they do and where they are in life . At one point Kate 's having driving lessons , and I 'm working as a detective who 's moved up through the ranks quickly , so we do seem quite different in age , but it 's better left unsaid I think ! " He added that Mark and Kate 's relationship " may not be the easiest of rides . " 
 Mark and Kate broke up after Kate confessed to lying in her police statement during Paul 's investigation . McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark did not stop loving Kate and that since he had time to think about it , the issue was not as " black and white " as he first thought . Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning ( Chris Milligan ) had taken an interest in Kate and he did not like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle . McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate , it forced Mark to come up with a plan to get closer to his ex @-@ girlfriend . McGregor said , " He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through ! " Mark later asked Lucas for his advice , but Lucas was not much help . Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said , " They both have a lot of history , such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate , and this prevents them from moving forward . " The actress believed Mark was " the one " for Kate as they were both academic and focused . 
 = = = One @-@ night stand and police corruption = = = 
 In April 2011 , a TV Week columnist reported that Mark would have a one @-@ night stand with Kate 's best friend , Jade Mitchell ( Gemma Pranita ) . At the same time , Mark also became involved in a police corruption storyline , after he reported Constable Wes Holland ( Daniel Hamill ) , for taking bribes . McGregor told an Inside Soap writer , " Mark 's life has been turned upside down since he blew the whistle on Constable Holland " , adding that he was now being treated like he did the wrong thing . When Mark went to Charlie 's to escape his troubles at the police station , he met up with Jade . They kissed as Jade became " the perfect distraction " for him . An Inside Soap reporter observed that of all the women Mark could have sought comfort in , Jade seemed the most unlikely as there was tension between them . Jade believed Mark had sided with Toadie against her sister and she told Kate not to give him a second chance . 
 After Jade challenged Mark to a game of pool , " sparks of a different kind " began to fly between them . McGregor explained the situation : " Mark has had a really bad day at work , so he 's out for a fun night . To his surprise , he enjoys Jade 's company . Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss . " The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade had spent the night together and Mark was full of regret . Mark was " terrified " that Kate would find out and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet , he does not feel any less guilty . Mark 's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down . Despite talking to his superior officer , nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place .

When asked whether Kate and Mark 's reunion would be bittersweet , McGregor explained " Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they had fallen out of love . But things are different now and Kate has a new boyfriend . When Brennan tells her he still loves her it 's hard because she thought he was dead and had let go of him . " 
 On 28 October 2013 , it was confirmed that McGregor had returned again and was filming at the show 's studios and on location in <unk> .

" Holy Soap said Mark 's most memorable moment was " His first kiss with Kate – at the police station in front of all his colleagues ! " In March 2011 , Mark came second in a poll run by Inside Soap magazine to find reader 's favourite " hunky " soap detective . He received 31 % of the vote .

 Mystic Seaport Light is a lighthouse at the south end of Mystic Seaport , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) upriver from Noank , Connecticut . The light is a two @-@ story white shingled structured topped with a glass @-@ enclosed lantern and is a replica of the 1901 Brant Point Light . The Mystic Seaport Light was designed by William F. Herman Jr. and constructed in 1966 . It was formally dedicated in August 31 , 1967 , but remained unlit due to active navigational regulations imposed by the United States Coast Guard . The Mystic Seaport light is now an active light , but not an official aid to navigation . 
 The structure was used as an example of a lighthouse for Mystic Seaport visitors , but was not part of an exhibit until a 2008 renovation . The interior of the lighthouse was equipped with five LCD televisions to display two short educational films that highlight the history and architectural diversity of American lighthouses . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The Mystic Seaport Light was designed by William F. Herman Jr. and constructed by Engineered Building in 1966 . Funds for the project were donated by Mr. and Mrs. John P. Blair . Mr. Blair was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Marine Historical Association since 1963 . The Marine Historical Association was the original name for the Mystic Seaport . Prior to the construction of the light , a total of $ 5 @,@ 000 was donated by Coast Guard Auxiliary members from Maine and Delaware to build the keeper 's cottage . 
 The original artist 's conception called for a generic lighthouse that was designed to be representative of all lighthouses , but the actual design of the lighthouse was later changed to a replica of the 1901 Brant Point Light located on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts . Constructed on the tip of Shipyard Point , it is a two @-@ story white shingled structure topped with a glass @-@ enclosed lantern . The light measures 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) by 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) by 38 feet ( 12 m ) . The lighthouse houses a fourth order Fresnel lens . 
 The design of the keeper 's house did not change much from the original artist 's conception , though Tim Harrison notes that " it does not resemble a typical lighthouse keeper 's house . " The dedication of the lighthouse was held on August 31 , 1967 , which was described as " another quiet [ , ] but proud ceremony " by Mystic Seaport .

 In 1979 , Brierley noted that the present use of the lighthouse remained as " [ a ] n example of a lighthouse used as a navigational aid . " Regardless of its intended function , the lighthouse was used as the starting mark for the Mystic River Day seine boat race in 1981 .

 = James Bowdoin = 
 James Bowdoin II ( / <unk> / ; August 7 , 1726 – November 6 , 1790 ) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston , Massachusetts , during the American Revolution and the following decade . He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant . He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s . Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors , he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence . He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis <unk> as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies . 
 From 1775 to 1777 he served as president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress ' executive council , the de facto head of the Massachusetts government . He was elected president of the constitutional convention that drafted the state 's constitution in 1779 , and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1780 , losing to John Hancock . In 1785 , following Hancock 's resignation , he was elected governor . Due to the large debts of Massachusetts , incurred from the Revolutionary War , Bowdoin ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility . During his two years in office the combination of poor economic conditions and his harsh fiscal policy laid down by his government led to the uprising known as Shays ' Rebellion . Bowdoin personally funded militia forces that were instrumental in putting down the uprising . His high @-@ handed treatment of the rebels may have contributed to his loss of the 1787 election , in which the populist Hancock was returned to office . 
 In addition to his political activities , Bowdoin was active in scientific pursuits , collaborating with Benjamin Franklin in his pioneering research on electricity . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London , and was a founder and first president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , to whom he bequeathed his library . Bowdoin College in Maine was named in his honor after a bequest by his son James III . 
 = = Early life = = 
 James Bowdoin II was born in Boston to Hannah Portage Bowdoin and James Bowdoin , a wealthy Boston merchant . His grandfather , Pierre Baudouin , was a Huguenot refugee from France . Pierre took his family first to Ireland , then to eastern Massachusetts ( present @-@ day Maine ) , before finally settling in Boston in 1690 . James Bowdoin I had a modest inheritance from his parents , but greatly expanded his father 's merchant business and land holdings to become one of the wealthiest men in the province . Young James attended the South Grammar School ( now Boston Latin School ) , then graduated from Harvard College in 1745 . When his father died in 1747 , he inherited a considerable fortune . He married Elizabeth Erving , daughter of his Harvard roommate , in 1748 . They had two children . That same year , he went back to Harvard to receive his master 's degree . 
 = = Scientific and other pursuits = = 
 Bowdoin may have met Benjamin Franklin as early as 1743 , and the two became frequent collaborators and correspondents on scientific subjects . During his Harvard years , he was educated in the sciences by John Winthrop , and developed an interest in electricity and astronomy . In 1750 Bowdoin traveled to Philadelphia to meet with Franklin . Bowdoin was interested in Franklin 's experiments on electricity , and Franklin solicited his advice on papers he prepared for submission to the Royal Society . Through the offices of Franklin , some of Bowdoin 's letters were read to the Society . Bowdoin was instrumental in gaining support in the provincial assembly for an expedition to Newfoundland to observe the 1761 transit of Venus across the sun , and in the same year published a treatise suggesting improvements to the telescope . In 1785 he published a series of memoirs arguing against Isaac Newton 's theory that light was transmitted by " corpuscles " , citing both natural observations and Scripture . 
 Bowdoin maintained a lifelong interest in the sciences . In 1780 he was one of the founders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He served as its first president until his death and left the society his library . Bowdoin published not only scientific papers , but poetry in both English and Latin . He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh and made a fellow of Harvard . His 1788 election to the Royal Society of London was the first such honor bestowed on an American after independence . 
 Bowdoin also had extensive business interests . Although he was often characterized as a merchant , and he engaged in the Atlantic trade , his principal interest was in land . His inheritance included major tracts of land , most of which he kept , in present @-@ day Maine as well as in the agriculturally rich Elizabeth Islands off the state 's south coast . Bowdoin expanded his holdings , eventually acquiring property in all of the New England states except Rhode Island . He was one of the managing proprietors of a large territory on the Kennebec River , where he was frequently involved in legal proceedings with squatters on the land , and with competing land interests . The dealings with squatters in particular left Bowdoin with a dislike of the lower classes in Massachusetts society , something that affected his politics . His inheritance also included an ironworks in Attleboro ( now Bridgewater ) that he sold in 1770 , apparently because it was too time @-@ consuming to manage . Despite the upheavals of the Revolution , Bowdoin was careful to always manage his financial affairs . He supported the cause of independence financially , but he did so without damaging his own business interests , unlike John Hancock , whose business suffered from neglect . 
 In later years he served as the first president of the Massachusetts Bank in 1784 and was also the first president of the Massachusetts Humane Society ( an organization initially devoted to rescuing survivors from shipwrecks and other water @-@ based disasters ) . 
 = = Governor 's Council and opposition to British rule = = 
 Bowdoin was elected to the provincial assembly in 1753 and served there until named to the governor 's council in 1756 . Although at first supportive of the royal governor , his politics became more radical as British colonial policy became increasingly unpopular , and Bowdoin believed those policies would have a negative effect on the New England economy . Personal factors may also have played a role in Bowdoin 's shift in views : John Temple , the local customs commissioner and Bowdoin 's son in law , was embroiled in nasty disputes with Governor Francis Bernard in the 1760s . By 1769 Bowdoin was one of the principal spokesmen of the opposition to the governor on the council . In that year Bernard rejected Bowdoin 's renewed election to the council . Bowdoin , however , was instrumental in causing Bernard 's downfall from office . Private letters critical of the provincial government that Bernard had written were published in 1769 to great outrage . Bowdoin rebutted the charges and claims made in Bernard 's letters , and published a highly polemic pamphlet arguing for Bernard 's removal that was sent to the colonial secretary , Lord Hillsborough . 
 Bowdoin won reelection to the assembly in 1770 , and was promptly reelected to the council the same year , soon after Bernard left the province . Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson acquiesced to Bowdoin 's return to the council , reasoning that he was less dangerous there than as an outspoken critic in the lower house . However , the seat Bowdoin vacated in the assembly was taken by Samuel Adams , another leading political opponent of the royal governors , and Hutchinson was faced with the prospect of opposition on both fronts . 
 After the Boston Massacre on March 5 , 1770 , Bowdoin was chosen by the Boston town meeting to serve on a committee that investigated the affair . The committee took depositions and produced a report describing the event that was published as A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre . The work was highly critical not only of the governor , but also the behavior of the British Army troops that were stationed in Boston , and is characterized by historian Francis <unk> as one of the major propaganda pieces influencing public opinion in the colonies . Bowdoin 's opposition to British policies continued during the Hutchinson administration , and when letters by Hutchinson were published to outrage similar to the Bernard letters affair , Bowdoin again penned works highly critical of the governor and calling for his removal . Hutchinson 's successor , General Thomas Gage , vetoed Bowdoin 's reelection to the council in 1774 , citing " express orders from His Majesty " that he be excluded from that body . 
 = = Government of Massachusetts = = 
 Bowdoin as named as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 but did not attend , citing the poor health of his wife . A bout of poor health , probably caused by tuberculosis , at the time also affected him . Bowdoin was again ill in 1775 when the American Revolutionary War broke out , and the family was relocated from British @-@ occupied Boston ( which was then under siege by area militia ) first to Dorchester , and eventually to Middleborough , where he resided until 1778 . ( Bowdoin 's Beacon Street mansion was occupied by General John Burgoyne . ) Despite his convalescence he was kept apprised of events occurring in and around Boston , and was elected president of the executive council of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress . This position , which he held until 1777 , made him the de facto head of the Massachusetts government . Citing his ongoing poor health , he resigned the post and withdrew from public view . He continued to correspond with other revolutionaries , and enjoyed their confidence , although his absence from the war effort would lead to later political difficulties . He began to return to public life in 1778 , and when Massachusetts wrote its own constitution in 1779 , he was president of the convention called to create it , and chairman of the committee that drafted it . John Adams , also a committee member , is generally credited as the major author of the new constitution , although Bowdoin and Samuel Adams likely made significant contributions . 
 In the first gubernatorial election , held in 1780 , Bowdoin ran for the office against John Hancock . In the absence of formal party politics , the contest was one of personality , popularity , and patriotism . Hancock was immensely popular , and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress . Bowdoin was cast by Hancock supporters as unpatriotic , citing among other things his refusal to serve in the First Continental Congress ( even though it was due to his illness ) . Bowdoin 's supporters , who were principally well @-@ off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities , cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace . Hancock won the election easily , receiving more than 90 % of the vote . The Massachusetts House of Representatives offered Bowdoin either the lieutenant governorship or a seat in the state senate , but Bowdoin declined both on account of his poor health . After the election Hancock appointed him to a commission to revise and consolidate the state 's laws . 
 Bowdoin ran against Hancock in subsequent elections , but was never able to overcome Hancock 's enormous popularity . The contest between the two men was just one element of a long @-@ running rivalry that encompassed business , politics , and religion , and was apparently deeply personal . The two men were both involved in the administration of Harvard , where their feud sometimes became ugly . For example , in 1776 , while Hancock was simultaneously treasurer of Harvard and president of the Second Continental Congress , a committee headed by Bowdoin decided that securities physically held by Hancock were at risk because of the war , and a delegation was sent to Philadelphia to receive an accounting of them and physical custody of the papers . Hancock 's dilatory responses and refusal to produce an accounting of the college books dragged on for several years , as a result of which Bowdoin orchestrated his censure by the Harvard board of overseers . The matter reached a peak of sorts in 1783 when the college 's issues with Hancock were read and discussed in an open meeting at which Hancock was the presiding officer . Both Bowdoin and Hancock attended the Brattle Street Church , where they competed with each other over the size and quality of the improvements to the building ( and even the location of a new one ) that they funded . James Warren captured the differences between the two men : " I don 't envy either of them their <unk> the Vanity of one will Sting like an Adder if it is disappointed , and the Advancements made by the other if they dont succeed will hurt his Modest pride . " The rivalry between the men was so bitter that the founding of Bowdoin College , named in his honor , had to be delayed until after Hancock died . 
 In 1785 , apparently sensitive to rising unrest in western Massachusetts over the poor economy , Hancock offered to resign , expecting to be asked to stay in office . However , the legislature made no such request , and he eventually did resign , pleading poor health . The gubernatorial race that year was dominated by Bowdoin , Lieutenant Governor Thomas Cushing ( who was widely viewed as a standin for Hancock but lacked his charisma ) , and Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln . The campaign was at times nasty . Bowdoin and Samuel Adams went after the Hancock @-@ Cushing faction , seizing on the recently established and locally controversial social club ( known either as " Sans Souci " or the " Tea Assembly " ) , at which card play and dancing took place ( these activities had previously been banned in socially conservative Boston ) , as a sign of moral decay that took place under Hancock 's term . Cushing supporters accused Bowdoin of cowardice in the war and insulting the people for refusing the lieutenant governorship in 1780 . The electorate gave no candidate a majority , and the General Court ended up choosing Bowdoin over the others in bitterly divisive voting . 
 = = = Shays ' Rebellion = = = 
 Governor Hancock had , during his time in office , refused to vigorously act to collect delinquent taxes . Bowdoin , seeking to make payments the state owed against the nation 's foreign debt , raised taxes and stepped up collection of back taxes . These actions , which were combined with a general post @-@ war economic depression and a credit squeeze caused by a shortage of hard currency , wrought havoc throughout the rural parts of the state . Conventions organized in the rural parts of the state submitted letters of protest to the state legislature , which was dominated by Bowdoin and the conservative wholesale merchants of the coastal portions of the state . 
 After the legislature adjourned in August 1786 without substantively addressing these complaints , rural Massachusetts protestors organized direct action , and began protest marches that shut down the state 's court system , which enforced tax and civil forfeiture judgments and had become a focus of the discontent . Bowdoin issued a proclamation in early September denouncing these actions , but took no overt steps to immediately organize a militia response ( unlike governors in neighboring Connecticut and New Hampshire ) . When the court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5 , the county militia ( composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors ) refused to turn out , much to Bowdoin 's chagrin . Protests and court shutdowns continued , with one correspondent writing in October , " We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War " . 
 Under the leadership of Bowdoin and Samuel Adams , the legislature enacted a Riot Act , suspended habeas corpus , and passed a bill that unsuccessfully attempted to address the financial reasons for the protests . By January 1787 the protests , which began as demands for reform , had grown to become a direct attack on the " tyrannical government of Massachusetts " . Hampshire County in particular ( which then included what are now Hampden and Franklin Counties ) had become a hotbed of rebellion , with leaders like Daniel Shays and Luke Day beginning to organize for an attack on government institutions . 
 Because the federal government had been unable to raise any significant number of troops and Bowdoin could no longer trust local militias in the western counties , he proposed in early January 1787 the creation of a private militia to be funded by eastern merchants . Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln raised funds and men for the effort , and had 3 @,@ 000 men in Worcester by January 19 . A standoff at the Springfield Armory on January 25 resulted in the death of several rebels , and Lincoln broke the main rebel force on February 4 in Petersham , ending large @-@ scale resistance . 
 The same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham , the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law , giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels . It also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army , and authorized the recruitment of additional militia . On February 12 the legislature passed the Disqualification Act , seeking to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers . This bill expressly forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices . 
 The crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically . In the election held in April 1787 , Bowdoin received few votes from the rural parts of the state , and was trounced by John Hancock . 
 In 1788 Bowdoin served as a member of the Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution . A strong supporter of Federalism , Bowdoin worked hard for its ratification , bringing a skeptical Samuel Adams and his supporters into the fold by inviting him to a dinner with other pro @-@ ratification delegates , and offering Federalist support to John Hancock in future elections . Bowdoin 's Federalist supporters backed Hancock in the 1789 election , even though Bowdoin also stood for election . He remained active in his charitable and scientific pursuits in his later years , continuing his leadership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as that of the Humane Society . He also continued to engage in new business ventures , buying in 1789 an interest in one of the first American merchant ships to sail to China . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 He died in Boston on November 6 , 1790 , of " putrid fever and dysentery " . Bowdoin 's funeral was one of the largest of the time in Boston , with people lining the streets to view the funeral procession . He was interred in Boston 's Granary Burying Ground . Among his bequests was a gift to Harvard College for awards that are now known as the Bowdoin Prizes . His son James III donated lands from the family estate in Brunswick , Maine , as well as funds and books , to establish Bowdoin College in his honor . 
 An orrery constructed by clockmaker Joseph Pope , now in Harvard 's science department , includes bronze figures of Bowdoin and Benjamin Franklin that were supposedly cast by Paul Revere . ( Bowdoin was responsible for having the device rescued when Pope 's house caught fire in 1787 . ) 
 Landmarks bearing the Bowdoin name in Boston include Bowdoin Street , Bowdoin Square , and the Bowdoin MBTA station . Bowdoin , Maine , incorporated 1788 , was named for Bowdoin ; neighboring <unk> , Maine ( incorporated 1762 ) was named either for his grandfather Pierre or his brother William . 
 = Children of Mana = 
 Children of Mana , originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu DS : Children of Mana , is a 2006 action role @-@ playing game for the Nintendo DS handheld console . It was developed by Square Enix and Nex Entertainment , and published by Square Enix and Nintendo . It is the sixth game of the Mana series — following 2003 's Sword of Mana — and the first entry in the World of Mana subseries . Set in a high fantasy universe , Children of Mana follows one of four young heroes as they combat an invasion of monsters and learn about the cataclysmic event that killed their families . 
 While it reprises the action role @-@ playing elements of previous Mana games , such as real @-@ time battle sequences , Children of Mana features an increased focus on user @-@ friendliness . Unlike earlier Mana titles , Children is a heavily action @-@ oriented dungeon crawler , in which the player progresses by completing randomly generated levels . Both the main plot and side @-@ quests require the player to fight through dungeons and defeat boss monsters before returning to the central Mana Village . Like many of its predecessors , the game features a local cooperative multiplayer component . 
 Children of Mana was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii , directed by Yoshiki Ito , and produced by Takashi <unk> and Katsuji Aoyama . The game was a moderate commercial success : it sold 100 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release , and over 280 @,@ 000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006 . While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and unique , they found the combat simplistic and repetitive , and the story insubstantial . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Like previous games in the Mana series , Children of Mana features a top @-@ down perspective , in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures . The player controls a main character , chosen from one of four options . Each of the characters have different ratings from one to five in four areas : the damage they do with magic , the speed that they can attack , and the amount of health and mana they have . The game plays out nearly identically regardless of which character is chosen , except for a few quests specific to each character . Unlike previous games in the series , the main character typically has no companions during the game ; however , a cooperative multiplayer option is present for up to four players , who all appear on each players ' screens . This multiplayer mode is only present with local WiFi , and progress is only saved on the host player 's game . 
 Unlike previous games in the series , which were more typical action role @-@ playing games , Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler , and the majority of the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map . The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them . The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters . Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors , and to progress between each zone , the player must find an item called a <unk> , then carry it to a pillar of light called a <unk> . The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached , where a boss monster lies . The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon ; upon returning , they start the dungeon over at the beginning . When not clearing dungeons , the player stays in the Mana Village , which contains shops to purchase equipment . Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the <unk> shop . During these quests , the dungeon itself is slightly altered : the player 's starting position may be different , the number of floors can change , and the monsters and boss monster contained may change . Like the main quests , <unk> quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters , sometimes to acquire an item from the end of the dungeon . 
 The game retains the real @-@ time battle mechanics of previous games in the Mana series . The game sports four weapons with their own unique abilities : sword , flail , bow and arrow , and hammer . The player can have two weapons ready to attack with at a time , and any of the four character options can use any weapon . The player can change which weapons they have available at any time . Each weapon has standard normal attacks , special attacks , and fury attacks . The fury attacks are the strongest and require a full Fury Gauge to use , which is filled by striking enemies with standard attacks and taking damage from enemies . Different weapons can have different effects on the environment , such as the hammer 's ability to smash pots . In addition to weapons , the player can select from one of eight Elementals , which provide different magical attacks and magical enhancements to weapon attacks . The player can switch between Elementals in the Mana Village . Elemental attacks can be made stronger by equipping Gems , which can also boost the player 's attributes .

 One day , following a flash of light , the stone at the base of the Mana Tree cracks , distorting time and space . The hero recalls that their friend Tess , who is a priestess , went to the Mana Tower to pray , and goes to find her . After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow , the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters . Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower , the hero finds Tess , frightened but unharmed . Suddenly , a giant flaming bird descends upon the two . The hero attempts to fight it , but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier . A sword then falls from the sky , causing the bird 's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast . When the bird is defeated , a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword , which is still stuck in the ground , but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries . The man disappears , and the hero attempts to grab the sword . No barrier appears to prevent them , and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana . 
 Upon returning from the Mana Tower , the hero discovers that three mysterious pillars of light have struck in the lands of Topple , Jadd , and Lorimar . After being asked by the leaders of the village , the hero investigates these places and finds dungeons full of monsters with a huge monster at the end . After these three tasks are completed , the mysterious man appears once again , identifying himself as the Mana Lord . He steals the Sword of Mana and causes a large storm in the land of Wendel . The hero journeys there to stop the Mana Storm by confronting the Mana Lord . When the Mana Lord is about to kill the hero , a group of gems appear around the hero to prevent his attack . The Mana Lord then decides to kidnap Tess and vanishes . 
 After returning to the Mana Village , the hero heads for the Path of Life under the roots of the Mana Tree . At the end of the Path , the hero finds the Mana Lord waiting , and the two fight . Upon his defeat , the Mana Lord reveals that he was one of the two children of Mana who had saved the world during the great disaster , and rather than trying to hurt anyone , he was simply trying to fulfill the reason he was created : " to fill the world with the power of Mana . " He tells the hero that the other child of Mana is spreading disaster through the world and must be stopped . He proceeds to give the Sword of Mana to the hero , then commits suicide by throwing himself off a cliff . This shift in power causes a rift to open in the sky , where the second child of Mana is waiting . The hero destroys this second child , the Scion of Mana , restoring the world to peace . 
 In the aftermath , Tess and the Elementals are entrusted with care of Illusia , while everyone else must leave . Moti says that Illusia will be protected as a haven and that humans will not return for many more years . They embark to Jadd to start a new life in a new world . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 2003 , Square Enix began a drive to begin developing " polymorphic content " , a marketing and sales strategy to " [ provide ] well @-@ known properties on several platforms , allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible " . The first of these was the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII , and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously . Although no such project for the Mana series had been announced by this point , it was announced in late 2004 that an unnamed Mana game was in development for the upcoming Nintendo DS platform . In early 2005 , Square Enix announced a " World of Mana " project , the application of this " polymorphic content " idea to the Mana franchise , which would include several games across different genres and platforms . These games , as with the rest of the series , would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another , even if appearing so at first glance , but would instead share thematic connections . The first release in this project and the sixth release in the Mana series was announced in September 2005 as Children of Mana for the DS . 
 Children of Mana was developed by Nex Entertainment , who had previously created dungeon crawl games in the Shining series , in collaboration with Square Enix . It was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii , directed by Yoshiki Ito , and produced by Takashi <unk> and Katsuji Aoyama . The game features an opening cinematic by Production I.G. The game was planned from the start as a " fun @-@ for @-@ all action type game " taking advantage of the DS 's capabilities . Ishii was especially focused on creating a truly cooperative multiplayer game , which he had wanted to create since Secret of Mana ( 1993 ) , the second game in the series . Despite this , he chose not to utilize the DS 's Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi functionality in order to effect an experience in which players would interact with people in the near vicinity rather than remotely , in congruence with the local multiplayer found in Secret of Mana . He also designed the multiplayer to create a sense of chaotic excitement , such that players could interact without focusing on the difficulty or competing against each other . Several of the game 's design choices were meant to focus more on the action components , such as attacks sending enemies flying across the screen and the use of both the buttons and stylus to keep the controls simple and directly connected to the action . The randomly generated dungeon crawling mechanic was also a means toward this end . Although Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected , he has also asserted in an interview that Children is set ten years after the 2007 game Dawn of Mana , which depicts the events of the cataclysm . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The score for Children of Mana was composed by Kenji Ito , Masaharu Iwata , and Takayuki Aihara . Ito had previously composed the music for the first game in the Mana series , Final Fantasy Adventure ( 1991 ) , as well as its 2003 remake Sword of Mana , which was the most recent game in the series prior to Children . This was the first soundtrack in the Mana series to feature work by Iwata and Aihara , though Iwata had previously worked for Square Enix on many other titles . The music of the game covers a range of styles , including rock , jazz , and classical . Due to the limitations of the Nintendo DS hardware , Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online said that not all of the synthesized instruments are " especially aesthetic or realistic " . The album Seiken Densetsu DS : Children of Mana Original Soundtrack collects 33 tracks from Children of Mana on two discs and is nearly an hour and a half in length . It was published by Square Enix on May 9 , 2006 , on the Japanese iTunes Store , but has not been released as a stand @-@ alone physical album . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Children of Mana sold almost 103 @,@ 000 units in its first three days in Japan — between March 2 and March 5 — which was considered below expectations and partially blamed on product shortages of the Nintendo DS . According to Enterbrain , by the end of 2006 Children of Mana had sold just over 281 @,@ 000 copies in Japan . It received mixed reviews from critics , with numerical scores that range from 58 to 90 out of 100 . The game 's presentation was praised , especially its graphics ; Greg Mueller of GameSpot said that " the saving grace of Children of Mana is the appealing visual style of the game . " Raymond Padilla of GamesRadar praised the " beautiful and unique art style " , and 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish said that the graphics are " almost painfully cute " . IGN 's Mark Bozon and RPGFan 's Neal Chandran compared the game to a painting and a storybook . The music was also praised ; Bozon called it " pretty stunning " , Chandran called it " quite good " , and Mueller said it " fits the tone of the game very well " . 
 Critics such as Mueller were generally more negative about the gameplay , finding it repetitive . He claimed that there is " no break from the monotony of dungeon clearing " , while Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said the game is repetitive and uninspiring . GamePro concluded that " the downfall of Children of Mana is its repetitiveness , " and Chandran felt that most players would be sick of the gameplay before finishing half of the game . The reviewers from the Japanese Shūkan Famitsū magazine , while giving the game an especially high score , noted that the gameplay could be considered insufficient compared to prior titles in the series . Bozon , while giving the game a more positive review than many others , felt that the thinness of the gameplay was bolstered by the multiplayer component , saying that " the game 's entertainment value goes up in leaps and bounds during multiplayer " , a point with which Fahey agreed to a lesser extent . 
 In addition to the general dungeon @-@ clearing gameplay , the combat itself was criticized by reviewers like Padilla , who said that " the weapon use is the most disappointing facet of this game " . Both Fahey and Mueller felt that the combat , while initially fun , quickly became boring due to the simplicity . Chandran added that magic spells were too slow to be useful in combat , further reducing the complexity of the gameplay . Chandran and GamePro both criticized the " sparse and slow " story , while Fahey dismissed it as " a gossamer @-@ thin layer which tries and fails miserably to hold everything together " and nothing more than several role @-@ playing game clichés stuck together . Padilla concluded that while the game had several good elements , it ultimately failed to live up to its potential as a Mana game . 
 = Newton 's parakeet = 
 Newton 's parakeet or the Rodrigues parakeet ( Psittacula exsul ) is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean . Several of its features diverged from related species , indicating long @-@ term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation . The rose @-@ ringed parakeet of the same genus is a close relative and probable ancestor . Newton 's parakeet may itself have been ancestral to the endemic parakeets of nearby Mauritius and Réunion . 
 Around 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) long , Newton 's parakeet was roughly the size of a rose @-@ ringed parakeet . Its plumage was mostly greyish or slate blue in colour , which is unusual in Psittacula , a genus containing mostly green species . The male had stronger colours than the female and possessed a reddish instead of black beak , but details of a mature male 's appearance are uncertain ; only one male specimen is known , and it is believed to be immature . Mature males might have possessed red patches on the wing like the related Alexandrine parakeet . Both sexes had a black collar running from the chin to the nape , but this was clearer in the male . The legs were grey and the iris yellow . 17th @-@ century accounts indicate that some members of the species were green , which would suggest that there were both blue and green colour morphs , but there is no definitive explanation for these reports . Little is known about its behaviour in life , but it may have fed on the nuts of the bois d ’ olive tree , along with leaves . It was very tame , and was able to mimic speech . 
 Newton 's parakeet was first written about by the French Huguenot François Leguat in 1708 , and was only mentioned a few times by other writers afterwards . The specific name " exsul " is a reference to Leguat , who was exiled from France . Only two life drawings exist , both of a single specimen held in captivity in the 1770s . The first specimen known to science , a female , became the holotype when the species was described in 1872 . A male , the last specimen recorded , was collected in 1874 , and these two specimens are the only ones that exist today . It became scarce due to deforestation and perhaps hunting , but it is thought that it was finally wiped out by a series of cyclones and storms that hit Rodrigues in the late 19th century . There was unfounded speculation about the possible survival of the species as late as 1967 . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Newton 's parakeet was first recorded by François Leguat in his 1708 memoir , A New Voyage to the East Indies . Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there . Subsequent accounts are by Julien Tafforet , who was also marooned on the island in 1726 , and then by the French mathematician Alexandre Pingré , who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus . 
 The first specimen known to science was a female collected by George Jenner , then the magistrate of Rodrigues , in 1871 . The specimen was preserved in alcohol and given to Edward Newton , a colonial administrator in Mauritius , who sent it to his brother , the British ornithologist Alfred Newton . Alfred Newton scientifically described the bird in 1872 and gave it the scientific name Palaeornis exsul . " <unk> " ( " exiled " ) refers to François Leguat , in that he was exiled from France when he gave the first description of the bird . Newton had tried to find a more descriptive name , perhaps based on colouration , but found it difficult . He refrained from publishing a figure of the female in his original description , though the journal Ibis had offered him the space . He instead wanted to wait until a male specimen could be procured , since he imagined it would be more attractive . The female , which is the holotype specimen of the species , is housed in the Cambridge University Museum as specimen UMZC 18 / Psi / 67 / h / 1 . 
 Alfred Newton requested further specimens , especially males , but in 1875 he finally published a plate of the female , lamenting that no male specimens could be found . Tafforet 's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year , and Alfred Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female . Newton 's collector , Henry H. Slater , had seen a live Newton 's parakeet the year before , but was not carrying a gun at the time . On 14 August 1874 , William <unk> shot a male specimen . It may have been the same specimen Slater had observed . It was subsequently sent to Edward Newton by William J. Caldwell . This is the paratype of the species , numbered UMZC 18 / Psi / 67 / h / 2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum . 
 Edward Newton noted that he had expected the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing , but that the absence of this indicated it was immature . He still found it more beautiful than the female . These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species . The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen , and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues . The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula , and all species within the former were transferred to the latter . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Based on morphological features , the Alexandrine parakeet ( Psittacula eupatria ) has been proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands , with new populations settling during the species 's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia . Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range . Subfossil remains of Newton 's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features , but also had similarities , such as a reduced sternum , which suggests a close relationship . Skeletal features indicate an especially close relationship with the Alexandrine parakeet and the rose @-@ ringed parakeet ( Psittacula krameri ) , but the many derived features of Newton 's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues . 
 Many endemic Mascarene birds , including the dodo , are descended from South Asian ancestors , and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there . Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene , so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands . Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known , subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws , reduced pectoral bones , and robust leg bones . Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe , members of which are known as <unk> , basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean . The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times , as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea . Other members of the Psittacula genus from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet ( Psittacula eques echo ) of Mauritius , as well as the extinct Réunion parakeet ( Psittacula eques eques ) , and Mascarene grey parakeet ( Psittacula bensoni ) of both Mauritius and Réunion . 
 A 2011 genetic study of parrot phylogeny was unable to include Newton 's parakeet , as no viable DNA could be extracted . The same paper found that the Mascarene parrot ( Mascarinus mascarinus ) of nearby Réunion was most closely related to the lesser vasa parrot from Madagascar and nearby islands , and therefore unrelated to the Psittacula parrots , undermining the theory of their common origin . A 2015 genetic study by Jackson et al. included viable DNA from the toe @-@ pad of the female Newton 's parakeet specimen . It was found to group within a clade of rose @-@ ringed parakeet subspecies ( from Asia and Africa ) , which it had diverged from 3 @.@ 82 million years ago . Furthermore , Newton 's parakeet appeared to be ancestral to the parakeets of Mauritius and Réunion . The cladogram accompanying the study is shown below : 
 = = Description = = 
 Newton 's parakeet was about 40 cm ( 16 in ) long - roughly the size of the rose @-@ ringed parakeet . The wing of the male specimen was 198 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 in ) , the tail 206 mm ( 8 @.@ 1 in ) , the culmen 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) , and the tarsus was 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) . The wing of the female specimen was 191 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) , the tail 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) , the culmen 24 mm ( 0 @.@ 94 in ) , and the tarsus was 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) . The male specimen was greyish blue ( also described as " <unk> blue " ) tinged with green , and darker above . The head was bluer , with a dark line running from the eye to the cere . It had a broad black collar running from the chin to the nape , where it became gradually narrower . The underside of the tail was greyish , the upper beak was dark reddish brown , and the mandible was black . The legs were grey and the iris yellow . The female was similar , but had a greyer head and a black beak . The black collar was not so prominent as that of the male , and did not extend to the back of the neck . The general appearance of Newton 's parakeet was similar to the extant Psittacula species , including the black collar , but the bluish grey colouration set it apart from other members of its genus , which are mostly green . 
 Philibert Commerson received a live specimen on Mauritius in the 1770s and described it as " greyish blue " . Paul Jossigny made two illustrations of this specimen , the only known depictions of Newton 's parakeet in life , unpublished until 2007 . Though both existing specimens are blue , some early accounts from Rodrigues have caused confusion over the colouration of the plumage . One of these is Leguat 's following statement : 
 There are abundance of green and blew <unk> , they are of a <unk> and equal bigness ; when they are young , their Flesh is as good as young Pigeons . 
 If the green parrots Leguat referred to were not the Rodrigues parrot ( Necropsittacus rodericanus ) , they may perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton 's parakeet , as Julian Hume has suggested . As Alfred Newton observed in his original description , some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges , depending on the light . This may explain some of the discrepancies . The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm @-@ blown members of Psittacula species from other islands , that survived on Rodrigues for a short time . 
 The two existing specimens were originally preserved in alcohol , but though this can discolour specimens , it is not probable that it could turn green to blue . Hume and Hein van Grouw have also suggested that due to an inheritable mutation , some Newton 's parakeets may have lacked psittacin , a pigment that together with <unk> produces green colouration in parrot feathers . Complete lack of psittacin produces blue colouration , whereas reduced psittacin can produce a colour between green and blue called <unk> , which corresponds to the colour of the two preserved Newton 's parakeet specimens . 
 Julien Tafforet also described what appears to be green Newton 's parakeets in his 1726 Relation de l 'Île Rodrigue , but the issue of colouration was further complicated : 
 The parrots are of three kinds , and in quantity ... The second species [ mature male Newton 's parakeet ? ] is slightly smaller and more beautiful , because they have their plumage green like the preceding [ Rodrigues Parrot ] , a little more blue , and above the wings a little red as well as their beak . The third species [ Newton 's parakeet ] is small and altogether green , and the beak black . 
 It has been proposed that the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton 's parakeets , and that the differences between them were due to sexual dimorphism . Alexandre Pingré also mentioned green birds , perhaps with some red colours , but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous . A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet . None of the existing Newton 's parakeet specimens have red patches . The single @-@ known male specimen may have been immature , judged on the colour of its beak , and this may also explain the absence of the red patch . When Psittacula are bred by aviculturalists , blue is easily produced from green ; the production of blue may suppress red colouration , so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Almost nothing is known about the behaviour of Newton 's parakeet , but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus . Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island mainly ate the nuts of the bois d ’ olive tree ( <unk> orientale ) . It may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does . The fact that Newton 's parakeet survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of , for example , the Rodrigues parrot . 
 Leguat and his men were hesitant to hunt the parrots because they were so tame and easy to catch . Leguat 's group took a parrot as a pet and were able to teach it to speak : 
 Hunting and Fishing were so easie to us , that it took away from the Pleasure . We often delighted ourselves in teaching the Parrots to speak , there being vast numbers of them . We carried one to Maurice Isle [ Mauritius ] , which talk ’ d French and Flemish . 
 As the kind of parrot mentioned here by Leguat is not specified , some sources attribute it to Newton 's parakeet , and others to the Rodrigues parrot . 
 Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived , and the island 's ecosystem remains heavily damaged . Forests covered the entire island before humans arrived , but very little forestation can be seen today . Newton 's parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues solitaire , the Rodrigues parrot , the Rodrigues rail , the Rodrigues starling , the Rodrigues owl , the Rodrigues night heron , and the Rodrigues pigeon . Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise , the saddle @-@ backed Rodrigues giant tortoise , and the Rodrigues day gecko . 
 The authors of the 2015 study which resolved the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton 's parakeet , due to their close evolutionary relationship . The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s , numbering only twenty individuals , but has since recovered , so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 Of the roughly eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes , only the echo parakeet has survived . The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation . Leguat stated that Newton 's parakeet was abundant during his stay . It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726 , but when Alexandre Pingré mentioned it in 1761 , he noted that the bird had become scarce . It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues ( Isle Gombrani ) , along with the Rodrigues parrot . After this point , much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for livestock . 
 According to early accounts praising its flavour , it appears Newton 's parakeet was commonly eaten by visitors . Several individuals would likely be needed to provide a single meal , owing to the bird 's small size . Pingré stated : 
 The perruche [ Newton 's parakeet ] seemed to me much more delicate [ than the flying @-@ fox ] . I would not have missed any game from France if this one had been commoner in Rodrigues ; but it begins to become rare . There are even fewer perroquets [ Rodrigues parrots ] , although there were once a big enough quantity according to François Leguat ; indeed a little islet south of Rodrigues still retains the name Isle of Parrots [ Isle Pierrot ] . 
 According to government surveyor Thomas Corby , Newton 's parakeet may still have been fairly common in 1843 . Henry H. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in south western Rodrigues during his three @-@ month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus , and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three @-@ month visit . The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species . A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population . Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886 , and since few forested areas were left by this time , there was little cover to protect any remaining birds . The male could therefore have been the last of the species alive . 
 There were unfounded rumours of its continued existence until the beginning of the 20th century . In 1967 James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets , since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds . Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population .

 U.S. Route 1 / 9 ( US 1 / 9 ) is the 31 @.@ 01 @-@ mile ( 49 @.@ 91 km ) long concurrency of US 1 and US 9 from their junction in Woodbridge Township , Middlesex County , New Jersey north to New York City . The route is a multilane road , with some freeway portions , that runs through urbanized areas of northern New Jersey adjacent to New York City . Throughout most of its length in New Jersey , the road runs near the New Jersey Turnpike / Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) . In Fort Lee , US 1 / 9 merges onto I @-@ 95 and crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge , where the two U.S. routes split a short distance into New York . US 1 / 9 intersects several major roads , including I @-@ 278 in Linden , Route 81 in Elizabeth , I @-@ 78 and US 22 in Newark , Route 139 in Jersey City , Route 3 and Route 495 in North Bergen , and US 46 in Palisades Park . Between Newark and Jersey City , US 1 / 9 runs along the Pulaski Skyway . Trucks are banned from this section of road and must use US 1 / 9 Truck . The concurrency between US 1 and US 9 is commonly referred to as " 1 and 9 " . Some signage for the concurrency , as well as the truck route , combines the two roads into one shield , separated by a hyphen ( 1 @-@ 9 ) or an <unk> ( 1 & 9 ) . 
 The current alignment of US 1 / 9 south of Elizabeth was planned as pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 in 1916 ; this road was extended to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City in 1922 . When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926 , US 1 and US 9 were marked concurrent through northern New Jersey between Rahway on the current alignments of Route 27 and US 1 / 9 Truck . In 1927 , pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 became Route 25 , and Route 1 and Route 6 were legislated along the current US 1 / 9 north of Jersey City . US 1 / 9 originally went to the Holland Tunnel on Route 25 ; after the George Washington Bridge opened the two routes were realigned to their current routing north of Jersey City . After the Pulaski Skyway opened in 1932 , US 1 / 9 and Route 25 were routed to use this road , which soon had a truck ban resulting in the creation of Route 25T ( now US 1 / 9 Truck ) . South of Newark , US 1 / 9 was moved from Route 27 to Route 25 . In 1953 , the state highways running concurrent with US 1 / 9 in New Jersey were removed . In 1964 , the approaches to the George Washington Bridge were upgraded into I @-@ 95 .

 US 1 and US 9 begin their concurrency at a directional interchange in Woodbridge Township , Middlesex County . US 1 comes from the southwest , where it serves the city of New Brunswick and Edison Township , while US 9 comes from the south , a short distance to the north of an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike ( I @-@ 95 ) and the Garden State Parkway . The combined US 1 / 9 runs northeast through business areas as a six @-@ lane divided highway , coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 a short distance after the merge . From this interchange , the road continues as a surface road with some jughandles , passing over New Jersey Transit ’ s North Jersey Coast Line .

 A short distance later , US 1 / 9 crosses into Rahway , Union County , where the road crosses the Rahway River before intersecting CR 514 in the southbound direction . The highway turns more northeast , becoming known as Edgar Road in Linden . In Linden , US 1 / 9 passes through a mix of industrial and business areas , crossing under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line before passing between the Linden Airport and the former Linden Assembly plant used by General Motors to the west . Following the intersection with CR 615 , the road enters more urbanized areas of homes and businesses . After passing near a couple of cemeteries , the highway runs to the west of the Bayway Refinery before passing under another Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line . After this bridge , US 1 / 9 meets the western terminus of I @-@ 278 at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance from US 1 / 9 . Past this interchange , US 1 / 9 continues into Elizabeth , where it intersects Route 439 at the Bayway Circle , which has been modified to allow US 1 / 9 to run straight through . At this point , US 1 / 9 splits from Edgar Road . From the Bayway Circle , the road turns more to the east before making a sharp turn to the north @-@ northeast and crossing the Elizabeth River on a skyway , which ends at the intersection with Jersey Street . The road continues north through urban neighborhoods as Spring Street , passing under another Conrail Shared Assets Operations line . The highway reaches an intersection with CR 624 , at which point US 1 / 9 turns into a freeway with a local @-@ express lane configuration , carrying two local lanes and two express lanes in each direction for a total of eight lanes . The freeway comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 81 and it continues around the west side of Newark Liberty International Airport . 
 = = = Essex and Hudson counties = = = 
 The US 1 / 9 freeway continues into Newark , Essex County , with several ramps providing access to the airport as well as to McClellan Street and Haynes Avenue . At the north end of the airport property , the road reaches the large Newark Airport Interchange , where it has connections to I @-@ 78 , US 22 westbound , and Route 21 northbound . Within this interchange , US 1 / 9 first has ramps to I @-@ 78 , US 22 , and Route 21 before turning east to parallel I @-@ 78 briefly prior to having more connections to I @-@ 78 as well as to Port Newark . Past the I @-@ 78 crossing , US 1 / 9 continues north , with the lanes splitting as it passes over the Conrail Shared Assets Operations Oak Island Yard before coming to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Delancey Street and South Street . The freeway continues through industrial areas as it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Wilson Avenue . Following this interchange , the directions of US 1 / 9 rejoin as the freeway continues northeast , with a Conrail Shared Assets Operations line running closely parallel to the northwest of the road . The local @-@ express lane configuration of US 1 / 9 ends at an interchange with US 1 / 9 Truck and Raymond Boulevard that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike ( I @-@ 95 ) . At this point , US 1 / 9 becomes the four @-@ lane divided Pulaski Skyway . Trucks are banned from using the Pulaski Skyway and have to use US 1 / 9 Truck to bypass it . 
 The Pulaski Skyway carries US 1 / 9 between Newark and Jersey City , crossing the Passaic River into Kearny , Hudson County and the Hackensack River into Jersey City . At the east end of the Pulaski Skyway , US 1 / 9 reaches the Tonnele Circle , where it intersects the north end of US 1 / 9 Truck as well as the western terminus of Route 139 . Here , US 1 / 9 head north on four @-@ lane divided surface road called Tonnelle Avenue , named for local landowner and politician John Tonnele . The road passes over a New Jersey Transit line and then a Conrail Shared Assets Operations line before running through urban areas . It turns more to the north @-@ northeast before reaching an interchange with CR 678 . At this point , US 1 / 9 crosses into North Bergen . In this area , the road crosses over Amtrak ’ s Northeast Corridor and coming to a channelized intersection with the eastern terminus of Route 3 that also provides access to eastbound Route 495 . A short distance later , US 1 / 9 becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road and reaches a partial interchange with Route 495 ; the only direct connection available is a ramp from westbound Route 495 to southbound US 1 / 9 . After this , the road comes to a diamond interchange with CR 676 and CR 681 . From this point , US 1 / 9 continues north @-@ northeast , crossing New Jersey Transit ’ s Hudson @-@ Bergen Light Rail near the line ’ s northern terminus at the Tonnelle Avenue station . Past this station , the road runs to the east of a railroad yard , still lined with businesses . 
 = = = Bergen County = = = 
 US 1 / 9 continues into Fairview , Bergen County , where the name changes to Broad Avenue . Shortly after entering Fairview , the route passes over a New York , Susquehanna and Western Railway line , where it is briefly a divided highway . Turning north , the road passes more suburban areas before continuing into Ridgefield . In Ridgefield , US 1 / 9 becomes a divided highway prior to intersecting Route 93 . The median ends after this intersection , and the road turns northeast into mostly residential neighborhoods with a few businesses , intersecting the western terminus of Route 5 . Past Route 5 , US 1 / 9 continues into Palisades Park , where it reaches an interchange with US 46 . 
 At this point , US 1 / 9 turns east off Broad Avenue to merge onto US 46 , which is a four @-@ lane freeway . This freeway makes a sharp turn to the north @-@ northeast and has partial interchanges at both ends of the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads , which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501 . US 1 / 9 / 46 continue into Fort Lee , where it has access to a couple commercial areas before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance . From here , the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes , angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street . Immediately past this point , the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I @-@ 95 , the eastern terminus of Route 4 , and the southern terminus of US 9W . Here , US 1 / 9 / 46 all join I @-@ 95 and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local @-@ express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction , passing numerous high @-@ rise buildings as it heads east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River .

 What is now the US 1 / 9 concurrency between Woodbridge and Elizabeth was first legislated as the northernmost part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 in 1916 , a route that was to continue south to Trenton . In 1922 , an extension of Route 1 was legislated to continue north from Elizabeth to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City . This extension was planned to be the first superhighway in the United States , with much of it opening in 1928 . As a result of the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , US 1 and US 9 were designated through northern New Jersey , sharing a concurrency from the current intersection of Route 27 and Route 35 in Rahway and continuing north on present @-@ day Route 27 ( then a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 ) to Newark , then turning east , eventually following what is now US 1 / 9 Truck toward Jersey City , where US 1 was to head for the Holland Tunnel and US 9 was to turn north to run near the west bank of the Hudson River . A year later , in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 between New Brunswick and Elizabeth became part of Route 27 while the Route 1 Extension became part of Route 25 . In addition , the current alignment of US 1 / 9 between the Tonnele Circle and Fort Lee , which at the time was a part of US 9 , became part of Route 1 while the approach to the George Washington Bridge became a part of Route 6 . 
 In 1932 , the Pulaski Skyway was opened to traffic , and US 1 / 9 were designated to use it along with Route 25 . Two years later , trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway , and a truck bypass of the structure called Route 25T was created . By the 1930s , US 1 / 9 was moved to follow Route 25 south to Woodbridge instead of Route 27 . By the 1940s , the US 1 / 9 alignment was moved to its current location north the Tonnele Circle , following Route 1 and Route 6 to the George Washington Bridge into New York City . In the vicinity of the George Washington Bridge , the route also ran concurrent with US 46 . In addition , US 9 was built to connect to US 1 in Woodbridge on its current alignment ( then designated Route 35 ) instead of using Route 4 ( the current Route 35 ) . 
 In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , the state highways running concurrent with US 1 / 9 were removed , while Route 25T became US 1 / 9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1 / 9 Business ( now Route 139 ) . In 1964 , the US 1 / 9 approaches to the George Washington Bridge , which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side , were rebuilt into a freeway that became a part of I @-@ 95 . Between February 2006 and November 2008 , the cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township , which was the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1 / 9 was a part of Route 25 , was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange , costing $ 34 million . 
 In 2013 , Route 1 / 9 was one of two main thoroughfares in Hudson County ( the other being Kennedy Boulevard ) that were listed among the Tri @-@ State Transportation Campaign 's list of the top ten most dangerous roads for pedestrians in New Jersey , New York and Connecticut . Route 1 / 9 , which tied for the # 10 place on the list , was cited for the five pedestrian fatalities that occurred on it from 2009 to 2011 .

 Cine City was a cinema in Withington , Manchester , England located at 494 Wilmslow Road , Withington , Manchester , M20 <unk> . It opened in 1912 as The Scala , and was the third cinema to open in Britain . During the 1930s , cinemas became increasingly popular ; The Scala was one of 109 cinemas in Manchester at its peak . 
 The road outside was hit by a small bomb during the Second World War , but the cinema ( which was showing several films at the time ) survived with only minor damage . After the war , television led to a decline in cinema attendances , and by 1965 , only 40 cinemas remained in Manchester . Cine City closed in July 2001 , making it the third @-@ longest running cinema in England . 
 By 2005 the building was in a bad state of repair , and was threatened with demolition . Although heritage groups won a stay of execution , the cinema was demolished in spring 2008 . A replacement building is planned for the site .

 The cinema opened in 1912 as " The Scala " . It was the third cinema to open in Britain , and by the time of its closure in 2001 it was the third longest @-@ running cinema in the country . As Cine City its original single @-@ screen auditorium had been fitted with 675 seats in three cinema screens . Before the advent of " talkies " , the Scala had a resident female cinema pianist , and the conductor Sir John Barbirolli once played the piano to accompany the silent films . Violet Carson , who went on to play Ena Sharples in Coronation Street , was also a resident pianist . During the 1930s the popularity of the new " picture houses " grew rapidly , with 109 in Manchester at its peak . Many people visited The Scala three or four times a week . The craze for cinema @-@ going was seen by some as a social ill of its time ; school teachers complained that pupils were not doing their homework because they were spending too much time at the cinema . One regular movie @-@ goer at the cinema in the 1920s was Robert Donat , a local boy who went on to become an Oscar @-@ winning actor . 
 During the Manchester Blitz of World War II , a small bomb fell onto Wilmslow Road in front of the cinema on the night of 1 October 1940 . The cinema ( which at the time was screening The Housekeeper 's Daughter and 5th Ave Girl ) survived with minor damage , although it had to close for a few weeks while repairs were completed . 
 After the war , the popularity of cinemas waned as more people acquired televisions , and by 1965 there were only 40 cinemas left in Manchester . Cine City was threatened with closure in 1997 when Geoff Henshaw , the owner at the time , died . It was purchased by David <unk> , who kept the cinema open until July 2001 , when it closed due to competition from a new multiplex cinema in nearby East Didsbury . 
 = = Closure and redevelopment = = 
 After the cinema closed , it was purchased by Develop UK , and several attempts were made to turn the building into a Wetherspoons pub . However these were rejected by the council twice , once in the initial planning application , and also in a subsequent appeal . The application was denied due to the moratorium on new food and drink licences in Withington , part of the town 's unitary development plan . In 2002 the building was purchased by Arrows International . They applied for planning permission in December 2002 to demolish part of the cinema , reconstructing it as five ground floor shops , with 21 flats on the upper floors . These plans were withdrawn as they were seen as <unk> the site . 
 In 2003 the site was purchased by property developer Mohammad Jamil , who runs the Britannia Property Group . When they purchased the site , Cine City was regarded as " too far gone " , so it was decided that it should be demolished and a new building constructed in its place . A campaign to save the building was started in 2002 by the actor and comedian John Thomson , but it ended in failure six years later , when it was realised that refurbishing the existing building would cost around £ 6 million . 
 As of 2005 , the building still retained a number of original features , including its gold brocade seats , wall friezes , cornices , and ceiling roses . However , the fabric of the building remained in a poor state of repair , and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished , and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation . The building , once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester , was not regarded as architecturally interesting , and was demolished in the spring of 2008 . The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building , which were Grade II listed in 1998 , remain . 
 = = Replacement building = = 
 Plans for a new building on the site have gone through several generations . The first design consisted of a six @-@ storey building ( including basement ) , which had a large shop on the ground floor , as well as an underground car park and four floors of residential apartments , with a top level to hold the building 's mechanics . Each floor would have 4 @,@ 000 square feet ( 372 m2 ) , and there would have been a leaning tower to the side of the building . The design was given planning permission in 2005 . 
 A revised design turned the mezzanine floor into an area that could be used as an arts venue , cinema , music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150 people . New plans cost £ 60 @,@ 000 . However this new design was deemed to be unworkable . A second design consisted of another six @-@ storey building with a large ground @-@ floor shop , a first @-@ storey car park , and four floors of flats . This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design , and did not include the tower . The plan was initially rejected by the council , but was subsequently approved in April 2008 , before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate . Several later applications for the site were also rejected , particularly due to concerns over parking , and the site was vacant as of June 2015 .

 = = Plot = = 
 The Fringe division tracks down a series of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands . Discovering traces of the husbands ' DNA on the bodies of the wives , Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives , using the substances as a perfume . Further identifying <unk> within the pheromone mix , they identify the murderer as Anson Carr ( Michael Massee ) , a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease . They arrive at Carr 's home to find another husband , already dead , in a dehydration chamber , and race to protect his wife , Dianna ( Ona Grauer ) . When no attack comes at the wife , Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair , and races to the mistress ' home , stopping Carr before he can kill her . As he is taken away , he admits he was trying to discover what love was , scientifically , so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it . 
 During the investigation , Olivia finds that the memories she is gaining from Peter Bishop 's ( Joshua Jackson ) original timeline are overriding her original memories . Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) becomes concerned and suggests that Olivia talk to Walter to help reverse the memory loss . During the case , in talking with the latest victim 's wife , Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter . After the conclusion of the case , she admits to Nina that she will let the memory alterations continue , even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood . 
 Simultaneous to these events , Peter has attempted to flee to New York City and points beyond to stay away from Olivia , fearing that staying near her would further erode her original memories . Walter calls him back , identifying that the Observer September ( Michael Cerveris ) had implanted something in Peter 's eye during the events of the previous episode . The small disc reveals a nearby address , where Peter finds a stash of September 's Observer equipment , including a GPS @-@ like device that leads him to a strange pod ( as shown previously in " The Arrival " ) . Peter is ultimately able to activate the pod , where September appears . September states the pod acts as a beacon , allowing him to return after the other Observers hid the universe from him . In response to Peter 's questions about trying to return to his own timeline , September states that Peter is actually home ; he was never truly erased from time as his love for his friends , and their love for him brought him back . September soon vanishes , and the pod buries itself in the ground . The episode closes as Peter and Olivia rejoin each other with a passionate kiss .

 " A Short Story About Love " was co @-@ written by executive producer J.H. Wyman and co @-@ producer Graham Roland . Wyman stated that the episode had " scary " and " romantic " themes , and as the title indicated , was " all about motivation . Love is a great motivator , for good and evil . " He and fellow executive producer Jeff Pinkner believed the episode was " kind of like a perfect version of what a Fringe show is , " because it depicted " <unk> " elements in the form of killings while using love and relationships as central plot drivers . Wyman added that it was a " culmination of what I could describe as — it ’ s a direction where we ’ ve been heading and I think the fans will be really happy and satisfied . " 
 Co @-@ showrunner Wyman also served as episode director , marking his television directorial debut . He noted his love of the experience , as it permitted him to grow closer with the series ' actors and " actually work with them on a level that [ he hadn 't ] before and really get down there with them . " Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season , but found he was too busy . He explained , " Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it . The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt that this is the perfect time because everything was completely under control . It allowed me to go and do it . It 's an episode that 's really close to me . It 's about love and it 's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe . " 
 Actor Joshua Jackson was pleased that Wyman directed , as he found it nice to have " somebody who 's in the writer 's room day @-@ in and day @-@ out and knows the show so intimately , come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information . " Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman 's direction , as the two were able to discuss themes in the script as well as how Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes . Gabel remarked that the director " wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln 's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that 's been happening . We played so many things that weren 't in the script , that were between the lines in just looks , and he told me how he was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end , and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn 't in the script . " 
 Guest actor Michael Massee appeared as Anson Carr , the episode 's villain . Wyman believed that the character was " terrifying " and " definitely one of the most frightening bad guys we ’ ve had . " Other guest stars included Michael Cerveris as September and Ona Grauer as Dianna Sutter . The episode featured two pieces of music : " White Rabbit " by Jefferson Airplane and " The Friends of Mr Cairo " by Jon & Vangelis .

 The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated " A Short Story About Love " with 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 , an indication of a " great " episode . While he criticized the episode 's " mystery @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " for detracting from the episode 's other storylines , Isler thought it improved when it began depicting Walter 's investigation of September . Other stated highlights of the episode included Noble 's performance and the reappearance of the beacon from an early first season episode , the latter of which he noted , " Fans have been wondering for years what that damn thing was and how it played into the story . " Isler concluded by observing that the story became " a little sappy " but was useful in " neatly " resolving the " ' is he or isn 't he ? ' drama that marked this season and set up the show to move onto the bigger task of crafting what could be the end of everything Fringe . " Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times was pleased that little was revealed of the villain 's backstory , but believed the episode really improved once it focused on Peter exploring September 's apartment . Like Isler , Hanson was happy to see the beacon again , explaining that he " love [ s ] any time Fringe reaches back to the crazy science of Season One . " 
 Writing for The A.V. Club , Noel Murray gave the episode a B. He had an issue with the episode " reducing ' love ' to an abstraction , for the sake of making it into a plot @-@ driver , " but noted that " at least ' A Short Story About Love ' confines those wince @-@ inducing reductions to a couple of short scenes , and in service of propelling this season ’ s ' displaced Peter ' arc to a place that it needs to be . " SFX 's Dave Bradley was more critical of the episode , opining that the love premise failed to " completely satisfy , at least not on a rational level " and that the " orange " universe explanation felt like " hand @-@ waving , a cheeky attempt to untangle the series ’ continuum without any further universe @-@ hopping . " Bradley also noted that the plot surrounding the villain , a " mad scientist MacGuffin , " seemed rushed and the script and direction " jarringly unsubtle " , but that the episode featured good performances with " great details in every scene " . 
 Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named " A Short Story About Love " the fifteenth best episode of the series , explaining " The timeline reboot of season 4 frustrated some fans , but the premise yielded several truly cool capture @-@ the @-@ imagination ideas that made for provocative drama , most notably Fringe 's most romantic hour ... The fact that the episode also featured one of the show 's <unk> <unk> — a serial killer who murdered men for their pheromones so he could make a perfume that allowed him to seduce their grieving female significant others — was a bonus . Icky , but bonus . " Cory Barker of TV.com named the episode the 17th best of the series , saying , " Fringe has never been afraid of coming up with intimate , emotionally based — and sometimes very hokey — resolutions for its grand plots . Whatever you think about the choices the writers made in Season 4 , it 's hard to deny the emotional wallop this episode delivered . "

 Crocheted Olek ( born 5 April 1978 , full name Agata Oleksiak , and also known as Olek ) is a Polish @-@ born artist living in the United States . Her works include sculptures , installations such as crocheted bicycles , inflatables , and fiber art . Her best known piece is a false apartment in which the contents , including the residents , were covered in crocheting . It was featured in various international media outlets . The work generally includes members of the public or the media , crocheted directly into the suit without traditional fasteners . 
 Crocheted Olek had exhibited in the United States , United Kingdom , Germany , Brazil , Turkey , France , Italy , Poland , and Costa Rica . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Oleksiak graduated with a degree in Cultural Studies from Adam Mickiewicz University , Poznań , Poland , from 1997 to 2000 . Attending LaGuardia College , she won the National Arts Club 's award for sculpture . Her early work included sculptures , costumes , and inflatables . 
 Oleksiak first used crocheting as part of her art in 2003 after moving to the United States . She " wowed critics " at the Williamsburg Arts and Historical Society Surrealist Fashion Show that year . In 2004 , Oleksiak created " a large <unk> piece made of crocheted strips of cloth , hair , cassette tape and stuffed animals " work for a four @-@ person show . The New York Times said this work gave the show at <unk> Gallery in Chelsea , Manhattan , " a tour @-@ de @-@ force center to work around . " Her crocheted sculpture " Spill " ( 2005 ) , featured in the Washington Post , included 1 @,@ 300 skinny white balloons cascading in an " intestinal shape " . She participated in The Waterways , a " socially conscious " art project on a <unk> water bus during the 2005 Venice Biennale ; her work , called " Camouflage " , " exploring the androgyny of fixed identity , sexuality , and culture " . In September and October of that year , Olek crocheted the windows of a burned @-@ out , abandoned building near her artist residency in Utica , New York . During this period , her costumes for theatre and dance performances drew critical praise , although a dance performance relating to one of her sculptures was criticized . 
 = = Notable works = = 
 Crocheted Olek 's crocheted full body clothing , dubbed " wearable sculptures " , has been used in various projects where Olek took her participants onto the New York City Subway . Crocheted Olek 's <unk> Arts Festival piece was " Painting to Shake Hands " on an " event score " in Yoko Ono 's Grapefruit . Participants wore her sculptures and placed a hand through a stretched canvas to shake the hands of passers @-@ by . A second performance was dubbed " Crocheted Grapefruit " . Performance piece " Thank You for Your Visit , Have a Nice Day " , performed on Manhattan 's 14th Street during the 2009 event , Art in Odd Places : SIGN , was inspired " by a uniformed attendant holding a " Hold the <unk> " sign in a Taipei metro station " . Performers held placards based on signs noticed by Crocheted Olek that were " emphatic , ironic or amused dialogue with their location . " 
 In 2009 , she stated : 
 I think crochet , the way I create it , is a metaphor for the complexity and interconnectedness of our body and its systems and psychology . The connections are stronger as one fabric as opposed to separate strands , but , if you cut one , the whole thing will fall apart . Relationships are complex and greatly vary situation to situation . They are developmental journeys of growth , and transformation . Time passes , great distances are surpassed and the fabric which individuals are composed of compiles and unravels simultaneously . 
 While some have drawn parallels between Crocheted Olek 's artwork and yarn bombing , she does not consider her works to be such ; she told the New York Times in 2011 that : " I don 't yarn bomb , I make art . If someone calls my bull a yarn bomb , I get really upset . Lots of people have aunts or <unk> who paint . Do you want to see that work in the galleries ? No . The street is an extension of the gallery . Not everyone ’ s work deserves to be in public " . In 2009 , she was a resident artist at Brazil 's Instituto <unk> . 
 Crocheted Olek 's first solo exhibition , " Knitting is for <unk> * * * * " , was held at Christopher Henry Gallery . Crocheted Olek 's apartment installation took years to prepare using yarn <unk> . It was originally scheduled to run from 9 September 2010 , to 17 October 2010 , but because of a series of extensions it closed in May 2011 . During that period , the gallery exhibited her work at the <unk> Art Show in Miami . After the exhibition closed , Crocheted Olek said she wanted to sell the work for $ 90 @,@ 000 . 
 In late December 2010 , Crocheted Olek installed a crocheted suit over " Charging Bull " ( 1989 ) , a statue on Wall Street , as a tribute to Arturo Di Modica , who installed the sculpture without permission . A park caretaker tore the suit from the statue two hours later . Crocheted Olek was the 2010 @-@ 2011 Workspace artist @-@ in @-@ residence at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council , during which she created and performed at the Whitney Museum of American Art . In May 2011 , she won the " Sculpture In Situ " category at the second Urban Arts Awards ( <unk> ) . 
 In August 2011 , Crocheted Olek held a solo exhibition at Jonathan <unk> Gallery . She collaborated director Gina <unk> and producer Michelle Price to create a short silent film called <unk> , through Kickstarter @-@ based fundraising . " Inspired by the silent film genre , it relies solely on powerful music , sound design and physical expression . The characters speak through modern dance , physical comedy , capoeira , martial arts , poi , belly dancing , breakdance , acrobatics , gymnastics and the instincts of soul searchers . " The project 's funding was ultimately canceled on Kickstarter , but the film was still created , and it won a film festival award . Her first solo exhibition in the United Kingdom , called " I do not expect to be a mother but I do expect to die alone " , was influenced by her experiences while she lived there . 
 Crocheted Olek changed materials for a joint exhibition with David E. Peterson in New York City ; she used thousands of semi @-@ inflated balloons , crocheted like yarn to create a cave @-@ like structure inside the gallery . The artist noted her love of the ephemeral nature of the medium ; the balloons often popped during the creation of the installation , and required immediate repair to prevent it unraveling entirely . The installation will gradually wither . She said that balloons represent " the happiest moments in life — which are often just as impermanent " . Some visitors noted a pungent scent of latex . Crocheted Olek was inspired by her time as a traveling clown for Health Plus , when she would visit poor New York neighborhoods . She had previously used balloons during her residency in Brazil . 
 Crocheted Olek is due to exhibit work at Renwick Gallery in a show titled 40 under 40 : Craft Futures between 20 July 2012 to 3 February 2013 , after which the gallery plans to tour the show . Crocheted Olek 's creative philosophy is that " Life and art are inseparable . "

 On 6 October 2011 , Crocheted Olek and an aggressive man were involved in an incident in London . She had just donated a work to a charity show when she was arrested and charged with unlawful wounding , unlawful wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm ( GBH ) and two counts of possessing a bladed article in a public place . Crocheted Olek was tagged with an ankle monitor , was under house arrest for over a month , but was allowed to attend a show in Poland . She did not talk about the situation . A trial took place in September 2012 at Southwark Crown Court . She was found not guilty of unlawful wounding with intent to cause GBH , but was found guilty of unlawful wounding and is due to be sentenced on 19 November 2012 . During this time , she taught Polish prisoners to crochet , and hopes to do the same when she returns to the US . 
 = Pillau @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Pillau class of light cruisers was a pair of ships built in Germany just before the start of World War I. The class consisted of SMS Pillau and Elbing . The ships were initially ordered for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1912 , and were built by the Schichau @-@ Werke shipyard in Danzig . After the outbreak of World War I , however , the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) confiscated the ships before they were completed . The ships were similar in design to other German light cruisers , although they lacked an armored belt . They were the first German light cruisers to be equipped with 15 cm SK L / 45 guns , of which they carried eight . The two ships had a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . 
 Pillau and Elbing saw extensive service with the German High Seas Fleet . Pillau participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 , and Elbing took part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft in April 1916 . The following month , both ships were heavily engaged in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June ; there , Elbing scored the first hit of either side in the battle . Elbing was accidentally rammed and immobilized by the German battleship SMS Posen in the confused night fighting , and her crew were ultimately forced to scuttle her . Pillau continued to serve with the fleet until the end of the war . After the German defeat , she was ceded to Italy as a war prize and renamed Bari . She served in the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) until June 1943 , when she was sunk in Livorno by USAAF bombers , and eventually broken up for scrap in 1948 .
