One of the demos recorded was that of " Pon de Replay " , which was written and produced by Carl Sturken , Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004 . The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay @-@ Z , who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings , where Rihanna auditioned for him and music executive L.A. Reid , in his office . Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay @-@ Z , Rihanna explained during an interview how she felt before walking into the room , saying : " That 's when I really got nervous ... I was like : ' Oh God , he 's right there , I can 't look , I can 't look , I can 't look ! ' I remember being extremely quiet . I was very shy . I was cold the entire time . I had butterflies . I 'm sitting across from Jay @-@ Z. Like , Jay @-@ Zee . I was star @-@ struck . " During the audition , Rihanna performed Whitney Houston 's cover of " For the Love of You " , " Pon de Replay " and " The Last Time " , the latter two of which would go on to be included on her debut album , Music of the Sun . Initially , Jay @-@ Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna , because he felt " Pon de Replay " was too big for her , saying " when a song is that big , it 's hard [ for a new artist ] to come back from . I don 't sign songs , I sign artists " . " Pon de Replay " was released via iTunes on July 26 , 2005 , through Def Jam Recordings .

 " Pon de Replay " is a dance @-@ pop , dancehall and R & B song that infuses a reggae style . According to the digital music sheet published at musicnotes.com , the song is written in the key of F @-@ sharp minor and is set in common time with a moderated dance groove , with a metronome of 100 beats per minute .

Doug Rule of Metro Weekly commented on the lyric " Hey Mr. DJ , won 't you turn the music up ? " and that it follows in the footsteps of recent songs which also incorporated " Hey Mr. DJ " , including Madonna 's " Music " and Jennifer Lopez 's " Play " . 
 In an interview with Kidzworld , Rihanna explained the lyrical content of the song , saying : " It 's just language that we speak in Barbados . It 's broken English . Pon is on , de means the , so it 's just basically telling the DJ to put my song on the replay . " Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic wrote about the song 's composition and musical influences , " [ Pon de Replay ] is driven by booming dancehall @-@ lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence ( and title spelling ) , it 's a simple dance @-@ pop song at its core , with standard English @-@ language singing as well as a can 't @-@ miss singalong hook . " Barry Walters of Rolling Stone also commented on the song 's composition and concurred with Birchmeier 's opinions of the song , writing that the song is " a poppy piece of dancehall reggae with slapping , syncopated beats recalling big @-@ band jazz " .

 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Pon de Replay " was directed by Little X. The video is set in a nightclub and begins with Rihanna and two of her friends arriving at a nightclub where the atmosphere appears lackluster ; due to the low volume of the music ( referencing the song 's lyrics ) , the people in the club seem bored and are not dancing . Subsequently , Rihanna vows to make the DJ turn up the music , thus stepping up onto a platform , wearing a silver belly top with baggy jeans , beginning to perform to the song , causing the DJ , played by DJ <unk> Sounds , to turn the music up . With this , the people previously bored now begin dancing to Rihanna 's track , including Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall , who also makes a cameo appearance . Scenes of people dancing in the club are shown , with intercut images being juxtaposed of Rihanna leaning against a wall with the word " Bar " in LED lights .

The video 's final scenes show the people in the club all gathered on the middle of the dance floor , performing various dance moves . These include a line of people featuring Rihanna , and male performers who make a human bicycle from their bodies .

 = Alamogordo , New Mexico = 
 Alamogordo / <unk> / is the county seat and economic center of Otero County in south @-@ central New Mexico , United States . A city in the Tularosa Basin of the Chihuahuan desert , it is bordered on the east by the Sacramento Mountains and to the west by White Sands National Monument . It is the city nearest to Holloman Air Force Base . The population was 30 @,@ 403 as of the 2010 census . Alamogordo is known for its connection with the Trinity test , the first explosion of an atomic bomb , and also for the Atari video game burial of 1983 . 
 Humans have lived in the Alamogordo area for at least 11 @,@ 000 years . The present settlement , established in 1898 to support the construction of the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad , is an early example of a planned community . The city was incorporated in 1912 . Tourism became an important economic factor with the creation of White Sands National Monument in 1934 . During the 1950 @-@ 60s , Alamogordo was an unofficial center for research on pilot safety and the developing United States ' space program . 
 Alamogordo is a charter city with a council @-@ manager form of government . City government provides a large number of recreational and leisure facilities for its citizens , including a large park in the center of the city , many smaller parks scattered through the city , a golf course , Alameda Park Zoo , a network of walking paths , Alamogordo Public Library , and a senior citizens ' center . Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center is a nonprofit shared military / civilian facility that is also the hospital for Holloman . 
 = = History = = 
 Tularosa Basin has been inhabited for at least 11 @,@ 000 years . There are signs of previous inhabitants in the area such as the Clovis culture , the Folsom culture , the peoples of the Archaic period , and the Formative stage . The Mescalero Apache were already living in the Tularosa Basin when the Spanish came in 1534 , and Mescalero oral history says they have always lived there . The Spanish built a chapel at La Luz ( about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from the future site of Alamogordo ) in 1719 , although La Luz was not settled until about 1860 . 
 The city of Alamogordo was founded in June 1898 , when the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad , headed by Charles Bishop Eddy , extended the railway to the town . Eddy influenced the design of the community , which included large wide thoroughfares and tree @-@ lined irrigation canals . Charles Eddy 's brother John Arthur Eddy named the new city Alamogordo ( " large / fat cottonwood " in Spanish ) after a grove of fat cottonwoods he remembered from the Pecos River area . When Alamogordo was laid out in 1898 , the east @-@ west streets were given numerical designations , while north @-@ south streets were named after states . The present @-@ day White Sands Boulevard was then called Pennsylvania Avenue . 
 Several government buildings in Alamogordo were constructed by the Works Progress Administration , a government program created in 1935 in response to the Great Depression . These include the Otero County Administration Building at 1101 New York Avenue , a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938 . The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places . The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd completed in 1942 . The Post Office moved out in 1961 , and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building . The last Federal agency to occupy it was the United States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008 , when that agency moved to a newly constructed building . Ownership of the building was transferred to Otero County government and many government offices were moved from the Courthouse to the new Administration Building in February 2009 . Alamogordo briefly made international news in late 2001 when Christ Community Church held a public book burning of books in the Harry Potter series , and several other series , on December 30 . 
 = = Geography = =

Plants native to the area are typical of the southern New Mexico foothills and include creosote bush , mesquite , saltbush , cottonwood , desert willow , and many species of cactus and yucca . 
 The Tularosa Basin is a closed basin , that is , no water flows out of it . Because of this and because of the geology of the region , water in the basin is hard : it has very high total dissolved solids concentrations , in excess of 3 @,@ 000 mg / L. The Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility , a Bureau of Reclamation laboratory doing research and development on desalination of brackish water , is located in Alamogordo . The gypsum crystals of White Sands National Monument are formed in Lake Lucero . Water drains from the mountains carrying dissolved gypsum and collects in Lake Lucero . After the water dries , the winds pick up the gypsum crystals and distribute them over the basin .

 Alamogordo was founded as a company town to support the building of the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad , a portion of the transcontinental railway that was being constructed in the late 19th century . Initially its main industry was timbering for railroad ties . The railroad founders were also eager to found a major town that would persist after the railroad was completed ; they formed the Alamogordo Improvement Company to develop the area , making Alamogordo an early example of a planned community . The Alamogordo Improvement Company owned all the land , platted the streets , built the first houses and commercial buildings , donated land for a college , and placed a restrictive covenant on each deed prohibiting the manufacture , distribution , or sale of intoxicating liquor . 
 Tourism became an important part of the local economy from the creation of White Sands National Monument in 1934 .

 = Johnny Broderick = 
 Johnny Broderick ( January 16 , 1896 ( some sources say 1894 , 1895 , or 1897 ) – January 16 , 1966 ) was a New York City Police Department detective who became known in the 1920s and 1930s as one of the city 's toughest officers , patrolling the Broadway theater district and policing strikes as head of the NYPD 's Industrial Squad , sometimes personally beating gangsters and suspects . 
 In his career as a detective between 1923 and 1947 , Broderick built a reputation for physical courage , for assaulting gangsters like Jack " Legs " Diamond and " Two @-@ Gun " Crowley , and for facing down armed gunmen in a prison break at The Tombs prison . 
 Broderick was a " celebrity detective " whose exploits were a favorite of gossip columnists and the press . He and his sometime partner Johnny Cordes were probably the best known officers in the NYPD in the era between the two world wars . A character based on Broderick was the subject of the 1936 film Bullets or Ballots , with the Broderick character played by Edward G. Robinson . He was also portrayed in a comic book about police , and a film , TV series and Broadway musical based on his life were once contemplated . 
 Broderick won eight medals for valor during his career , but he was dogged by accusations of excessive force . The Industrial Squad under his command was accused of brutality toward strikers and corruption , with Broderick himself accused of taking bribes , and he once beat a prisoner in his custody so badly that he was permanently crippled . He would sometimes beat up innocent people , and brutality complaints against him were futile . He was finally forced into retirement by Mayor William O 'Dwyer for associating with gangsters . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Joseph Broderick was born on Manhattan 's East 25th Street , in the impoverished Gashouse District , the son of Margaret Kendall and Michael Broderick . At the age of 12 he left parochial school to drive a brick truck , and then a coal truck , to support his mother after the death of his father . He served in the U.S. Navy in World War I and worked as a bodyguard for Samuel Gompers , the labor leader . He joined the New York City Fire Department in April 1922 , but found that boring . Having taken both the Fire and Police Department examinations , in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department . 
 In their 2001 book NYPD , James Lardner and Thomas A. Reppetto describe Broderick as a " Gashouse district tough guy " and " former labor slugger . " 
 = = Career = = 
 Broderick joined the NYPD on January 16 , 1923 , and he became a detective third grade on April 2 of that year , obtaining in less than four months a promotion that would usually take five years . The New York Herald Tribune called his swift appointment as detective " extraordinary luck or influence or both . " He continued to rise rapidly in rank . He was promoted to detective second grade in May 1925 and detective first grade in March 1926 . The Daily News reported years later that " no few of Detective Broderick 's contemporaries [ felt ] that he plainly had an angel somewhere in the city . " In 1934 it was reported that before joining the police department he was a chauffeur for a coal merchant who was close to chief inspector William J. Lahey , who was believed to be Broderick 's sponsor in the department . 
 Broderick was put in charge of the Industrial Squad , a plainclothes unit was created in 1917 to monitor the labor movement , to keep it free from political radicals , Communists and racketeers , and to suppress violence during strikes . Broderick " had little patience with labor militants , " according to one history of the NYPD in that era , and he led the Industrial Squad in violent confrontations with the fur workers ' union , which was led by Communists , and railroad workers insurgents in 1926 and 1927 . Strikes in the city 's Garment District also turned violent , and in August 1925 Broderick 's nose was broken when he tried to disperse a crowd of striking garment workers . 
 In November 1926 the Gangster Squad was absorbed by the Industrial Squad , with Broderick in command . While commander of the Industrial Squad , Broderick received acclaim for his role in quelling an attempted prison break at The Tombs , the Manhattan prison , on November 3 , 1926 . He faced down two armed convicts , one of them mobster Hyman Amberg , in the Tombs yard after they had already killed two prison officials . Police said that the convicts , who were already wounded , committed suicide as Broderick approached . 
 He remained in charge of the Gangster and Industrial Squad until 1928 , when he received what The New York Times described as " lesser assignments . " After Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor in 1934 , Broderick and other police officers fell out of favor for connections with the Democratic Tammany Hall political machine . In 1934 , by then assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney 's office , he was reduced in rank to patrolman , his pay was cut by $ 1000 and he was transferred to Long Island City by police commissioner John F. O 'Ryan . Syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler said at the time that Broderick " has been busted and sent out to walk a beat because he has enjoyed for some years the endorsement and assistance of some of the most pernicious Tammany politicians in the city . He was reinstated as detective third grade by O 'Ryan five months later after meeting with Broderick , saying that the original demotion was a result of " vague criticism regarding their political connections , " and that he was viewed by his current commander as a " model cop . " He was promoted to detective second grade in 1935 and detective first grade in 1939 . 
 On the Broadway beat , Broderick swiftly gained a reputation for violence . His fists were once described as " huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat , " and to " <unk> " became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch . His knuckles were broken many times . Once he knocked out the gangster Francis " Two Gun " Crowley with a single punch , even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him . He was said to have demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him , and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye . Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper , which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled @-@ up newspaper . 
 Broderick 's exploits were widely reported in the New York media , gaining him celebrity status . His tenth anniversary on the police department was commemorated by a dinner in his honor in January 1933 at the Della Robbia room of the Vanderbilt Hotel , attended by politicians and civic leaders including Tammany Hall district leader James J. Hines . Entertainment was provided , gratis , by Bill Robinson , Bert Lahr and Harry Richman . Hines was subsequently convicted of racketeering for protecting Harlem numbers rackets run by Dutch Schultz . 
 Broderick 's exploits were a mainstay of the New York newspapers . He tossed hoodlums who had been bothering women through a plate @-@ glass window , one by one , and then arrested them for malicious destruction of property , for which they were sentenced to 30 days in jail . He also disarmed a man who was robbing a crowded restaurant at Columbus Circle with two guns and a knife . He once reputedly responded to a threat from gangster Legs Diamond by emptying a trash bin over his head , and forced him to crawl away . Other accounts of the confrontation hold that Broderick dumped Diamond in the trash bin head @-@ first , while others say that Broderick knocked out Diamond with a single blow , with one account claiming that Diamond was left unconscious for 20 minutes . Broderick 's reputation for toughness was such that Jack Dempsey , the heavyweight boxing champion , once said of Broderick that " He 's the only I wouldn 't want to meet in a fight outside the ring and its rules . " 
 He would offer himself as an informal protection service for crime victims , especially young women , and personally beat up offenders . 
 Broderick worked often with Johnny Cordes , a two @-@ time winner of the department 's medal of honor , and Barney <unk> , whose exploits inspired the 1959 TV series The Lawless Years . 
 Broderick was often selected as a bodyguard for visiting celebrities . President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that Broderick be his special bodyguard when he visited New York for the 1936 World Series , and he also was bodyguard for Queen Marie of Romania and King Albert of Belgium . 
 = = Allegations of misconduct = = 
 Throughout his career , beginning with his days in the Industrial Squad , Broderick was a subject of allegations of misconduct , and the Industrial Squad under his command was accused of violence toward strikers and corruption . He sometimes beat up people who were totally innocent , and lawsuits and complaints of brutality were futile because of his public image , honed by favorable media coverage , and connections . 
 In a column on Broderick 's brief demotion to patrolman in 1934 , Westbrook Pegler said that the demotion would do him some good , that he " was excessively tough at times and there were occasions when , pining for action , he bounced round people who were in not particular need of bouncing around . " Pegler said that Broderick was selective in whom he would harass , that " there were many low characters in the city , notorious for their activity in the rackets , who were walking right past Detective Broderick on the street and in the lobby of [ Madison Square ] Garden , whom he did not find any occasion to bounce around . " Pegler said he found that " strange . " 
 In July 1926 , Broderick and the Industrial Squad were accused by the American Civil Liberties Union of clubbing and beating striking Interborough Rapid Transit Company workers , injuring 20 . Broderick denied the charges , saying the police were acting in self @-@ defense . The squad was accused by the Teamsters Union of beating striking drivers , and it was accused of brutality against striking paper @-@ box makers in 1926 . The following year , Broderick 's squad was accused of attacking fur industry strikers . In 1928 , Broderick and officers from his squad were accused of beating two spectators at a Madison Square Garden bicycle race , sending them to the hospital with broken jaws and internal injuries . In this incident Broderick 's career was rescued by favorable press coverage . 
 In 1927 , a furriers union official , Isidor Shapiro , told a special committee of the American Federation of Labor that his union paid the police $ 3800 a week in bribes for protection during a 1926 strike . Union officials claimed that non @-@ union workers were beaten while police officers " stood idly by . " Shapiro claimed that the " Industrial Squad chief " was paid $ 100 a week and that ten men in the squad were paid $ 50 a week . Broderick and the other officers were clearly after an inquiry by a judge . The charges were revived in 1939 , when a former Communist , Maurice L. Malkin , accused Broderick and other officers of corruption in testimony before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . Malkin testified that the furriers union , which was controlled by Communists in the 1920s , borrowed $ 1 @.@ 75 million from racketeer Arnold Rothstein to finance the 1926 strike , and that $ 110 @,@ 000 of that went to Broderick and other members of the Industrial Squad , including Barney <unk> . The amount that Broderick received was said to be $ 45 @,@ 000 and $ 50 @,@ 000 . No action was taken against Broderick or the other detectives . 
 As a mayoral candidate in 1929 , Fiorello LaGuardia accused the Industrial Squad of extorting payoffs from labor and management , and that " instead of preserving order , this agency has done more to create disorder than anything else . " The squad was disbanded in 1933 . 
 In 1937 , a justice of the New York State Supreme Court freed a prisoner who had been arrested for parole violation and beaten by Broderick , saying that " the police of the City of New York beat him so badly that he will be a cripple for life . I think this man has more than expiated his crime . " The prisoner sustained fractures to the knee and ribs , his jaw was dislocated , and he was not given medical attention while in police custody . Broderick 's superiors found no reason to discipline the detective . 
 = = Retirement controversy = = 
 In September 1946 , Broderick was assigned to the office of Mayor William O 'Dwyer in an unannounced confidential capacity , a move that many in city government found surprising . After a few months he was abruptly transferred to the Main Office Division , and in July 1947 , he retired from the police department . 
 In 1949 , he sought to become a Democratic leader in the Broadway district on Manhattan 's west side . One of the two incumbent district leaders Broderick was challenging , Gerald V. Murphy , accused him of having been forced out of the department for associating with gangsters . The charge was confirmed by Manhattan 's District Attorney , Frank Hogan , who disclosed that Broderick was forced to retire by Mayor William O 'Dwyer after Hogan 's office learned that in November 1946 he had accompanied a gambler and ex @-@ convict , Ben Kaye , to Hot Springs , Arkansas , where he " associated with " mobster <unk> Madden . Broderick denied the charge , conceding that he was on the same plane as Kaye but that it was a " coincidence . " He admitted that he knew Madden and " every gangster in New York . That was my job . " His bid to become a district leader failed in the September 1949 primary elections . 
 In an editorial , the New York Herald Tribune pointed out that the circumstances of Broderick 's forced retirement only came to light because he was seeking a new career in politics , and that " voters may wonder how much they are really told about city government , when the Broderick incident demonstrates how discreetly a little embarrassment can be obliterated . " 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1931 Broderick was 5 feet 10 inches tall , weighed 170 pounds , and " dresses like Beau Brummel . " He neither smoked nor drank , worked out at a gymnasium every day , and kept in top physical condition . 
 At the time of his demotion in 1934 he was described as having an affluent lifestyle . Though drawing a salary of $ 4 @,@ 000 a year , cut to $ 3 @,@ 000 as a result of the demotion , he drove a Cadillac , dressed expensively and owned a home in Jackson Heights , Queens . 
 Broderick was a devoted prizefighting fan , rarely missing a fight at Madison Square Garden . During his days as a detective , Broderick enjoyed listening to his wife play the piano and was described by his New York Times obituary as fond of " monogrammed , cream @-@ colored silk underwear " and that off @-@ duty he was " the gentlest of men . " He was said to be upset by his portrayal by Robinson in Bullets or Ballots because Robinson was shown drinking and smoking . 
 After his retirement he sold his life story to RKO Pictures for $ 75 @,@ 000 , to be made into a motion picture titled " Broadway 's One @-@ Man Riot Squad . " A 1948 report said that the screenplay was to be by Herman J. Mankiewicz , who knew Broderick from his days as a newspaper reporter . The film , which was to star Robert Ryan , was never made , and plans to have a television series or musical made about his life persisted through 1959 , but did not come to pass . 
 He died of heart disease on his birthday at his farmhouse outside Middletown , New York , where he raised horses and dogs . He was survived by his wife , the former Marion McShea , his daughter , Marion Farinon , three sisters and nine grandchildren . He was buried in Pine Lawn Cemetery in Massapequa , Long Island . In 1933 it was reported that he had been married for 14 years at the time , and that he had two daughters , Margaret and Marion . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The brutal methods used by Broderick and other officers were sanctioned by the police department during their era , and praised as " fearless . " Beginning in the 1960s , however , New York police sought to curb that kind of conduct . Training programs were established teaching officers to observe the civil rights of suspects and the public . By the 1980s , it was feared that the pendulum had shifted back toward brutality , as complaints of assaults by police climbed . Broderick was cited by The New York Times in 1985 as an exemplar of the old methods of policing . 
 At the time of his death in 1966 , Walter Henning , an assistant chief inspector and a colleague of Broderick 's , called him a " man of his time , " and said that " under restrictions today , he 'd have a difficult time doing the things he did . " But during Prohibition , he said , " when these people [ gangsters ] went in and out of court it was like a revolving door , they had rather be locked up than to meet Johnny . " 
 In his 2011 book American Police a History , 1845 – 1945 , Thomas A. Reppetto , a former Chicago detective commander and ex @-@ president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City , said that despite his fearsome reputation Broderick was actually beaten up on several occasions . Broderick 's image , he says , " rested to a great extent that Broadway show business figures relied upon him for informal protection , " as well as on " rave accounts " of his career by Ed Sullivan , Gene Fowler , Toots Shor and others . 
 Reppetto observed that the " real strength " of Broderick and Cordes was that they " had what the gangster did not , the legal right to use deadly force and the practical power to slug hoods on sight . "

 = Jaco Van Dormael = 
 Jaco Van Dormael ( born 9 February 1957 ) is a Belgian film director , screenwriter and playwright . His complex and critically acclaimed films are especially noted for their respectful and sympathetic portrayal of people with mental and physical disabilities . 
 Van Dormael spent his childhood travelling around Europe , before going on to study filmmaking at the INSAS in Brussels , where he wrote and directed his first short film , Maedeli la brèche ( 1981 ) , which received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the Student Academy Awards . Van Dormael 's feature debut , Toto le héros ( 1991 ) , was an immediate hit and won the Caméra d 'Or at the Cannes Film Festival . 
 Five years later Van Dormael was among the prizes again at Cannes with Le huitième jour ( 1996 ) , when his two leading actors , Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne , were jointly awarded the prize for Best Actor . His third feature film , Mr. Nobody ( 2009 ) , received further critical acclaim and many accolades , winning six Magritte Awards , including Best Film and Best Director . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jaco Van Dormael was born in Ixelles . Belgium , on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple . Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven , when his family returned to Belgium . At his birth , he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen . It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired . This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films , which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities . 
 He delighted in working with children and for a while pursued a career as a circus clown . He became a producer of children 's entertainment with the Theatre de <unk> , Theatre <unk> and Theatre de la <unk> . After developing an interest in filmmaking , he enrolled at the INSAS in Brussels and later the Louis Lumière College in Paris . As a children 's entertainer , childhood and innocence would become strong themes throughout his work .

 In the 1980s , Van Dormael produced a number of short films that aroused considerable critical interest . While he was a student at the INSAS , he wrote and directed the children 's story Maedeli la brèche . The short film was praised by critics and received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the 1981 Student Academy Awards presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . The following year Van Dormael directed Stade 81 , a documentary short film about the Paralympic Games . He later directed the award @-@ winning short films Les <unk> ( 1981 ) , L <unk> ( 1982 ) , Sortie de <unk> ( 1983 ) , and De boot ( 1985 ) . His most famous short of the period is È pericoloso sporgersi ( 1984 ) which won the Grand Prix in international competition at the Clermont @-@ Ferrand International Short Film Festival . 
 = = = Mainstream breakthrough = = = 
 Van Dormael made his feature @-@ length debut in 1991 with Toto le héros ( Toto the hero ) , a tale about a man who believes his life was " stolen " from him when he was switched at birth , told in a complex mosaic of flashbacks and dream sequences , sometimes with almost a stream of consciousness effect . Toto le héros was ten years in the making as Van Dormael rewrote the script at least eight times . In 1985 , two Belgian producers read a version of the script , and over the next five years they raised about $ 3 @.@ 5 million , a huge amount for a Belgian production , all in public money from Belgium , the European Community and state television in France and Germany . Van Dormael premiered Toto le héros at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival , where it won the Camera d 'Or . The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and was a financial success . It won five Joseph Plateau Awards , the César Award for Best Foreign Film , four European Film Awards , the André Cavens Award , and received a BAFTA nomination . Pierre Van Dormael 's soundtrack for the film was also well @-@ regarded , and since their first collaboration in 1980 , he has composed the music to every film of his brother . Toto le héros propelled Van Dormael into the international spotlight as both a writer and director . 
 In the wake of this success , Van Dormael participated in the 1995 critically acclaimed project Lumière et <unk> ( Lumière and Company ) . This work is actually an anthology of very short works ( on average 50 – 60 seconds ) contributed by international film directors in which each used the original Auguste and Louis Lumière 's motion picture camera to make his film . The Kiss is the 52 @-@ second film made by director Jaco Van Dormael featuring actor Pascal Duquenne . At the same time , Van Dormael was at work writing his next major work . 
 He wanted to make a more linear film than Toto le héros , one which explored the world through the eyes of a man with Down syndrome . Van Dormael 's next film , Le <unk> jour ( The Eighth Day ) , accomplishes this with the chance meeting and friendship between Georges , played by Pascal Duquenne , and Harry , an unhappy divorced businessman portrayed by Daniel Auteuil . Van Dormael 's interest in people with mental and physical disabilities stems from an interest in their " talent for life , for loving life , that we often lack . " He sought to explore the concept of two worlds ( that of Georges and that of Harry ) existing simultaneously and yet separately . Le huitième jour premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival , where it was nominated for the Palme d 'Or . It did win the Best Actor award at the festival , which was given to both Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil . This was the first time in the festival 's history that two actors had shared the award . The film was acclaimed by film critics and received four Joseph Plateau Awards . It was also nominated for a César Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film . Le huitième jour grossed $ 33 @,@ 031 @,@ 984 worldwide on a budget of $ 5 million making it Van Dormael 's highest grossing film to that point . 
 In 1998 , Van Dormael participated in the project Spotlights on a Massacre : 10 Films Against 100 Million Antipersonnel Land Mines , a collection of short films that works as an anti @-@ land mine campaign . The same year he was also a member of the jury at the 51st Cannes Film Festival . In 1999 , Toto le héros received the Best Belgian Screenplay 1984 – 1999 Award at the 13th Joseph Plateau Awards . 
 = = = Mr. Nobody and after = = = 
 Van Dormael began seeking to film Mr. Nobody in 2001 , an attempt that lasted six years before the director was able to make his English @-@ language feature debut in 2007 . This project differed from other Belgian productions in being filmed in English instead of in one of Belgium 's main languages . The director explained , " The story came to me in English . It 's a story set over very long distances and time frames . One of the strands of the plot is about a kid who must choose between living with his mother in Canada or his father in England . There are also some incredible English @-@ speaking actors I wanted to work with . " The production budget for Mr. Nobody was € 37 million , ranking it the most expensive Belgian film to date . The budget was approved before casting was done , based on the prominence of the director 's name and the strength of his script . The film utilizes nonlinear narrative and the many @-@ worlds interpretation to tell the life story of the last mortal on Earth , Nemo Nobody , portrayed by Jared Leto . 
 Mr. Nobody had its world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009 , where it won the Biografilm Award and the Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Contribution . It has received high praise from film critics and was named by many one of the best films of that year . It received seven Magritte Award nominations , winning Best Film , Best Director , Best Screenplay , Best Cinematography , Best Original Score and Best Editing . It also won the André Cavens Award and the People 's Choice Award for Best European Film at the 23rd European Film Awards . Since its original release , Mr. Nobody has become a cult film , noted for its philosophy and soundtrack , personal characters and Christophe Beaucarne 's cinematography . 
 In August 2014 , Van Dormael began filming his fourth feature film , Le Tout Nouveau Testament ( The Brand New Testament ) , with Catherine Deneuve , Yolande Moreau and Benoît <unk> , a comedy in which God ( <unk> ) is alive and lives in Brussels with his daughter . It premiered at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2015 to critical acclaim . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Van Dormael 's films , while few , have strong common themes between them . They make distinctive use of naive voiceover and examine the world from an innocent perspective ( the young Thomas in Toto le héros , the mentally handicapped protagonist of Le huitième jour , and the unborn child of Mr. Nobody ) . These characters views are often colorful , imaginative , and somewhat removed from reality , with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations . 
 His films also typically end with a death , which is portrayed not as a tragedy , but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below . Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth , but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world . This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody , where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death at the end of the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness . 
 Van Dormael makes prominent use of nostalgic standards music , as well , featuring " Boum ! " by Charles <unk> in Toto le héros and " Mexico " by Luis Mariano in Le huitième jour as recurring themes . Mr. Nobody used " Mr. Sandman " as its recurring musical theme . 
 All of Van Dormael 's films contain surreal elements . In his first two films , these moments were few , like dancing flowers in Toto le héros or Georges flying around the room in Le huitième jour . Mr. Nobody makes much more extensive use of surreal imagery throughout the film . 
 Both Toto le héros and Le huitième jour prominently featured characters with Down Syndrome , and portrayed these characters lovingly , emphasizing their childlike characteristics .

 = Adolf Anderssen = 
 Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen ( July 6 , 1818 – March 13 , 1879 ) was a German chess master . He is considered to have been the world 's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s . He was quite soundly defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858 , but Morphy retired from chess soon after and Anderssen was again considered the leading player . 
 After his defeat by Steinitz in 1866 , Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe , winning over half the events he entered — including the Baden @-@ Baden 1870 chess tournament , one of the strongest tournaments of the era . He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50 . 
 Anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play , particularly in the " Immortal Game " ( 1851 ) and the " Evergreen Game " ( 1852 ) . He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems , driving forward the transition from the " Old School " of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions . 
 He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an " elder statesman " of the game , to whom others turned for advice or arbitration . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Anderssen was born in Breslau ( now called Wrocław ) , in the Prussian Province of Silesia , in 1818 . He lived there for most of his life , sharing a house with and supporting his widowed mother and his unmarried sister . Anderssen never married . He graduated from the public gymnasium ( high school ) in Breslau and then attended university , where he studied mathematics and philosophy . After graduating in 1847 at the age of 29 , he took a position at the Friedrichs @-@ Gymnasium as an instructor and later as Professor of Mathematics . Anderssen lived a quiet , stable , responsible , respectable middle @-@ class life . His career was teaching mathematics , while his hobby and passion was playing chess . 
 When Anderssen was nine years old , his father taught him how to play chess . Anderssen said that as a boy , he learned the strategy of the game from a copy of William Lewis ' book Fifty Games between <unk> and McDonnell ( 1835 ) . 
 = = Chess career = = 
 = = = First steps = = = 
 Anderssen first came to the attention of the chess world when he published <unk> für Schachspieler ( " Task for chess players " ) , a collection of 60 chess problems , in 1842 . He continued to publish problems for many years , both in magazines and as a second collection in 1852 . These brought him to the attention of the " Berlin Pleiades " group , which included some of the strongest players of the time , and he played matches against some of them . Anderssen 's development as a player was relatively slow , largely because he could spare neither the time nor the money to play many matches against strong players . Nevertheless , by 1846 he was able to put up a good fight against another Pleiades member , Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa , who may have been the world 's strongest player at the time . In 1846 , he became the editor of the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner <unk> ( later called Deutsche Schachzeitung ) when its founder Ludwig Bledow , one of the " Berlin Pleiades " , died . Anderssen held this post until 1865 . 
 = = = London 1851 = = = 
 In 1848 Anderssen drew a match with the professional player Daniel Harrwitz . On the basis of this match and his general chess reputation , he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament , to be held in London in 1851 . Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation , as he was deterred by the travel costs . However the tournament 's principal organizer , Howard Staunton , offered to pay Anderssen 's travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary , should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize . Anderssen accepted this generous offer . 
 Anderssen 's preparations for the 1851 London International Tournament produced a surge in his playing strength : he played over 100 games in early 1851 against strong opponents including Carl <unk> , Ernst <unk> , Max Lange and Jean Dufresne . The 1851 International Tournament was a knock @-@ out event in which pairs of competitors played short matches , and Anderssen won it by beating Lionel Kieseritzky , József Szén , Staunton , and Marmaduke <unk> – by margins of at least two games in every case . His prize was two @-@ thirds of the total prize fund of £ 500 , i.e. about £ 335 ; that is equivalent to about £ 240 @,@ 000 ( $ 370 @,@ 200 ) in 2006 's money . When Anderssen and Szén found they were to play each other , they agreed that , if either won the tournament , the other would receive one @-@ third of the prize ; this does not appear to have been considered in any way unethical . 
 Although most chess books regard Wilhelm Steinitz as the first true world champion , one of the organizers of the 1851 London International tournament had said the contest was for " the baton of the World ’ s Chess Champion " . In fact Anderssen was not described as " the world champion " , but the tournament established Anderssen as the world 's leading chess player , at the time it had same meaning . The London Chess Club , which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues , organized a tournament that was played a month later and included several players who had competed in the International Tournament . The result was the same – Anderssen won . 
 = = = Morphy match , 1858 = = = 
 Opportunities for tournament play remained rare , and Anderssen was reluctant to travel far because of the expense . In his one recorded tournament between 1851 and 1862 , a one @-@ game @-@ per @-@ round knock @-@ out tournament at Manchester in 1857 , he was eliminated in the second round . Then in late 1858 he was beaten 8 – 3 by the American champion Paul Morphy in a famous match held in Paris , France ( two wins , two draws , seven losses ) . Although Anderssen knew as well as anyone how to attack , Morphy understood much better when to attack and how to prepare an attack . Morphy had recently scored equally convincing wins in matches against other top @-@ class players : Johann Löwenthal , the Rev. John Owen and Daniel Harrwitz . However Morphy returned to the USA in 1859 and soon afterwards announced his retirement from serious chess . Hence Anderssen was once again the strongest active player . 
 Anderssen played the curious opening move 1 @.@ a3 in three games of his match against Morphy , and broke even with it ( one loss , one draw , one win ) . This opening move , now referred to as " Anderssen 's Opening " , has never been popular in serious competition . 
 = = = Other games 1851 – 62 = = = 
 Shortly after the 1851 London International tournament , Anderssen played his two most famous games , both casual encounters which he won by combinations that involved several sacrifices . In the first , as Black , but moving first , against Lionel Kieseritzky in London just after the International tournament ( 1851 ) and now called the " Immortal Game " , he sacrificed a bishop , both rooks and finally his queen . In the second , played in Berlin in 1852 as white against Jean Dufresne and now called the " Evergreen Game " , the total sacrifice was more modest , but still exceeded a queen and a minor piece . 
 After the match with Morphy , Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch , one of the leading players of the time , who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess . Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and narrowly won in 1861 ( 5 / 9 ; won four , drew two , lost three ; Kolisch was ahead at the half @-@ way stage ) . 
 = = = London 1862 = = = 
 Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament , the first international round @-@ robin tournament ( in which each participant plays a game against each of the others ) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games . He lost only one game , to the Rev. John Owen and finished two points ahead of Louis Paulsen , who had the best playing record in the early 1860s . Morphy had retired from chess at this time , so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world 's leading active player . 
 Anderssen 's only known competitive chess between 1862 and 1866 was a drawn match ( three wins , three losses , and two draws ) in 1864 against Berthold <unk> , who was a strong player and respected chess writer . 
 = = = Steinitz match , 1866 = = = 
 In 1866 Anderssen lost a close match with 30 @-@ year @-@ old Wilhelm Steinitz ( six wins , eight losses , and no draws ; Steinitz won the last two games ) . Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the positional approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority , the 1866 match was played in the attack @-@ at @-@ all @-@ costs style of the 1850s and 1860s . This is generally seen as the point at which Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world 's leading active player . Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been floating around since the 1840s , the 1866 Anderssen – Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship , and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive . Furthermore , Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments & in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871 . 
 = = = 1866 – 79 = = = 
 By this time tournaments were becoming more frequent , and the round @-@ robin format was adopted . At the same time , Anderssen , after losing the match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866 , re @-@ dedicated himself to chess , particularly studying both endgames and positional play . The result was that Anderssen , in his early fifties , was playing the finest chess of his career . As a result , Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career : five first places , two second places , two third places ; and a sixth place in the final year of his life , when his health was failing . One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz , Gustav Neumann , Joseph Henry Blackburne , Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden @-@ Baden 1870 chess tournament . This is regarded as one of the top 20 strongest tournaments ever despite the proliferation of " super tournaments " since 1990 . One of Anderssen 's third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament , when he was 55 . About half of Anderssen 's tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations ; but these were open to all nationalities , and most of them had a few " top ten " or even " top five " competitors . Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches but his dominance came to an end came 1871 . 
 The Leipzig 1877 tournament , in which Anderssen came second behind Louis Paulsen , was organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Anderssen 's learning the chess moves . The initiative sprang from the Central German Chess Federation . It is the only tournament ever organized to commemorate a competitor . 
 Still at Leipzig , Anderssen lost a match against tournament winner Louis Paulsen ( three wins , one draw , and five losses ) . Matches were Anderssen 's relative weakness ; his only match win in this period was in 1868 , against the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Johann Zukertort ( eight wins , one draw , and three losses ) . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 = = = Playing strength and style = = = 
 Anderssen was very successful in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878 , taking first prize in over half of the events in which he played . His only recorded tournament failures were a one @-@ game @-@ per @-@ round knock @-@ out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live . His match record was much weaker : out of the 12 that he played , he won only two , drew four and lost six . 
 Arpad Elo , inventor of the Elo rating system , retroactively calculated ratings through history , and estimated that Anderssen was the first player with a rating over 2600 . Chessmetrics ranks Anderssen as one of the top five players for most of the period from 1851 to shortly before his death in 1879 . 
 Steinitz rated Anderssen as one of the two greatest attacking players of his time : " We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king ’ s @-@ side attack , and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough . " Although Anderssen is regarded as a member of the " heroic " attacking school , he was not in favor of mindless aggression , for example he said : " Move that one of your pieces , which is in the worst plight , unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack " , a principle more recently labelled " Makogonov 's rule " . According to Fine , his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won . 
 Anderssen 's home town was so proud of him that in 1865 Breslau University awarded him an honorary doctorate . 
 = = = Influence on chess = = = 
 The " heroic " attacking school of play to which Anderssen belonged was eclipsed by Steinitz ' positional approach – by 1894 it was generally acknowledged that the only way to beat Steinitz was to apply Steinitz ' principles . 
 Anderssen has had a more enduring influence on chess problem composition . He started composing in the last years of the " Old School " , whose compositions were fairly similar to realistic over @-@ the @-@ board positions and featured spectacular " key " moves , multiple sacrifices and few variations . He was one of the most skilful composers of his time , and his work forms an early stage of the " Transition Period " , between the mid @-@ 1840s and the early 1860s , when many of the basic problem ideas were discovered , the requirement for game @-@ like positions was abandoned and the introduction of composing competitions ( the first of which was in 1854 ) forced judges to decide on what features were the most desirable in a problem . 
 Outside the field of chess problems Anderssen was not a prolific author . However he edited the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner <unk> ( later called Deutsche Schachzeitung ) from 1846 to 1865 , and was co @-@ editor with Gustav Neumann of Neue Berliner Schachzeitung from 1864 to 1867 . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Steinitz wrote : " Anderssen was honest and honourable to the core . Without fear or favour he straightforwardly gave his opinion , and his sincere disinterestedness became so patent .... that his word alone was usually sufficient to quell disputes ... for he had often given his decision in favour of a rival ... " On the other hand , Reuben Fine , a 20th @-@ century player , wrote , " There is a curious contrast between his over @-@ the @-@ board brilliance and his uninspired safety @-@ first attitude in everyday affairs . " 
 = = Death = = 
 Anderssen died on March 13 , 1879 in his hometown . The Deutsche Schachzeitung noted his death in 1879 with a nineteen @-@ page obituary . Bombing raids during World War II damaged his grave in Breslau . After the war , the city became part of Poland and is now known under its Polish name Wrocław . In 1957 , the Polish Chess Federation decided to re @-@ bury Anderssen in a new grave at the <unk> Cemetery .

 = Cleveland Street scandal = 
 The Cleveland Street scandal occurred in 1889 , when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street , Fitzrovia , London , was discovered by police . The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons . At the time , sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain , and the brothel 's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered . It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second @-@ in @-@ line to the British throne had visited , though this has never been substantiated . Sir Charles Russell QC was retained to watch the proceedings in the case on Albert Victor 's behalf . Unlike overseas and Welsh newspapers , the English press never named the Prince , but the allegation influenced the handling of the case by the authorities , and has coloured biographers ' perceptions of him since . 
 The police acquired testimonies that Lord Arthur Somerset , an equerry to the Prince of Wales , was a patron . Both he and the brothel keeper , Charles Hammond , managed to flee abroad before a prosecution could be brought . The male prostitutes , who also worked as telegraph messenger boys for the Post Office , were given light sentences and no clients were prosecuted . After Henry James FitzRoy , Earl of Euston , was named in the press as a client , he successfully sued for libel . 
 The scandal fuelled the attitude that male homosexuality was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower @-@ class youths . Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde of being an active homosexual . 
 = = Male brothel = = 
 In July 1889 , Police Constable Luke Hanks was investigating a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office . During the investigation , a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered to be in possession of fourteen shillings , equivalent to several weeks of his wages . At the time , messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash in the course of their duties , to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers . Suspecting the boy 's involvement in the theft , Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning . After hesitating , Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond , who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street . According to Swinscow , he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk , eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Henry Newlove . In addition , he named two seventeen @-@ year @-@ old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond : George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest <unk> . Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and <unk> and , armed with these , a confession from Newlove . 
 Constable Hanks reported the matter to his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline . Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 . The Act made all homosexual acts between men , as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts , punishable by up to two years ' imprisonment with or without hard labour . He found the house locked and Hammond gone , but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother 's house in Camden Town . In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest , Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond , who had consequently escaped to his brother 's house in Gravesend . 
 = = Notable clients = = 
 On the way to the police station , Newlove named Lord Arthur Somerset and Henry FitzRoy , Earl of Euston , as well as an army colonel by the name of Jervois , as visitors to Cleveland Street . Somerset was the head of the Prince of Wales 's stables . Although Somerset was interviewed by police , no immediate action was taken against him , and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset 's involvement . A watch was placed on the now @-@ empty house and details of the case shuffled between government departments . 
 On 19 August , an arrest warrant was issued in the name of George Veck , an acquaintance of Hammond 's who pretended to be a clergyman . Veck had actually worked at the Telegraph Office , but had been sacked for " improper conduct " with the messenger boys . A seventeen @-@ year @-@ old youth found in Veck 's London lodgings revealed to the police that Veck had gone to Portsmouth and was returning shortly by train . The police arrested Veck at London Waterloo railway station . In his pockets they discovered letters from Algernon Allies . Abberline sent Constable Hanks to interview Allies at his parents ' home in Sudbury , Suffolk . Allies admitted to receiving money from Somerset , having a sexual relationship with him , and working at Cleveland Street for Hammond . On 22 August , police interviewed Somerset for a second time , after which Somerset left for Bad Homburg , where the Prince of Wales was taking his summer holiday . 
 On 11 September , Newlove and Veck were committed for trial . Their defence was handled by Somerset 's solicitor , Arthur Newton , with Willie Mathews appearing for Newlove , and Charles Gill for Veck . Somerset paid the legal fees . By this time , Somerset had moved on to Hanover , to inspect some horses for the Prince of Wales , and the press was referring to " noble lords " implicated in the trial . Newlove and Veck pleaded guilty to indecency on 18 September and the judge , Sir Thomas Chambers , a former Liberal Member of Parliament who had a reputation for leniency , sentenced them to four and nine months ' hard labour respectively . The boys were also given sentences that were considered at the time to be very lenient . Hammond escaped to France , but the French authorities expelled him after pressure from the British . Hammond moved on to Belgium from where he emigrated to the United States . Newton , acting for Somerset , paid for Hammond 's passage . On the advice of the Prime Minister , Lord Salisbury , no extradition proceedings were attempted , and the case against Hammond was quietly dropped . 
 Somerset returned to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at Newmarket but suddenly left for Dieppe on 26 September , probably after being told by Newton that he was in danger of being arrested . He returned again on 30 September . A few days later , his grandmother , Emily Somerset , Dowager Duchess of Beaufort , died and he attended her funeral . The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe , Assistant Treasury Solicitor , and James Monro , Commissioner of Police , pressed for action to be taken against Somerset , but the Lord Chancellor , Lord <unk> , blocked any prosecution . Rumours of Somerset 's involvement were circulating , and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France . Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir Dighton Probyn , who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before , that a warrant for his arrest was imminent . This was denied by Lord Salisbury and the Attorney General , Sir Richard Webster . The Prince of Wales wrote to Lord Salisbury , expressing satisfaction that Somerset had been allowed to leave the country and asking that if Somerset should " ever dare to show his face in England again " , he would remain unmolested by the authorities , but Lord Salisbury was also being pressured by the police to prosecute Somerset . On 12 November , a warrant for Somerset 's arrest was finally issued . By this time , Somerset was already safely abroad , and the warrant caught little public attention . After an unsuccessful search for employment in Turkey and Austria @-@ Hungary , Somerset lived the rest of his life in self @-@ imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France . Other names mentioned by the press were Lord Ronald Gower and Lord Errol . Also implicated was the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley , who fled abroad for four years . The Paris Figaro even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house . The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters . In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being " daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character " bearing upon the scandal . By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified , twenty @-@ two of whom had fled the country .

 Because the press barely covered the story , the affair would have faded quickly from public memory if not for journalist Ernest Parke . The editor of the obscure politically radical weekly The North London Press , Parke got wind of the affair when one of his reporters brought him the story of Newlove 's conviction . Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence ( the usual penalty for " gross indecency " was two years ) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest . His curiosity aroused , Parke found out that the boys had named prominent aristocrats . He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names . It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy , Earl of Euston , in " an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street " . He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person , who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor , the son of the Prince of Wales . 
 Euston was in fact still in England and immediately filed a case against Parke for libel . At the trial , Euston admitted that when walking along Piccadilly a tout had given him a card which read " Poses plastiques . C. Hammond , 19 Cleveland Street " . Euston testified that he went to the house believing Poses plastiques meant a display of female nudes . He paid a sovereign to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the " improper " nature of the place and immediately left . The defence witnesses contradicted each other , and could not describe Euston accurately . The final defence witness , John Saul , was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle , and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel The Sins of the Cities of the Plain which was cast as his autobiography . Delivering his testimony in a manner described as " brazen effrontery " , Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an " immoral life " and " practising criminality " , and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house . The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses , and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country . On 16 January 1890 , the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison . One historian considers Euston was telling the truth and only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card . However , another has alleged Euston was a well @-@ known figure in the homosexual underworld , and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn , that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the Victoria Cross for his tenacity . Saul stated that he told the police his story in August , which provoked the judge to rhetorically enquire why the authorities had not taken action . 
 The judge , Sir Henry Hawkins , had a distinguished career , although after his death a former Solicitor General for England and Wales Sir Edward Clarke wrote : " Sir Henry Hawkins was the worst judge I ever knew or heard of . He had no notion whatever of what justice meant , or of the obligations of truth or fairness . " The prosecuting counsels , Charles Russell and Willie Mathews , went on to become Lord Chief Justice and Director of Public Prosecutions , respectively . The defence counsel , Frank Lockwood , later became Solicitor General , and he was assisted by H. H. Asquith , who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twenty years later . 
 While Parke 's conviction cleared Euston , another trial began on 16 December 1889 when Newlove 's and Somerset 's solicitor , Arthur Newton , was charged with obstruction of justice . It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad . Newton was defended by Charles Russell , who had prosecuted Ernest Parke , and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster , the Attorney General . Newton pleaded guilty to one of the six charges against him , claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients , who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest , from potential blackmail . The Attorney General accepted Newton 's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges . On 20 May , the judge , Sir Lewis Cave , sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison , which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh . A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary , Henry Matthews , protesting at Newton 's treatment . 
 During Newton 's trial , a motion in Parliament sought to investigate Parke 's allegations of a cover @-@ up . Henry Labouchère , a Member of Parliament from the Radical wing of the Liberal Party , was staunchly against homosexuality and had campaigned successfully to add the " gross indecency " amendment ( known as the " Labouchère Amendment " ) to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 . He was convinced that the conspiracy to cover up the scandal went further up the government than assumed . Labouchère made his suspicions known in Parliament on 28 February 1890 . He denied that " a gentleman of very high position " — presumably Prince Albert Victor — was in any way involved with the scandal , but accused the government of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . He suggested that a triumvirate of the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury , the Lord Chancellor of England and the Attorney @-@ General colluded to hamper the investigation , allowing Somerset and Hammond to escape , delaying the trials and failing to prosecute the case with vigour . Labouchère 's accusations were rebutted by the Attorney General , Sir Richard Webster , who was also the prosecutor in the Newton case . Charles Russell , who had prosecuted Parke and was defending Newton , sat on the Liberal benches with Labouchère but refused to be drawn into the debate . After an often passionate debate over seven hours , during which Labouchère was expelled from Parliament after saying " I do not believe Lord Salisbury " and refusing to withdraw his remark , the motion was defeated by a wide margin , 206 – 66 . In a subsequent speech to the House of Lords , Salisbury bore witness against himself by suggesting his memory of his handling of the affair was defective . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Public interest in the scandal eventually faded . Nevertheless , newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice , presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited by members of the upper class . This attitude reached its climax a few years later when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas . 
 Oscar Wilde alluded to the scandal in The Picture of Dorian Gray , first published in 1890 . Reviews of the novel were hostile ; in a clear reference to the Cleveland Street scandal , one reviewer called it suitable for " none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys " . Wilde 's 1891 revision of the novel omitted certain key passages , which were considered too homoerotic . In 1895 , Wilde unsuccessfully sued Lord Alfred 's father , the Marquess of Queensberry , for libel . Sir Edward Carson , Lord Queensberry 's counsel , used quotes from the novel against Wilde and questioned him about his associations with young working men . After the failure of his suit , Wilde was charged with gross indecency , found guilty and subsequently sentenced to two years ' hard labour . He was prosecuted by Charles Gill , who had defended Veck in the Cleveland Street case . 
 Prince Albert Victor died in 1892 , but society gossip about his sex life continued . Sixty years after the scandal the official biographer of King George V , Harold Nicolson , was told by Lord Goddard , who was a twelve @-@ year @-@ old schoolboy at the time of the scandal , that Prince Albert Victor " had been involved in a male brothel scene , and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him . The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence , but was thereafter reinstated . " In fact , none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time , indeed most had very distinguished careers . However , Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients — the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen . In 1913 , he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years ' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences . Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover @-@ up . State papers on the case in the Public Record Office , released to the public in the 1970s , provide no information on the prince 's involvement other than Newton 's threat to implicate him . Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions , Sir Augustus Stephenson , " I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved ( PAV ) . I don 't mean to say that I for one instant credit it — but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said , be concocted or be true . " Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher , confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true . He writes , " I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son 's name being coupled with the thing ... we were both accused of going to this place but not together ... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention . " In his correspondence , Sir Dighton Probyn refers to " cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV " and " false reports dragging PAV 's name into the sad story " . When Prince Albert Victor 's name appeared in the American press , the New York Herald published an anonymous letter , almost certainly written by Charles Hall , saying " there is not , and never was , the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor . " Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual , but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as " ardently heterosexual " and his involvement in the rumours as " somewhat unfair " .

 The site of the brothel at 19 Cleveland Street , Marylebone , and its historical context within the homosexual and other transgressive communities of London 's Fitzrovia and neighbouring Soho and Bloomsbury , has become the subject of academic study and general interest . In Parliament , Labouchère indignantly described 19 Cleveland Street as " in no obscure thoroughfare , but nearly opposite the Middlesex Hospital " . The house , which was located on the western side of Cleveland Street , no longer survives : it was demolished in the 1890s for an extension of the Hospital , which itself was bulldozed in 2005 . Two sketches of the house were published by The Illustrated Police News . 
 It has occasionally been claimed that the house survives . This theory proposes that , following a renumbering of the street , No. 19 was deleted from the Land Survey to suppress its existence , and that the house is the current No. 18 on the eastern side of the street . Cleveland Street was indeed renumbered : the southernmost end was originally Norfolk Street . ( For example , the current number 22 Cleveland Street , was originally 10 Norfolk Street , and for a time was the home of Charles Dickens . ) However , the renumbering of Cleveland Street was ordered in 1867 , long before the scandal , by the Metropolitan Board of Works : " the odd numbers , commencing with 1 and ending with 175 , being assigned to the houses on the Western side ; that the even numbers , commencing with 2 and ending with 140 , to those on the Eastern side ; that such numbers do commence at the Southern end . " An Ordnance Survey of 1870 also shows No. 19 and its adjacent houses on the street 's western side . In an 1894 Ordnance Survey these properties have been subsumed by the new Middlesex Hospital wing . 
 = Soviet Strike = 
 Soviet Strike is a helicopter @-@ based shooter game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation in 1996 and the Sega Saturn in 1997 . The game is a sequel to the Strike games which began on the Sega Mega Drive with Desert Strike : Return to the Gulf . Soviet Strike is the series ' first installment for a 32 @-@ bit console and was first conceived as 32 @-@ bit Strike . Early on , it was intended for the 3DO console , before development changed to the PlayStation . 
 Soviet Strike is set after the disintegration of the Soviet Union , and takes place in a fictionalised Russia , Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea . The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman , a renegade ex @-@ Communist figure . Like its predecessors , the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition , but has more authentic 3D graphics , as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective . The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment . Critics received the game positively , praising the graphics and full motion video , while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Soviet Strike is a helicopter @-@ based shooter game . As in its predecessors , the player views the action from outside his craft , using one of two available viewpoints . These are similar to the isometric perspective of the previous games , but are improved " overhead " versions . This removes the predecessors ' problem of buildings occasionally obstructing the player 's view ; and unlike the previous games , the player can no longer collide the helicopter into structures , instead always flying over them . The first camera system fixates on the Apache , while the second " allows you [ the player ] to rotate the screen around the helicopter " . The Apache is armed with a machine gun , Hydra rockets and Hellfire missiles , which vary in power and payload . The Sega Saturn version includes two hidden power @-@ up weapons : doubled machine guns and Maverick missiles . The craft has finite ammunition , fuel , and armour , and the player must manage the payload by collecting limited supplies . 
 The game has five large levels , each divided into several missions . Mission objectives include seeking and destroying enemy personnel and structures such as radars , training camps and ships ; rescuing prisoners @-@ of @-@ war and other persons ( including , in one mission , Boris Yeltsin ) , as well as recovering intercontinental ballistic missiles and capturing enemy commanders and agents . Soviet Strike employs a relatively realistic , fluid virtual battlefield and sophisticated artificial intelligence , which will put in motion set pieces even if the protagonist has not arrived to take part . The opposing intelligence can track the player using radar and reinforce positions accordingly . As such the player must sometimes pre @-@ emptively destroy radars . Enemy troops may also flee once they have lost a battle . Some missions require set piece solutions , including " starting an avalanche to crush a tank battalion and sealing a nuclear reactor core in a salt mine . " The game is " very tightly structured " , yet the player has the ability to roam the battlefield attacking enemies at will . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The player is a helicopter pilot in STRIKE , a special covert operations force of the US military designed for preemptive action to prevent " wars that never happen . " STRIKE 's commander is General Earle , who has electronics expert Hack and agent Andrea Grey ( whose cover job is a news reporter ) working for him . The other protagonists are STRIKE asset Nick Arnold , guerrilla fighter Amad , and former Soviet Army pilot Ivan <unk> . The game 's antagonists are former KGB Chairman Uri " Shadowman " <unk> , <unk> dictator <unk> Savak , and disgraced Soviet scientist Dr <unk> Ukrainian . 
 A series of voiceovers called STRIKE Files outline the origins of STRIKE . One such file has General Earle detailing the organization 's mandate to US President Bill Clinton after his inauguration in January 1993 . In the tape , Clinton is unaware that STRIKE prevented a civil war in Mexico in 1982 which could have turned the country into a secret Warsaw Pact member @-@ state . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The end of the Soviet Union leaves a power vacuum in Eastern Europe that former KGB Chairman Uri <unk> , AKA the Shadowman , is willing to exploit for his own ends . In the first mission , which takes place in the Crimea , the player must rescue a captured spy named Nick Arnold to retrieve intelligence on the game 's antagonist . The second level is set in the Sea of Azov : the player must battle the elements of the Black Sea Fleet which is preparing to invade Europe . The mission also involves the rescue of guerrilla fighter Amad . 
 STRIKE 's victory in the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus , where <unk> Savak , leader of the fictional state of Irek , begins aggressive overtures against local fighters . In the mission ( which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place ) , the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad 's relatives in stopping <unk> troops from capturing an ex @-@ Soviet chemical weapons plant . With STRIKE killing Savak ( and passed off as the victim of a car crash ) , the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more , this time from Dr <unk> Ukrainian , who wields an arsenal of ballistic missiles . The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman 's lead armor commander , Vila , who operates a special red @-@ turreted T @-@ 80 , and aid in the destruction of an abandoned nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use . 
 The final mission takes place in Moscow , with Shadowman 's unleashing his minions in the KGB , the military and the Russian mafia in attempting a coup against President Boris Yeltsin 's government . The player must prevent a bombing on the Kremlin before seeking out and killing Shadowman . The game 's end sequence depicts Andrea delivering a televised news report blaming the destruction on an earthquake and consequent gas fires . 
 = = Development = = 
 Soviet Strike began development as a game for the 3DO under the working title of 32 @-@ bit Strike . Strike series creator Mike Posehn assisted in early programming and the design but otherwise did not wish to work as part of a large team , necessitated by the move to a more advanced console . The development team , who had already spent several months working on the 3DO version , decided to rework it instead as a PlayStation game when it was clear that the 3DO 's demise was inevitable ; an additional two years ' labor time was the result . The team re @-@ evaluated the basics of the 16 @-@ bit games and aimed to create more lifelike environments and enemy behaviour . The 3D engine - created by the Road Rash 3DO team - used satellite images of real topography , imposed on polygonal maps . It also modified the preceding isometric viewpoint - which caused buildings to obstruct the player 's view - to an overhead perspective with which the player could move and see over terrain and structures . Unlike some of its predecessors , Soviet Strike features only a helicopter - albeit with power @-@ ups in some levels - and the team also abandoned the unpopular on @-@ foot levels found in Urban Strike . The developers aimed to include more humour in the game , with other additions being voice @-@ overs and full motion video . 
 The later Saturn version featured a number of changes : an optional easy difficulty setting ( providing the player with twice the fire @-@ power and slower fuel consumption ) , adjustable brightness on the heads @-@ up display ; two hidden powerful weapons ; hundreds of bug fixes from the PlayStation version ; extra sound effects added to helicopters ; improvements to the graphics of control and menu screens and compass ; stereo and mono versions ; cow sound effects ; and more improvised fuel added to level 4 . It was also compatible with the Saturn 's then @-@ recent analogue controllers . The game was followed by a further sequel , Nuclear Strike , released for the PlayStation in late 1997 .

 Reviewers said the terrain graphics were " realistic " , " nearly photo @-@ realistic " , " photo @-@ realistic " and " Superb " . Others called them " gorgeous " . Reviewing the Saturn version , GameFan said the terrain " looks amazing " . Next Generation said : " the game makes a giant leap forward in terms of the environment " but called the explosions " average " , while those of the Saturn version impressed reviewers . GamePro said the " explosions are satisfying eye @-@ candy " . Jeff Gerstmann said the vehicles " look good " , while another reviewer called the structures " highly realistic " . Next Generation felt the structures and vehicles together with the terrain formed an " impressive " environment . The magazine felt the animation to be " average " ; Gerstmann called it " choppy " but overall felt the graphics an improvement over the game 's predecessors on older systems . GameFan 's Saturn review summarised the graphics as " first @-@ rate " , while Russian magazine Great Drakon also praised them . 
 Critics called the full motion video " stylish " , and praised the acting . Gerstmann said the FMV had " some of the best CD @-@ ROM acting seen in a long time " and called it the game 's " only real plus " . Edge noted the new video but felt it was " over @-@ the @-@ top " and intrusive , while others disagreed . GamePro compared the FMV to Desert Storm if reported by MTV , saying its " hip new attitude " was " part of the charm " , while another critic said the sequences " spice up the proceedings a fair bit " . Great Drakon also praised the FMV . Reviewing the Saturn version , GameFan noted a poorer quality of FMV than the PlayStation version . Gerstmann felt the sound to be " dull " , while Next Generation called it " exemplary " . Others praised the quality of the gunfire sound effects , and noted humour in the enemy troops ' utterances . 
 Gerstmann noted " a raw collection of messy operations " , while Edge praised the game 's " inventiveness " - saying it " makes Soviet Strike " - as well as the variety added by the games artificial intelligence . The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action , the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level . Another critic said the " real @-@ time , living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player 's involvement " and also noted " practically no load time . " GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve , long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die , infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies ' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint , and was thankful for the Saturn version 's optional easier difficulty setting . Next Generation also criticised the player 's restricted view , calling it the game 's " worst problem " . One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game 's longevity ; Sega Saturn Magazine had " some reservations " about the game 's replay @-@ value , with only 5 missions , but said it was " very playable and enjoyable " , while another reviewer called it " a load of fun " . Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling , erratic motion and imprecise control , Great Drakon praised the controls , while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version . The reviewer also enjoyed this version 's new weaponry . Another reviewer pointed to some " minor flaws " , saying the HUD " smacks of 16 @-@ bit era graphics " ; The game impressed Great Drakon 's reviewer , who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing . IGN said : " Everything about this game is great . Excuse me for gushing , but when you come across a game that 's as fun to play as Soviet Strike , and great looking , you really sit up and take notice . " 
 Gerstmann called the quality FMV " a small victory in a larger conflict " , saying the game had " too many little problems to recommend it " and that it " simply doesn 't play as well as the old 16 @-@ bit Strike games . " Sega Saturn Magazine called it a " worthy addition " to the series and also noted improvements to the Saturn version . GameFan said the game " is everything you could wish for from a <unk> Strike " and that " it plays brilliantly , and exercises both your trigger finger and grey matter . " The magazine later reflected that the Saturn version was somewhat better but nevertheless very similar to the PlayStation original . It recommended the game to Strike fans but felt it would be an " in at the deep end " introduction for newcomers to the series . Edge summarised : " this is a fairly well @-@ engineered continuation of the four @-@ year @-@ old Strike series " , which retains the gameplay of the original but updates the graphics to true 3D . GamePro felt the game might be too slow for fans of faster paced action games , but recommended it for players of previous instalments in the series . Allgame later felt : " The series peaked with the release of Soviet Strike . " 
 = Climate of south @-@ west England = 
 The climate of south @-@ west England is classed as oceanic ( Cfb ) according to the Köppen climate classification . The oceanic climate is typified by cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round , with more experienced in winter . Annual rainfall is about 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 39 in ) and up to 2 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 79 in ) on higher ground . Summer maxima averages range from 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) to 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) and winter minima averages range from 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) to 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) across the south @-@ west . It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom , the majority of winds coming from the south @-@ west and north @-@ east . Government organisations predict the area will experience a rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom . 
 Inland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation . They have the highest summer maxima temperatures , but winter minima are lower than those of the coast . Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast , but less so in comparison to higher ground . They experience the lowest wind speeds and the total sunshine hours are between those of the coast and the moors . This typical climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north @-@ east into the region . 
 In comparison to inland areas , the coast experiences high minimum temperatures , especially in winter , and slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer . Rainfall is lowest at the coast and snowfall there is rarer than the rest of the region . Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine . The general coastal climate becomes more prevalent further south @-@ west into the region . 
 The south @-@ west has areas of moorland inland such as Bodmin Moor , Dartmoor and Exmoor . Because of their high altitude they experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the south west ( approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas ) . Both of these factors also result in the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine . Exposed areas of the moors are windier than the lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Information in this article relates to the Met Office definition of south @-@ west England , which covers Cornwall , Devon , Somerset , North Somerset , Bath and North East Somerset , South Gloucestershire , the City of Bristol and the Isles of Scilly . This is a smaller area than the UK Government 's South West England region , which also covers Gloucestershire , Wiltshire and Dorset . The region is also sometimes loosely described as the West Country . 
 = = Temperature = = 
 The south @-@ west experiences a seasonal temperature variation , although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom . This is because the sea is in closer proximity to inland areas of the south @-@ west than inland areas of most of the United Kingdom and the sea has less seasonal temperature variance . The sea is coldest between February and March ; as a result Cornwall and Devon are coldest in February with daily minima ranging from 1 @.@ 5 ° C ( 34 @.@ 7 ° F ) in inland Devon to 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) on the Isles of Scilly . The sea has less influence towards the north @-@ east of the region , causing January to be the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures from 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) or 2 ° C ( 36 ° F ) . In the months of July and August ( the hottest part of the year ) daily maxima range from about 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) on the coast of Cornwall to 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) across inland areas of the north @-@ east ( Somerset and North Somerset ) . 
 The sea surrounding the south @-@ west peninsula has the highest annual mean temperature of any sea in the United Kingdom , with a temperature close to 11 ° C ( 52 ° F ) — 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) . Coastal areas of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly experience annual mean temperatures similar to that of the sea as the prevailing wind is from the sea . Towards the north @-@ east of the region , the annual mean temperature decreases and is closer to 10 ° C / 15 ° F The sea 's influence on annual temperature range is highest in west Cornwall , where the range is approximately 9 ° C / 14 ° F. In the north @-@ east of the region , the range is approximately 12 ° C / 22 ° F. Inland areas are affected by their altitude : the mean temperature decreases as altitude increases . Princetown on Dartmoor , with an altitude of 414 metres ( 1 @,@ 358 ft ) , has a mean temperature of 8 ° C ( 46 ° F ) . 
 The sea 's influence in the south @-@ west usually prevents cold temperatures , however temperatures can plummet during periods of cold easterly air flow : all of which have been recorded in January . In 1987 the minimum temperature recorded at St Mawgan , Cornwall was − 9 ° C ( 16 ° F ) and − 7 @.@ 2 ° C ( 19 @.@ 0 ° F ) was noted on the Isles of Scilly . Inland areas have experienced even colder conditions with − 15 ° C ( 5 ° F ) at Exeter International Airport , Devon in 1958 and at <unk> , Cornwall in 1979 . Further to the north @-@ east of the region , temperatures reached − 16 @.@ 1 ° C ( 3 @.@ 0 ° F ) in Yeovilton , Somerset in 1982 . 
 Extremely high temperatures ( heat waves ) are rare in the south @-@ west . Their occurrence is caused by south @-@ easterly air flow that blows hot air from mainland Europe , combined with strong summer sunshine . The hottest recorded temperature in the south west is 35 @.@ 4 ° C ( 95 @.@ 7 ° F ) , on 3 August 1990 , at Saunton Sands , Devon . 
 = = Sunshine = = 
 Average annual sunshine totals rise above 1 @,@ 600 hours along the coast — higher totals are recorded on the region 's southern coast at the English Channel than on its northern coast along the Bristol Channel . 1 @,@ 400 – 1 @,@ 600 hours of annual sunshine are to be expected in inland areas of the south west . In June 1925 , the highest monthly sunshine totals were recorded : 381 @.@ 7 hours at Pendennis Point , Cornwall and 334 @.@ 8 hours at Long Ashton , Somerset . During the winter months , which are the dullest , less than 20 hours of monthly sunshine have occasionally been recorded . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . 
 In general , June is the sunniest month , because the days are at their longest , and December is the dullest . The Azores high pressure system affects the south @-@ west of England as it extends north @-@ eastwards towards the British Isles . The Azores is more influential in summer . The high pressure reduces cloud cover through the process of subsidence . In spring and summer , the sea is cool compared to the air temperature , causing less convective cloud cover . The convective cloud forms more frequently inland , especially on higher ground such as Dartmoor , Exmoor and Bodmin Moor , thus reducing the amount of sunshine . Coastal areas of the south @-@ west have more hours of sunshine . 
 = = Rainfall = = 
 Most of the rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . 
 The Isles of Scilly have annual rainfall totals of about 850 – 900 mm ( 33 – 35 in ) . Coastal areas of Cornwall and Devon typically receive 900 – 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 35 – 39 in ) of rainfall annually . The altitude increases the amount of rainfall . Highland areas are cooler , causing moist air to cool below the dew point as it rises over high ground forming clouds and then rain . Princetown is 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) from Plymouth and 403 metres ( 1 @,@ 322 ft ) higher , and has double the rainfall . Areas that fall in the rain shadows ( lees ) of higher ground have lower levels of rainfall : 800 mm ( 31 in ) near Exeter ( east of Dartmoor ) and 700 mm ( 28 in ) in parts of central Somerset ( east of Exmoor ) . The Mendip Hills , to the north @-@ east of the region , receive over 1 @,@ 100 mm ( 43 in ) per year and the Bath @-@ Bristol area receives around 800 – 900 mm ( 31 – 35 in ) . 
 The sea reaches its highest temperature in late summer / autumn and its lowest in late winter / spring . As a result , the highest rainfall can be expected in autumn and lowest in spring . The months with the most rainfall are in autumn and winter . Monthly rainfall can be variable . On the coast , most months have recorded less than 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) and , some months , less than 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) at some point . The wettest station of the region , Princetown , has recorded 7 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) of rain during May . 
 The number of days with at least 1 millimetre ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) of rainfall correlates to the pattern of quantity of rainfall . In late spring / summer , 9 – 10 days per month recorded rain in coastal areas , 7 – 9 days in the north @-@ east and 12 – 13 days at high altitude ( Princetown ) . In winter these values increase to 15 – 16 on the coast , 12 – 13 in the north @-@ east and over 18 days in high altitude . 
 Very heavy <unk> — spanning 5 – 15 hours — <unk> rare in the south @-@ west . Such incidences include the Lynmouth disaster of 15 August 1952 , caused by 228 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) of rainfall falling locally on Exmoor over 12 hours . Also , on 8 June 1957 , 203 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) fell at Camelford , Cornwall and in June 1917 , 243 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 6 in ) fell in 13 hours in Bruton , Somerset . The north @-@ Cornish village of Boscastle was flooded on 16 August 2004 ; a peak hourly rainfall of 80 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) was recorded . Approximately 100 people had to be rescued by helicopter and 116 cars were swept out to sea . 
 From December 2013 onwards the Somerset Levels suffered severe flooding as part of the wider winter storms of 2013 – 14 in the United Kingdom . The Levels are a low @-@ lying area around 10 to 12 feet ( 3 to 4 m ) above mean sea level ( O.D. ) which have been prone to flooding from fresh water and occasional salt water inundations . People have attempted to drain the area for hundreds of years . During December 2013 and January 2014 heavy rainfall led to extensive flooding with over 600 houses and 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 900 ha ) of agricultural land , including North Moor , Curry and Hay Moors and Greylake , affected . The village of Thorney was abandoned and Muchelney cut off . 
 = = Snowfall = = 
 Snowfall normally occurs between November and April and short snowfalls can occur between October and May on higher ground . The snow usually only settles between the months of December and March . Snow rarely falls when temperatures are greater than 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) and for snow to settle temperatures must normally be lower than 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) . 
 In the south @-@ west the number of days of snowfall increases with altitude : per approximately every 100 m ( 330 ft ) increase in altitude , the number of days of snow falling increases by five days . From 1979 to 2000 , on average there were fewer than 10 days per winter in which snow fell in the islands of the south @-@ west and the coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall , and slightly more than 10 days on average near to the Severn Estuary . Inland areas received between 8 – 15 days of snow falling ; more days of snow fall were noted particularly to the north @-@ east . Some upland areas received , on average , over 25 days per year of snow falling . 
 Similarly to the ratio of days of snow falling to altitude , the number of days in which snow settles on the ground increases by five days per every 100 m ( 330 ft ) increase in altitude . In the south @-@ west , it is rare that snow settles on the ground . From 1979 to 2000 on average , lowland areas did not record any lying snow in one out of every three years . During this period , snow settled , on average , fewer than three days per year across the Isles of Scilly and on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall . Inland areas had an average of 5 – 10 days of snow lying per year and , as with the days of snow falling ; this was higher towards the north @-@ east of the region . More than 20 days of snow lying can be expected on the high grounds of Dartmoor and Exmoor . 
 The south @-@ west , although the mildest region of the British Isles , has been affected by some of the most severe blizzards . Blizzards are a rare occurrence in the United Kingdom , but can occur when especially cold easterly winds from the continent meet an Atlantic depression , causing a prolonged snowstorm and high winds . This occurred in February 1978 , when 50 cm ( 20 in ) of snow accumulated in inland Devon and 90 cm ( 35 in ) on Dartmoor and Exmoor , causing by − 2 ° C ( 28 ° F ) winds at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . In January 1982 , snow drifts were 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) deep around the Bristol area . Convective showers on 12 January 1987 left parts of Cornwall with deep snow : 35 cm ( 14 in ) at Falmouth , 39 cm ( 15 in ) Penzance and 23 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) on the Isles of Scilly . 
 = = Wind = = 
 The south @-@ west is the second most exposed area of the United Kingdom ; second to western Scotland . The strong winds are caused by deep depressions across or close to the British Isles . Winds are stronger in the winter @-@ half year , as the depressions ' strength and frequency increase . The lightest mean wind speeds are in summer . The speed of peak gusts and mean wind speed follow a similar pattern throughout the year . 
 Mean wind speeds are generally lower to the north @-@ east of the region and in inland areas . Yeovilton , lowland Somerset , has a mean wind speed that is two thirds that of St. Mawgan in coastal Cornwall . An increase in altitude in inland areas generally increases the mean wind speed ; similar wind speeds are recorded on the highest parts of Exmoor and Dartmoor as on the coast . 
 The majority , and the strongest , of the winds are from the south @-@ west and north @-@ east as Atlantic depressions pass from west to east over the United Kingdom . When an Atlantic depression reaches the United Kingdom , winds usually blow from the south or south @-@ west , and they change to west or north @-@ west when the depression leaves . If a depression passes along the English Channel , strong winds can occur from the east or north @-@ east . Due to anticyclogenesis over Scandinavia , the majority of winds in Spring are from the north @-@ east . Coastal areas of the south @-@ west usually experience calm or very light winds that do not have a classifiable wind direction less than 6 % of the time ; this figure is 15 % in the north @-@ east and inland areas . 
 Islands and exposed headlands have the highest number of days per year of gale @-@ force winds ( averaged out over ten consecutive minutes ) . A gale @-@ force wind is defined as being at least 34 knots ( 63 km / h ; 39 mph ) , which is 8 on the modern Beaufort scale . Gales are recorded approximately 24 days per year in the Isles of Scilly and coastal Cornwall . Further north @-@ east and further inland , the number of days decreases . Plymouth , coastal Devon , receives 16 days ; Yeovilton , Somerset , receives seven ; and Long Ashton , north @-@ west Somerset , receives four . Wind speeds can vary on local topography : wooded or urban areas sheltered by hills receive fewer days of gales and lower wind speeds . 
 On 15 December 1979 , there were gusts of 91 knots ( 169 km / h ; 105 mph ) at Lizard Point , Cornwall 99 knots ( 183 km / h ; 114 mph ) at St Mary 's , Isles of Scilly and 103 knots ( 191 km / h ; 119 mph ) at Gwennap Head , Cornwall . Widespread winds from the Burns ' Day storm on 25 January 1990 overturned vehicles and damaged buildings . It caused the highest wind speed during the 1971 – 2001 period to be recorded in two stations : 84 knots ( 156 km / h ; 97 mph ) at Plymouth and 85 knots ( 157 km / h ; 98 mph ) at St Mawgan . 79 knots ( 146 km / h ; 91 mph ) was recorded on top of a building in Bristol as well as 74 knots ( 137 km / h ; 85 mph ) at Exeter International Airport and 68 knots ( 126 km / h ; 78 mph ) at Yeovilton . At Plymouth , the maximum hourly mean speed was 60 knots ( 110 km / h ; 69 mph ) and at Yeovilton , 45 knots ( 83 km / h ; 52 mph ) . The Bristol Channel floods on 30 January 1607 apparently caused " many thousand " deaths and may have destroyed several small harbours . The cause of it is disputed to be either a European windstorm or a tsunami . 
 = = Future = = 
 According to a study by the Met Office , within 40 years the average temperature is likely to increase by 2 ° C ( 4 ° F ) in the south @-@ west and the average warmest summer day will increase by 3 ° C ( 6 ° F ) to be 31 ° C ( 88 ° F ) . It predicts that the region will have one of the highest annual temperatures in the United Kingdom and there will be an estimated 53 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 1 in ) increase in winter precipitation . 
 The rise in temperature could lead to outdoor citrus cultivation being possible . Sea level rises could cause spring tides to rise over many of the region 's harbour walls and an increase in sea level by about 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) at Newlyn . Following the announcement , the government of the United Kingdom called on the local authorities and other organisation to prepare for the consequences . All major government investments will have to consider the risks as a result of future climate change . 
 A report from the Environment Agency said that , over the next 25 years , investment would need to double for the building and upkeep of flood defences in order to maintain the current levels of flood protection and counter the effects of climate change . Flooding from rivers and the sea currently puts 65 @,@ 369 properties at risk in Devon and Cornwall , 29 @,@ 577 of which are at " significant risk " . Current flood defence schemes protect some of these properties from flooding . Richard Cresswell , the regional director for the Environment Agency in the south west , said : 
 " The latest UK climate change data shows that the risk of flooding and coastal erosion will continue to increase in future due to rising sea levels and more frequent and heavy storms . " 
 £ 357 million on flood risk management in Cornwall , Devon , Dorset , Somerset , South Gloucestershire and Wiltshire has been spent since 2002 , which includes spending continuing into 2009 / 10 . 
 Rising sea levels are likely to cause more flooding on the Somerset Levels . Since 1990 the drainage board has been charged with looking at the rhynes , cleaning them out and keeping them clear , with the Environment Agency overseeing the work . With rising sea levels the work required to maintain the current sea defences is likely to become more expensive and it has been proposed by Ian Liddell @-@ Grainger ( Bridgwater @-@ MP ) , that two inland seas are created .

 = HMS Ajax ( 1880 ) = 
 HMS Ajax was the name ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1870s . Completed in 1883 , she was immediately placed in reserve until 1885 when the ship was commissioned for the first time . Later that year , Ajax was assigned as a coast guard ship in Scotland and remained there for the next six years . She was reduced to reserve again in 1891 and was taken out of service a decade later . The ship was sold for scrap in 1904 and subsequently broken up . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Ajax class was designed as a shallow @-@ draught version of the preceding Inflexible that was also smaller and cheaper ; unfortunately the need , imposed by budgetary constraints , to produce a smaller ship produced a vessel with all of the shortcomings of Inflexible but with none of her virtues . The ships had a length between perpendiculars of 280 feet ( 85 @.@ 3 m ) and were 300 feet 9 inches ( 91 @.@ 7 m ) long overall , some 44 feet ( 13 @.@ 4 m ) shorter than Inflexible . They had a beam of 66 feet ( 20 @.@ 1 m ) , and a draught of 23 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 2 m ) and displaced 8 @,@ 510 long tons ( 8 @,@ 650 t ) . Their crew consisted of 345 officers and ratings , over 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 048 t ) less than Inflexible . The Ajax @-@ class ships were bad seaboats and steered very erratically , especially at high speed . More deadwood was added to their sterns in 1886 in a partially successful attempt to rectify the problem . 
 The Ajax class was powered by a pair of inverted , vertical , compound @-@ expansion steam engines . These were built by John Penn and Sons and each drove a single propeller using steam provided by 10 cylindrical boilers . The engines were designed to produce a total of 6 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . The ships carried a maximum of 970 long tons ( 986 t ) of coal , enough to steam 2 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ; 2 @,@ 400 mi ) at 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . 
 They copied the main armament layout of Inflexible with their turrets arranged en echelon so that both turrets could directly ahead and to each side , although this was more theoretical than practical due to damage from muzzle blast . Each turret mounted a pair of rifled muzzle @-@ loading RML 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 318 mm ) guns . Their shells weighed 809 pounds ( 367 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 38 long tons ( 39 t ) . The guns had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 575 ft / s ( 480 m / s ) and were credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 18 @.@ 4 inches ( 470 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . To attack the unarmoured portion of their opponents , the Ajax class was fitted with a pair of rifled breech @-@ loading BL 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) , 80 @-@ pounder guns . For defence against torpedo boats , they carried six quick @-@ firing QF 6 @-@ pdr ( 2 @.@ 2 in ( 57 mm ) ) Nordenfelt guns . The ships also mounted a pair of above @-@ water 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo launchers and could carry a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) torpedo boat . 
 The Ajax class copied Inflexible 's armour scheme of a heavily armoured citadel with <unk> ends and sides . But unlike their predecessor , they lacked enough buoyancy to remain afloat if their ends were flooded . The citadel was 104 feet ( 32 m ) and the armour was composed of wrought iron plates 10 inches ( 254 mm ) and 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick , separated and backed by 10 inches of teak at the waterline , reducing above and below the waterline to an armoured thickness of 15 inches ( 381 @.@ 0 mm ) in a similar sandwich . The citadel was closed off by fore and aft transverse bulkheads that were 16 @.@ 5 inches ( 419 mm ) thick above water and 13 @.@ 5 inches ( 343 mm ) below . The armoured deck was 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick from bow to stern . The turrets were protected by compound armour plates 16 to 14 inches ( 406 to 356 mm ) thick and 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) plates defended the conning tower .

 Ajax , the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy , was named for the mythological hero . The ship was laid down on 21 March 1876 in No. 4 Slipway , Pembroke Dockyard , Wales , and was launched on 10 March 1880 by Mrs. George Parkin , wife of the dockyard 's Captain @-@ Superintendent . She was completed on 30 March 1883 at a cost of £ 548 @,@ 393 . 
 Ajax was not commissioned until 30 April 1885 and was assigned to the Particular Service Squadron commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby . That summer , the squadron evaluated the weapons and defences of a fortified harbour , Berehaven ( now <unk> ) , Ireland , against torpedo boats and other threats . In August 1885 , when tensions with Russia had subsided , she was posted as guard ship at Greenock . Ajax accidentally collided with the turret ship Devastation in 1887 off Portland . The latter had one compartment below water holed , but Ajax only received two holes in her bow . The ship participated in the annual manoeuvres in August 1889 and a shell exploded in one of her 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun barrels on 2 September , wounding one man . The ship was reduced to reserve at Chatham Dockyard in 1891 . Her BL six @-@ inch , 80 @-@ pounder guns were replaced by QF six @-@ inch guns in 1897 . She was further reduced to Dockyard Reserve in November 1901 , and was sold to Castles for scrap in March 1904 and subsequently broken up at Charlton . 
 = Atlantic torpedo = 
 Tetronarce <unk> also known as the Atlantic torpedo is a species of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae . It is found in the Atlantic Ocean , from Nova Scotia to Brazil in the west and from Scotland to West Africa and off southern Africa in the east , occurring at depths of up to 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) . Younger individuals generally inhabit shallower , sandy or muddy habitats , whereas adults are more pelagic in nature and frequent open water . Up to 1 @.@ 8 m ( 6 ft ) long and weighing 90 kg ( 200 lb ) , the Atlantic torpedo is the largest known electric ray . Like other members of its genus , it has an almost circular pectoral fin disk with a nearly straight leading margin , and a robust tail with a large triangular caudal fin . Distinctive characteristics include its uniform dark color , smooth @-@ rimmed spiracles ( paired respiratory openings behind the eyes ) , and two dorsal fins of unequal size . 
 Solitary and nocturnal , the Atlantic torpedo is capable of generating up to 220 volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators . Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes , though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans . It is an aplacental viviparous species , wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) . Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year . The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful , though it is not fatal . Because of its electrogenic properties , the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon . Prior to the 19th century , its liver oil was used as lamp fuel , but it is no longer of any economic value . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species as Data Deficient ; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers , but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first scientific description of the Atlantic torpedo was published in 1835 by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte , in his principal work <unk> della Fauna <unk> . Sixteen specimens were designated as the syntypes . The assignment of the southern African " great torpedo " to this species is provisional . Another type of electric ray found in the Indian Ocean off Mozambique may also belong to T. <unk> . The Atlantic torpedo is placed in the subgenus Tetronarce , which differs from the other Torpedo subgenus Torpedo in having generally plain coloration and smooth @-@ margined spiracles . Other common names include Atlantic electric ray , Atlantic New British torpedo , black torpedo , crampfish , electric ray , numbfish , or torpedo . This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Atlantic torpedo has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc 1 @.@ 2 times as wide as it is long , with a thick and nearly straight front margin . The eyes are small and are followed by much larger spiracles , which do not have papillae on their inner rims . The nostrils are close to the mouth ; there is a flap of skin between them three times as wide as long , with a sinuous rear margin . The mouth is wide and arched , with prominent furrows at the corners . The teeth are pointed and increase in number with age , ranging from 38 rows in juveniles to 66 rows in adults ; the first several series of teeth are functional . The gill slits are small , with the first and fifth pairs shorter than the others . 
 The pelvic fins are rounded and slightly overlapped by the disc at the front . The first dorsal fin is triangular with a rounded apex , originating in front of the pelvic fin insertions . The second dorsal fin is only one @-@ half to two @-@ thirds as large as the first ; the distance between the dorsal fins is less than the length of the first dorsal fin base . The stout tail comprises about one @-@ third of the total length , terminating in a caudal fin shaped like an equilateral triangle with slightly convex margins . The skin is soft and completely devoid of dermal denticles ( scales ) . The dorsal coloration is a plain dark brown to gray , sometimes with a few diffuse spots , and darkening at the fin margins . The underside is white , with dark fin margins . The largest of the electric rays , the Atlantic torpedo can measure 1 @.@ 8 m ( 6 ft ) long and weigh 90 kg ( 200 lb ) . However , a length of 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 5 m ( 2 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 9 ft ) and weight of 30 lb ( 14 kg ) is more typical . Females attain a larger size than males . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Atlantic torpedo is widely distributed in cool waters on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean . In the east , it is found from northern Scotland to the Gulf of Guinea , including the entire Mediterranean Sea ( but not the Black Sea ) , the Azores , and Madeira , as well as from Namibia to western South Africa . In the west , it occurs from southern Nova Scotia to Venezuela and Brazil . It is rare in the North Sea and the Mediterranean and south of North Carolina . 
 Juvenile Atlantic torpedoes are primarily bottom @-@ dwelling and usually found at depths of 10 – 50 m ( 33 – 164 ft ) over sandy or muddy flats , or near coral reefs . As they mature , they become more pelagic in habits , and adults are often encountered swimming in the open ocean . This species has been recorded from the surface to a depth of 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) ; in the Mediterranean , it is most common at depths of 200 – 500 m ( 660 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) . It is said to make long migratory movements . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Like other members of its family , the Atlantic torpedo is capable of generating a powerful electric shock from a pair of kidney @-@ shaped electric organs in its disc , for both attack and defense . These organs comprise one @-@ sixth of the ray 's total weight and contain around half a million jelly @-@ filled " electric plates " arranged in an average of 1 @,@ 025 – 1 @,@ 083 vertical hexagonal columns ( visible beneath the skin ) . These columns essentially act as batteries connected in parallel , enabling a large Atlantic torpedo to produce up to a kilowatt of electricity at 170 – 220 volts , provided that it is well @-@ fed and rested . The discharges from the electric organ occur in a series , or train , of closely spaced pulses each lasting around 0 @.@ 03 seconds . Trains contain on average 12 pulses , but trains of over 100 pulses have been recorded . The ray regularly emits pulses even without an obvious external stimulus . 
 Solitary in nature , the Atlantic torpedo is often seen resting on or half @-@ buried in the substrate during the day , becoming more active at night . Large and well @-@ defended from attack , it seldom falls prey to other animals . Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms <unk> occidentale and C. minus , <unk> <unk> , <unk> sp . , and Phyllobothrium gracile , the monogeneans Amphibdella <unk> and Amphibdelloides maccallumi , and the copepod Eudactylina <unk> . Some accounts suggest that this ray may be able to survive out of water for up to a day . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The diet of the Atlantic torpedo consists mainly of bony fishes , including flatfishes , salmon , eels , and mullet , though it has also been known to take small catsharks and crustaceans . Captive rays have been observed lying still on the bottom and " pouncing " on fish that pass in front of them . At the moment of contact , the ray traps the prey against its body or the bottom by curling its pectoral fin disc around it , while delivering strong electric shocks . This strategy allows the sluggish ray to capture relatively fast @-@ moving fish . Once subdued , the prey is maneuvered to the mouth with rippling motions of the disc and swallowed whole , head @-@ first . The ray 's highly distensible jaws allow surprisingly large prey to be ingested : an intact salmon weighing 2 kg ( 4 lb ) has been found in the stomach of one individual , and another contained a summer flounder ( Paralichthys dentatus ) 37 cm ( 15 in ) long . This ray has been known to kill fish much larger than it can eat . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The Atlantic torpedo is aplacental viviparous : the developing embryos are sustained by yolk , which is later supplemented by protein and fat @-@ enriched histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . Females have two functional ovaries and uteruses , and a possibly biennial reproductive cycle . After a year @-@ long gestation period , females bear up to 60 pups during the summer ; the litter size increases with the size of the female . When the embryo is 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long , it has a pair of deep notches at the front of the disc marking the origin of the pectoral fins , and the curtain of skin between the nostrils has not yet developed ; on the other hand , the eyes , spiracles , dorsal fins , and tail have reached adult proportions . Newborn rays measure 17 – 25 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) long , and still have the anterior notches in the disc . Males and females reach sexual maturity at lengths of 55 cm ( 22 in ) and 90 cm ( 35 in ) respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Though seldom life @-@ threatening , the electric discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe and may be enough to knock a person unconscious . However , a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock . The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value , as its meat is flabby and tasteless . It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook @-@ and @-@ line . When caught at sea , it is generally discarded or cut up for bait . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient ; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality , though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking , as well as by the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles . Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion . 
 Various electric fishes , including the Atlantic torpedo , were used in medicine during the classical era . In the 1st century , Roman physician Scribonius Largus wrote of the application of live " dark torpedo " to patients afflicted with gout or chronic headaches . In 1800 , the Atlantic torpedo became the namesake for the naval weapon when American inventor Robert Fulton began using the word " torpedo " to describe bombs that submarines could attach to ships ( although these early devices were more akin to modern @-@ day mines ) . Before the widespread introduction of kerosene in the 19th century , the liver oil of this species was regarded as of equal quality to sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ) oil for use in lamps . Before the 1950s , its oil was also used in small quantities by fishermen in the United States as a treatment for muscle and stomach cramps , as well as to lubricate farm machinery . Along with several other species of electric rays , the Atlantic torpedo is used as a model organism in biomedical research because its electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptor proteins . These proteins play an important role in mediating many neurological processes , such as those involved in the functioning of anesthesia . 
 = Afrasia djijidae = 
 Afrasia djijidae is a fossil primate that lived in Myanmar approximately 37 million years ago , during the late middle Eocene . The only species in the genus Afrasia , it was a small primate , estimated to weigh around 100 grams ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) . Despite the significant geographic distance between them , Afrasia is thought to be closely related to Afrotarsius , an enigmatic fossil found in Libya and Egypt that dates to 38 – 39 million years ago . If this relationship is correct , it suggests that early simians ( a related group or clade consisting of monkeys , apes , and humans ) dispersed from Asia to Africa during the middle Eocene and would add further support to the hypothesis that the first simians evolved in Asia , not Africa . Neither Afrasia nor Afrotarsius , which together form the family Afrotarsiidae , is considered ancestral to living simians , but they are part of a side branch or stem group known as eosimiiforms . Because they did not give rise to the stem simians that are known from the same deposits in Africa , early Asian simians are thought to have dispersed from Asia to Africa more than once prior to the late middle Eocene . Such dispersals from Asia to Africa also were seen around the same time in other mammalian groups , including <unk> rodents and anthracotheres . 
 Afrasia is known from four isolated molar teeth found in the Pondaung Formation of Myanmar . These teeth are similar to those of Afrotarsius and Eosimiidae , and differ only in details of the chewing surface . For example , the back part of the third lower molar is relatively well @-@ developed . In the Pondaung Formation , Afrasia was part of a diverse primate community that also includes the eosimiid Bahinia and members of the families <unk> and Sivaladapidae . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Afrasia derives from the continental names " Africa " and " Asia " , and refers to the occurrence of <unk> primates on both continents . The species , A. djijidae , was named in memory of a young girl from <unk> village in central Myanmar . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 Afrasia djijidae was first described in 2012 on the basis of isolated teeth from the 37 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Pondaung Formation , which is close to the village of <unk> in Myanmar . Prior to the discovery of A. djijidae , early Asian simians were typically classified in two families , Eosimiidae and <unk> . While eosimiids are generally considered the most basal simian clade ( a stem group of simians ) , the phylogenetic placement of <unk> is more disputed . <unk> are usually considered to share affinities with either eosimiids or crown simians ( those simians that are part of the smallest clade that contains the living simians ) ; the latter view is favored . 
 <unk> were first described from findings in China in 1994 and are still best known there ( two genera are now known , Eosimias and Phenacopithecus ) , but have also been recorded in Pakistan ( Phileosimias ) and Myanmar ( Bahinia ) . All species had a small body size and a mix of primitive ( ancestral ) and derived traits ( . The largest eosimiid , Bahinia , is from the Pondaung Formation , the same stratum as Afrasia , and the morphology of its molars bridges the gap between the more primitive molars of Eosimias and the more derived molars of the later Eocene African simians . Afrasia , on the other hand , is more comparable in size to the eosimiids from China . 
 The upper molars of Afrasia are nearly identical in morphology and size to those of Afrotarsius , an animal known from <unk> to 39 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old deposits in Libya ( species Afrotarsius libycus ) and about 30 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old deposits in Egypt ( A. <unk> ) . Afrotarsius was originally described as a tarsier , but later suggested to be related to primitive simians . Because of their close similarities , Afrasia and Afrotarsius are together placed in the family Afrotarsiidae . A phylogenetic analysis placed Afrasia as a sister group to Afrotarsius , forming the family Afrotarsiidae . Afrotarsiidae was found to be most closely related to Eosimiidae , and unrelated to tarsiers . The clade formed by Afrotarsiidae and Eosimiidae was designated as the infraorder <unk> by <unk> et al. in 2012 . <unk> are the sister group of crown simians . However , the classification of Afrotarsius as a stem simian is not accepted by all researchers , and the phylogenetic claims and their implications rest on only the four molars of Afrasia initially discovered . 
 = = = Biogeography = = = 
 Several hypotheses compete to explain the geographic origins of simians . Of the two most popular views , one hypothesis states that simians originated in Asia , while the other favors Africa as their place of origin . Both their ancient origins and the sparse fossil record in Africa and Asia complicate the debate . Convergent evolution also makes it difficult for researchers to determine the relationships between fossils . Also , the earliest fossils , which do not match up with molecular clock estimates for simian origins , have been found in both Afro @-@ Arabia and Asia . At the time , both land masses would have been separated by the Tethys Sea . 
 The oldest undisputed simians from Africa also date to the late middle Eocene . Afrotarsius was found in the Dur At @-@ <unk> escarpment in Libya , which dates to 38 – 39 million years ago and also contains the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> . Although diverse , these primates were all very small in size , much like eosimiids . Simian classification for older fossils from Africa are more contested . Altiatlasius , the oldest suspected fossil primate known from the late Paleocene of Morocco , is too fragmentary to ascertain its true affinities . <unk> was popularly considered an early middle Eocene simian ; however , less fragmentary remains uncovered between 2003 and 2009 suggest it was a type of <unk> , a group of strepsirrhine primates likely related to lemuriform primates ( lemurs and lorisoids ) . 
 According to the team who discovered Afrasia , headed by Jean @-@ Jacques Jaeger , the similarities in tooth morphology , body size and age suggest a phylogenetic relationship with Afrotarsius despite the geographic separation . They suggested that <unk> simians from Asia dispersed across the Tethys Sea to Africa around the middle Eocene , giving rise to Afrotarsius . A reverse migration — as suggested by the African origins hypothesis for simians — is not favored due to the close phylogenetic relationship between the older Asian eosimiids and Afrasia . However , to explain the origins of <unk> , <unk> , and crown simians from the African fossil record , a higher simian clade also needed to disperse from Asia to Africa before the late middle Eocene since neither Afrasia nor Afrotarsius could have given rise to this group . Such dispersals from Asia to Africa were not uncommon , since <unk> rodents , anthracotheres , and possibly other mammalian fauna from Asia arrived around the same time . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 Afrasia is known from four isolated teeth : a first upper molar ( M1 ) , with a length of 2 @.@ 13 mm and width of 3 @.@ 06 mm ; a second upper molar ( M2 ) , the holotype , of 2 @.@ 27 mm by 3 @.@ 35 mm ; a second lower molar ( m2 ) of 2 @.@ 09 mm by 1 @.@ 41 mm ; and a third lower molar ( m3 ) of 2 @.@ 05 mm by 1 @.@ 27 mm . Like other eosimiiforms , it was a small primate that weighed around 94 or 108 g ( 3 @.@ 3 or 3 @.@ 8 oz ) , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1 , respectively . It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular ; some distinguishing features are the well @-@ developed small cusps ( conules ) on the upper molars , the variable development of the lingual cingulum ( a shelf on the inner , or lingual , side of the tooth ) of the upper molars , and the unreduced talonid ( posterior portion ) on the m3 . Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus , Bahinia , and Phileosimias . 
 The M2 is similar to that of eosimiids and almost identical to that of Afrotarsius libycus . It shows well @-@ developed small accessory cusps ( the paraconule and metaconule ) that are connected to equally well @-@ developed crests . The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia , but weaker than in Phileosimias . The stylar shelf , the outer area of the tooth , is broad , particularly at the metacone cusp . However , the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius , which makes the <unk> ( an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth ) more symmetrical in the former . The parastyle , a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth , is located more buccally ( towards the outer side of the tooth ) than in Afrotarsius and is larger . The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias , but smaller than that of Eosimias . The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias , but the protocone , the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth , is more expansive . The lingual cingulum is incomplete ; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus . 
 M1 is similar to M2 , but somewhat smaller . The <unk> is less apparent , the stylar shelf is narrower , there is no crest behind the metaconule , and the lingual cingulum is continuous . The condition of the parastyle more closely resembles that in Afrotarsius . 
 In m2 , the trigonid ( the front portion of the tooth ) consists of three very distinct cusps : the paraconid at the front , and behind it the paired protoconid ( on the buccal side ) and metaconid ( on the lingual side ) . These three cusps are less discrete in Afrotarsius . The paraconid is distinct from the <unk> , the crest that connects it to the protoconid , and is located more lingually than in Afrotarsius . Between this cusp and the metaconid behind it , the central basin of the trigonid is open towards the lingual margin of the tooth . The protoconid has a V shape , with one arm reaching towards the metaconid and the other towards the paraconid . The back portion of the tooth , the talonid , is broader ; Eosimias has a narrower talonid . The main cusps , the buccal hypoconid and lingual entoconid , are opposite each other on the margins of the tooth ( the entoconid is further to the front in Phenacopithecus ) . A crest , the cristid obliqua , connects the front side of the hypoconid to the protoconid . It is nearly in line with the main axis of the tooth , contrasting with its more diagonal position in Eosimias and Phenacopithecus . A crest , the postcristid , descends from the hypoconid along the back margin of the tooth and almost reaches the entoconid , which is separated by a notch . It incorporates the third talonid cusp , the hypoconulid , which is indistinct in Afrasia . In Afrotarsius and eosimiids ( except the Pakistani Phileosimias ) , this crest reaches the entoconid . There is a cingulum , or shelf , on the buccal side of m2 . 
 The last lower molar , m3 , is smaller and has a longer talonid , with a well @-@ developed hypoconulid lobe at the back , and generally resembles that of Phenacopithecus , but the trigonid is smaller . The paraconid is distinct . The hypoconulid lobe is longer than in Afrotarsius and the entoconid is located further to the front . Unlike on m2 , there is no notch between the hypoconulid and entoconid , though a shallow valley is present . 
 = = Range and ecology = = 
 Afrasia has only been found in the Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar , a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using <unk> and fission track dating . This places it at the end of the <unk> stage , near the Middle – Late Eocene boundary . Although many tons of sediments in the area have been screened for fossils , Afrasia is still known only from four teeth , suggesting that it was a rare species . 
 Since fossils were first discovered there in 1916 , a rich fossil fauna has been recovered in the Pondaung Formation . In addition to Afrasia , primates found there include the eosimiid Bahinia ; the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; and the sivaladapids <unk> and <unk> . 
 = Philitas of Cos = 
 Philitas of Cos ( / <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> , <unk> ; c . 340 – c . 285 BC ) , sometimes spelled Philetas ( / <unk> / ; <unk> , <unk> ; see Bibliography below ) , was a scholar and poet during the early Hellenistic period of ancient Greece . A Greek associated with Alexandria , he flourished in the second half of the 4th century BC and was appointed tutor to the heir to the throne of Ptolemaic Egypt . He was thin and frail ; Athenaeus later caricatured him as an academic so consumed by his studies that he wasted away and died . 
 Philitas was the first major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet . His reputation continued for centuries , based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in elegiac meter . His vocabulary Disorderly Words described the meanings of rare literary words , including those used by Homer . His poetry , notably his elegiac poem Demeter , was highly respected by later ancient poets . However , almost all his work has since been lost . 
 = = Life = = 
 Little is known of Philitas ' life . Ancient sources refer to him as a Coan , a native or long @-@ time inhabitant of Cos , one of the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea just off the coast of Asia . His student Theocritus wrote that Philetas ' father was <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) and his mother , assuming the manuscript is supplemented correctly , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) . From a comment about Philitas in the Suda , a 10th @-@ century AD historical encyclopedia , it is estimated he was born c . 340 BC , and that he might have established a reputation in Cos by c . 309 / 8 BC . During the Wars of the Diadochi that followed the death of Alexander the Great and divided Alexander 's empire , Ptolemy had captured Cos from his rival successor , Antigonus , in 310 BC ; his son , Ptolemy II Philadelphus , was born there in 308 BC . It was a favorite retreat for men of letters weary of Alexandria . 
 Philetas was appointed Philadelphus ' tutor , which suggests he moved to Alexandria c . 297 / 6 BC and moved back to Cos in the later <unk> BC . He may also have tutored Arsinoe II , Philadelphus ' older sister and eventual wife . Later tutors of royal offspring in Ptolemaic Egypt generally headed the Library of Alexandria , but it is unknown whether Philitas held that position . Philitas also taught the poets Hermesianax and Theocritus and the grammarian <unk> , and after he returned to Cos he seems to have spent at least ten years leading a brotherhood of intellectuals and poets that included Aratus , Hermesianax , and Theocritus . 
 Hermesianax wrote of " Philitas , singing of nimble <unk> " , and Ovid twice calls her " Battis " . It is commonly thought that <unk> or Battis was Philitas ' mistress , and that Hermesianax referred to love poetry ; another possibility is that her name connoted " chatterbox " , and that she was a humorous personification of Philitas ' passion for words . 
 Philitas was thin and frail , and may have suffered and died from a wasting disease . He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the <unk> BC . His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree by the people of Cos , depicting him as " frail with all the glosses " . His contemporary <unk> wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus , which " included nothing from the physique of heroes . No , ... he cast the old man full of cares . " The 3rd century AD Roman author Aelian skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in the soles of his shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind . A 2nd century AD Greek author , Athenaeus of <unk> , wrote that Philitas studied false arguments and erroneous word @-@ usage so intensely that he wasted away and starved to death , and that his epitaph read : 
 St. George Stock analyzed the story as saying Philitas studied the Megarian school of philosophy , which cultivated and studied paradoxes such as the liar paradox : if someone says " I am lying " , is what he says true or false ? Stock wrote that Philitas worried so much over the liar paradox that he died of insomnia , and translated the epitaph as follows : 
 A more literal translation suggests that the invented epitaph pokes fun at Philitas ' focus on using the right words : 
 = = Works = = 
 Philitas wrote a vocabulary explaining the meanings of rare literary words , words from local dialects , and technical terms ; it probably took the form of a lexicon . The vocabulary , called Disorderly Words ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , has been lost , with only a few fragments quoted by later authors . One example , quoted in Athenaeus , is that the word <unk> ( <unk> ) meant " wine cup " in the ancient Greek region of Boeotia ; this was evidently contrasted to the same word meaning " milk pail " in Homer 's Iliad . <unk> , another scholarly work , probably contained Philitas ' versions and critical interpretations of Homer and other authors . 
 About thirty fragments of Philitas ' poetry are known , along with four definite titles : 
 Demeter , Philitas ' most famous work , consisted of elegiac couplets , or couplets in the elegiac meter . Its few surviving fragments suggest that it narrated the grain goddess Demeter 's hunt for her daughter Persephone . The fragments describe Demeter 's arrival on Cos and warm welcome by its royal family of <unk> , or humans twice normal size , thus presenting the founding myth of a local cult of Demeter on Cos . 
 Hermes was an <unk> , or brief mythological narrative , written in hexameter . It had the structure of a hymn , with a central narrative telling of Odysseus ' visit to the island of the king Aeolus , keeper of the winds , and of Odysseus ' secret affair with the king 's daughter <unk> . It is also possible that Hermes was a collection of such stories , with the patronage of Hermes himself as the common thread . 
 Playthings ( <unk> , <unk> ) had two shorter collections . These poems had the structure of epigrams and their themes may have included erotica . The only surviving poem contains two elegiac couplets and has a puzzle or riddle structure characteristic of some ancient Greek drinking @-@ party songs . 
 Only one of the <unk> has been fully reconstructed . 
 Another possible poem is Telephus , which may have been a companion to Demeter . 
 At most fifty verses of Philitas survive . Below is an example fragment of two verses , which was quoted in the Collection of Paradoxical Stories , whose putative author Antigonus ( often identified with Antigonus of Carystus , a near @-@ contemporary ) does not specify which work they came from ; indirect evidence suggests Demeter . These two verses show the confluence of Philitas ' interests in poetry and obscure words : 
 According to Antigonus , the " cactus " ( κάκτος , <unk> ) was a thorny plant from Sicily , and " When a deer steps on it and is pricked , its bones remain soundless and unusable for flutes . For that reason Philitas spoke of it . " Antigonus quotes one more passage , and the 5th century AD anthologist Stobaeus quotes eleven passages from Philitas ; the remaining fragments are derived from ancient commentators who quoted Philitas when discussing rare words or names used by other authors . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Philitas was the most important intellectual figure in the early years of Hellenistic civilization . He gained instant recognition in both poetry and literary scholarship , and , as far as is known , was the first person called " poet as well as scholar " ( <unk> <unk> καὶ <unk> , <unk> [ h ] <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . As tutor to Philadelphus he is assumed to have had great influence on the development of the <unk> at Alexandria , a scholarly institution that included the famous Library of Alexandria . A statue was erected of him , possibly at a <unk> at Cos , and his work was explicitly acknowledged as a classic by both Theocritus and Callimachus . 
 His reputation for scholarship endured for at least a century . In Athens , the comic playwright Strato made jokes that assumed audiences knew about Philitas ' vocabulary , and the vocabulary was criticized more than a century later by the influential Homeric scholar Aristarchus of Samothrace in his Against Philitas ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) . The geographer Strabo described him three centuries later as " simultaneously a poet and a critic " . 
 Philitas was the first writer whose works represent the combination of qualities now regarded as Hellenistic : variety , scholarship , and use of Homeric sources in non @-@ epic works . He directly influenced the major Hellenistic poets Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes . His poetry was mentioned or briefly quoted by Callimachus and by other ancient authors , and his poetic reputation endured for at least three centuries , as Augustan poets identified his name with great elegiac writing . Propertius linked him to Callimachus with the following well @-@ known couplet : 
 The 1st @-@ century AD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas second only to Callimachus among the elegiac poets . Philitas ' influence has been found or suspected in a wide range of ancient writing ; <unk> ' 2nd century AD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him . Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries , though , so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd century BC read any but a few of his lines . 
 = Russian cruiser Pallada ( 1906 ) = 
 Pallada ( Russian : <unk> ) was the last of the four Bayan @-@ class armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . She was assigned to the Baltic Fleet during World War I where she captured codebooks from the German cruiser Magdeburg that had run aground during the first month of the war . The ship was torpedoed by a German submarine in October 1914 and exploded ; none of the crew survived . Pallada was the first warship lost by the Russians during the war . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Pallada was 449 @.@ 6 feet ( 137 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . She had a maximum beam of 57 @.@ 5 feet ( 17 @.@ 5 m ) , a draught of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) and displaced 7 @,@ 750 long tons ( 7 @,@ 870 t ) . The ship had a crew of 568 officers and men . Pallada was named in honour of the earlier Russian cruiser captured by the Japanese during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Both ships were named for the Greek goddess , Pallas Athena . 
 The ship had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines with a designed total of 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 304 kW ) , but they developed 19 @,@ 320 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 410 kW ) on sea trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 55 knots ( 41 @.@ 76 km / h ; 25 @.@ 95 mph ) . Steam for the engines was provided by 26 Belleville boilers . She could carry a maximum of 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 118 t ) of coal , although her range is unknown . 
 Pallada 's main armament consisted of two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ calibre guns in single turrets fore and aft . Her eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) gun were mounted in casemates on the sides of the ship 's hull . Anti @-@ torpedo boat defense was provided by 20 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) 50 @-@ calibre guns ; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure . The remaining guns were located above the six @-@ inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with gun shields . Pallada also mounted four 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship also had two submerged 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one mounted on each broadside . 
 The ship used Krupp armour throughout . Her waterline belt was 190 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) thick over her machinery spaces . Fore and aft , it reduced to 90 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) . The upper belt and the casemates were 60 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The armour deck was 50 millimetres ( 2 in ) thick ; over the central battery it was a single plate , but elsewhere it consisted of a 30 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) plate over two 10 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) plates . The gun turrets were protected by 132 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) of armour and the conning tower had walls 136 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) thick .

 Pallada was built by the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Construction began on 24 June 1905 , although she was not formally laid down until August , and the ship was launched on 10 November 1906 . Pallada was completed in February 1911 . She spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet . 
 On 26 August 1914 , during the first month of World War I , the German light cruiser Magdeburg ran aground near the island of Odensholm in the Gulf of Finland . Her escort , the destroyer V @-@ 26 , failed to pull her off and rescued part of the crew before Pallada and the protected cruiser Bogatyr appeared and opened fire . The Germans blew up the front part of the ship , but failed to demolish the rest of the ship . They failed to destroy their naval codebooks , which were discovered by the Russians . A copy was later given to the British where it proved enormously helpful in reading German wireless traffic . Together with the armoured cruiser Rurik , Pallada unsuccessfully searched for German ships between Bornholm and Danzig on the night of 27 August . Less than two months later , on 11 October , she was torpedoed by the German submarine U @-@ 26 and blew up with the loss of all hands , the first Russian warship sunk during the war .

 On 6 October 2012 the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported that the wreck of Pallada had been discovered by a diver group outside Hanko near the coast of Finland in 2000 , but the group had waited until 2012 before publishing their find . 
 The ship is lying in three pieces , all upside @-@ down , at a depth of about 40 to 50 metres ( 130 to 160 ft ) . Although the wreck was severely damaged during the sinking and is now covered in silt , a number of details such as a large wooden emblem of the Russian double @-@ headed eagle are still intact . One of the eight @-@ inch turrets is resting on the seafloor next to the bow section . 
 On 6 September 2013 , Helsingin Sanomat reported that the previously largely untouched wreck of Pallada had been looted . 
 = Edmund Ætheling = 
 Edmund Ætheling ( / <unk> <unk> / ; c . 1015 – 17 – possibly 1046 , certainly by 1054 ) was a member of the royal House of Wessex as the son of Edmund Ironside , who briefly ruled as King of England between April and November 1016 . He fought the Danish Vikings under Cnut the Great , but following the Danish victory at the Battle of <unk> in October , it was agreed that Ironside would rule Wessex , while Cnut took Mercia and probably Northumbria . In November 1016 , Ironside died and Cnut became King of all England . 
 Intent on keeping his succession secure , Cnut sent Ironside 's two infant sons , Edward and Edmund Ætheling , to his brother in Sweden , where they were to be murdered . Instead , the princes were spared and sent to safety to the Kingdom of Hungary , where they remained in the care of King Stephen I. After fleeing assassins hired by Cnut , the Æthelings arrived at the royal court of Kievan Rus ' in 1028 . The princes remained under the tutelage of Prince Yaroslav the Wise until adulthood . In 1046 , the Æthelings both traveled to Hungary and helped the exiled Andrew of Hungary in his quest for the throne . Edmund died shortly after marrying a Hungarian princess , before 1054 . 
 = = Birth = = 
 Edmund was born either in 1015 , 1016 or 1017 . Edmund 's mother was probably Ealdgyth , Edmund Ironside 's wife ; it is possible that she was only his stepmother , as the king 's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born . Although there is a possibility that Edmund was older than his brother , later known as Edward the Exile , it is also possible that they were twins . At the time , it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father 's name ; thus , Edmund could have been the younger , posthumous son . 
 = = Life in exile = = 
 With Edmund Ironside dead and Cnut marrying Emma of Normandy , both Edmund and Edward were deprived of their rights to succeed to the English throne . Nonetheless , both were titled " Ætheling " , an Old English word which designated royal princes who were eligible for kingship . As Edmund and Edward were the rightful heirs of England , Cnut decided to have them murdered . Considering it " a disgrace " for the Ætheling to be killed on English soil , Cnut sent them to his half @-@ brother , Olof Skötkonung , the reigning King of Sweden , where they were to be put to death . An old ally of the princes ' grandfather , Æthelred the Unready , Olof instead sent the Ætheling to the Hungarian royal court of King Stephen I , fearing they were unsafe in the north , where Cnut 's power was great . Although exiled , Edmund and Edward still instilled hope in the leaderless Anglo @-@ Saxons of Danish England . 
 After his baptism in 985 , Stephen I had become the first Christian ruler of Hungary . By the time of Edmund and Edward 's arrival at his court , Stephen was married to Gisela of Bavaria and had led a peaceful reign . The Hungarian court was " a happy home " for the exiled English princes . However , in 1028 , Edmund and Edward were forced to flee Hungary after Cnut sent powerful assassins to carry out the task of murdering the two Æthelings . The princes found refuge at the court of Yaroslav the Wise , Grand Prince of Kiev . 
 Edmund and Edward were recorded as being " somewhat grown , and had passed twelve years " when they arrived in Yaroslav 's capital , <unk> , another name for Kiev . A mid thirteenth @-@ century <unk> ( chronicle ) records nothing of Edmund and Edward 's stay at the Kievan court , although later Russian chronicles do mention their refuge . The Anglo @-@ Saxons were Roman Catholics and Edmund and Edward were reserved towards the Eastern Orthodox character of Kievan Christianity ; Yaroslav is likely to not have allowed the Æthelings to voice their dissatisfaction . The Æthelings ' presence at the Kievan court presented itself as " a very useful negotiating counter " for Yaroslav 's Western @-@ orientated foreign policy . 
 After King Harthacnut 's death , the English considered bringing Edmund and Edward back to England , but nothing came of it , as the princes were still in Kiev in late 1042 . By 1043 , Edmund , now in his late twenties , was being left out of Yaroslav 's continental schemes , while Edward was elevated " to a position of sole responsibility where England 's crown or dynastic alliances were concerned . " This was possibly due to Edmund having an affair with a noble lady , which had caused quite a scandal . Andrew of Hungary , a Hungarian prince who had also been exiled , had established himself at Yaroslav 's court in the 1030s . In 1046 , during the Vata pagan uprising in Hungary , Andrew returned to his homeland with the intention of gaining the throne ; Edmund and Edward are likely to have fought for Andrew 's army and it is possible that they were present at his coronation . 
 = = Marriage and death = = 
 Ailred of Rievaulx , a near @-@ contemporary chronicler , recorded Edmund 's marriage to the daughter of a Hungarian king , but omitted to mention the name of the king and the name of the daughter . This could not have been a daughter of King Stephen , although a sister of King Samuel Aba , as well as any other princess of the huge Árpád dynasty is a possible candidate . It is possible that Edmund 's wife was named Hedwig . Edmund died shortly after the marriage , possibly during the military campaign of Andrew of Hungary in 1046 ; he was certainly dead by 1054 , when only Edward was recalled to England by the princes ' uncle , King Edward the Confessor . The king wanted to appoint his nephew as his heir , however Edward died soon after his arrival in London . With the death of Edward 's son , Edgar the Ætheling ( who had been proclaimed king in 1066 but was forced to swear allegiance to William the Conqueror and renounce his rights ) , around 1126 , the male line of the House of Wessex died out . Edmund was buried in Hungary , however the exact location of his grave is unknown .

 Although his career as an artist was fleeting , Gibson 's career as a patron and lover of art was lifelong . In the 1950s and 1960s Gibson made major contributions to the arts in Australia , both as a collector and a patron of arts organisations . He acquired the works of some of Australia 's most highly regarded artists , such as Russell Drysdale , Albert Tucker and John Brack . Other artists well represented in his collection included Noel <unk> , John Passmore , Clifton Pugh and Clive Stephen . 
 As a collector , Gibson 's tastes were eclectic . At the same time as acquiring paintings by " the younger Australian painters " of his time , he was also collecting antique English silver . This led one writer to exclaim of his collection that " it must surely cover more ground than almost any other private one in this country " . Toward the end of his life the collection included over 560 items from artists of over 30 countries . His fascination with silver also led him to spend time during a visit to Europe in 1952 , learning from the British silversmith Robert Stone how silverware was made . This was an experience recounted in Gibson 's only book The <unk> , so named because of a commission Gibson sought of Stone . 
 The <unk> was an account of a trip around the world taken by Gibson and his wife in 1951 . It described his visits to cultural institutions and contained ruminations on cultural collections policy . Reflecting on the damage caused by World War II to cultural artifacts , art and architecture , he advocated a wide distribution of works of art around the world , to afford them greater protection . He was to have an opportunity to pursue these views in later roles with the National Gallery of Victoria . 
 The silver <unk> was one of a range of works commissioned by Gibson . Others included three portraits of himself : one by Manx artist Bryan Kneale , one by Australian artist Noel <unk> , and a sketch by Archibald Prize @-@ winning artist Louis Kahan , this last being in the University of Melbourne 's Clem <unk> collection . 
 = = Gibson and the arts in Australia = = 
 Gibson actively supported many Australian arts organisations . He was director of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust at its foundation in 1954 , as well as being its Victorian chairman from 1955 to 1967 , and president from 1968 to 1971 . The Trust was instrumental in the foundation of major Australian arts institutions including Opera Australia , orchestras in Sydney and Melbourne , and the National Institute of Dramatic Arts . 
 Gibson was variously trustee , treasurer and deputy chairman of the National Gallery of Victoria ( NGV ) in the period 1956 to 1964 . The NGV was Australia 's oldest public gallery , its acquisitions largely funded by the massive but dwindling Felton Bequest . Gibson was one of several new faces brought to the Gallery 's board at a critical time : the Victorian government had announced a decision to build a new National Gallery in Melbourne , and governance of the existing institution was undergoing significant upheaval . Gibson was reported to be " always a man of strong opinions " , bringing a robust and blunt character to some of the meetings of the Gallery 's trustees . The trustees were concerned that the substantial resources of the institution 's rich Felton Bequest were not being applied effectively to ensure the representation of contemporary schools of art in the Gallery 's collection . 
 Seeking to directly support the NGV , Gibson financed the purchase of works by and for the Gallery , as well as making his personal collection available for exhibition . He provided a donation in 1962 allowing the NGV to purchase the Clement Meadmore sculpture <unk> III . Gibson purchased Tom Roberts ' major painting Coming South , for $ 20000 , presenting it to the NGV in 1967 . A selection from Gibson 's extensive personal collection was presented as an NGV exhibition in 1969 . 
 Gibson played many other roles in the arts , through societies of artists , of collectors , and through boards of which he was a member as a result of his involvement with the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust . These included Deputy Chairman of the Melbourne Theatre Company from 1960 to 1968 . 
 He was a foundation member of the National Trust of Australia ( Victoria ) in 1955 , and co @-@ founded the Society of Collectors of Fine Arts . 
 = Leningrad première of Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 7 = 
 The Leningrad première of Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 7 occurred on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War , while the city of Leningrad ( now St. Petersburg ) was under siege by Nazi German forces . 
 Dmitri Shostakovich had intended for the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra , but because of the siege that group was evacuated from the city , as was the composer himself . The world première of the symphony was held in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra . The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra , supplemented with military performers . Most of the musicians were starving , which made rehearsing difficult : musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals , and three died . The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert . 
 Despite the poor condition of the performers and many of the audience members , the concert was highly successful , prompting an hour @-@ long ovation . The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive , code @-@ named Squall , intended to silence German forces during the performance . The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare . The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects . The conductor concluded that " in that moment , we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine " . Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event . 
 = = Background = = 
 Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 – 75 ) completed his Symphony No. 7 on 27 December 1941 and dedicated it to his native Leningrad . At the time Leningrad was under a 900 @-@ day siege by Nazi German forces , which would kill about a third of the city 's pre @-@ war population . 
 Shostakovich wanted the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra to première the symphony , but that group had been evacuated to Novosibirsk as part of the government @-@ led cultural exodus . Instead , the world première was held in Kuybyshev on 5 March 1942 , performed by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra under conductor Samuil <unk> . The Moscow première was given by a combination of the Bolshoi and the All @-@ Union Radio orchestras on 29 March in the <unk> Hall of the House of Unions . 
 The microfilmed score of the symphony was flown to Tehran in April to allow its promulgation to the West . It received its radio première in Western Europe on 22 June , in a performance broadcast by Henry Wood and the London Philharmonic Orchestra , and its concert première at a Promenade concert at London 's Royal Albert Hall on 29 June . The North American première was broadcast from New York City on 19 July 1942 by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 The Leningrad Radio Orchestra under Karl Eliasberg was the only remaining symphonic ensemble in Leningrad after the Philharmonic was evacuated . The Radio Orchestra 's last performance had taken place on 14 December 1941 and its final broadcast on 1 January 1942 . A log note from the next scheduled rehearsal reads " Rehearsal did not take place . <unk> is dead . Petrov is sick . <unk> is dead . Orchestra not working " . 
 On 2 April 1942 , Boris <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the Leningrad city arts department announced preparations for the symphony 's performance . The hiatus in musical broadcasts was quickly ended by Andrei Zhdanov , a Soviet politician involved in the defence of Leningrad , to allow for rehearsals and provide a morale boost for the city . Performing the symphony " became a matter of civic , even military , pride " . According to an orchestra member , " the Leningrad authorities wanted to give the people some emotional stimulation so that they could feel cared for " . It was considered an important political act because of its potential value as propaganda . 
 Of the original 40 @-@ member Leningrad Radio Orchestra , only 14 or 15 still lived in the city ; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy . Shostakovich 's symphony required an expanded orchestra of 100 players , meaning the remaining personnel were grossly insufficient . Eliasberg , at the time being treated for " dystrophy " , went door to door to seek out those musicians who had not responded to the orchestra 's reassembly due to starvation or weakness . " My God , how thin many of them were , " one of the organizers remembered . " How those people livened up when we started to ferret them out of their dark apartments . We were moved to tears when they brought out their concert clothes , their violins and cellos and flutes , and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio . " A plane carrying supplies from Kuybyshev airlifted the symphony 's 252 @-@ page conductor 's score into Leningrad . 
 The first rehearsal in March 1942 was intended to be three hours long , but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments . They frequently collapsed during rehearsals , especially those playing brass instruments . Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge , and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport . His first attempts at conducting were like a " wounded bird with wings that are going to drop at any moment " . A report by <unk> noted that " the first violin is dying , the drum died on his way to work , the French horn is at death 's door ... " . Orchestral players were given additional rations ( donated by civilian music enthusiasts ) in an effort to combat starvation , and hot bricks were used to radiate heat ; nevertheless , three performers died during rehearsals . Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra . Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands with the support of the Soviet commander of the Leningrad front , Leonid Govorov . 
 In addition to the Seventh Symphony , the makeshift orchestra also rehearsed traditional symphonic works by Beethoven , Tchaikovsky and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . A concert of Tchaikovsky excerpts was held on 5 April . Some players protested the decision to perform Shostakovich 's symphony , not wanting to expend their little strength on an " intricate and not very accessible " work . Eliasberg threatened to rescind the additional rations , quelling any dissent . During the rehearsals , Eliasberg was criticized for his harsh demeanour : musicians who missed rehearsals , were late , or did not perform to expectations lost their rations . One performer lost rations because he had attended his wife 's burial and was late for rehearsal . Although some sources suggest a team of copyists was employed , according to other sources musicians were made to copy out their individual parts by hand from the score . 
 Rehearsals were held six days a week at the Pushkin Theatre , usually from 10 am to 1 pm . However , they were frequently interrupted by air @-@ raid sirens , and some musicians were required to undertake anti @-@ aircraft or firefighting duties . To enable them to attend rehearsals , performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints . Members of the military orchestra ( and some ordinary troops ) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers . Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June , and in late July were increased to 5 – 6 hours a day . Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available ; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair , as the starving repairman had already eaten several . 
 The orchestra played the entire symphony all the way through only once before the première , at a dress rehearsal on 6 August . 
 = = Performance = = 
 The concert was given in the Grand Philharmonia Hall on 9 August 1942 . This was the day Hitler had previously designated to celebrate the fall of the city with a lavish banquet at Leningrad 's Astoria Hotel . The performance was preceded by a pre @-@ recorded radio address by Eliasberg , aired at 6 pm : 
 Comrades – a great occurrence in the cultural history of our city is about to take place . In a few minutes , you will hear for the first time the Seventh Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich , our outstanding fellow citizen . He wrote this great composition in the city during the days when the enemy was , insanely , trying to enter Leningrad . When the fascist swine were bombing and shelling all Europe , and Europe believed the days of Leningrad were over . But this performance is witness to our spirit , courage and readiness to fight . Listen , Comrades ! 
 Lieutenant @-@ General Govorov ordered a bombardment of German artillery positions in advance of the concert in a special operation , code @-@ named " Squall " . Soviet intelligence personnel had located the German batteries and observation posts a few weeks before , in preparation for the attack . Three thousand high @-@ caliber shells were lobbed onto the enemy . The purpose of the operation was to prevent the Germans from targeting the concert hall and to ensure that it would be quiet enough to hear the music over speakers he ordered to be set up . He also encouraged Soviet soldiers to listen to the concert via radio . Musicologist Andrei <unk> later praised Govorov 's actions as providing the " incentive " for the concert , adding that his choice to allow soldiers to participate was " a quite exceptional decision " . Govorov himself later remarked to Eliasberg that " we played our instrument in the symphony , too , you know , " in reference to the artillery fire . The military contribution to the affair was not widely known until well after the war ended . 
 There was a large audience for the concert , comprising party leaders , military personnel , and civilians . Leningrad citizens who could not fit into the hall gathered around open windows and loudspeakers . The musicians onstage were " dressed like cabbages " in multiple layers to prevent starvation @-@ induced shivering . Shortly before the concert started , the electric lights above the stage were turned on for the first time since rehearsals had commenced . As the hall fell silent , Eliasberg began conducting . The performance was of poor artistic quality , but was notable for the emotions raised in the audience and for its finale : when some musicians " faltered " due to exhaustion , the audience stood up " in a remarkable , spontaneous gesture ... willing them to keep going " . 
 The performance received an hour @-@ long standing ovation , with Eliasberg being given a symbolic bouquet of Leningrad @-@ grown flowers by a young girl . Many in the audience were in tears due to the emotional impact of the concert , which was seen as a " musical biography of suffering Leningrad " . The musicians were invited to a banquet with Party officials to celebrate . 
 Loudspeakers broadcast the performance throughout the city as well as to the German forces in a move of psychological warfare , a " tactical strike against German morale " . One German soldier recalled how his squadron " listened to the symphony of heroes " . Eliasberg later met with some of the Germans who camped outside Leningrad during the performance , who told him that it had made them believe they would never capture the city : " Who are we bombing ? We will never be able to take Leningrad because the people here are selfless " .

 Shostakovich scholar Laurel Fay suggests that this concert was " an event of legendary import all by itself " . Journalist Michael <unk> calls it " a legendary moment in Soviet political and military history " . Critic U.S. <unk> suggests that this performance " was popularly – and , of course , officially – recognized as the prelude to actual victory over the Germans " . The blockade was breached in early 1943 and ended in 1944 . Eliasberg concurred with <unk> 's assessment , saying that " the whole city had found its humanity ... in that moment , we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine " . There was no official recognition of the significance of the concert : one musician noted that afterwards " there was no feedback , nothing until 1945 " . 
 Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 7 enjoyed a measure of popularity throughout the Western world during the war , but from 1945 it largely stopped being performed outside the Soviet Union . It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov 's Testimony suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis , but of the Soviet government . The veracity of Volkov 's account , which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich , has been debated . Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it was inspired by the attack on Leningrad ( as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted ) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda , as well as its artistic merit in reference to Shostakovich 's other works . 
 The première made Eliasberg a " hero of the city " . Shortly after the concert , he married Nina <unk> , who had played the piano part . But once the siege ended and the Philharmonic returned to Leningrad , he fell from favour . The conductor of the Philharmonic , Yevgeny Mravinsky , had him fired in 1950 because he envied Eliasberg 's popular acclaim . Eliasberg was a " poor and largely forgotten " travelling conductor when he died in 1978 . However , at the fifty @-@ year anniversary of the première his remains were moved to the prestigious <unk> or Alexander Nevsky Cemetery , the result of a campaign by orchestra archivist Galina <unk> , conductor Yuri <unk> , and St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak . Sarah Quigley fictionalized Eliasberg 's wartime career in her historical novel The Conductor . 
 Surviving performers participated in reunion concerts in 1964 and 1992 , playing " from the same seats in the same hall " . Shostakovich attended the first reunion concert on 27 January 1964 . Twenty @-@ two musicians and Eliasberg performed the symphony , and instruments were placed on the other chairs to represent those participants who had died since the première . The 1992 performance featured the 14 remaining survivors . The 1942 concert was also commemorated in the 1997 film The War Symphonies : Shostakovich Against Stalin . There is a small museum dedicated to the event at School No. 235 in St. Petersburg , which includes a statue of Shostakovich and artifacts from the performance .

 " 30 Minutes After Noon " is the seventh episode of the 1960s Supermarionation television series Thunderbirds . Written by Alan Fennell and directed by David Elliott , it first aired in the United Kingdom on ATV Midlands on 11 November 1965 . In a plot incorporating visual allusions to 1960s spy thriller films , in particular the James Bond film franchise , " 30 Minutes After Noon " sees the Tracy family attempt to rescue a British secret agent embroiled in the latest scheme of the Erdman Gang , a powerful crime syndicate . 
 Drawing inspiration from the 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File , a recent release at the time of shooting , Elliott decided to bring Fennell 's script to life with the use of " quirky visuals " . As such , Elliott and his camera operator , Alan Perry , experimented with original angles and techniques , electing to introduce one scene with a long tracking shot and filming the characters using a mixture of live @-@ action close @-@ up shots and forced perspective . The music , on the other hand , is recycled from earlier Thunderbirds episodes . 
 Commentators such as media historian Nicholas J. Cull have praised Elliott and Perry 's cinematographic innovations for imitating the visual style of older espionage films . However , Stephen La Rivière , writer of Filmed in Supermarionation : A History of the Future , argues that the pastiche is not evident throughout : asserting that the switch in narrative focus from the Hudson Building fire to the infiltration of the Erdman Gang essentially divides the episode into loosely connected halves , La Rivière suggests that the visual style of the first owes more to conventional filming techniques . " 30 Minutes After Noon " was adapted for audio in the 1960s and serialised as a comic strip in the 1990s .

 In Spoke City , Thomas Prescott accepts an apparently innocent hitch @-@ hiker into his car . The stranger 's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott 's wrist , warning him that it contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes ; the key to unlock it will be found in his office at the Hudson Building . Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit , Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet . The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift : the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated , and Prescott is plunged to the bottom of the lift shaft , ten storeys underground . 
 Although the fire is quickly brought under control , Prescott is completely cut off . News of the events in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island . Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1 , while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned fire @-@ fighting apparatus . <unk> into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers , Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level , whereupon Prescott is arrested . Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations , including the Erdman Gang , has been destroyed in the fire . Prescott 's claims about the hitch @-@ hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered . 
 An operation to expose the Erdman Gang leads to the recruitment of Southern , a British Secret Service agent , who is assigned to infiltrate the organisation and leak intelligence on its latest scheme . The gang leader contacts the undercover Southern and Erdman operatives Dempsey and Kenyon at Glen Carrick Castle in the Scottish Highlands , and briefs them on their mission . The trio are to drive to the Nuclear Plutonium Store , where isotopes for all Britain 's power stations are housed , and plant explosives to detonate at 12 : 30 p.m. ; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England . To ensure compliance , the charges , which have already been armed , are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott 's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store . 
 On their arrival , Southern , Dempsey and Kenyon use a ray gun to neutralise the store 's robot guards and bypass the security doors one after the other , ultimately arriving in the plutonium vault . Southern reveals his true identity and holds the others at gunpoint , commanding them to proceed to the Leader 's proposed rendezvous point and capture him . The tables are turned , however , when a robot traps Southern in a crushing grip . Dempsey and Kenyon unlock the bracelets and make a getaway , jamming the security doors and leaving Southern to die in the nuclear explosion . 
 Southern 's emergency call is transferred from his superior , Sir William Frazer , to International Rescue . Landing outside the Plutonium Store in Thunderbirds 1 and 2 , Scott and Virgil use the Laser Cutter Vehicle to burn through the doors . Inside the vault , Virgil releases Southern from the robot . As the time nears 30 minutes past noon , Scott , in possession of the three bracelets , takes off in Thunderbird 1 ; he jettisons them over the sea , where they explode harmlessly . On Jeff 's orders , Lady Penelope and Parker intercept the Erdman Gang at their rendezvous and use FAB 1 's cannon to shoot down the leader , Dempsey and Kenyon before they can escape in a <unk> . Southern recovers from his ordeal at the Creighton @-@ Ward Mansion .

 Initially unenthusiastic about his task of realising Alan Fennell 's script , director David Elliott developed his inspiration after seeing the 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File , starring Michael Caine . He remembers that the film " used all the old @-@ fashioned shots – looking through a lampshade , etc . On Monday morning , Paddy [ Seale , lighting camera operator ] came in and said , ' I saw a film this weekend , ' and I said , ' So did I. ' ' Was it The Ipcress File ? ' ' Yep . Right , that 's what I want to do . ' " In homage to The Ipcress File , Elliott decided to incorporate " quirky visuals " into his direction of the Thunderbirds episode . 
 Elliott decided to open the Glen Carrick Castle sequence with a tracking shot covering all three walls of the puppet set , coordinating the necessary camera manoeuvres with camera operator Alan Perry . In a pioneering move for a Supermarionation production , forced perspective is used during this scene to present a live human hand and scale puppet characters within the same frame . While the hand , intended to belong to Southern , <unk> a pen in the foreground of the shot , the puppets of Kenyon and Dempsey are positioned across a table in the background . Although the puppets of Thunderbirds were sculpted in 1 ⁄ 3 human size , a visual illusion ensures that Kenyon and Dempsey appear to be accurately scaled in proportion to the hand . 
 Incidental music for " 30 Minutes After Noon " was , for the most part , recycled from previous Anderson productions . The television belonging to Hudson Building janitor Sam Saltzman issues the " March of the Oysters " track from the Stingray episode " Secret of the Giant Oyster " . The Highland theme from " Loch Ness Monster " accompanies the scenes set in Glen Carrick Castle ; the castle model is itself a re @-@ use of Castle McGregor , which appeared in the same Stingray episode . Its last appearance in the Supermarionation productions was as Glen Garry Castle in the Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episode " The Trap " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " 30 Minutes After Noon " achieved viewing figures of 5 @.@ 2 million when it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992 . According to Nathalie Olah of The Independent , the nature of the episode 's plot demonstrates the " sense of drama " that made Thunderbirds popular : " Sure , most kids didn 't understand the workings of a plutonium bomb , but the fact that the show was capable of sustaining their attention , as well as that of their older siblings and parents , meant they had some idea by the end of said episode . " Thunderbirds co @-@ creator Sylvia Anderson praises scriptwriter Alan Fennell 's " vivid imagination " and his complex script , while also opining that " 30 Minutes After Noon " was " more a vehicle for live action than for the limited emotions of our puppet cast . " 
 Media historian Nicholas J. Cull links the episode to one of Fennell 's other Thunderbirds scripts , " The Man from MI.5 " , in which the main guest character is a British Secret Service agent called <unk> . For Cull , " 30 Minutes After Noon " is one of several Thunderbirds episodes that incorporates visual homage to the James Bond films . In particular , he comments on Southern 's briefing scene , in which the characters of Southern , Sir William Frazer and an unnamed aide are substituted by hats on a stand : " Southern 's hat is a trilby , tossed onto the stand in best James Bond fashion . " Tom Fox , in a review for Starburst magazine , draws a similar conclusion with regard to the scene ; he picks out the robot guards and the " spooky " , " nefarious " and " palatial " hideout of the Scottish castle as the episode 's other highlights . He gives " 30 Minutes After Noon " a rating of four out of five stars . 
 Commenting on David Elliott 's resolution to diversify the range of camera angles , Stephen La Rivière , author of Filmed in Supermarionation : A History of the Future , expresses disappointment that the first half of " 30 Minutes After Noon " presents standard camera work : he judges these scenes to be " filmed as normal " , and suggests that they compare negatively to the " quirky visuals " of the latter half . La Rivière also discusses the episode 's editing , noting that " 30 Minutes After Noon " is split into two distinct storylines ( with the exploits of Southern and the British Secret Service only coming after the devastation of the Hudson Building ) . He argues that , in this respect , the episode is similar to its antecedents , whose running time was unexpectedly doubled from 25 to 50 minutes and which therefore had to be extended with character @-@ based subplots , secondary rescues and other filler scenes . 
 In a review published in <unk> News Flash , " 30 Minutes After Noon " is described as a " thrilling , well @-@ paced episode " , which " brings together a very sadistic bad guy scheme and some innocent , and some not @-@ so @-@ innocent victims in peril , all providing plenty of action for International Rescue . " The reviewer commends the pacing as being " especially good " , and also credits the " inventive camera work " , commenting , " I don 't think I 've seen more use of ' real hand acting ' in any other episode . " The concept of exploding bracelet bombs is connected to the premise of the Saw horror films , in which victims are seen to be trapped in dangerous situations and are threatened with death if they do not carry out tasks that are put before them .

 Muramasa : The Demon Blade , known in Japan as Oboro Muramasa ( Japanese : <unk> , lit . " Hazy Muramasa " ) , is an action role @-@ playing game developed by Vanillaware for the Wii home console , and later the PlayStation Vita handheld console . The original game was published in 2009 by Marvelous Entertainment ( Japan ) , Ignition Entertainment ( North America ) , and Rising Star Games ( Europe ) . The Vita version was published in 2013 by Marvelous AQL in Japan and Aksys Games in Western territories . Using a 2D side @-@ scrolling perspective , the gameplay revolves around a beat em up fighting system , while incorporating RPG elements such as leveling and questing . 
 Muramasa takes place during the Edo period on Japan 's main island of Honshu . Due to ruling shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi 's thirst for power , conflicts have arisen over ownership of the Demon Blades , samurai swords that force their wielders to kill others before bringing tragedy and madness upon them . The story revolves around two different protagonists related to this conflict — Momohime , a woman who is possessed by the spirit of vengeful rōnin Jinkuro Izuna ; and Kisuke , an amnesiac ninja on the run for a forgotten crime who is tied up with the tragedy that destroyed Momohime 's family . The Vita port includes four self @-@ contained stories based on Japanese folklore released under the banner title Genroku Legends ( <unk> , Genroku <unk> ) . 
 The concept work for Muramasa began during the middle of development on Odin Sphere . Along with improving on the action gameplay over Odin Sphere , a great deal of effort was put into making the game 's setting authentic to the period . When the game released in the West , it retained its Japanese <unk> to preserve its atmosphere . It released to moderate sales and mixed to positive reviews : the graphics were universally praised , the gameplay divided opinion and the story received a mixed response . The Vita port , released in the West as Muramasa Rebirth , released to strong sales and similar reception to its original version . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Muramasa is a two @-@ dimensional ( 2D ) side @-@ scrolling action role @-@ playing game set on the main Japanese island of Honshu during the Edo period . Players take control of two characters with similar gameplay abilities . Navigation takes place through hand @-@ drawn 2D side @-@ scrolling environments reminiscent of Japanese artwork of the period , and can enter towns to talk with non @-@ playable characters ( NPCs ) and buy items such as health restoratives and accept quests . An additional cooking element allows the characters to cook meals using materials gathered during exploration : meals grant temporary character boosts , and fill a " fullness " meter that limits how much food a character can eat . 
 Combat comes in the form of both avoidable random encounters and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area : enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology . Battles are triggered only when enemies are near , with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed . In combat , characters attack and guard using a single @-@ button prompt , while another button accesses items such as healing potions . Continuously attacking triggers combos . Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons , which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash . Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game . At the end of each battle , experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished : leveling up increases a character 's health , stats , and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies . 
 Weapons are distinguished into two categories , Blade ( katana ) and Long Blade ( <unk> ) : Blades are fast , while Long Blades are slower and deal higher damage . Three blades can be equipped at any one time : each blade has its own stats , determining the amount of damage that can be inflicted . When blocking or using a blade 's Secret Art special move , its Soul Power gauge depletes : if emptied , the sword breaks and its offensive abilities are drastically reduced . When sheathed , the Soul Power regenerates . Soul Power can be gathered in various locations to restore Soul Power and the character 's health . There are 108 blades that can be collected and forged in @-@ game : forging blades requires Soul Power and " spirit " , and each blade has a level cap determining when it can be forged . Weapon forging is governed by a weapon @-@ based skill tree .

 Muramasa takes place on Honshu , the main island of the Japanese archipelago , with its overall style and setting drawing heavily upon Japanese folklore and mythology . It is set in the Genroku period , itself within the larger Edo period , during the reign of the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi . Tsunayoshi 's thirst for power has created conflict around ownership of the Demon Blades , samurai swords forged by the legendary swordsmith Muramasa <unk> that crave blood when drawn and bring madness and death to those foolish enough to draw them . Due to the chaos generated by this , the Demon Blades ' powers begin summoning demons from Yomi , along with causing ancient gods to stir from long slumber . 
 The two lead characters are Momohime ( <unk> ) , a princess of the Narukami clan from the locality of Mino ; and Kisuke ( <unk> ) , a runaway ninja with no memories but a burning desire for vengeance . For the course of the game , Momohime is inadvertently possessed by the spirit of Jinkuro Izuna ( <unk> <unk> ) , an unscrupulous rōnin who was trying to possess the body of Momohime 's betrothed Yukinojo <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , a high @-@ status samurai .

 Momohime 's Story 
 Momohime 's story begins after she wakes up Kyo with memories of being killed by the dying Jinkuro when he was aiming for her betrothed , the samurai lord Yukinojo . Upon encountering the spirit of Jinkuro , he forcefully possesses her , but before the process of soul transference is finished , they are attacked . In the confusion , Momohime 's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk <unk> and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime 's body will die if her soul is harmed . With her soul safe , Jinkuro sets out to regain the Dark Resurrection Demon Blade so he can properly utilize his Soul Transference Technique and gain influence through a new host . Encountering Yukinojo , who is searching for Momohime , the two battle . Momohime forces Jinkuro to spare Yukinojo , even when she learns that Yukinojo 's intentions in marrying her were part of a scheme to ruin her family as punishment for defying the shogun . Jinkuro goes to Yukinojo 's compound to retrieve the Dark Resurrection , but the storehouse where it is said to be is absorbed into Yomi by demons . Descending into Yomi , Jinkuro 's soul is briefly captured by a demon , and it is only with Momohime 's help that he escapes and learns that the Dark Resurrection was never in the storehouse . With Momohime 's body beginning to fail due to the strain Soul Transference put on it , Jinkuro attempts to ascent to Heaven so he can become an immortal demon , but is stopped by Raijin and Fujin . 
 While willing to accept his death and allow Momohime her remaining time in her body , Kongiku shows them another way to Heaven . There , Yukinojo appears and reveals that he had the Dark Resurrection all along . They are then attacked by Fudo @-@ <unk> , who is there to deliver divine justice upon Jinkuro . In the first ending , Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives ; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro 's soul through prayer . In the second ending , Momohime and Jinkuro are intercepted by Kisuke and Yuzuruha , resulting in Kongiku being robbed of her human form as punishment for her defiance . Though defeated , Kisuke delivers a fatal wound to Momohime , forcing Jinkuro to merge his soul with Momohime 's to save her : this act leaves her an amnesiac but grants her Jinkuro 's sword fighting abilities , which become legendary as she travels Japan in search of her missing memories . In the third ending , after the battle with Fudo @-@ <unk> Jinkuro is transported to the night he first attacked Yukinojo and Momohime with the power of the Oboro Muramasa Demon Blade , which can defy the passage of fate . He chooses not to attack them , then later possesses Yukinojo 's body and uses that position to ensure Momohime 's safety and her family 's security . Momohime herself lives to be one hundred years old and bears three children , while Kongiku remains close to Jinkuro in the guise of a servant . 
 Kisuke 's Story 
 Kisuke 's story begins with him suffering amnesia and on the run from his former ninja comrades . Returning to Edo to discover the truth in the company of Yuzuruha , he accidentally breaks an ancient seal keeping damned souls at bay . Defeating the monsters they manifest as , he learns from his mollified ninja companions and their employer Yukinojo that he was part of a mission to steal the Kuzuryu Demon Blade from Momohime 's <unk> Clan and punish them for defying the shogun 's order to surrender it , which in turn was tied in with Yukinojo 's intentions in marrying Momohime . Yukinojo sends Kisuke against Torahime , Momohime 's sister and the shrine maiden in charge of keeping the Kuzuryu 's power in check . Pursuing her , Kisuke fights both Torahime and undead soldiers loyal to her family . In pursuit of her , he faces agents who are preserving the flow of magic energy to Mount Fuji , including a young <unk> . His battles awaken his memories : he was originally disguised as a servant in Torahime 's household as part of Yukinojo 's scheme to destroy her family , but fell in love with Torahime and attempted to betray his ninja comrades when stealing the Kuzuryu . Dying from his wounds , the spirit of Senju <unk> , the creator of the Oboro Style that controls the Demon Blades , fused with Kisuke to save his life and pass on the Oboro Style to someone who would use it for good . The fusion triggered Kisuke 's amnesia , but left him with the ability to wield Demon Blades without succumbing to their evil . 
 Rescuing Torahime from the spider demon Tsuchigumo , Kisuke learns that she died while fleeing from the shogun 's forces , and that her present life is a temporary gift from Amitābha . The two travel to Mount Fuji , where its native dragon god has gone berserk with rage after Japan 's ley line energy is diverted to Edo , forcing a route into Heaven . The true culprit is the dark deity imprisoned in the Kuzuryu , the mad god <unk> . Upon being confronted , the possessed Shogun Tsunayoshi fatally wounds Torahime , who dies in Kisuke 's arms : Kisuke then defeats Tsunayoshi and takes possession of the Kuzuryu . In the first ending , after the battle , Kisuke asks Amitābha to return the now @-@ enlightened Torahime to life , then commits suicide as an act of defiance when his demand is refused . Torahime asks for her and Kisuke to be reincarnated so she can help him attain enlightenment . In the second ending , Kisuke arrives to find Tsunayoshi killed by the Jinkuro @-@ possessed Momohime . Kisuke exorcises Jinkuro , and following Torahime 's final request becomes Momohime 's servant . The two then set out on a personal quest to locate all the Demon Blades causing conflict in Japan . In the third ending , after his battle , Kisuke is sent back in time to the day he first betrayed his employers through the Oboro Muramasa 's power . His warning allows Torahime to foil the plot against her family , then <unk> steals the Kuzuryu and sets off on a journey round the world to exhaust its power by striking down evil , promising to marry Torahime upon his return .

Arashimaru kills So Xian and escapes his lair with Shiranui 's aid , then goes peacefully to his death after asking the saddened Shirohebi to give his head and Spear of Bishamon to his brother <unk> so he can restore the Okabe house . Arashimaru 's head is given proper burial at the Shirohebi 's insistence , and Arashimaru 's spirit is deified due to the grave becoming a prayer site for pilgrims .

The Genroku Legends conclude with the narrator detailing the locations of the Seven Gods ' treasures scattered through the stories , and thanking the player for locating them and calming Enma so his demons could return to Hell . 
 = = Development = = 
 Muramasa was developed by Vanillaware , a studio created by former Atlus staff members to create successor projects to the 2D action @-@ adventure game Princess Crown . According to sound producer Hitoshi Sakimoto , the game 's director George Kamitani was laying out plans for Muramasa when Odin Sphere was in the middle of development . According to Kamitani , while Odin Sphere was an evolution of Princess Crown 's narrative , Muramasa provided the chance of evolving its gameplay . He even went so far as to dub it " Princess Crown III " . The draft proposal was completed by the end of 2006 . The positive sales of Odin Sphere gave Vanillaware the capital needed to begin full development on Muramasa . The team 's style of development was identical to their strategy for Odin Sphere , although they worked to change up some aspects to make it a unique experience . When developing the game , the team decided to create a vertical plain for players to explore , something which the team had needed to forego with Odin Sphere . In addition , bathing sequences cut from Odin Sphere were reworked and incorporated into Muramasa as hot spring scenes . 
 The Wii was chosen as the game 's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2 , the console for which Odin Sphere was developed . This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware . Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , but went undeveloped development due to development costs . Using the Wii 's motion controls was tested by the team , but due to the game 's old @-@ fashioned style there was little need to implement them . The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics , especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game 's scenery to interact and respond properly . They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum , which was made possible due to the Wii 's area pre @-@ loading abilities . Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development . The team was highly dedicated to the success of the project , putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players . 
 In creating the game 's atmosphere , which was based on Japan as it was in the Edo era combined with local folklore and mythology , the team wanted to create an air of realism within its fantasy world . In keeping with their wish for realism , Momohime and Kisuke were given distinct accents ( Momohime used a cultured dialect while Kisuke spoke with an Edogawa accent ) . Another realistic element was the game 's food , which was designed based on the types of delicacies that were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries . One of the folklore references was the 108 Demon Blades in the game , which was a direct reference to the 108 human vices in Japanese folklore . A number of monsters and deities from Japanese mythology made appearances in the game , and the art style was intended to give a " Japanese " feel without consciously copying artwork from the game 's period . The artwork was created at double its in @-@ game resolution , then reduced to fit within the hardware . Several potential playable characters and storylines , such as narratives following Jinkuro and Torahime , had to be cut from the game . Elements of the cut storylines were incorporated into Kisuke and Momohime 's stories . The game 's setting was a heavy departure from Vanillaware 's previous games , which had used Western @-@ inspired settings and stories . The game 's overall theme was " death " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music was handled by a team from sound company Basiscape , composed of multiple composers who had worked on Odin Sphere . Sakimoto acted as sound producer , the sound director was Masaaki Kaneko , and the music was composed by Sakimoto , Yoshimi Kudo , Noriyuki <unk> , Mitsuhiro Kaneda , Kimihiro Abe , Azusa Chiba and Masaharu Iwata . Sakimoto was working on music for Odin Sphere when the project was first proposed , and thought Kamitani was being overambitious working on a premise based in Japan when developing a game based on European mythology . During the initial planning stage , Sakimoto thought the game would be a " mock @-@ Japanese " project , with Japanese instruments inserted into techno music . Once he realized how sincere Kamitani was with the project , Sakimoto and the team needed to re @-@ identify with the roots of traditional Japanese music . For Sakimoto , his approach was to reconnect with how earlier Japanese people turned their wabi @-@ sabi philosophy and worldview into words and music : he carried over this approach into the project . Each of the composers had to go through similar experiences .

 Muramasa was first announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show ( TGS ) under the title Oboro Muramasa <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " The Hazy Legend of Muramasa 's Mystical Sword " ) , alongside its intended platform , setting and gameplay mechanics . After its announcement , information releases about the game virtually stopped , and an April 2008 report by Famitsu reported the game 's development was " struggling " , although no details were revealed . Muramasa was reintroduced at TGS 2008 under its current Japanese title , along with its planned release window in 2009 and details on its characters and story . The game released in Japan on April 9 , 2009 . It was later released as part of Nintendo Channel 's budget game line @-@ up in January 2010 , and re @-@ released on the Virtual Console for Wii U in July 2015 . 
 It was announced for a release in North America under the title Muramasa : The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year . The game was originally being published by Xseed Games , but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule . Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment . Ignition Entertainment later explained that it was in hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights , and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights . The change between publishers was an internal agreement between Xseed , their parent company Marvelous USA , and Ignition . The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up , and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity . The game released in North America on September 8 , 2009 . The game 's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment . Due to the game 's strong Japanese atmosphere , it was seen as a hard sell in the West , but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes . Due to this , the game was not dubbed into English , but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized . An aspect Ignition worked hard with was to make sure the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners . This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the " lackluster " localization of Lux @-@ Pain , which had been beyond their control during development . 
 The game was published in Europe by Rising Star Games alongside other Marvelous products including Valhalla Knights : Eldar Saga and Arc Rise Fantasia . The English translation was carried over from the North American version , although the English language version underwent regional adjustment , and some minor faults were corrected . The game was also translated into French , Italian , German and Spanish , which made using the original translation more practical than creating a new one . Originally scheduled for November 2009 , it was first shifted into 2010 , then moved back into 2009 . The game released in Europe on November 6 of that year . Upon release in the United Kingdom , most retailers did not stock it : this was put down to a general attitude that it would not sell like prevalent franchises or games from mainstream genres . The game released in Australia on December 3 , 2009 . 
 = = = Muramasa Rebirth = = = 
 Muramasa Rebirth , released in Japan under its original title of Oboro Muramasa , is a port of Muramasa developed by Vanillaware for the PlayStation Vita . According to its development team , the Vita was chosen as the port 's platform over the more commercially successful Xbox 360 and PS3 due to the Vita 's OLED @-@ based screen , which they felt better portray the game 's palette . While content was cut from the original version , the team decided against going back and restoring it , instead creating new additional content . The controls were also adjusted to suit the new platform . Muramasa Rebirth was published in Japan by Marvelous AQL on March 28 , 2013 . The game 's Western release was handled by Aksys Games , which also created a new localization . Compared to the original version , which was described as a direct translation , Aksys Games ' version was more " flavorful " and more faithful to the original text . It released in North America on June 25 . It was released in Europe and Australia through PlayStation Network on October 16 . 
 In addition to the main game , four self @-@ contained stories were released as downloadable content ( DLC ) under the title Genroku Legends ( <unk> , Genroku <unk> ) , featuring new characters within the Muramasa universe . For the new characters , swords are replaced by other weapons such as clubs and shurikens , but they otherwise play in the same way as Momohime and Kisuke . New music was created for the title under Sakimoto 's supervision : the four episodes were scored by Kudo , Chiba , Kaneda and Iwata respectively . The Vanillaware @-@ developed DLC launched in both Japan and the West between November 2013 and November 2014 : the final DLC 's Japanese release was delayed by over two months behind the Western release . A special edition of Muramasa Rebirth exclusive to Japan contained all four DLC episodes alongside the original content . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Demon Blade received critical acclaim , garnering a score of 81 / 100 on Metacritic based on 58 critic reviews . In its review , Famitsu praised the art style , and called the battle system " absorbing " . Their main complaints were the lack of variety between characters and the story having no proper climax . Destructoid 's Conrad Zimmerman called it " a very solid title " , saying that while flawed in its story delivery and instances of repetition , its visuals were " absolutely beautiful " and it proved fun to play . IGN 's Mark Bozon was highly positive about the graphics and sound , but thought the backtracking might put some people off and said the story " may go over people ’ s heads " . Game Revolution writer Nick Tan enjoyed the game greatly , but admitted that its lack of depth reduced the score he could give it as a reviewer . Joe Juba , writing for Game Informer , found The Demon Blade " stunning " despite some missteps in its pacing and depth . GameSpot 's Tom McShea praised the visuals , boss battles and collectable swords , but found few other activities outside combat , which itself lacked depth . GamePro 's Andy Burt called the visuals " gorgeous " and praised the combat and multiple storylines , but found its linearity and <unk> where combat got " bogged down " hampered the experience . GameTrailers praised its combat and visuals , calling it " one of the better action titles on the [ Wii ] " . Keza MacDonald , writing for Eurogamer , noted that " like many beautiful things , [ Muramasa : The Demon Blade ] is a little lacking in substance " , saying that its lack of depth undermined other aspects . Micheal Cunningham of RPGamer called it " a great game " to see and play despite its plain story . RPGFan 's Dennis Rubinshteyn shared several points in common with reviewers about the story and repetition , while again praising the graphics and sound design . 
 Rebirth also had a positive reception , with Metacritic giving it a score of 78 / 100 based on 26 critic reviews . In its review , Famitsu praised it for being a good remake , although one reviewer was disappointed at the lack of new content . Chris Carter of Destructoid said that people who had already played the original version would not find much new content , while newcomers would likely be enchanted by it . Juba , reviewing Rebirth for Game Informer , said that the game was " exactly what developer Vanillaware intended it to be : a better @-@ looking version of the 2009 release " , while noting that this had no fixed the game 's original faults as noted by him . IGN 's Colin Moriarty called Rebirth a " faithful port " , praising the improved localization and generally enjoying playing despite backtracking hampering the experience . Adrian den Ouden of RPGamer also praised the localization and shared points of praise and criticism with the previous reviewer . Stephen Meyerink of RPGFan , who had not played the Wii original , called Rebirth " a gorgeous , action @-@ packed , fairly lengthy adventure that looks , sounds , and plays better than ever " . Chris Holzworth of Electronic Gaming Monthly was impressed by the visuals and indifferent about the story , and recommended playing it on a higher difficulty setting .

 = U.S. Route 31 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Alabama to the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that runs from the Indiana – Michigan state line at Bertrand Township north to its terminus at Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) south of Mackinaw City . Along its 356 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 573 @.@ 7 km ) route , US 31 follows the Michigan section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway as well as other freeways and divided highways northward to Ludington . North of there , the trunkline is a rural undivided highway through the Northern Michigan tourist destinations of Traverse City and Petoskey before terminating south of Mackinaw City . Along its route , US 31 has been dedicated in memory of a few different organizations , and sections of it carry the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) moniker . Four bridges used by the highway have been recognized for their historic character as well . 
 The first highways along the route of the modern US 31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike , an auto trail from 1913 , and later a pair of state trunklines ( the original M @-@ 11 and M @-@ 58 ) in 1919 . These state highways were redesignated US 31 on November 11 , 1926 , when the US Highway System was approved . Since then , the highway has been realigned in places . The highway crossed the Straits of Mackinac by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the Mackinac Bridge was built , connecting to US 2 north of St. Ignace . Later , sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s . These segments opened through the subsequent decades with the last one opening in 2003 . Future plans by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) are to finish the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and bypass Grand Haven .

 Between Lake Michigan Beach and the northern terminus south of Mackinaw City , most of US 31 forms a portion of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan . Additionally , much of the highway from the Indiana – Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards . Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I @-@ 94 near Benton Harbor , and between Holland and Ferrysburg . The remainder of US 31 is a two- or four @-@ lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes . The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the US 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = = St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I @-@ 196 = = = 
 US 31 and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway crosses into Michigan from Indiana southwest of Niles and parallels the St. Joseph River as the two run northward through southwest Michigan . The freeway passes through farmland before crossing US 12 at the first of a set of three interchanges located between Niles on the east and Buchanan on the west . US 31 crosses the river north of the interchange with Niles – Buchanan Road . North of the Walton Road interchange , the freeway turns northwesterly to recross the St. Joseph River near Lake Chapin south of Berrien Springs . The parkway curves around the west side of town before crossing the river for a third time . As US 31 continues northward parallel to the river , it enters the eastern fringes of the Benton Harbor – St. Joseph area . Traffic is forced to exit the freeway at the interchange with Napier Road although the freeway continues northward for less than 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) . 
 After separating from its freeway , US 31 turns west along Napier Avenue for about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) before meeting I @-@ 94 and merging with it . I @-@ 94 / US 31 runs concurrently on a northeasterly course through a partial interchange with Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) before meeting the southern end of I @-@ 196 in Benton Charter Township . At this trumpet interchange , I @-@ 196 / US 31 runs north from I @-@ 94 and passes to the west of the Point O <unk> Golf & Country Club . It continues northward in rural Berrien County through farm fields . The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the Paw Paw River . Past the river , the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland . At the community of Lake Michigan Beach , I @-@ 196 / US 31 meets the northern terminus of M @-@ 63 at exit 7 , and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time . North of this interchange , the freeway parallels a county road ( A @-@ 2 , the Blue Star Highway ) that is the former route of US 31 .
