 Ewbank , Martin , Maynard , and Namath are recognized based upon their achievements with the Jets . Ewbank is also recognized based upon his achievements with the Baltimore Colts , coaching them to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 . Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the Washington Redskins ( 1976 – 79 , 81 – 85 ) , as is Monk ( 1980 – 93 ) , who won three Super Bowl championships with Washington . Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits as a member of the San Francisco 49ers . Baugh and Turner are recognized based upon their achievements as players with other teams , rather than their head coaching stints with the Jets . While Parcells reversed the fortunes of the Jets , he had major impact for the New York Giants , coaching them to two Super Bowl victories . Wolf only had a brief stint with the Jets between 1990 and 1991 , while most of his major contributions occurred as an executive and player personnel director with the Oakland Raiders ( 1963 @-@ 1974 , 1979 @-@ 1989 ) , and later as General Manager of the Green Bay Packers ( 1991 @-@ 2001 ) . Favre only played one season as a member of the Jets in 2008 , between most of his career with the Packers ( 1992 @-@ 2007 ) and his last two NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings ( 2009 @-@ 2010 ) .

 Perhaps the most famous of the Jets ' first round picks came in 1965 when they selected Alabama quarterback Joe Namath who boosted the Jets into the national spotlight with his boisterous personality and lifestyle . His physical talents on the field helped improve the Jets ' fortunes , leading them to victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III . Though injuries hampered the latter part of Namath 's career , he is best remembered , according to former teammate John Dockery , as " a guy that came along and broke a lot of the conventions . " Namath was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1985 . 
 Perhaps one of the most disappointing players in Jets history was running back Blair Thomas . Thomas , who averaged 5 @.@ 4 yards per carry at Penn State , was an intriguing prospect the Jets were interested in utilizing to help their cumbersome offense . Confident in their decision , the Jets drafted Thomas with the second overall pick in 1990 , expecting him to be a solid player for years to come . Thomas ran for only 620 yards in 1990 , and failed to meet the high expectations . By the time Thomas left the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1993 , he had rushed for 2 @,@ 009 yards and only five touchdowns . The 2008 first round pick , defensive lineman Vernon Gholston , followed a similar path , failing to record a sack during his three @-@ year tenure with the team . 
 In the 2013 @-@ 14 seasons , one of the Jets ' strongest units has been their defensive line , manned by 1st Round selections Muhammad Wilkerson ( 2011 ) and Sheldon Richardson ( 2013 ) . In 2013 , Wilkerson ended the season with 10 @.@ 5 sacks , matching the last Jets player to have more than 10 sacks in a single season , John Abraham in 2005 . Also that year , Richardson was honored with an award from the AP for Defensive Rookie of the Year . The Jets ' run defense was stout with all three in the line up , finishing fifth as a team in rushing yards allowed in 2014 .

 = U.S. Route 113 = 
 U.S. Route 113 ( US 113 ) is a spur of US 13 in the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware . The U.S. Highway runs 74 @.@ 75 miles ( 120 @.@ 30 km ) from US 13 in Pocomoke City , Maryland north to Delaware Route 1 ( DE 1 ) in Milford , Delaware . In conjunction with DE 1 , US 113 is one of two major north – south highways on the Delmarva Peninsula ( with US 13 ) that connect Dover with Pocomoke City and the Eastern Shore of Virginia . The U.S. Highway is the primary north – south highway in Worcester County , Maryland , where it connects Pocomoke City with Snow Hill and Berlin . US 113 is one of three major north – south highways in Sussex County , Delaware , where it connects Selbyville and Georgetown with Milford . While US 113 does not pass through Ocean City or the Delaware beaches , the U.S. Highway intersects several highways that serve the Atlantic Ocean resorts , including US 50 , Maryland Route 90 ( MD 90 ) , US 9 , and DE 1 . US 113 is a four @-@ lane divided highway for its whole length except for between Snow Hill and Berlin , where it is a two @-@ lane undivided road . 
 US 113 follows the corridor of a post road established in the late 18th century to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia . The highway was improved as an all @-@ weather road in the 1910s . In Maryland , the post road was designated one of the original state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission ( MDSRC ) in 1909 . In Delaware , the highway was the Selbyville – Dover portion of the DuPont Highway , a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont . The DuPont Highway , which was started by DuPont 's company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department ( DSHD ) , spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware . The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic ; US 113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s . Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid @-@ 1930s ; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US 113 Alternate . 
 Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway began in the 1950s in Dover . Much of the remainder of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s ; the final section of two @-@ lane US 113 in that state was expanded in the mid @-@ 1990s . The Berlin bypass became the first section of US 113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid @-@ 1950s . In the early 1970s , US 113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed , replacing what would become US 113 Business . The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000 . The Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) is upgrading the last remaining two @-@ lane portions of US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four @-@ lane divided highway . US 113 's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE 1 from Milford to Dover . The Delaware Department of Transportation ( DelDOT ) plans to upgrade US 113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale ; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 113 has a length of 37 @.@ 49 miles ( 60 @.@ 33 km ) in Maryland . Known as Worcester Highway , the highway runs from its southern terminus in Pocomoke City north to the Delaware state line via Snow Hill and Berlin in Worcester County . In Delaware , US 113 is named Dupont Boulevard and extends 37 @.@ 26 miles ( 59 @.@ 96 km ) from the Maryland state line at Selbyville north to its northern terminus in Milford via Georgetown in Sussex County and a small portion of Kent County . All of US 113 is part of the National Highway System . 
 = = = Pocomoke City to Snow Hill = = = 
 US 113 begins in Pocomoke City at an intersection with US 13 ( Ocean Highway ) , the main highway of the Delmarva Peninsula that connects Wilmington and Dover with Salisbury and Norfolk . Old Virginia Road ( unsigned MD 250A ) , a section of old alignment of US 113 , continues west to US 13 Business ( Market Street ) . US 13 Business heads north through the Pocomoke City Historic District , which preserves buildings from Pocomoke City 's late 19th century and early 20th century heyday as a river port and station on the main rail line of the Delmarva Peninsula . Just north of US 13 , US 113 intersects American Legion Drive ( unsigned MD <unk> ) , which leads to MD 359 ( Bypass Road ) , another section of the old alignment of the U.S. Highway . The U.S. Route leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting MD 756 ( Old Snow Hill Road ) , the original alignment of US 113 . 
 US 113 heads northeast as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The U.S. Highway parallels the east bank of the Pocomoke River at a distance of about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) ; the highway crosses many streams that drain into the river , including Pilchard Creek , Bachelors Branch , <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and Hardship Branch . US 113 passes through Pocomoke State Forest , which preserves bald cypress swamps and loblolly pine stands along the Maryland Scenic and Wild River , and by the Shad Landing unit of Pocomoke River State Park . About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the entrance to the state park , US 113 Business ( Market Street ) splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill , which is the county seat of Worcester County . US 113 Business passes through the Snow Hill Historic District , which contains several museums and preserves colonial era buildings of the river port at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke River . US 113 bypasses the town to the east and intersects MD 12 ( Snow Hill Road ) , which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton , and MD 365 ( Public Landing Road ) . After the intersection with MD 365 , the highway turns north , reduces to a two @-@ lane highway , and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River . US 113 crosses the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at grade and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US 113 Business . 
 = = = Snow Hill to Berlin = = = 
 Between Snow Hill and Berlin , US 113 is a two @-@ lane road currently being reconstructed as a four @-@ lane divided highway from the Berlin end . As of October 2010 , the highway is under construction from Massey Branch of Marshall Creek to Goody Hill Road between Newark and Ironshire , where the highway presently expands to a divided highway . The U.S. Highway traverses Five Mile Branch of the Pocomoke River before the highway veers away from that river and passes into the Atlantic Ocean watershed . Further north , US 113 crosses Massey Branch and <unk> Branch of Beaverdam Creek , which flow into Newport Bay . The U.S. Highway parallels and then intersects the Snow Hill Line at grade and passes by the communities of Newark and Ironshire , which are served by sections of old alignment named Newark Road and Shire Drive , respectively . Newark is home to the <unk> Railway Station , a preserved Pennsylvania Railroad station . Ironshire contains the historic home Simpson 's Grove . 
 US 113 passes the historic plantation home Merry Sherwood before reaching the intersection with MD 818 ( Main Street ) just south of Berlin . MD 818 , the old alignment of US 113 , heads north through the Berlin Commercial District , which contains several museums and preserves buildings from the late 19th century when Berlin was at the intersection of two railroad lines . US 113 bypasses Berlin to the east , where the highway intersects MD 376 ( Assateague Road ) and MD 346 ( Old Ocean City Boulevard ) , the old alignment of US 50 , and passes the historic home Caleb 's Discovery . The U.S. Route intersects US 50 , which connects Ocean City with Salisbury and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge , at a cloverleaf interchange just south of the northern end of MD 818 , which the highway meets while it parallels the Snow Hill Line . 
 = = = Berlin to Selbyville = = = 
 North of Berlin , US 113 is a four @-@ lane divided highway that crosses several creeks that come together to form the St. Martin River , which empties into Isle of Wight Bay , a lagoon on the west side of Ocean City . The first of three sections of old alignment of US 113 north of Berlin , MD 575 ( Worcester Highway ) , splits to the northeast toward Friendship at a right @-@ in / right @-@ out interchange with the northbound direction . The U.S. Highway leaves the railroad track and meets MD 90 ( Ocean City Expressway ) at a partial cloverleaf interchange ; MD 90 connects the northern part of Ocean City with US 50 west of Berlin . US 113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD 575 and MD 589 ( Racetrack Road ) , which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs , a harness racing track with a slot machine casino that opened in January 2011 . The exit ramp from northbound US 113 intersects MD 575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589 . Another segment of old alignment serves properties and St. Martin 's Episcopal Church between the exit and entrance ramps from southbound US 113 . A third section of old alignment parallels the southbound side of the divided highway through Showell . US 113 intersects MD 367 ( Bishopville Road ) in Bishop , crosses the Snow Hill Line at grade at an oblique angle , and intersects the east end of MD 610 ( Whaleyville Road ) before the highway enters Delaware . 
 = = = Selbyville to Georgetown = = = 
 US 113 enters Sussex County to the east of the Great Cypress Swamp in the town of Selbyville , where the highway intersects DE 54 ( Cemetery Road / Cypress Road ) , which heads east to Fenwick Island . Between Selbyville and Georgetown , the U.S. Highway passes to the west of several towns formed where the original post road crossed streams that flow into the Indian River , such as Frankford on Vines Creek . US 113 intersects DE 26 ( Clayton Street / Nine Foot Road ) , which heads east to Bethany Beach , in Dagsboro , which was settled at the site of a gristmill on Pepper Creek and is home to Prince George 's Chapel . The route crosses several branches of the Indian River before intersecting DE 20 ( Dagsboro Road ) , which joins the U.S. Highway in a concurrency . The two highways parallel Delaware Avenue , the old alignment of DE 20 , as they pass through the fringe of Millsboro , which was founded at the head of navigation of the Indian River . US 113 intersects DE 24 and DE 30 ( Washington Street / Laurel Road ) on the west side of town . After crossing Betts Pond , DE 20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US 113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of Stockley . 
 North of Stockley , US 113 intersects DE 24 Alternate ( Speedway Road ) adjacent to Georgetown Speedway on its way to Georgetown , which was founded as a more central county seat for Sussex County in 1791 . South of the town , the U.S. Highway meets the south end of Bedford Street , which is marked US 9 Truck / DE 404 Truck . The truck routes , which bypass the downtown area of Georgetown , join US 113 in a concurrency . US 9 Truck ends at the intersection with US 9 ( County Seat Highway / Market Street ) on the west side of Georgetown . Along with DE 404 , US 9 heads east toward Delaware Coastal Airport , the original county seat of Lewes , Rehoboth Beach , and Dewey Beach . North of the center of town , US 113 intersects DE 404 and DE 18 ( Seashore Highway ) , which head west toward Bridgeville and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge . At this intersection , DE 404 Truck ends . The U.S. Highway meets the other end of Bedford Street before it leaves the Georgetown area .

 Between Georgetown and Milford , US 113 heads north through a forested area that surrounds the Ellendale Swamp , which forms the eastern edge of the Nanticoke River watershed . The U.S. Highway crosses <unk> Branch and passes through several units of Redden State Forest , which was established as a hunting preserve by the Pennsylvania Railroad in the early 20th century . North of the swamp area , US 113 passes to the west of Ellendale , which flourished in the late 19th @-@ century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines at its Railroad Square . Ellendale is connected to the U.S. Route by DE 16 ( Beach Highway ) , which passes through Milton , home of the <unk> Head Brewery , on its way to the Delaware beaches . Just north of DE 16 on the northbound side of the highway is Teddy 's Tavern , which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to service travelers on the DuPont Highway . North of Ellendale , US 113 enters the Delaware Bay watershed ; the highway crosses Cedar Creek and passes to the west of Lincoln . 
 US 113 reaches its northern terminus in Milford , a city founded in the early 19th century at the head of navigation of the Mispillion River that was once a shipbuilding center . The U.S. Highway intersects DE 36 ( Lakeview Avenue ) on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments , Silver Lake to the east and Haven Lake to the west . US 113 meets Norfolk Southern Railway 's Indian River Secondary railroad track at grade and intersects DE 14 ( Front Street / Milford Harrington Highway ) . On the north side of Milford , the U.S. Route intersects DE 1 Business ( Walnut Street ) at an oblique angle . DE 1 Business joins US 113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern termini at a partial interchange with DE 1 . There is no direct access from northbound US 113 to southbound DE 1 or from northbound DE 1 to southbound US 113 . 
 = = History = = 
 US 113 was included in the original report laying out the U.S. Highway System in 1925 . US 113 was only marked between US 213 in Berlin and US 13 in Dover on the November 1926 map laying out the U.S. Route system . By 1927 , the highway was also marked as US 113 on the Pocomoke City to Berlin portion . 
 = = = Predecessor roads = = = 
 The original highway along much of the US 113 corridor was a post road established in the late 18th century that connected Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill , Berlin , Selbyville , Georgetown , Milford , and Dover , ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia . In Maryland , the post road followed what is now MD 12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton to Snow Hill . A separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill ; that highway , as well as the portion of the post road from Snow Hill through Berlin to Bishop , followed the alignment along which US 113 would be marked in the early 20th century . By 1898 , the dirt road from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County . North of Bishop , the post road followed the Old Stage Road north to the Delaware state line . 
 In Delaware , the Dover – Milford portion of the post road followed the King 's Highway established in the late 17th century to connect Dover with Lewes , the original county seat of Sussex County . South of Milford , the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s . A 1796 act of the Delaware General Assembly called for the surveying of a straighter 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line , a highway that became known as the State Road by the mid @-@ 19th century . The path of the State Road remains as a series of unnumbered highways that generally parallel US 113 to the east through all of the towns from Selbyville to Milford . From Main Street in Selbyville , the highway followed Pepper Road to Frankford 's Main Street , Clayton Avenue to Dagsboro 's Main Street , and Iron Branch Road to State Street in Millsboro . The State Road continued along Fox Run Drive and Bethesda Road to Stockley , then Zoar Road to Georgetown , through which the highway followed Bedford Street . The post road used the present alignment of US 113 to Redden before traversing Old State Road through Ellendale and Lincoln to Milford , where the highway passed through town as Walnut Street . From Milford to Dover , the State Road was mostly overlaid by US 113 . The two exceptions were through Frederica , where the State Road used Market Street , and between Milford and Frederica , where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road , Reynolds Road , Pritchett Road , and Milford Neck Road . 
 = = = Maryland state roads = = = 
 When MDSRC was established in 1908 , their first major project was to connect all of Maryland 's county seats with all @-@ weather roads . The highway between Pocomoke City and Berlin via Snow Hill was chosen as one of the original state roads in 1909 . Sections of paved highway existed north of Snow Hill , from Ironshire to Berlin , and from Berlin to the northern terminus of present MD 818 by 1910 . The highway was paved from Snow Hill to Newark in 1911 ; the Newark – Berlin section was under construction that year and completed in 1912 . Construction on the Pocomoke City – Snow Hill road was started from the Pocomoke City end in 1911 and completed in 1914 . The highway was paved with a 12 @-@ to @-@ 14 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide macadam surface except for the final section between <unk> Church Road and Hardship Branch , which was paved with 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide concrete . The highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was constructed as a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide concrete road from the northern end of the existing paved road in Berlin to Showell in 1917 and 1918 . The road from Showell to the Delaware state line was constructed along a new alignment to connect with the southern end of the DuPont Highway by 1921 . 
 The first improvements to US 113 in Maryland were the widening of 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the Snow Hill – Berlin road with the addition of a pair of 2 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) wide macadam shoulders in 1926 . By the end of 1930 , the widening of the Snow Hill – Berlin road to 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) in width was completed . The Berlin – Delaware state line road was widened to a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) width around 1930 . Widening of the Pocomoke City – Snow Hill road began in 1929 . The first bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1936 . This bypass , which was built with a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide concrete surface following present day MD 359 and unsigned MD 250A , replaced Old Snow Hill Road , which was redesignated MD 756 . In 1934 , MDSRC recommended widening the entirety of US 113 from 15 to 18 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) to 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . However , further widening of US 113 did not occur until after World War II . The U.S. Highway was widened from Snow Hill to the Delaware state line starting in 1947 and from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill beginning in 1949 . Widening was completed on all of US 113 in Maryland by 1953 . 
 = = = DuPont Highway = = = 
 The portion of US 113 in Delaware was constructed on a new alignment as the Selbyville – Dover portion of the DuPont Highway . This highway was the brainchild of Thomas Coleman DuPont , who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure . Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main north – south highway as the backbone of a well laid out system of roads in Delaware , DuPont envisioned a 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) right @-@ of @-@ way that contained a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) wide high @-@ speed automobile highway in the center , surrounded by dual trolley tracks , roadways for heavy vehicle traffic , unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines , and sidewalks at the outer edge of the right @-@ of @-@ way . The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and utility line rentals . After sections of the highway were built , they would be turned over without charge to the state , which would maintain the road . 
 Despite these grand visions , in the end the DuPont Highway was constructed in Sussex County as a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide concrete roadway on the proposed 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) right @-@ of @-@ way . The Delaware General Assembly passed the Boulevard Corporation Act of 1911 , which authorized the formation of Coleman DuPont Road , Inc. to acquire land and construct a highway the length of the state . Construction of the first section of the highway began near Selbyville on September 18 , 1911 . By 1912 , construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right @-@ of @-@ way . DuPont offered to make concessions , such as agreeing to pay up to five times the assessed value of a farmer 's land five years after the road 's completion and reducing the width of the corridor of land to be acquired to 100 feet ( 30 m ) . Construction on the highway resumed in 1915 after the litigation had taken its course . The first two sections of the highway , from Selbyville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to a point 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) south of Milford , were completed on May 24 , 1917 . Despite DuPont 's grand boulevard not coming to fruition , his highway was innovative as one of the earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but did not pass directly through them , a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town 's residents . Up to that point , the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads . 
 On July 20 , 1918 , DuPont reached an agreement with the state of Delaware for the newly formed DSHD to construct the remaining sections of the highway . DuPont would dissolve Coleman DuPont Road , Inc. and finance the remainder of construction up to $ 44 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ mile ( $ 27 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ kilometer ) , $ 690 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ mile ( $ 430 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ kilometer ) in 2016 dollars . The highway department would complete the road to Milford along the lines designed by DuPont 's company . The DuPont Highway north of Milford would be both designed and constructed by DSHD , which decided on a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) wide right @-@ of @-@ way for future sections of the highway . The portions from north of Ellendale to north of Milford , from Frederica to Little Heaven , and through Rising Sun were completed by 1920 . All other portions of the DuPont Highway between Ellendale and Dover were under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923 , the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville – Wilmington highway was completed near Odessa . 
 The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware , which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast . In conjunction with the rise of the automobile , the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis . Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets . No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods , farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits , vegetables , and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north . 
 By the end of the 1920s , the 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide roadway was inadequate for traffic , so US 113 was widened to 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) in width with the addition of 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wide concrete shoulders , then resurfaced with asphalt . The highway was widened from Selbyville to Georgetown in 1930 , Georgetown to Milford in 1931 , and Milford to Dover in 1933 . After World War II , US 113 was widened to 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) with the addition of another 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wide concrete shoulder and asphalt resurfacing . The U.S. Highway was expanded between Georgetown and Ellendale starting in 1946 . The sections from Selbyville to Dagsboro , from Dagsboro to Georgetown , and from Milford to Little Heaven were expanded beginning in 1947 . The post @-@ war widening of US 113 from Selbyville to the Dover Bypass in Little Heaven was completed with work on the U.S. Highway 's Ellendale – Milford segment in 1949 . 
 = = = Dover bypass and expansion = = = 
 In 1931 , DSHD began construction on the first bypass of Dover . Much of the bypass would use Bay Road , the existing highway from modern DE 8 ( North Little Creek Road ) in Dover to Kitts Hummock on Delaware Bay . Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover , and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE 1 's interchange with DE 9 ( Bayside Drive ) at the southern end of Dover Air Force Base . The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing . Between December 1931 and the end of 1933 , DSHD constructed a causeway across 3 @,@ 150 feet ( 960 m ) of the marsh on the east bank of the river , a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway . A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1934 . Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide concrete pavement starting in 1934 . US 113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass north to US 13 ( State Street ) when the new highway opened for Memorial Day in 1935 . DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US 113 Alternate . 
 The first section of US 113 to be expanded to a divided highway was in Dover . The highway from State Street north of downtown Dover to the modern intersection of US 13 and Bay Road was expanded to a divided highway as part of the same project completed in April 1952 to construct a southern bypass of Dover for US 13 between State Street south of Dover and Bay Road . US 113 's course did not change , as it was co @-@ signed with US 13 on the expanded portion of Bay Road . US 113 's northern terminus was rolled back from State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road in 1966 ; this was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) in 1974 . The Bay Road divided highway was extended south along US 113 to the southern end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959 . US 113 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was expanded to a divided highway in 1984 and 1985 ; this project included replacing the two @-@ lane drawbridge over the St. Jones River with a four @-@ lane girder bridge . 
 The first segment of the original DuPont Highway to be expanded to a divided highway was from north of Milford to south of Frederica in 1959 . The divided highway was extended around Milford south to near Lincoln between 1962 and 1964 . The four @-@ lane divided Frederica bypass was constructed in 1965 ; DE 12 was later extended north from Frederica to the bypass along old US 113 ( Frederica Road ) . US 113 was expanded to a divided highway from the Maryland state line to Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967 . The divided highway was extended north to Stockley in 1968 and Georgetown in 1969 . The US 113 – DE 1 interchange in Milford was built concurrent with the completion of the Milford Bypass in 1971 . US 113 between Frederica and Little Heaven was expanded in 1975 . The final stretch of two @-@ lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated by 1996 when the Georgetown – Ellendale section was widened to a four @-@ lane divided highway .

 The first portion of divided highway in Maryland was the Berlin bypass , which was constructed between 1954 and 1956 . The divided highway extended from Hayes Landing Road north of Ironshire to Deer Park Drive north of Berlin . The old alignment of the U.S. Highway through Berlin became MD 818 . US 113 also bypassed Newark and Ironshire in 1956 ; the relocated highway was constructed as the first carriageway of a future divided highway . US 113 's interchange with US 50 was built in 1976 . The next section of US 113 to become a divided highway was between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill . The highway was expanded from Pilchard Creek to just west of Hardship Branch in 1971 . The divided highway was extended north to the southern end of the Snow Hill bypass in 1973 . The divided highway was extended south to US 13 in Pocomoke City along a new alignment in 1974 . The two @-@ lane Snow Hill bypass was constructed from south of Snow Hill to MD 12 in 1973 ; the bypass was completed to its northern end in 1975 . The bypassed portion of US 113 in Snow Hill was designated MD 394 in 1977 and then US 113 Business in 1997 . 
 MDSHA conducted its first study on expanding US 113 north of Berlin to a divided highway in the early 1970s . While US 113 was not expanded at that time , preparations for a future expansion were started , including acquisition of right @-@ of @-@ way along the proposed route and the partial construction of an interchange with MD 90 in 1976 when that two @-@ lane freeway was constructed . A second planning study was conducted in the late 1980s ; this study recommended intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway . The local group County Residents Action for Safer Highways ( CRASH ) formed in response to the significantly higher accident rates along the two @-@ lane sections of US 113 compared to the state average . The high accident rate , which included 42 fatal accidents between 1980 and 1997 , led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US 113 to four lanes . MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US 113 Planning Study , which recommended expanding US 113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin . 
 US 113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998 . The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MD 818 to south of MD 589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community . This segment , which included the finishing of the MD 90 interchange 24 years after it was first laid out , was completed in 2000 . The second segment of US 113 reconstruction , from south of MD 589 to Jarvis Road , included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin 's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell . The second section , including the interchange with MD 589 , was completed in 2002 . The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line when the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road in 2003 . Sections of old alignment of US 113 north of Berlin were designated MD 575 . 
 Following the expansion of US 113 from Berlin to the Delaware state line , MDSHA turned its attention toward the remaining 17 miles ( 27 km ) of two @-@ lane highway in Maryland between the southern end of the Snow Hill Bypass and Hayes Landing Road north of Ironshire . In 2006 , MDSHA began construction on a five @-@ phase , long @-@ term project to expand US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four @-@ lane divided highway . Phase 1 , which covered 4 @.@ 0 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of the Snow Hill bypass from the southern terminus of US 113 Business to just north of MD 365 , was completed in 2007 . Phase 2 was divided into two sub @-@ phases . Phase 2A covered the 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) of US 113 from Goody Hill Road south of Ironshire to Hayes Landing Road and was completed in 2009 . Phase 2B , which covered the 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) of highway between Massey Branch just north of Newark and Goody Hill Road , began in summer 2009 and was complete at the end of 2011 . Phase 3 involves the 4 @.@ 4 miles ( 7 @.@ 1 km ) of roadway between Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill and Massey Branch ; construction began in fall 2015 and is expected to be finished in spring 2017 . Phase 4 includes the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) section of US 113 between the north end of Phase 1 near MD 365 north to the south end of Phase 3 at Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill , which will complete US 113 as a four @-@ lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Milford . Phase 5 will be the construction of an interchange between US 113 and MD 12 in Snow Hill . The interchange will be a dumbbell interchange , a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad . On June 25 , 2015 , Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening US 113 in Maryland , among other projects across the state .

 DE 1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line in Fenwick Island in 1974 . DE 1 was co @-@ signed with DE 14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1977 when DE 14 was truncated at Milford . The DE 1 designation was extended north in 1988 along US 113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US 13 toward Christiana to connect the coastal highway portion of DE 1 with the " Relief Route " ( now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway ) to which DE 1 was to be assigned between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana . The Dover – Smyrna portion of the DE 1 freeway was completed between the east side of Dover and Dover Air Force Base in 1993 . As a result , US 113 traffic had to use Exit 95 , the interchange for DE 10 at the north gate of Dover Air Force Base , to continue north or south on the U.S. Highway . In 2001 , US 113 and DE 1 were upgraded to a freeway from the southern end of Dover Air Force Base to Exit 95 . US 113 was rolled back to Milford in favor of the sole designation of DE 1 between the Milford and Dover areas in 2004 . This was approved by AASHTO in their annual 2003 meeting along with the removal of the US 113 Alternate designation . DelDOT had submitted for the truncation of US 113 at the spring 2003 AASHTO meeting but it was denied because they did not submit for the removal of US 113 Alternate . Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US 113 at US 13 in Dover . 
 In 2001 , the DelDOT conducted a feasibility study for a future north – south limited access highway in Sussex County . The Sussex County North – South Transportation Study explored routes along and between the US 13 , US 113 , and DE 1 corridors . The study took into account local , long distance , and seasonal traffic patterns ; environmental , agricultural , and developmental impacts ; connections with arterial highways ; and the ability to build the limited @-@ access highway in usable sections . The study recommended routing the limited @-@ access highway along the US 113 corridor , using as much of the current US 113 route as possible . For its standing US 113 North / South Study , DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas : Millsboro – South , Georgetown , Ellendale , and Milford . 
 The Milford area study has been dormant since July 2007 due to community opposition to DelDOT 's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford . After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes to the west and east of Milford , DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives . Both alternatives head east from US 113 's current alignment west of Lincoln to meet DE 1 at an interchange south of the latter highway 's interchange with the south end of DE 1 Business . On June 15 , 2007 , DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department 's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass , far below the required 75 percent for consensus to have been achieved . On July 1 , 2007 , in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group , the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155 , which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US 113 North / South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route . Citing a lack of community consensus , DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US 113 bypass of Milford in January 2008 . 
 As of March 2012 , the Millsboro – South , Georgetown , and Ellendale area studies are in varying stages of progress . In the Georgetown and Ellendale areas , DelDOT has decided to upgrade the current alignment . The environmental assessments for the Georgetown and Ellendale areas are complete . In addition , the Ellendale assessment has been approved by the Federal Highway Administration , so design work will proceed when funds become available . DelDOT has suggested a preferred alternative for the Millsboro – South area that would follow US 113 's present alignment through Selbyville , then bypass Frankford , Dagsboro , and Millsboro to the east before rejoining the present course north of Millsboro . However , amid growing opposition to the preferred alternative through the Millsboro area and a revelation that DelDOT is paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass , Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US 113 in Sussex County in January 2011 . Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the Millsboro – South area . In May 2011 , Sussex County legislators proposed the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment , with the addition of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US 113 and DE 24 that could be constructed mostly through state @-@ owned land .

 U.S. Route 113 Business ( US 113 Business ) is a business route of US 113 in Maryland . Known as Market Street , the highway runs 4 @.@ 16 miles ( 6 @.@ 69 km ) between junctions with US 113 on the south and north sides of Snow Hill . US 113 Business follows the original alignment of US 113 through Snow Hill . This alignment was constructed as part of the state road between Pocomoke City and Berlin in 1911 and 1912 . US 113 's bypass of Snow Hill was completed in 1975 . The old alignment was designated Maryland Route 394 by 1977 . That designation was replaced by US 113 Business in 1997 . 
 US 113 Business begins at an intersection with US 113 ( Worcester Highway ) south of Snow Hill . The business route heads northeast as two @-@ lane Market Street through farmland before entering downtown Snow Hill . US 113 Business passes the Julia A. Purnell Museum and the Samuel Gunn House shortly before intersecting MD 12 ( Church Street ) . MD 12 joins US 113 Business for a short concurrency , during which the two highways pass All Hallows Episcopal Church , <unk> Memorial Presbyterian Church , and the Worcester County Courthouse . After MD 12 turns north onto Washington Street , the business route passes the George Washington Purnell House , then leaves downtown Snow Hill and meets the west end of MD 365 ( Bay Street ) . US 113 Business crosses Purnell Creek and leaves the town limits of Snow Hill before reaching its northern terminus at US 113 north of Snow Hill .

 = = = Former Delaware alternate route = = = 
 U.S. Route 113 Alternate ( US 113 Alternate ) was an alternate route of US 113 in Delaware . The highway ran 9 @.@ 10 miles ( 14 @.@ 65 km ) from US 113 and DE 1 in Little Heaven north to the intersection of US 13 and US 113 in Dover . US 113 Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US 13 in Dover . The alternate route was established when US 113 's new alignment along Bay Road was completed in 1936 . The highway followed the same alignment south of Dover for its entire existence . Within Dover , US 113 Alternate originally followed State Street past the Delaware State Capitol to its northern terminus at US 13 ( Governors Avenue ) , which is now US 13 Alternate , just south of Silver Lake on the north side of downtown Dover . US 113 Alternate was moved away from downtown Dover in 1974 when the alternate route was made concurrent with US 13 north to its intersection with US 113 's northern terminus east of the Delaware State Capitol . US 113 Alternate was removed as an alternate in 2004 concurrent with US 113 's northern terminus being rolled back to Milford . 
 US 113 Alternate began at an intersection with US 113 and DE 1 ( Bay Road ) in Little Heaven . Connections from southbound US 113 Alternate to northbound US 113 and DE 1 and from southbound US 113 and DE 1 to northbound US 113 Alternate were provided by <unk> Point Road . The highway headed northwest as two @-@ lane Clapham Road . US 113 Alternate passed through Magnolia , where the highway was known as Main Street and intersected Walnut Street . The highway continued north from Magnolia as State Street through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions . After Rising Sun Road split to the northwest , US 113 Alternate veered north and intersected DE 10 Alternate ( Sorghum Mill Road ) in Rising Sun . DE 10 Alternate joined US 113 Alternate in a concurrency north across <unk> Creek to DE 10 Alternate 's eastern terminus at the intersection with DE 10 ( Lebanon Road ) . US 113 Alternate continued north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake and entered the city of Dover . After passing under the Puncheon Run Connector with no access and crossing Puncheon Run , the highway intersected US 13 ( DuPont Highway ) . While State Street continued north toward the Delaware State Capitol , US 113 Alternate joined US 13 in a concurrency . The U.S. Highways crossed the St. Jones River before meeting Court Street ( now Martin Luther King , Jr . Boulevard ) , which was used to access the Delaware State Capitol to the west and Bay Road , the old alignment of US 113 , to the east . US 113 Alternate reached its northern terminus at an intersection with Bay Road ; that intersection was also the northern terminus of US 113 .

 = Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula = 
 The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula ( also known as Bridge Formula B and the Federal Bridge Formula ) is a mathematical formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation ( DOT ) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle ( CMV ) based on axle number and spacing . The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic ( intrastate traffic is subject to state limits ) . The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges . CMVs are most often tractor @-@ trailers or buses , but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry . 
 Early 20th @-@ century weight limits were enacted to protect dirt and gravel roads from damage caused by the solid wheels of heavy trucks . As time passed , truck weight limits focused primarily on gross weight limits ( which had no prescribed limits on length ) . By 1974 , bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits . The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight @-@ to @-@ length ratio of heavy trucks , and to protect roads and bridges from the damage caused by the concentrated weight of shorter trucks . The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks , preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure . 
 Compliance with the law is checked when vehicles pass through a weigh station , often located at the borders between states or on the outskirts of major cities , where the vehicle may be weighed and measured . The one exception to the formula allows a standard five @-@ axle semi @-@ truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight . This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law . 
 = = History = = 
 The first truck weight limits were enacted by four states in 1913 , ranging from 18 @,@ 000 pounds ( 8 @,@ 200 kg ) in Maine to 28 @,@ 000 pounds ( 13 @,@ 000 kg ) in Massachusetts . These laws were passed to protect earth and gravel @-@ surfaced roads from damage caused by the steel and solid rubber wheels of early heavy trucks . By 1933 , all states had some form of truck weight regulation . The Federal @-@ Aid Highway Act of 1956 instituted the first federal truck weight regulation ( set at 73 @,@ 280 pounds or 33 @,@ 240 kilograms ) and authorized the construction of the Interstate Highway System . 
 In the late 1950s , the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) conducted a series of extensive field tests of roads and bridges to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of pavement materials . In 1964 , the AASHTO recommended to Congress that a bridge formula table be used instead of a single gross weight limit for trucks . The Federal @-@ Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974 established the bridge formula as law , along with the gross weight limit of 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) . Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 feet or more length between axle sets , and a maximum load of 105 @,@ 500 lbs . 
 = = Usage = = 
 The formula was enacted as law to limit the weight @-@ to @-@ length ratio of a commercial motor vehicle ( CMV ) . The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck 's axle from producing stress on bridge members ( possibly causing a bridge collapse ) . In simplified form , this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice . When standing upright , a person 's weight is concentrated at the bottom of their feet , funneling all of their weight into a small area . When lying down , a person 's weight is distributed over a much larger area . This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up . For an overweight truck to comply with the formula , more axles must be added , the distance between axles must be increased , or weight must be removed . 
 A division of the DOT , the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) , regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry . The FMCSA enforces the length , width , and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) for interstate commercial traffic . Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways , U.S. Highways , and state highways known as the National Network ( NN ) . Provided the truck remains on the NN , it is not subject to state limits . These limits ( which can be lower or higher than federal limits ) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic , provided the vehicle is not on the NN . 
 CMVs are defined by the FMCSA as vehicles engaged in interstate commerce that are used to transport passengers or property : vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 10 @,@ 001 pounds ( 4 @,@ 536 kg ) or more ; those designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers ( including the driver ) for compensation ; vehicles designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers ( including the driver ) without compensation ; or those used to transport hazardous materials in quantities requiring the vehicle to be marked or placarded under hazardous materials regulations . 
 The weight and size of CMVs are restricted for practical and safety reasons . CMVs are restricted by gross weight ( total weight of vehicle and cargo ) , and by axle weight ( i.e. , the weight carried by each tire ) . The federal weight limits for CMVs are 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) for gross weight ( unless the bridge formula dictates a lower limit ) , 34 @,@ 000 pounds ( 15 @,@ 000 kg ) for a tandem axle , and 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 9 @,@ 100 kg ) for a single axle . A tandem axle is defined as two or more consecutive axles whose centers are spaced more than 40 inches ( 102 cm ) but not more than 96 inches ( 244 cm ) apart . Axles spaced less than 40 inches ( 102 cm ) apart are considered a single axle . 
 In effect , the formula reduces the legal weight limit for shorter trucks with fewer axles ( see table below ) . For example , a 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) three @-@ axle dump truck would have a gross weight limit of 54 @,@ 500 pounds ( 24 @,@ 700 kg ) , instead of 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) , which is the standard weight limit for 63 @-@ foot ( 19 @.@ 2 m ) five @-@ axle tractor @-@ trailer . FHWA regulation § 658 @.@ 17 states : " The maximum gross vehicle weight shall be 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) except where lower gross vehicle weight is dictated by the bridge formula . " 
 = = Bridge collapse = = 
 The August 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis brought renewed attention to the issue of truck weights and their relation to bridge stress . In November 2008 , the National Transportation Safety Board determined there had been several reasons for the bridge 's collapse , including ( but not limited to ) : faulty gusset plates , inadequate inspections , and the extra weight of heavy construction equipment combined with the weight of rush hour traffic . The I @-@ 35 Trade Corridor Study reported that the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) expressed concern over bridges on the I @-@ 35 corridor due to an expected increase of international truck traffic from Canada and Mexico , with the FHWA listing it as " high @-@ priority " in 2005 . 
 As of 2007 , federal estimates suggest truck traffic increased 216 % since 1970 , shortly before the federal gross weight limit for trucks was increased by 30 @,@ 000 pounds ( 14 @,@ 000 kg ) . This is also the period during which many of the existing interstate bridges were built . Research shows that increased truck traffic ( and therefore , increased stress ) shortens the life of bridges . National Pavement Cost Model ( <unk> ) estimates indicate that one 80 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) truck does as much damage to roads as 750 3 @,@ 800 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 700 kg ) cars . 
 Some smaller bridges have a weight limit ( or gross weight load rating ) indicated by a sign posted in a visible position in front of the bridge ( hence the reference to a " posted bridge " ) . These are necessary when the weight limit of the bridge is lower than the federal or state gross weight limit for trucks . Driving a truck over a bridge that is too weak to support it usually does not result in an immediate collapse . The bridge may develop cracks , which over time can weaken the bridge and cause it to collapse . Most of these cracks are discovered during mandated inspections of bridges . Most bridge collapses occur in rural areas , result in few injuries or deaths , and receive relatively little media attention . While the number varies from year to year , as many as 150 bridges can collapse in a year . About 1 @,@ 500 bridges collapsed between 1966 and 2007 , and most of those were the result of soil erosion around bridge supports . In 1987 , the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed in upstate New York , due to erosion of soil around the foundation , which sparked renewed interest in bridge design in inspection procedures . 
 In special cases involving unusually overweight trucks ( which require special permits ) , not observing a bridge weight limit can lead to disastrous consequences . Fifteen days after the collapse of the Minneapolis bridge , a heavy truck collapsed a small bridge in Oakville , Washington . 
 = = Formula law = = 
 CMVs are required to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and some large cities . These weigh stations are run by state DOTs , and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA . Weigh stations check each vehicle 's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in @-@ ground truck scales , and are usually where a truck 's compliance with the formula is checked . 
 FMCSA regulation § 658 @.@ 17 states : 
 No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be moved or operated on any interstate highway when the gross weight on two or more consecutive axles exceeds the limitations prescribed by the following formula : 
 <formula> 
 w 
 = the maximum weight in pounds that can be carried on a group of two or more axles to the nearest 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) . 
 ℓ = 
 spacing in feet between the outer axles of any two or more consecutive axles . 
 n = number of axles being considered . 
 Two or more consecutive axles may not exceed the weight computed by the bridge formula , even if the gross weight of the truck ( or the weight on one axle ) is below otherwise legal limits . Although this means that any two axles must comply with the formula , experience has shown that axles 1 through 3 , 1 through 5 , and 2 through 5 are critical and must be checked . This means that the axle group which comprises the entire truck ( known as the " outer group " ) and the interior axle groups ( known as the " tractor group " and " trailer group " ) must also comply with the bridge formula . If these combinations are found to be satisfactory , then all of the other axle groups on this type of vehicle will usually be satisfactory . 
 Penalties for violating weight limits vary between states ( bridge formula weight violations are treated as gross weight violations ) , as the states are responsible for enforcement and collection of fines . Some states , such as Connecticut , issue fines on a percentage basis ( e.g. 20 % overweight at $ 10 per 100 pounds or 45 kilograms ) , which means larger trucks pay higher fines . For example , a truck with a legal gross limit of 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 9 @,@ 100 kg ) that violates the limit by 5 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 300 kg ) would pay a fine of $ 500 , while a truck with a legal gross limit of 60 @,@ 000 pounds ( 27 @,@ 000 kg ) that violates the limit by 5 @,@ 000 pounds would pay a fine of $ 250 . Other states , such as New York , issue fines on a per @-@ pound basis ( e.g. , 5 @,@ 000 pounds overweight equals a $ 300 fine ) . Others , such as Massachusetts , impose a less complicated fine schedule whereby a vehicle that violates the limits by less than 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) is fined $ 40 per 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) , while a violation over 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) pays $ 80 per 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) ( e.g. 5 @,@ 000 pounds or 2 @,@ 300 kilograms overweight equals a $ 200 fine ) . 
 Some states require overweight trucks to offload enough cargo to comply with the limits . In Florida , any vehicle that exceeds the limits by more than 6 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 700 kg ) is required to be unloaded until the vehicle is in compliance . Florida also includes a scale tolerance , which allows for violations of less than 10 % to be forgiven , and no fine issued . Florida also allows for a load to be shifted ( e.g. , moved from the front towards the rear of the vehicle ) for the vehicle to comply with axle weight limits , without penalty . 
 = = Exception = = 
 There is one exception to the formula : two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry 34 @,@ 000 pounds ( 15 @,@ 000 kg ) each if the overall distance between the first and last axles of these tandems is 36 feet ( 11 m ) or more . For example , a five @-@ axle truck may carry 34 @,@ 000 pounds both on the tractor tandem axles ( 2 and 3 ) and the trailer tandem axles ( 4 and 5 ) , provided axles 2 and 5 are spaced at least 36 feet ( 11 m ) apart . 
 This exception allows for the standard 5 @-@ axle semi @-@ truck configuration to gross up to 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) ( the legal limit ) without being in violation of the bridge formula law . Without it , the bridge formula would allow an actual weight of only 66 @,@ 000 pounds ( 30 @,@ 000 kg ) to 67 @,@ 500 pounds ( 30 @,@ 600 kg ) on tandems spaced 36 feet ( 11 m ) to 38 feet ( 11 @.@ 6 m ) apart ; compared to 68 @,@ 000 pounds ( 31 @,@ 000 kg ) with the exception . This exception was sought by the American Trucking Associations so trucking companies could use 40 @-@ foot ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) trailers and weigh 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) . It was the only way tank truck operators could reach 80 @,@ 000 pounds without adding axles to their fleets of trailers already in operation . 
 A CMV may exceed the bridge formula limits ( or gross weight and its axle weight limits ) by up to 400 pounds ( 181 kg ) if the vehicle is equipped with an auxiliary power unit ( APU ) or idle reduction technology . According to the FMCSA , this is permitted " in order to promote reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling " . To be eligible , the vehicle 's operator must prove the weight of the APU with written certification , or — by demonstration or certification — that the idle reduction technology is fully functional at all times . Certification of the APU 's weight must be available to law enforcement officers if the vehicle is found in violation of applicable weight laws . The additional weight allowed cannot exceed 400 pounds or the weight certified , whichever is less .

 The bridge formula ( also referred to as Formula B ) is based on research into single @-@ span bridges , and fails to consider multiple @-@ span bridges . Two @-@ span bridges may not be fully protected by Formula B , depending on the truck length , span length , and other factors . Shorter wheelbase vehicles ( usually specialized trucks such as garbage trucks and water trucks ) have trouble complying with Formula B. 
 In 1987 , the U.S. Congress passed the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act , requesting the Transportation Research Board ( <unk> ) to conduct a study to develop alternatives to Formula B. The study recommended several that were never implemented . It suggested that Formula B was too strict for trucks with shorter axle lengths .

 = The Rite of Spring = 
 The Rite of Spring ( French : Le Sacre du printemps ; Russian : « <unk> <unk> » , Vesna <unk> , ' sacred spring ' ) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky . It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes company ; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky , with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich . When first performed , at the Théâtre des Champs @-@ Élysées on 29 May 1913 , the avant @-@ garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation and a near @-@ riot in the audience . Although designed as a work for the stage , with specific passages accompanying characters and action , the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece , and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century . 
 Stravinsky was a young , virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes . The Rite was the third such project , after the acclaimed Firebird ( 1910 ) and Petrushka ( 1911 ) . The concept behind The Rite of Spring , developed by Roerich from Stravinsky 's outline idea , is suggested by its subtitle , " Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts " ; in the scenario , after various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring , a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death . After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour , the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s , when a version choreographed by Léonide Massine replaced Nijinsky 's original . Massine 's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world 's leading ballet @-@ masters , which gained the work worldwide acceptance . In the 1980s , Nijinsky 's original choreography , long believed lost , was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles . 
 Stravinsky 's score contains many novel features for its time , including experiments in tonality , metre , rhythm , stress and dissonance . Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music , a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny . The music has influenced many of the 20th @-@ century 's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire . 
 = = Background = = 
 Igor Stravinsky was the son of Fyodor Stravinsky , the principal bass at the Imperial Opera , St Petersburg , and Anna , née <unk> , a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old @-@ established Russian family . Fyodor 's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music , including Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , Borodin and Mussorgsky , meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home . In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at St Petersburg University , while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint . Having impressed Rimsky @-@ Korsakov with some of his early compositional efforts , Stravinsky worked under the guidance of the older composer . By the time of his mentor 's death in 1908 Stravinsky had produced several works , among them a Piano Sonata in F @-@ sharp minor ( 1903 – 04 ) , a Symphony in E @-@ flat major ( 1907 ) , which he catalogued as " Opus 1 " , and in 1908 a short orchestral piece , Feu d 'artifice ( " Fireworks " ) . 
 In 1909 Feu d 'artifice was performed at a concert in St Petersburg . Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev , who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences . Like Stravinsky , Diaghilev had initially studied law , but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world . In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris ; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky 's opera Boris Godunov . In 1909 , still in Paris , he launched the Ballets Russes , initially with Borodin 's Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Scheherazade . To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine , the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky . Diaghilev 's intention , however , was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th @-@ century style , and he was looking for fresh compositional talent . Having heard Feu d 'artifice he approached Stravinsky , initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create the ballet Les Sylphides . Stravinsky worked on the opening " Nocturne " and the closing " Valse Brillante " ; his reward was a much bigger commission , to write the music for a new ballet , The Firebird ( L 'oiseau de feu ) for the 1910 season . 
 Stravinsky worked through the winter of 1909 – 10 , in close association with Fokine who was choreographing The Firebird . During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who , although not dancing in the ballet , was a keen observer of its development . Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer , observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age ( he was 21 ) . On the other hand , Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration , " the very essence of a great personality " . The Firebird was premiered on 25 June 1910 , with Tamara Karsavina in the main role , and was a great public success . This ensured that the Diaghilev – Stravinsky collaboration would continue , in the first instance with Petrushka ( 1911 ) and then The Rite of Spring . 
 = = Synopsis and structure = = 
 In a note to the conductor Serge Koussevitzky in February 1914 , Stravinsky described The Rite of Spring as " a musical @-@ choreographic work , [ representing ] pagan Russia ... unified by a single idea : the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring " . In his analysis of The Rite , Pieter van den <unk> writes that the work lacks a specific plot or narrative , and should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes . 
 The French titles are given in the form given in the four @-@ part piano score published in 1913 . There have been numerous variants of the English translations ; those shown are from the 1967 edition of the score .

 = = = Conception = = = 
 Lawrence Morton , in a study of the origins of The Rite , records that in 1907 – 08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky 's collection Yar . Another poem in the anthology , which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read , is " <unk> " which , Morton observes , contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed , including pagan rites , sage elders , and the <unk> sacrifice of a young maiden : " The likeness is too close to be coincidental " . Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite . In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first , that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round . However , in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus : " One day [ in 1910 ] , when I was finishing the last pages of L 'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg , I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite : sage elders , seated in a circle , watching a young girl dance herself to death . They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring . Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps " . 
 By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich , the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals . Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic , and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev 's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances . The pair quickly agreed on a working title , " The Great Sacrifice " ( Russian : <unk> <unk> ) ; Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work , although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev , the ballet Petrushka . 
 In July 1911 Stravinsky visited <unk> , near Smolensk , where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria <unk> , a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev 's magazine World of Art . Here , over several days , Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet . Thomas F. Kelly , in his history of the Rite premiere , suggests that the two @-@ part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich . Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai <unk> , the editor of the Russian Musical Gazette , that the first part of the work would be called " The Kiss of the Earth " , and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of sages , culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring . Part Two , " The Sacrifice " , would have a darker aspect ; secret night games of maidens , leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages . The original working title was changed to " Holy Spring " ( Russian : Vesna <unk> ) , but the work became generally known by the French translation Le Sacre du printemps , or its English equivalent The Rite of Spring , with the subtitle " Pictures of Pagan Russia " . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Stravinsky 's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at <unk> in Ukraine in September 1911 , he worked on two movements , the " Augurs of Spring " and the " Spring Rounds " . In October he left <unk> for Clarens in Switzerland , where in a tiny and sparsely @-@ furnished room — an eight @-@ feet @-@ by @-@ eight closet , with only a muted upright piano , a table and two chairs — he worked throughout the 1911 – 12 winter on the score . By March 1912 , according to the sketchbook chronology , Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II . He also prepared a two @-@ hand piano version , subsequently lost , which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes conductor Pierre Monteux in April 1912 . He also made a four @-@ hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of The Rite ; he and the composer Claude Debussy played the first half of this together , in June 1912 . 
 Following Diaghilev 's decision to delay the premiere until 1913 , Stravinsky put The Rite aside during the summer of 1912 . He enjoyed the Paris season , and accompanied Diaghilev to the Bayreuth Festival to attend a performance of Parsifal . Stravinsky resumed work on The Rite in the autumn ; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912 . During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score , which he signed and dated as " completed in Clarens , March 8 , 1913 " . He showed the manuscript to Maurice Ravel , who was enthusiastic and predicted , in a letter to a friend , that the first performance of the Le Sacre would be as important as the 1902 premiere of Debussy 's Pelléas et Mélisande . After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March , Monteux drew the composer 's attention to several passages which were causing problems : inaudible horns , a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings , and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during fortissimo episodes . Stravinsky amended these passages , and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the " Sacrificial Dance " . Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere ; rather , Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more . According to Van den <unk> , " [ n ] o other work of Stravinsky 's underwent such a series of post @-@ premiere revisions " . 
 Stravinsky acknowledged that the work 's opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs , but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources ; if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music , he said , it was due to " some unconscious ' folk ' memory " . However , Morton has identified several more melodies in Part I as having their origins in the Lithuanian collection . More recently Richard Taruskin has discovered in the score an adapted tune from one of Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's " One Hundred Russian National Songs " . Taruskin notes the paradox whereby The Rite , generally acknowledged as the most revolutionary of the composer 's early works , is in fact rooted in the traditions of Russian music . 
 = = = Realisation = = = 
 Taruskin has listed a number of sources that Roerich consulted when creating his designs . Among these are the Primary Chronicle , a 12th @-@ century compendium of early pagan customs , and Alexander Afanasyev 's study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory . The Princess <unk> 's collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration . When the designs were complete , Stravinsky expressed delight and declared them " a real miracle " . 
 Stravinsky 's relationship with his other main collaborator , Nijinsky , was more complicated . Diaghilev had decided that Nijinsky 's genius as a dancer would translate into the role of ballet @-@ master ; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky 's first attempt at choreography , Debussy 's L 'après @-@ midi d 'un faune , caused controversy and near @-@ scandal because of the dancer 's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work 's end . It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that , at least initially , Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky 's talents as a choreographer with approval ; a letter he sent to <unk> praises the dancer 's " passionate zeal and complete self @-@ effacement " . However , in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension ; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer : " ... the poor boy knew nothing of music . He could neither read it nor play any instrument " . Later still , Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky 's dancing maidens as " knock @-@ kneed and long @-@ braided <unk> " . 
 Stravinsky 's autobiographical account refers to many " painful incidents " between the ballet @-@ master and the dancers during the rehearsal period . By the beginning of 1913 , when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule , Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that " unless you come here immediately ... the Sacre will not take place " . The problems were slowly overcome , and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913 , the dancers appeared to have mastered the work 's difficulties . Even the Ballets Russes 's sceptical stage director , Serge Grigoriev , was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky 's choreography . 
 The conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of Petrushka . Monteux 's first reaction to The Rite , after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version , was to leave the room and find a quiet corner . He drew Diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that ; Diaghilev managed to change his mind . Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism , he never came to enjoy the work ; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it . In old age he said to Sir Thomas Beecham 's biographer Charles Reid : " I did not like Le Sacre then . I have conducted it fifty times since . I do not like it now " . On 30 March Monteux informed Stravinsky of modifications he thought were necessary to the score , all of which the composer implemented . The orchestra , drawn mainly from the Concerts Colonne in Paris , comprised 99 players , much larger than normally employed at the theatre , and had difficulty fitting into the orchestra pit . 
 After the first part of the ballet received two full orchestral rehearsals in March , Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo . Rehearsals resumed when they returned ; the unusually large number of rehearsals — seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers — were fit into the fortnight before the opening , after Stravinsky 's arrival in Paris on 13 May . The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score , saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly . According to Doris Monteux , " The musicians thought it absolutely crazy " . At one point — a climactic brass fortissimo — the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound , causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily . 
 The role of the sacrificial victim was to have been danced by Nijinsky 's sister , <unk> <unk> ; when she became pregnant during rehearsals , she was replaced by the then relatively unknown Maria Piltz .

 = = = Premiere = = = 
 Paris 's Théâtre des Champs @-@ Élysées was a new structure , which had opened on 2 April 1913 with a programme celebrating the works of many of the leading composers of the day . The theatre 's manager , Gabriel Astruc , was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season , and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25 @,@ 000 francs per performance , double what he had paid the previous year . The programme for 29 May 1913 , as well as the Stravinsky premiere , included Les Sylphides , Weber 's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin 's Polovtsian Dances . Ticket sales for the evening , ticket prices being doubled for a premiere , amounted to 35 @,@ 000 francs . Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere , in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests . According to Stravinsky all went peacefully . However , the critic of L 'Écho de Paris , Adolphe <unk> , foresaw possible trouble ; he wondered how the public would receive the work , and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked . 
 On the evening of 29 May the theatre was packed . Gustav <unk> reported , " Never ... has the hall been so full , or so resplendent ; the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear " . The evening began with Les Sylphides , in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles . The Rite followed . Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction , and grew into a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in " Augurs of Spring " . But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts , " it was not Stravinsky 's music that did the shocking . It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky . " Marie Rambert , who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky , recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage . In his autobiography , Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him , and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings . The demonstrations , he says , grew into " a terrific uproar " which , along with the on @-@ stage noises , drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers . The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement , and " began to beat rhythmically on top of my head " , though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first , his own emotion being so great . 
 At that time , a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups : the wealthy and fashionable set , who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music , and a " Bohemian " group who , the poet @-@ philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted , would " acclaim , right or wrong , anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes " . Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other , but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra : " Everything available was tossed in our direction , but we continued to play on " . Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected — possibly with the intervention of the police , although this is uncorroborated . Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption . Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II , and by some accounts Maria Piltz 's rendering of the final " Sacrificial Dance " was watched in reasonable silence . At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers , for Monteux and the orchestra , and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening 's programme continued . 
 Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro 's critic , Henri <unk> , who called the work " a laborious and puerile barbarity " and added " We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure " . On the other hand , Gustav <unk> , writing in the leading theatrical magazine <unk> , thought the performance was superb , especially that of Maria Piltz ; the disturbances , while deplorable , were merely " a rowdy debate " between two ill @-@ mannered factions . Emile <unk> , of Les <unk> , who had barely heard the music , wrote : " Couldn 't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well @-@ intentioned spectators ? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element " . The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky 's choreography rather than at the music , a view shared by the critic Michel @-@ Dimitri Calvocoressi , who wrote : " The idea was excellent , but was not successfully carried out " . Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer — unlike , he said , the premiere of Debussy 's Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902 . Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint @-@ Saëns had stormed out of the premiere , Stravinsky observed that this was impossible ; Saint @-@ Saëns did not attend . Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau 's story that , after the performance , Stravinsky , Nijinsky , Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took a cab to the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin . Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky , at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome . To Maximilien Steinberg , a former fellow @-@ pupil under Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky 's choreography had been " incomparable : with the exception of a few places , everything was as I wanted it " . 
 = = = Initial run and early revivals = = = 
 The premiere was followed by five further performances of The Rite at the Théâtre des Champs @-@ Élysées , the last on 13 June . Although these occasions were relatively peaceful , something of the mood of the first night remained ; the composer Puccini , who attended the second performance on 2 June , described the choreography as ridiculous and the music cacophonous — " the work of a madman . The public hissed , laughed – and applauded " . Stravinsky , confined to his bed by typhoid fever , did not join the company when it went to London for four performances at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane . Reviewing the London production , The Times critic was impressed how different elements of the work came together to form a coherent whole , but was less enthusiastic about the music itself , opining that Stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm : " If M. Stravinsky had wished to be really primitive , he would have been wise to ... score his ballet for nothing but drums " . The ballet historian Cyril Beaumont commented on the " slow , uncouth movements " of the dancers , finding these " in complete opposition to the traditions of classical ballet " . 
 After the opening Paris run and the London performances , events conspired to prevent further stagings of the ballet . Nijinsky 's choreography , which Kelly describes as " so striking , so outrageous , so frail as to its preservation " , did not appear again until attempts were made to reconstruct it in the 1980s . On 19 September 1913 Nijinsky married <unk> de <unk> while the Ballets Russes was on tour without Diaghilev in South America . When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married , and dismissed Nijinsky . Diaghilev was then obliged to re @-@ hire Fokine , who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph Faune . Fokine made it a condition of his re @-@ employment that none of Nijinsky 's choreography would be performed . In a letter to the art critic and historian Alexandre Benois , Stravinsky wrote , " [ T ] he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance and , still more important , of again seeing this offspring of mine " . 
 With the disruption following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and the dispersal of many artistes , Diaghilev was ready to re @-@ engage Nijinsky as both dancer and choreographer , but Nijinsky had been placed under house arrest in Hungary as an enemy Russian citizen . Diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in the United States , but the dancer 's mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917 . In 1920 , when Diaghilev decided to revive The Rite , he found that no one now remembered the choreography . After spending most of the war years in Switzerland , and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 Russian Revolution , Stravinsky resumed his partnership with Diaghilev when the war ended . In December 1920 Ernest Ansermet conducted a new production in Paris , choreographed by Léonide Massine , with the Nicholas Roerich designs retained ; the lead dancer was Lydia Sokolova . In his memoirs , Stravinsky is equivocal about the Massine production ; the young ballet @-@ master , he writes , showed " unquestionable talent " , but there was something " forced and artificial " in his choreography , which lacked the necessary organic relationship with the music . Sokolova , in her later account , recalled some of the tensions surrounding the production , with Stravinsky , " wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred Chosen Virgins , <unk> [ ing ] up and down the centre aisle " while Ansermet rehearsed the orchestra . 
 = = = Later choreographies = = = 
 The ballet was first shown in the United States on 11 April 1930 , when Massine 's 1920 version was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski , with Martha Graham dancing the role of the Chosen One . The production moved to New York , where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive , a sign , he thought , that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously . The first American @-@ designed production , in 1937 , was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton , whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances . 
 In 1944 Massine began a new collaboration with Roerich , who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which Massine brought to fruition at La Scala , Milan in 1948 . This heralded a number of significant postwar European productions . Mary <unk> in Berlin ( 1957 ) followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice , as did Maurice Béjart in Brussels ( 1959 ) . Béjart ' s representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as " ceremonial coitus " . The Royal Ballet 's 1962 production , choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan and designed by Sidney Nolan , was first performed on 3 May and was a critical triumph . It has remained in the company 's repertoire for more than 50 years ; after its revival in May 2011 the Daily Telegraph 's critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet 's greatest achievements . Moscow first saw The Rite in 1965 , in a version choreographed for the Bolshoi Ballet by Natalia <unk> and Vladimir Vasiliev . This production was shown in Leningrad four years later , at the Maly Opera Theatre , and introduced a storyline that provided the Chosen One with a lover who wreaks vengeance on the elders after the sacrifice . Johnson describes the production as " a product of state atheism ... Soviet propaganda at its best " . 
 In 1975 Pina Bausch , who had taken over the Wuppertal ballet company , caused a stir in the ballet world with her stark depiction , played out on an earth @-@ covered stage , in which the Chosen One is sacrificed to gratify the misogyny of the surrounding men . At the end , according to The Guardian 's Luke Jennings , " the cast is sweat @-@ streaked , filthy and audibly panting " . Part of this dance appears in the movie Pina . In America , in 1980 , Paul Taylor used Stravinsky 's four @-@ hand piano version of the score as the background for a scenario based on child murder and gangster film images . In February 1984 Martha Graham , in her 90th year , resumed her association with The Rite by choreographing a new production at New York 's State Theater . The New York Times critic declared the performance " a triumph ... totally elemental , as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony , as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implication " . 
 On 30 September 1987 , the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles performed The Rite based on a reconstruction of Nijinsky 's 1913 choreography , until then thought lost beyond recall . The performance resulted from years of research , primarily by Millicent Hodson , who pieced the choreography together from the original prompt books , contemporary sketches and photographs , and the recollections of Marie Rambert and other survivors . Hodson 's version has since been performed by the Kirov Ballet , at the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and later that year at Covent Garden . In its 2012 – 13 season the Joffrey Ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues , including the University of Texas on 5 – 6 March 2013 , the University of Massachusetts on 14 March 2013 , and with The Cleveland Orchestra on 17 – 18 August 2013 . 
 The music publishers Boosey and Hawkes have estimated that since its premiere , the ballet has been the subject of at least 150 productions , many of which have become classics and have been performed worldwide . Among the more radical interpretations is Glen Tetley 's 1974 version , in which the Chosen One is a young male . More recently there have been solo dance versions devised by <unk> <unk> and Javier de Frutos , a punk rock interpretation from Michael Clark , and Rites ( 2008 ) , by The Australian Ballet in conjunction with <unk> Dance Theatre , which represents Aboriginal perceptions of the elements of earth , air , fire and water . 
 = = = Concert performances = = = 
 On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance ( the music without the ballet ) , in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky . On 5 April that year , Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work , at the Casino de Paris . After the performance , again under Monteux , the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers . The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921 , at the Queen 's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens . Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922 , when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme . Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall , as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra . 
 Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926 , in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam ; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton . Of these occasions he later wrote that " thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted , as I wanted it " . Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage ; many of Stravinsky 's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind . The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras , and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as " the most important piece of music of the 20th century " . 
 In 1963 , 50 years after the premiere , Monteux ( then aged 88 ) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London 's Royal Albert Hall . According to Isaiah Berlin , a close friend of the composer , Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being " murdered by that frightful butcher " . Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening 's performance of Mozart 's opera The Marriage of Figaro , at Covent Garden . Under pressure from his friends , Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act . He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending ; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware , wildly cheering audience . Monteux 's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion , recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that " Monteux , almost alone among conductors , never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it , and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity " .

 Commentators have often described The Rite 's music in vivid terms ; Paul Rosenfeld , in 1920 , wrote of it " pound [ ing ] with the rhythm of engines , whirls and spirals like screws and fly @-@ wheels , grinds and shrieks like laboring metal " . In a more recent analysis , The New York Times critic Donal Henahan refers to " great crunching , snarling chords from the brass and thundering thumps from the timpani " . The composer Julius Harrison acknowledged the uniqueness of the work negatively : it demonstrated Stravinsky 's " abhorrence of everything for which music has stood these many centuries ... all human endeavour and progress are being swept aside to make room for hideous sounds ... " 
 In The Firebird , Stravinsky had begun to experiment with bitonality ( the use of two different keys simultaneously ) . He took this technique further in Petrushka , but reserved its full effect for The Rite where , as the analyst E.W. White explains , he " pushed [ it ] to its logical conclusion " . White also observes the music 's complex metrical character , with combinations of duple and triple time in which a strong irregular beat is emphasised by powerful percussion . The music critic Alex Ross has described the irregular process whereby Stravinsky adapted and absorbed traditional Russian folk material into the score . He " proceeded to pulverize them into motivic bits , pile them up in layers , and reassemble them in <unk> collages and montages " . 
 The duration of the work is about 35 minutes . The score calls for one piccolo , three flutes ( third doubling second piccolo ) , one alto flute , four oboes ( fourth doubling second English horn ) , English horn , three clarinets in B ♭ and A ( third doubling second bass clarinet ) , clarinet in E ♭ and D , one bass clarinet , four bassoons ( fourth doubling second contrabassoon ) , one contrabassoon ; eight horns ( seventh and eighth doubling tenor Wagner tubas ) , trumpet in D , four trumpets in C ( fourth doubling bass trumpet in E ♭ ) , two trombones , one bass trombone , two bass tubas ; a percussion section with 5 timpani ( requiring two players ) , bass drum , tam @-@ tam , triangle , tambourine , cymbals , antique cymbals in A ♭ and B ♭ , güiro ; and strings . Despite the large orchestra , much of the score is written chamber @-@ fashion , with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles . 
 = = = Part I : The Adoration of the Earth = = = 
 The opening melody is played by a solo bassoon in a very high register , which renders the instrument almost unidentifiable ; gradually other woodwind instruments are sounded and are eventually joined by strings . The sound builds up before stopping suddenly , Hill says , " just as it is bursting ecstatically into bloom " . There is then a reiteration of the opening bassoon solo , now played a semitone lower . 
 The first dance , " Augurs of Spring " , is characterised by a repetitive stamping chord in the horns and strings , based on E @-@ flat superimposed on a triad of E , G @-@ sharp and B. White suggests that this <unk> combination , which Stravinsky considered the focal point of the entire work , was devised on the piano , since the constituent chords are comfortable fits for the hands on a keyboard . The rhythm of the stamping is disturbed by Stravinsky 's constant shifting of the accent , on and off the beat , before the dance ends in a collapse , as if from exhaustion . The " Ritual of Abduction " which follows is described by Hill as " the most terrifying of musical hunts " . It concludes in a series of flute trills that usher in the " Spring Rounds " , in which a slow and laborious theme gradually rises to a dissonant fortissimo , a " ghastly caricature " of the episode 's main tune . 
 Brass and percussion predominate as the " Ritual of the Rival Tribes " begins . A tune emerges on tenor and bass tubas , leading after much repetition to the entry of the Sage 's procession . The music then comes to a virtual halt , " bleached free of colour " ( Hill ) , as the Sage blesses the earth . The " Dance of the Earth " then begins , bringing Part I to a close in a series of phrases of the utmost vigour which are abruptly terminated in what Hill describes as a " blunt , brutal amputation " . 
 = = = Part II : The Sacrifice = = = 
 Part II has a greater cohesion than its predecessor . Hill describes the music as following an arc stretching from the beginning of the Introduction to the conclusion of the final dance . Woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout the Introduction , which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes . The transition into the " Mystic Circles " is almost imperceptible ; the main theme of the section has been prefigured in the Introduction . A loud repeated chord , which Berger likens to a call to order , announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim . The " Glorification of the Chosen One " is brief and violent ; in the " <unk> of the Ancestors " that follows , short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls . The " Ritual Action of the Ancestors " begins quietly , but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into the quiet phrases that began the episode . 
 The final transition introduces the " Sacrificial Dance " . This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I , though it contains some wild moments , with the large percussion section of the orchestra given full voice . Stravinsky had difficulties with this section , especially with the final bars that conclude the work . The abrupt ending displeased several critics , one of whom wrote that the music " suddenly falls over on its side " . Stravinsky himself referred to the final chord disparagingly as " a noise " , but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite the section , was unable to produce a more acceptable solution . 
 = = Influence and adaptations = = 
 The music historian Donald Jay Grout has written : " The Sacre is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century ... it had the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before " . The academic and critic Jan <unk> , echoing Bernstein , calls it one of the 20th century 's most influential compositions , providing " endless stimulation for performers and listeners " . According to Kelly the 1913 premiere might be considered " the most important single moment in the history of 20th century music " , and its repercussions continue to reverberate in the 21st century . Ross has described The Rite as a prophetic work , presaging the " second avant @-@ garde " era in classical composition — music of the body rather than of the mind , in which " [ m ] <unk> would follow the patterns of speech ; rhythms would match the energy of dance ... sonorities would have the hardness of life as it is really lived " . 
 Among 20th @-@ century composers most influenced by The Rite is Stravinsky 's near contemporary , Edgard Varèse , who had attended the 1913 premiere . Varèse , according to Ross , was particularly drawn to the " cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms " of The Rite , which he employed to full effect in his concert work <unk> ( 1921 ) , scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion 's roar and a wailing siren . Aaron Copland , to whom Stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former 's student days , considered The Rite a masterpiece that had created " the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord " . Copland adopted Stravinsky 's technique of composing in small sections which he then shuffled and rearranged , rather than working through from beginning to end . Ross cites the music of Copland 's ballet Billy the Kid as coming directly from the " Spring Rounds " section of The Rite . For Olivier Messiaen The Rite was of special significance ; he constantly analysed and expounded on the work , which gave him an enduring model for rhythmic drive and assembly of material . 
 After the premiere the writer Leon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time , suitable to be heard in 1940 . Coincidentally , it was in that year that Walt Disney released Fantasia , an animated feature film using music from The Rite and other classical compositions , conducted by Stokowski . The Rite segment of the film depicted the Earth 's prehistory , leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs . Among those impressed by the film was Gunther Schuller , later a composer , conductor and jazz scholar . The Rite of Spring sequence , he says , overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music : " I hope [ Stravinsky ] appreciated that hundreds — perhaps thousands — of musicians were turned onto The Rite of Spring ... through Fantasia , musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work , or at least not until many years later " . In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation , though as Ross remarks , he said nothing critical at the time ; according to Ross , the composer Paul Hindemith observed that " Igor appears to love it " . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Before the first gramophone disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929 , Stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company . He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel , with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium . The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921 ; the British <unk> Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990 . 
 In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first orchestral gramophone recording of The Rite . While Stravinsky led L <unk> des Concerts <unk> in a recording for the Columbia label , at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label . Stokowski 's version followed in 1930 . Stravinsky made two more recordings , in 1940 and 1960 . According to the critic Edward Greenfield , Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but , Greenfield says , in the 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra the composer inspired a performance with " extraordinary thrust and resilience " . In conversations with Robert Craft , Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of The Rite made in the 1960s . He thought Herbert von Karajan 's 1963 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic , was good , but " the performance is ... too polished , a pet savage rather than a real one " . Stravinsky thought that Pierre Boulez , with the Orchestre National de France ( 1963 ) , was " less good than I had hoped ... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations " . He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra for making the music sound Russian , " which is just right " , but Stravinsky 's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving . 
 As of 2013 there were well over 100 different recordings of The Rite commercially available , and many more held in library sound archives . It has become one of the most recorded of all 20th century musical works . 
 = = Editions = = 
 The first published score was the four @-@ hand piano arrangement ( Edition Russe de Musique , <unk> ) , dated 1913 . Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914 . After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky , who had not heard the music for seven years , made numerous revisions to the score , which was finally published in 1921 ( Edition Russe de Musique , RV 197 / <unk> large and pocket scores ) . 
 In 1922 Ansermet , who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin , sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score . In 1926 , as part of his preparation for that year 's performance with the Concertgebouw Orchestra , Stravinsky rewrote the " <unk> of the Ancestors " section and made substantial changes to the " Sacrificial Dance " . The extent of these revisions , together with Ansermet 's recommendations , convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary , and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929 . It did not , however , incorporate all of Ansermet 's amendments and , confusingly , bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition , making the new edition hard to identify . 
 Stravinsky continued to revise the work , and in 1943 rewrote the " Sacrificial Dance " . In 1948 Boosey and Hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score ( B & H <unk> ) , although Stravinsky 's substantial 1943 amendment of the " Sacrificial Dance " was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed , to the composer 's disappointment . He considered it " much easier to play ... and superior in balance and sonority " to the earlier versions . A less musical motive for the revisions and corrected editions was copyright law . The composer had left Galaxy Music Corporation ( agents for Editions Russe de la Musique , the original publisher ) for Associated Music Publishers at the time , and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match the full work and the revised Sacrificial Dance ; moreover , the revised dance could only be published in America . The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America , where it had lapsed , but Boosey ( who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue ) did not have the rights to the revised finale . 
 The 1929 score as revised in 1948 forms the basis of most modern performances of The Rite . Boosey and Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965 , and produced a newly engraved edition ( B & H <unk> ) in 1967 . The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 ( B & H <unk> ) and a revised piano version , incorporating the 1929 revisions , in 1967 . 
 The Paul Sacher Foundation , in association with Boosey and Hawkes , announced in May 2013 , as part of The Rite 's centenary celebrations , their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score , as used in early performances . After being kept in Russia for decades , the autograph score was acquired by Boosey and Hawkes in 1947 . The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962 , on his 80th birthday . After the composer 's death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the Paul Sacher Foundation . As well as the autograph score , they have published the manuscript piano four @-@ hands score . 
 In 2000 , Kalmus Music Publishers brought out an edition where former Philadelphia Orchestra librarian Clint <unk> made over 21 @,@ 000 corrections to the score and parts . Since then a published errata list has added some 310 more corrections , and this is considered to be the most accurate version of the work as of 2013 .

 Milford Haven ( / <unk> <unk> / ; Welsh : <unk> , meaning " mouth of the two Rivers Cleddau " ) is a town and community in Pembrokeshire , Wales . It is situated on the north side of the Milford Haven Waterway , an estuary forming a natural harbour that has been used as a port since the Middle Ages . The town was founded in 1790 on the north side of the Waterway , from which it takes its name . Designed to a grid pattern , it was originally intended by the founder , Sir William Hamilton , to be a whaling centre , though by 1800 it was developing as a Royal Navy dockyard which it remained until the dockyard was transferred to Pembroke in 1814 . It then became a commercial dock , with the focus moving in the 1960s , after the construction of an oil refinery built by the Esso Company , to logistics for fuel oil and liquid gas . By 2010 the town 's port has become the fourth largest in the United Kingdom in terms of tonnage , and plays an important role in the United Kingdom 's energy sector with several oil refineries and one of the biggest LNG terminals in the world . 
 Milford is the second largest settlement in Pembrokeshire , with a population of 12 @,@ 830 ; while the 13 @,@ 086 people in its community boundaries make it the most populous in the county . As a Welsh local government community , Milford takes in the town of Milford itself and its suburbs , including Hakin , Hubberston , <unk> , and Steynton . The total population of the 6 electoral wards in question was 13 @,@ 907 at the 2011 census . 
 The natural harbour of the Haven was known as a safe port and was exploited for several historical military operations throughout the second millennium . Campaigns conducted from the Haven included part of Henry II 's Invasion of Ireland in 1171 and Cromwell 's own attack on Ireland in 1649 , while forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de <unk> 's 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising . In 1485 , Henry VII landed at the Milford Haven Waterway before marching on to England . 
 = = History = = 
 The town of Milford was founded in 1793 , after Sir William Hamilton obtained an Act of Parliament in 1790 to establish the port at Milford , and takes its name from the natural harbour of Milford Haven , which was used for several hundred years as a staging point on sea journeys to Ireland and as a shelter by Vikings . It was known as a safe port and is mentioned in Shakespeare 's Cymbeline as " blessed Milford " . It was used as the base for several military operations , such as Richard de Clare 's invasion of Leinster in 1167 , Henry II 's Invasion of Ireland in 1171 , and Oliver Cromwell 's 1649 invasion of Ireland ; while forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de <unk> 's 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising and Henry VII 's 1485 landing at the waterway before marching on England . By the late 18th century the two local creeks were being used to load and unload goods , and surrounding settlements were established , including the medieval chapel , and Summer Hill Farm , the only man @-@ made structures on the future site of Milford . 
 Sir William Hamilton , the town 's founder , had acquired the land from his wife , Catherine Barlow of <unk> . His nephew , the Hon. Charles Francis Greville , invited seven Quaker families from Nantucket and Martha 's Vineyard to settle in the new town and develop a whaling fleet , In 1800 , following the bankruptcy of the shipbuilding contractor Jacobs & Sons , who had established their shipyard there in 1797 , he persuaded the Navy Board 's overseer , Jean @-@ Louis <unk> , to lease the site for the Navy Board and develop a dockyard for building warships . Seven royal vessels were eventually launched from the dockyard , including HMS Surprise and HMS Milford . The town was built on a grid pattern , thought to have been to the design of Jean @-@ Louis Barrallier , who remained in charge of shipbuilding there for the Navy Board . Between 1801 and 1803 , the town and waterway were protected by temporary batteries at Hakin Point and south of St Katherine 's Church , in response to the perceived threat following the Fishguard Invasion . 
 A church was consecrated in October 1808 and dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria in the underdeveloped eastern side of the town , it remained a chapel of ease until 1891 when Milford became a parish , until that time competing with St Peter and St <unk> in Steynton . By the start of the 19th century , a mail coach was operating between London and Hubberston , and in 1800 the short lived Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank was established by Thomas Phillips , operating from a branch in the town . It collapsed in 1810 . 
 In 1814 the Royal Dockyard was transferred to Pembroke Dock ; though , when Robert Fulke Greville inherited the estate in 1824 , a commercial dock was started which became the home of a successful fishing industry . By 1849 , the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building , and by 1906 , Milford had become the sixth largest fishing port in the UK , and its population rose . The Pembrokeshire Herald claimed in 1912 that " the fish trade is Milford 's sole industry .... the population of the town has doubled by means of it " . 
 In 1863 , the railway network came to Milford , linking it to the Haverfordwest line and beyond . In 1866 , work was completed on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and ship @-@ breaking yard on the eastern side of the town . Between 1875 and 1886 The Great Eastern was a permanent fixture at Milford Docks , remaining there for lengthy repairs . Her arrival into the docks was heralded as an example of the scale of vessel which the town could expect to attract . 
 In the late 1850s , work began on a network of forts on both sides of the Milford Haven estuary , as a direct result of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom . They were designed with the intention of defending the United Kingdom against French invasion , although were never used for this purpose . Notable examples in the town were Fort <unk> in Gelliswick and <unk> Fort to the north east of the town . 
 By 1901 , the town 's population had reached 5 @,@ 102 , and by 1931 had further doubled to 10 @,@ 104 . The early twentieth century saw a period of increased urbanization of the area ; in the period from the First World War to 1937 , 312 council houses were built , and public services , such as electricity supplies and sewerage , were completed . The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed , and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace , at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station . 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath . 
 During the Second World War Milford Haven was chosen as a base for allied American troops , and roughly 1 @,@ 000 American military personnel were housed in the town at this time . They manned an amphibious base which included a hospital built in Hakin and a docks complex at Newton Noyes . The base had a complement of 71 officers and 902 enlisted men , and played a rôle in preparations for D Day . Despite its strategic importance as the home of a large fish market , a mines depot , a flax factory , and housing numerous military personnel , Milford escaped serious damage from German bombings during the Second World War . In the summer of 1941 a bomb fell in fields near Priory Road , and later that year , a bomb damaged a house in Brooke Avenue . In neither instance were there casualties . 
 In 1960 , the Esso Company completed work on an oil refinery near the town , which opened despite environmental objections . This was followed by similar developments by many other chief oil companies in a 10 @-@ year period . In 1974 , Milford could boast an oil trade of 58 @,@ 554 @,@ 000 tons , which was three times the combined trade of all the other ports of Wales . In 1996 the area hit the headlines internationally when the oil tanker Sea Empress ran aground , causing a substantial oil spill . By the early 1980s , the Esso refinery was the second largest in the UK . 
 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Milford Haven is an Anglicization of an old Scandinavian name " <unk> " that was first applied to the waterway – the Old Norse <unk> , meaning sandbank , and <unk> , meaning <unk> or inlet , developing into " Milford " ; then later the term " Haven " from the Germanic word Haven for port or harbour was added . The town was named Milford after the waterway , and , as with the waterway , Haven was added later – in this case around 1868 , when the railway terminus was built . The Welsh for Milford Haven , " <unk> " , refers to the estuary which is the meeting point of the " White River Cleddau " ( Afon Cleddau Wen ) and the " Black River Cleddau " ( Afon Cleddau Ddu ) . The term " Aber " is associated with the ' pouring out ' of a river , hence the description of the two rivers meeting and forming an estuary . Cleddau itself may make reference to the action of a weapon or tool cutting through the land . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The town of Milford Haven lies on the north bank of the Milford Haven waterway , which is a ria or drowned valley . This is a landscape of low @-@ lying wooded shorelines , creeks and mudflats . There has been a great deal of loss and degradation of local mudflat habitat as a result of industrial and commercial development – one study indicated a 45 per cent loss in Hubberston Pill . 
 The town itself has a historic late 18th and 19th centuries core based on a grid pattern , located between Hubberston Pill and Castle Pill and extending inland for 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) . Milford Haven 's 20th century expansion took in several other settlements . Hakin and Hubberston are older , and situated to the west of the main town . Steynton is a medieval village to the north , no longer separated due to the expansion of houses . Lower Priory , with the remains of a very early religious Priory , is located in a natural valley near the village of Thornton . 
 Milford Haven enjoys a mild climate . Its proximity to the coast contributes to wet winters , but it enjoys a generous amount of sunshine with around 1 @,@ 800 hours of sunshine a year being recorded for the nearby village of Dale . This is comparable to the South Coast of England , and the highest annual average level of sunshine in Wales . The nearest official Met Office weather station is at Milford Haven Conservancy Board .

 The community of Milford Haven covers an area of 1 @,@ 573 hectares ( 6 @.@ 07 sq mi ) and includes the Milford Central , East , Hakin , Hubberston , North and West wards . The community has its own town council . The Lord Mayor is Councillor William Elliott BA <unk> who is serving his first term in office and the Deputy Lord Mayor is Councillor Colin Sharp . These appointments mean that Milford becomes the first town in the UK to appoint both an openly gay Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor The six wards comprising Milford Haven community each elect one councillor to Pembrokeshire County Council . Milford Haven was part of the historic county of Pembrokeshire , abolished in 1974 , which was reconstituted as a unitary authority when local government in Wales was reorganised in 1996 . Between 1974 and 1996 , Milford Haven was part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire district of Dyfed . Milford Haven is part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire National Assembly for Wales constituency and UK Parliamentary constituency . The local Assembly Member is Paul Davies of the Conservative Party and the local Member of Parliament is Stephen Crabb , also a Conservative . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Milford Haven has experienced a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding , fishing , as a railhead and an ocean terminal . At the height of the fishing boom , it was said that " every day was a pay day " . In 1921 , 674 people were identified as working in the fishing industry , the leading occupation in the town , followed by transport and communication with 600 employees . The development of the oil industry also helped to boost the town 's fortunes . However , the slumps have been just as severe , the area being scheduled as ' distressed ' in the inter @-@ war period . During the 1980s and 1990s , the unemployment rate at times topped 30 % , and the major industry of oil refining created no more than 2 @,@ 000 direct or indirect jobs . Into the new millennium , its fortunes have risen , as can be witnessed in the activity surrounding the LNG terminal , and the new building works which accompanied it and its connection to the controversial South Wales Gas Pipeline . In February 2003 , Pembrokeshire Council granted outline planning permission to <unk> for an LNG storage depot at Waterston , and in March 2004 , an additional site was approved at South Hook for ExxonMobil . International tourism has also increased , with the arrival of transatlantic liners and the revenue they introduce to the town . 2012 saw 3 @,@ 000 cruise passengers from six cruise vessels disembark at Milford , and the Port Authority expected 5 @,@ 000 in 2013 . The waterway transports 25 % of Britain 's requirement for motor fuel , and the port handled 53 million tonnes of shipping in 2008 , making it the largest port in Wales , and the sixth largest in the UK . There are two major commercial centres : Charles Street in the historic town centre , and the Havens Head Retail Park located at the foot of the docks area . In 2012 , it was announced that the Milford waterway was declared an Enterprise Zone by the coalition government , due to its importance to the energy sector . In 2014 , plans by Milford Haven Port Authority were unveiled , which propose a transformation of the docks area into a residential and commercial destination , including hotel accommodation . 
 In November 2014 it was announced that Milford Haven Refinery , a major employer in the area , will be converted into a ' storage and distribution facility ' with a loss of over 300 jobs . 
 Post @-@ war Milford Haven was not considered a promising location for tourism : a 1964 study commissioned by the District Council highlighted the lack of nearby beaches , proximity of the town to heavy industrialization , and a shortage of tourist facilities such as restaurants and hotels . However , in the 1980s , a series of steps to beautify certain parts of the town commenced . The outdoor swimming pool , which had remained disused for some years , was transformed into a water @-@ garden and officially opened in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher . In 1991 , the Tall Ships Race came to Milford , and this coincided with an overhaul of the docks . Subsequently , it was rebranded as a marina , and a number of attractions including cafes , restaurants and retail outlets sprung up . A Tourist Information Centre is located near the retail park and the local museum , in the old custom house , focuses on the maritime history of the area . 
 = = Demography = = 
 By the 1950s , the fishing industry was in decline , and unemployment in the area had reached 11 % . There had been a housing boom however in the years following Second World War . The District Council took advantage of recently lifted restrictions , and built over 1 @,@ 000 new homes to accommodate the rising population . A new wave of hope however arrived with the prospect of a booming oil industry . The industry however was not labour @-@ intensive , and did not provide huge labour opportunities for locals , in the 1970s employing only 2 @,@ 000 workers . " The nature of large construction projects meant that workers were attracted from outside the local area , and the decline of the fishing industry was to a certain extent masked . However , this employment was not permanent . On completing the construction of construction projects such as the Esso refinery and the Cleddau Bridge , those who decided to relocate to the town were faced with what the Preseli District Council called in 1977 " the area 's serious unemployment problem " . 
 Milford Haven is not ethnically diverse , with 96 @.@ 4 % of people identifying themselves as white , compared with 99 @.@ 2 % in 2001 . 92 @.@ 9 % of people in Milford Central ward were born in the UK , and only 3 @.@ 8 % of residents arrived later than 2001 . 96 @.@ 3 % of residents claim English as their first language . 1 @.@ 5 % of residents identify as having religious views other than any denomination of Christianity , including no religion . 
 = = = Welsh language = = = 
 Milford Haven is located within the geographical and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales , which has predominately used English for many centuries . Although it is the most westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border , a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language . In the 2011 census , only 7 @.@ 5 % of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak , read and write the language , in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18 % of the population are able to read , write and speak Welsh , while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40 % of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh . Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008 , when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested ; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Architecture in Milford Haven can be divided into roughly three broad periods of building . The number of buildings which pre @-@ date the town 's official foundation in 1790 are scarce . These include the Medieval priory , and a 12th @-@ century ' beacon chapel ' . 
 The initial phase of construction from the late 18th century is located in the area central to the town , the three parallel streets of Hamilton Terrace , Charles Street And Robert Street . Three @-@ storey Georgian domestic and commercial properties are set along the northern side of the main road through the town , and overlook the harbour and waterway . 
 By the late 19th century , the land directly above this central area was being developed . To house the growing population , rows of terrace houses were built , which slowly encompassed the area north up to Marble Hall Road , and east to Pill , examples including Shakespeare Avenue and Starbuck Road . The Great North Road took a northerly route which sliced this new district in two . Suburban owner @-@ occupied detached and semi @-@ detached properties grew up on land overlooking the waterway and along the course of Steynton Road . Around the start of the 20th century , there was a recognized need to provide accommodation to poorer families . As a result , much former agricultural land was bought , and new Council Housing was built . These were frequently in large estates of houses , such as Howarth Close , Haven Drive and The Glebelands Estate . They transformed previously rural areas into an urban landscape , and considerably increased Milford 's area of housing .

 = = Places of worship = = 
 The people of Milford Haven in 2001 identified themselves as being under 1400 Christian out of near 1900 in total . The earliest known religious building in the area was the Benedictine priory , known as Pill Priory , which was dissolved during Henry VIII 's reign . Other early buildings included the Catholic St. Thomas a Becket chapel , a later ' beacon church ' , built around the 12th century which fell into disrepair but was reconsecrated in the 20th century . 
 The first religious building raised after Milford Haven was founded was St. Katharine 's and St. Peter 's , an Anglican church , it is considered to be the town 's parish church due to its central position within the town and the fact that it was built by Charles Francis Greville the founder of Milford Haven . Other Anglican buildings include St. David 's in Hubberston , St. Mary 's ( 1927 ) and the Church of the Holy Spirit ( 1971 ) in Hakin and St. Peter 's and St. <unk> 's in Steynton . St. David 's is a Norman church and is believed to be the oldest building in Milford to be in regular use . St. Mary 's was built in 1927 largely by funds from the local residents of Hakin . 
 In 2000 , the church of St. <unk> in Hakin closed , leaving one Roman Catholic church in Milford Haven , St. Francis of Assisi on Priory Road . Baptists congregate at North Road Baptist Church which is one of the older religious buildings of the community , built in 1878 . The Friends Meeting House ( Quakers ) , built in 1811 by the original Quaker whalers who were central to the early growth of the town , is in Priory Road . Quakers travel from distances around Pembroke to worship at the Friends House . 
 Members of both the Methodist and United Reformed Churches now worship at Christ Church in Priory Road ( formerly known as Priory Road Methodist Church which was opened in 1902 ) . In recent years the church has drawn together the Methodist Churches in Milford Haven , Hakin Point and Waterston as well as Tabernacle URC to form a new Local Ecumenical Partnership . 
 The building of Tabernacle URC in Charles Street closed in 2011 with the new united congregation moving to their new home in Christ Church . The old Tabernacle building is still used as a place of worship by the local Islamic community in the form of a Mosque . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The main road to the town is the <unk> from Haverfordwest , which connects with the A40 . The town centre 's road system is based on a grid pattern . The route to Hakin and the western side of the town is along the <unk> via Victoria Bridge over the docks . 
 Bus routes passing through the town are operated by independent companies and Pembrokeshire County Council subsidies . Services include a town circular , Haverfordwest , Pembroke Dock and St Davids . National Express operate services to both London and Rochdale via Steynton . 
 The first links to a railway to Milford Haven came through the completion of the South Wales Railway in 1856 . Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port . The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland , but after a failure to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford , ( Neyland ) , which was completed in April 1856 . The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863 , which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway . The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway . Today the town is served by Milford Haven railway station . The station , and all trains serving it , are operated by Arriva Trains Wales on the West Wales Line . It is the terminus , and from here , trains depart every two hours to Manchester Piccadilly via Carmarthen , Swansea , and Cardiff Central .

 State Route 96 ( SR 96 ) is a 6 @.@ 75 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 10 @.@ 86 km ) state highway located within Snohomish County in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway travels east from an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in Paine Field @-@ Lake Stickney through Mill Creek and an intersection with SR 527 to end at SR 9 south of Snohomish . SR 96 was established in 1991 and follows the route of a wagon road constructed by Snohomish County in the late 1880s to connect Snohomish to Seattle . The highway was closed during the Great Coastal Gale of 2007 after a culvert was damaged and its eastern terminus was re @-@ constructed in 2009 to serve increasing volumes of traffic . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 96 begins as 128th Street at a diamond interchange with I @-@ 5 in Paine Field @-@ Lake Stickney , located in suburban Snohomish County south of Everett . The highway travels east and crosses the Interurban Trail and North Creek before turning southeast onto 132nd Street and entering the city of Mill Creek . SR 96 passes north of McCollum Pioneer Park and Henry M. Jackson High School before it intersects SR 527 at the city center . The highway continues east and passes Archbishop Murphy High School before turning northeast onto Seattle Hill Road and ascends the eponymous hill into Silver Firs . SR 96 descends southeast into the Snohomish River valley from <unk> Corner to Rees Corner on 131st Street , ending at an intersection with SR 9 south of Snohomish . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 96 was its western terminus at I @-@ 5 , serving 43 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busy section is its eastern terminus at SR 9 , serving 11 @,@ 000 vehicles .

 Seattle Hill Road and 131st Street have existed since 1885 on their present route as part of a wagon road constructed by Snohomish County connecting Snohomish to Seattle . The highway from Seattle Hill through Mill Creek was completed by the late 1950s and paved in the early 1960s by the county . SR 96 was added to the state highway system and codified in 1991 , traveling east from I @-@ 5 to SR 9 via Mill Creek . Seattle Hill Road was bypassed to the south by Cathcart Way in 2004 , planned by the county government since 1978 to redirect traffic on the two @-@ lane SR 96 . During the Great Coastal Gale in December 2007 , Seattle Hill Road was washed out by a damaged culvert and subsequently closed until late January as WSDOT crews repaired the highway . The eastern terminus of SR 96 , an intersection with SR 9 , was expanded between April 2008 and December 2009 by WSDOT , adding turning lanes and a traffic camera .

It begins at an intersection with Route 138 in Wall and ends when the road <unk> into Hoes Lane in Piscataway . Much of the route is a limited @-@ access freeway , including the entire portion in Monmouth County and the northern end through New Brunswick and Piscataway . The remainder of the route is a multi @-@ lane divided highway . Route 18 was formerly designated as Route S28 , a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 28 through Middlesex and Monmouth Counties . The designation , assigned in the 1927 renumbering , remained until a second renumbering in 1953 . At that point , Route 18 was designated onto the alignment . 
 The route originally ended at Route 27 at the border between Highland Park and New Brunswick , but was extended northward to then @-@ County Route 514 Spur , now County Route 622 , in 1983 . The freeway through New Brunswick was constructed during the 1980s over the Delaware and Raritan Canal location . Route 18 was further extended in 2004 , and presently ends at Hoes Lane in Piscataway . However , construction is underway to extend the route to I @-@ 287 in Piscataway .

The highway heads northward as a four @-@ lane freeway , crossing under Route 138 . Route 18 interchanges with Route 138 westbound and Monmouth Boulevard , a local road in New Bedford . Route 18 then crosses under Monmouth Boulevard and County Route 18 ( Belmar Boulevard ) in the community of <unk> . The route continues through <unk> , and interchanges with Brighton Avenue ( southbound Interchanges 7A and 7B ) . The freeway continues south of the Shark River Golf Course , through Neptune , paralleling Brighton Avenue , and interchanges with Route 33 and County Route 17 at exit 8 . Although signed as exit 8 northbound , the interchange is divided into exits 8A and 8B heading southbound . The roadway crosses into Ocean Township and crosses under County Route 17 ( West Bangs Avenue ) . In Ocean Township , there are exits for Route 66 and Asbury Avenue , Deal Road , and West Park Avenue . Farther north , the highway enters Eatontown . 
 A large interchange near the Naval Weapons Station Earle serves Industrial Way West , County Route 547 ( Wyckoff Road ) , New Jersey Route 36 , Hope Road , the Garden State Parkway , the Tinton Falls interchange ( exit 105 ) , and County Route 38 ( Wayside Road ) . The route continues northwestward into Colts Neck .

 After entering Middlesex County , Route 18 continues north as a freeway , entering Old Bridge Township . After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 ( exit 30 ) , the freeway ends , and the route becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge . The route crosses several roads in this area . It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 ( Old Bridge @-@ Matawan Road ) , but has no northbound interchange to connect with them ; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads . On the southbound side , motorists can use a cloverleaf or <unk> Road . Route 18 then enters East Brunswick , then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615 , which also connects to County Route 527 . 
 Route 18 then continues through the heavily developed commercial corridor of East Brunswick , intersecting with County Route 617 ( <unk> Lane ) and passing near Brunswick Square Mall . After the interchanges with County Routes 535 ( Cranbury Road ) and County Route 606 ( Milltown Road ) , Route 18 intersects West Ferris Street , West Prospect Street , <unk> Lane , and then meets County Route 527 ( the Old Bridge Turnpike ) at <unk> Road . An intersection and partial interchange with Eggers Street and JFK Boulevard is followed by crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike at exit 9 of the turnpike . The road then intersects Tower Center Boulevard before crossing into New Brunswick at Lawrence Brook . 
 The U.S. Route 1 interchange is followed by an intersection at Paulus Boulevard before separating into a local / express configuration and paralleling the Raritan River , passing the former New Brunswick city docks . Local exits include New Jersey Route 172 ( the southern terminus of George Street ) , the Rutgers University boathouse and Elmer B.

 The alignment of Route 18 through Middlesex County from Middlesex to Highland Park was first designated in the 1926 designing of a new highway system as State Highway Route S @-@ 29 , a prefixed spur of New Jersey Route 29 ( U.S. Route 22 ) through Middlesex County . The route followed Washington Avenue in Middlesex and the River Road in Piscataway until terminating at State Highway Route 27 near the Albany Street Bridge in Highland Park . By the time of the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , the route was re @-@ designated as State Highway Route S @-@ 28 . This route was a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 28 in Middlesex , following Raritan Avenue and River Road through Piscataway and Highland Park , joining State Highway Route 27 on a concurrency into New Brunswick , and onto George Street in New Brunswick southward . After New Brunswick , Route S @-@ 28 continued southward through East Brunswick , Old Bridge and <unk> before terminating at State Highway Route 4 ( U.S. Route 9 ) in Matawan . 
 The route was originally designated as an east – west highway , whereas it is now signed north @-@ south . Although Route S @-@ 28 was used for the alignment for nearly three decades , the second state highway renumbering in 1953 eliminated the designation , and Route 18 was designated in place . 
 During the 1950s , as the New Jersey State Highway Department was drawing out plans for an extensive freeway system , freeways were proposed for Route 18 and nearby Route 35 . Route 18 's freeway was to begin in Eatontown and head westward to Old Bridge along the former alignment of State Highway Route 18 prior to the 1953 renumbering , while Route 35 was to be rerouted from its surface alignment and head northward from Seaside Heights to Long Branch on a new freeway . Both plans were endorsed by the Tri @-@ State Transportation Committee in 1962 , and the acquisition for the right @-@ of @-@ ways began almost immediately . The freeways combined were to cost $ 50 million ( 1962 USD ) and be 30 miles ( 48 km ) in total . Both freeways were designed to handle 30 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 vehicles daily . 
 The freeway was completed between Route 138 and Route 33 in 1967 and Route 33 and Deal Road in 1969 . Following this , the Route 35 freeway was cancelled and it became the part of Route 18 south of Eatontown . In 1974 , Route 18 was completed between just south of Normandy Road in Colts Neck and US 9 . A small portion of the freeway between <unk> Road and Normandy Road in Colts Neck was finished in 1977 . Route 18 was built between Wayside Road and <unk> Road in 1978 . The final portion of the Route 18 between Deal Road and Wayside Road was finished in 1988 . 
 = = = Freeway around New Brunswick = = = 
 The proposals for a freeway bypassing New Brunswick began in 1962 , when the New Jersey State Highway Department made plans to construct a new freeway from U.S. Route 1 through New Brunswick to U.S. Route 22 in Bound Brook . The price tag for construction was $ 44 million ( about $ 344 million in 2016 dollars ) and was to head for 8 @.@ 3 miles ( 13 @.@ 4 km ) , accessing the Somerset Freeway , I @-@ 287 and Route 28 before terminating at US 22 . The extension to Bound Brook , however , was canceled in the 1970s because of tight funding . 
 Construction of a new four @-@ lane bridge across the Raritan River ( now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge ) began in the 1960s , but in 1970 , when the environment impact laws came out , construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river . Outside of the bridge , there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick . The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick , abandoned in 1932 . The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of the fears of losing the canal , while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick . 
 In 1977 , the newly formed New Jersey Department of Transportation received a federal grant to construct the Route 18 Freeway from New Street in New Brunswick , across the Raritan and terminating at Middlesex County Route 514 Spur in Piscataway . This 2 @.@ 3 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) portion was completed in 1983 at a cost of $ 40 million ( about $ 95 million in 2016 dollars ) , with a finished bridge and freeway through New Brunswick . 
 In 2005 , construction began on a revamped Route 18 freeway through New Brunswick . The rebuild includes local and express lanes from Route 172 ( George Street ) to the interchange with Route 27 ( Albany Street ) . Conti Enterprises was hired for the project , which was announced complete in August 2009 at a ceremony by governor Jon S. Corzine and Stephen <unk> , the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation . During the construction , the New Street interchange and bridge were demolished and replaced . The area of the Paulus Boulevard intersection was upgraded for accessibility , and a bus stop was installed , but the roadway southbound is still three lanes at the traffic light . In adjacent Elmer Boyd Park a new entranceway and amphitheatre were added . 
 = = = Extension through Piscataway and to Brielle = = = 
 In 2001 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation approved construction of extending the Route 18 Freeway northward from Middlesex County Route 622 ( River Road , former CR 514 Spur ) in Piscataway to a new arterial on the existing Hoes Lane in the Rutgers University campuses . Construction of this segment , designated as Section 2A , built a partial cloverleaf interchange to County Route 622 , a trumpet interchange to Frelinghuysen Avenue ( the access to Busch Campus ) and a partial cloverleaf to County Route 609 ( Metlars Lane ) and Davidson Road . The state acquired 12 homes along the existing Metlars Lane and 30 acres ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land from Rutgers to build the extension . The project cost the state $ 85 million ( 2004 USD ) . 
 The Department of Transportation then planned the extension to Interstate 287 in Piscataway , by upgrading Hoes Lane 's arterial boulevard and its 20 intersections to standards , eliminating and upgrading several traffic lights . At the intersection with Centennial Avenue , Route 18 will turn off Hoes and follow Centennial to Possumtown Road , where it will terminate at Interstate 287 exit 8 . On February 15 , 2012 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on the project , which is to cost $ 28 million and is nearing completion in mid @-@ 2016 . Although NJDOT 's road inventory continues to show Route 18 as ending at Hoes Lane and Buckingham Drive in Piscataway , Route 18 signage has been erected on Hoes Lane and Centennial Ave. between the current terminus and the future one . At least one press release suggested that NJDOT considered Route 18 to extend to Interstate 287 as of April 2016 . 
 There has been scrutiny about the stub end at Exit 6A for Route 138 that was to be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles ( 8 km ) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle . Some of the right @-@ of @-@ way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi @-@ use trail for bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park . In 2001 , the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four @-@ approach interchange between Route 35 , Route 34 and Route 70 , but the project included no hint of the Route 18 Extension . NJDOT is in planning to create a Park & Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway . It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138 . Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot . 
 = = = New exit ramp in Old Bridge Township = = = 
 Construction was slated for the interchange with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge as there is no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18 . The traffic flow along CR 516 ( Old Bridge into Matawan ) and 527 ( Old Bridge into <unk> / Manalapan ) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18 . The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527 . A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527 . Subsequently , County Route 516 's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated . The project would cost over $ 28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010 . As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation . Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road , taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project . There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin .

 = Japanese battleship Nagato = 
 Nagato ( <unk> ) , named for Nagato Province , was a dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during the 1910s . The lead ship of her class , she carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 . The ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Nagato briefly participated in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War in 1937 and was the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during the attack on Pearl Harbor . She covered the withdrawal of the attacking ships and did not participate in the attack itself . 
 Other than participating in the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , where she did not see combat , the ship spent most of the first two years of the Pacific War training in home waters . She was transferred to Truk in mid @-@ 1943 , but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid @-@ 1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft . Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 . She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month . The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her . Nagato was converted into a floating anti @-@ aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties . She was attacked in July 1945 as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN 's last remaining capital ships , but was only slightly damaged . In mid @-@ 1946 , the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads . She survived the first test with little damage , but was sunk by the second .

 Nagato had a length of 201 @.@ 17 meters ( 660 ft 0 in ) between perpendiculars and 215 @.@ 8 meters ( 708 ft 0 in ) overall . She had a beam of 29 @.@ 02 meters ( 95 ft 3 in ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 08 meters ( 29 ft 9 in ) . The ship displaced 32 @,@ 720 metric tons ( 32 @,@ 200 long tons ) at standard load and 39 @,@ 116 metric tons ( 38 @,@ 498 long tons ) at full load . Her crew consisted of 1 @,@ 333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1 @,@ 368 in 1935 . The crew totaled around 1 @,@ 734 men in 1944 . 
 In 1930 , Nagato 's bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a head sea . This increased her overall length by 1 @.@ 59 meters ( 5 ft 3 in ) to 217 @.@ 39 meters ( 713 ft 3 in ) . During her 1934 – 36 reconstruction , the ship 's stern was lengthened by 7 @.@ 55 meters ( 24 @.@ 8 ft ) to improve her speed and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a pagoda mast . She was given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment . These changes increased her overall length to 224 @.@ 94 m ( 738 @.@ 0 ft ) , her beam to 34 @.@ 6 m ( 113 ft 6 in ) and her draft to 9 @.@ 49 meters ( 31 ft 2 in ) . Her displacement increased over 7 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 900 long tons ) to 46 @,@ 690 metric tons ( 45 @,@ 950 long tons ) at deep load . The ship 's metacentric height at deep load was 2 @.@ 35 meters ( 7 ft 9 in ) . In November 1944 , the tops of Nagato 's mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Nagato was equipped with four Gihon geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 80 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 21 Kampon water @-@ tube boilers ; 15 of these were oil @-@ fired while the remaining half @-@ dozen consumed a mixture of coal and oil . The ship could carry 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 600 t ) of coal and 3 @,@ 400 long tons ( 3 @,@ 500 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . The ship exceeded her designed speed of 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) during her sea trials , reaching 26 @.@ 7 knots ( 49 @.@ 4 km / h ; 30 @.@ 7 mph ) at 85 @,@ 500 shp ( 63 @,@ 800 kW ) . 
 Funnel smoke would often choke and blind crewmen on the bridge and in the fire @-@ control systems so a " fingernail " -shaped deflector was installed on the fore funnel in 1922 to direct the exhaust away from them . It was less than effective and the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort during a refit in 1924 . That funnel was eliminated during the ship 's 1930s reconstruction when all of her boilers were replaced by ten oil @-@ fired Kampon boilers , which had a working pressure of 22 kg / cm2 ( 2 @,@ 157 kPa ; 313 psi ) and temperature of 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) . In addition her turbines were replaced by lighter , more modern , units . When Nagato conducted her post @-@ reconstruction trials , she reached a speed of 24 @.@ 98 knots ( 46 @.@ 26 km / h ; 28 @.@ 75 mph ) with 82 @,@ 300 shp ( 61 @,@ 400 kW ) . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges , which increased her capacity to 5 @,@ 560 long tons ( 5 @,@ 650 t ) and thus her range to 8 @,@ 560 nmi ( 15 @,@ 850 km ; 9 @,@ 850 mi ) at 16 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Nagato 's eight 45 @-@ caliber 41 @-@ centimeter guns were mounted in two pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets fore and aft . Numbered one through four from front to rear , the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of − 2 to + 35 degrees . The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute . The turrets aboard the Nagato @-@ class ships were replaced in the mid @-@ 1930s with the turrets stored from the unfinished Tosa @-@ class battleships . While in storage the turrets had been modified to increase their range of elevation to – 3 to + 43 degrees , which increased the gun 's maximum range from 30 @,@ 200 to 37 @,@ 900 meters ( 33 @,@ 000 to 41 @,@ 400 yd ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament of twenty 50 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ centimeter guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure . The manually operated guns had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 500 metres ( 22 @,@ 400 yd ) and fired at a rate of six to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defense was provided by four 40 @-@ caliber 3rd Year Type three @-@ inch AA guns in single mounts . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . The ship was also fitted with eight 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , four on each broadside , two above water and two submerged . 
 Around 1926 , the four above @-@ water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast . They were replaced by eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns in 1932 , fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 meters ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 meters ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers two @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees which gave them a ceiling of 4 @,@ 000 meters ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . 
 When the ship was reconstructed in 1934 – 36 , the remaining torpedo tubes and the two forward 14 cm guns were removed from the hull . The remaining 14 cm guns had their elevation increased to + 35 degrees which increased their range to 20 @,@ 000 meters ( 22 @,@ 000 yd ) . An unknown number of license @-@ built 13 @.@ 2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns in twin mounts were added . The maximum range of these guns was 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) , but the effective range against aircraft was 700 – 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 770 – 1 @,@ 640 yd ) . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute , but the need to change 30 @-@ round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute . 
 The unsatisfactory two @-@ pounders were replaced in 1939 by twenty license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in a mixture of twin @-@ gun and single mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . Additional 25 mm guns were installed during the war ; on 10 July 1944 , the ship was reported to have 98 guns on board . An additional 30 guns were added during a refit in Yokosuka in November . Two more twin 127 mm gun mounts were added at the same time abreast the funnel and her 14 cm guns were removed as she was by then a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt was 305 mm ( 12 in ) thick and tapered to a thickness of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) at its bottom edge ; above it was a strake of 229 mm ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) armor . The main deck armor was 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) while the lower deck was 75 mm ( 3 in ) thick . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face , 230 – 190 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) on the sides , and 152 – 127 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 0 in ) on the roof . The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick , while the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armor plates . The sides of the conning tower were 369 mm ( 14 @.@ 5 in ) thick . 
 The new 41 cm turrets installed during Nagato 's reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones . Face armor was increased to 460 mm ( 18 @.@ 1 in ) , the sides to 280 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) , and the roof to 250 – 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armored deck . These additions increased the weight of the ship 's armor to 13 @,@ 032 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 826 long tons ) , 32 @.@ 6 percent of her displacement . In early 1941 , as a preparation for war , Nagato 's barbette armor was reinforced with 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armor plates above the main deck and 215 mm ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) plates below it .

 When completed in 1920 , the ship was fitted with a 10 @-@ meter ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinder in the forward superstructure ; six @-@ meter ( 19 ft 8 in ) and three @-@ meter ( 9 ft 10 in ) anti @-@ aircraft rangefinders were added in May 1921 and 1923 , respectively . The rangefinders in the second and third turrets were replaced by 10 @-@ meter units in 1932 – 33 . 
 Nagato was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire @-@ control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I , but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925 . It controlled the main and secondary guns ; no provision was made for anti @-@ aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire @-@ control director was introduced in 1932 . A modified Type 14 fire @-@ control system was tested aboard the ship in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 34 . A new anti @-@ aircraft director called the Type 94 that was used to control the 127 mm AA guns was introduced in 1937 , although when Nagato received hers is unknown . The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937 . 
 While in drydock in May 1943 , a Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10 @-@ meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast . On 27 June 1944 , two Type 22 surface search radars were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her mainmast . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Nagato was fitted with an 18 @-@ meter ( 59 ft 1 in ) aircraft flying @-@ off platform on Turret No. 2 in August 1925 . Yokosuka Ro @-@ go Ko @-@ gata and Heinkel HD 25 floatplanes were tested from it before it was removed early the following year . An additional boom was added to the mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y now assigned to the ship . A Hansa @-@ Brandenburg W.33 floatplane was tested aboard Nagato that same year . A catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3 in mid @-@ 1933 , a collapsible crane was installed in a portside sponson , and the ship was equipped to operate two or three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided . The ship now operated Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 . A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft , such as the one Kawanishi E7K that was added in 1939 – 40 . Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943 .

 Nagato , named for Nagato Province , was ordered on 12 May 1916 and laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 28 August 1917 as the lead ship of her class . She was launched on 9 November 1919 by Admiral Katō <unk> , completed on 15 November 1920 and commissioned 10 days later with Captain <unk> Iida in command . Nagato was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sōjirō Tochinai . On 13 February 1921 , the ship was inspected by the Crown Prince , Hirohito . Captain <unk> <unk> relieved Iida on 1 December 1921 . The ship hosted Marshal Joseph Joffre on 18 February 1922 and Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten on 12 April during the prince 's visit to Japan . 
 After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake , Nagato loaded supplies from Kyushu for the victims on 4 September . Together with her sister ship Mutsu , she sank the hulk of the obsolete battleship Satsuma on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in Tokyo Bay in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty . The ship was transferred to the reserve of the 1st Division on 1 December and became a gunnery training ship . In August 1925 , aircraft handling and take @-@ off tests were conducted aboard Nagato . She was reassigned as the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 1 December , flying the flag of Admiral Keisuke Okada . Captain Kiyoshi Hasegawa assumed command of the ship on 1 December 1926 . 
 Nagato was again placed in reserve on 1 December 1931 and her anti @-@ aircraft armament was upgraded the following year . In August 1933 the ship participated in fleet maneuvers north of the Marshall Islands and she began her first modernization on 1 April 1934 . This was completed on 31 January 1936 and Nagato was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . During the attempted coup d 'état on 26 February by disgruntled Army officers , the ship was deployed in Tokyo Bay and some of her sailors were landed in support of the government . In August , she transported 1 @,@ 749 men of the 43rd Infantry Regiment of the 11th Infantry Division from Shikoku to Shanghai during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . Her floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day . Nagato became a training ship on 1 December until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938 . The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940 . She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto issued the code phrase " Niitaka yama nobore " ( Climb Mount Niitaka ) on 2 December 1941 from Nagato at anchor at Hashirajima to signal the 1st Air Fleet ( Kido Butai ) in the North Pacific to proceed with its attack on Pearl Harbor . When the war started for Japan on 8 December , she sortied for the Bonin Islands , along with Mutsu , the battleships Hyūga , Yamashiro , Fusō , Ise of Battleship Division 2 , and the light carrier Hōshō as distant cover for the withdrawal of the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . Yamamoto transferred his flag to the new battleship Yamato on 12 February 1942 . Nagato was briefly refitted 15 March – 9 April at Kure Naval Arsenal . 
 In June 1942 Nagato , commanded by Captain Hideo Yano , was assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway , together with Yamato , Mutsu , Hosho , the light cruiser Sendai , nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships . Following the loss of all four carriers of the 1st Air Fleet on 4 June , Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island , and into a night engagement with his surface forces , but the American forces withdrew and Nagato saw no action . After rendezvousing with the remnants of the 1st Air Fleet on 6 June , survivors from the aircraft carrier Kaga were transferred to Nagato . On 14 July , the ship was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and she became the flagship of the 1st Fleet . Yano was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was replaced by Captain <unk> <unk> nine days later . Nagato remained in Japanese waters training until August 1943 . On 2 August Captain Mikio Hayakawa assumed command of the ship . 
 That month , Nagato , Yamato , Fusō and the escort carrier Taiyō , escorted by two heavy cruisers and five destroyers transferred to Truk in the Caroline Islands . In response to the carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September , Nagato and much of the fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September , having failed to locate them . The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island , and on 17 October , Nagato and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack . The fleet arrived on 19 October , departed four days later , and arrived back at Truk on 26 October . Hayakawa was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November and he was relieved on 25 December by Captain Yuji Kobe . 
 On 1 February 1944 , Nagato departed Truk with Fusō to avoid an American air raid , and arrived at Palau on 4 February . They left on 16 February to escape another air raid . The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island , near Singapore , and the ship became the flagship of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki , commander of Battleship Division 1 , on 25 February until he transferred his flag to Yamato on 5 May . Aside from a brief refit at Singapore , the ship remained at Lingga training until 11 May when she was transferred to Tawitawi on 12 May . The division was now assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa . 
 On 10 June , Battleship Division 1 departed Tawitawi for <unk> in preparation for Operation Kon , a planned counterattack against the American invasion of Biak . Three days later , when Admiral Soemu Toyoda , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Combined Fleet , was notified of American attacks on Saipan , Operation Kon was canceled and Ugaki 's force was diverted to the Mariana Islands . The battleships rendezvoused with Ozawa 's main force on 16 June . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea , Nagato escorted the aircraft carriers Jun 'yō , Hiyō and the light carrier Ryūhō . She fired 41 cm Type 3 Sankaidan incendiary anti @-@ aircraft shrapnel shells at aircraft from the light carrier Belleau Wood that were attacking Jun 'yō and claimed to have shot down two Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers . The ship was strafed by American aircraft during the battle , but was not damaged and suffered no casualties . During the battle Nagato rescued survivors from Hiyō that were transferred to the carrier Zuikaku once the ship reached Okinawa on 22 June . She continued on to Kure where she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns . <unk> on 8 July , Nagato loaded a regiment of the 28th Infantry Division the following day and delivered them to Okinawa on 11 July . She arrived at Lingga via Manila on 20 July . 
 = = = = Battle of Leyte Gulf = = = = 
 Kobe was promoted to Rear Admiral on 15 October . Three days later , Nagato sailed for Brunei Bay , Borneo , to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for " Operation Sho @-@ 1 " , the counterattack planned against the American landings at Leyte . The Japanese plan called for Ozawa 's carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita 's 1st Diversion Force ( also known as the Center Force ) could enter Leyte Gulf and destroy American forces landing on the island . Nagato , together with the rest of Kurita 's force , departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October . 
 In the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October , Nagato was attacked by multiple waves of American dive bombers and fighters . At 14 : 16 she was hit by two bombs dropped by planes from the fleet carrier Franklin and the light carrier Cabot . The first bomb disabled five of her casemate guns , jammed one of her Type 89 gun mounts , and damaged the air intake to No. 1 boiler room , immobilizing one propeller shaft for 24 minutes until the boiler was put back on line . Damage from the second bomb is unknown . The two bombs killed 52 men between them ; the number of wounded is not known . 
 On the morning of 25 October , the 1st Diversion Force passed through the San Bernardino Strait and headed for Leyte Gulf to attack the American forces supporting the invasion . In the Battle off Samar , Nagato engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of Task Group 77 @.@ 4 @.@ 3 , codenamed " Taffy 3 " . At 06 : 01 she opened fire on three escort carriers , the first time she had ever fired her guns at an enemy ship , but missed . At 06 : 54 the destroyer USS Heermann fired a spread of torpedoes at the fast battleship Haruna ; the torpedoes missed Haruna and headed for Yamato and Nagato which were on a parallel course . The two battleships were forced 10 miles ( 16 km ) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel . Turning back , Nagato engaged the American escort carriers and their screening ships , claiming to have damaged one cruiser with forty @-@ five 410 mm and ninety @-@ two 140 mm shells . The ineffectiveness of her shooting was the result of the poor visibility caused by numerous rain squalls and by smoke screens laid by the defending escorts . At 09 : 10 Kurita ordered his ships to break off the engagement and head north . At 10 : 20 he ordered the fleet south once more , but as they came under increasingly severe air attack he ordered a retreat again at 12 : 36 . At 12 : 43 Nagato was hit in the bow by two bombs , but the damage was not severe . Four gunners were washed overboard at 16 : 56 as the ship made a sharp turn to avoid dive @-@ bomber attacks ; a destroyer was detached to rescue them , but they could not be found . As it retreated back to Brunei on 26 October , the Japanese fleet came under repeated air attacks . Nagato and Yamato used Sankaidan shells against them and claimed to have shot down several bombers . Over the course of the last two days she fired ninety @-@ nine 410 mm and six hundred fifty @-@ three 140 mm shells , suffering 38 crewmen killed and 105 wounded during the same time . 
 On 15 November the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 of the 2nd Fleet . After an aerial attack at Brunei on 16 November , Nagato , Yamato , and the fast battleship Kongō left the following day , bound for Kure . En route , Kongō and one of the escorting destroyers was sunk by USS Sealion on 21 November . On 25 November , she arrived at Yokosuka , Japan for repairs . Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery . Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns , which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple 25 mm gun mounts . Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation . Captain Kiyomi Shibuya relieved Kobe in command of Nagato on 25 November . Battleship Division 3 was disbanded on 1 January 1945 and the ship was reassigned to Battleship Division 1 . That formation was disbanded on 10 February and she was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District as a coastal defence ship . Moored alongside a pier , a coal @-@ burning donkey boiler was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted submarine chaser was positioned alongside to provide steam and electricity ; her anti @-@ aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational . On 20 April , Nagato was reduced to reserve and retired Rear Admiral Miki Otsuka assumed command a week later . 
 In June 1945 , all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti @-@ aircraft armament was moved ashore , together with her rangefinders and searchlights . Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1 @,@ 000 officers and enlisted men . On 18 July 1945 , the heavily camouflaged ship was attacked by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral William Halsey , Jr . ' s campaign to destroy the IJN 's last surviving capital ships . Nagato was hit by two bombs , the first 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka , the executive officer , and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting the roof of the conning tower . The second 500 @-@ pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette . It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it , but blew a hole nearly 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) in diameter in the deck above the officer 's lounge , killing 21 men and damaging four 25 mm guns on the deck above . A dud rocket of uncertain size hit the ship 's fantail , but failed to do any significant damage . To convince the Americans that Nagato had been badly damaged by the attack , her damage was left unrepaired and some of her ballast tanks were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom . 
 Captain Shuichi Sugino was appointed as Nagato 's new captain on 24 July , but he was unable to take up his appointment until 20 August . Retired Rear Admiral Masamichi <unk> was assigned as the ship 's interim captain until Sugino arrived . The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1 / 2 August that a large convoy was approaching Sagami Bay and Nagato was ordered to attack immediately . The ship was totally unprepared for any attack , but <unk> began the necessary preparations . The water in the ballast compartments was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16 @-@ inch guns . The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning , but no order to attack ever came because it had been a false alarm . Sailors from the battleship USS Iowa , Underwater Demolition Team 18 , and the high @-@ speed transport USS Horace A. Bass secured the battleship on 30 August after the occupation began and Captain Cornelius Flynn , executive officer of the Iowa , assumed command . Nagato was stricken from the Navy List on 15 September . 
 = = After the war = = 
 The ship was selected to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads , a series of nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid @-@ 1946 . In mid @-@ March , Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok under the command of Captain W. J. Whipple with an American crew of about 180 men supplementing her Japanese crew . The ship was only capable of a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) from her two operating propeller shafts . Her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up . Her consort , the light cruiser <unk> broke down on 28 March and Nagato attempted to take her in tow , but one of her boilers malfunctioned and the ship ran out of fuel in bad weather . The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived on 30 March . Towed at a speed of 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) , the ship reached Eniwetok on 4 April where she received temporary repairs . On her trip to Bikini in May , Nagato reached 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 Operation Crossroads began with the first blast ( Test Able ) , an air burst on 1 July 1946 ; she was 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 1 @,@ 640 yd ) from ground zero and was only lightly damaged . A skeleton crew boarded Nagato to assess the damage and prepare her for the next test on 25 July . As a test , they operated one of her boilers for 36 hours without any problems . For Test Baker , an underwater explosion , the ship was positioned 870 meters ( 950 yd ) from ground zero . Nagato rode out the tsunami of water from the explosion with little apparent damage ; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated . A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive . Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized and sank during the night of 29 / 30 July . 
 The wreck is upside down and her most prominent features are her four propellers , at a depth of 33 @.@ 5 meters ( 110 ft ) below the surface . She has become a scuba diving destination in recent years and The Times named Nagato as one of the top ten wreck diving sites in the world in 2007 .

The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8 , 1986 . It is also a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District . 
 The hotel was named for Timothy Blackstone , a notable Chicago business executive and politician , who served as the founding president of the Union Stock Yards , president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad , and mayor of La Salle , Illinois . The hotel is famous for hosting celebrity guests including numerous U.S. presidents , for which it was known as the " Hotel of Presidents " for much of the 20th century . The hotel is known for contributing the term " smoke @-@ filled room " to political parlance . The hotel fell into disrepair that necessitated closure in 2000 and subsequent renovation . It reopened on March 6 , 2008 after a $ 128 @-@ million renovation and is managed by the Renaissance Hotels division of Marriott International . 
 = = History = = 
 The hotel and the adjacent Blackstone Theatre were built on the site of Timothy Blackstone 's mansion by John and Tracy Drake , sons of Blackstone 's former business partner , the hotel magnate John Drake . John and Tracy Drake also developed the Drake Hotel . Their father had been a director of Blackstone 's Chicago and Alton Railroad . At the time of the opening , the hotel and theatre were located at the southern edge of the Chicago Theatre District at Michigan Avenue and Hubbard Court ( which was first renamed 7th Street and later Balbo Drive ) . 
 The original construction was capitalized at $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( $ 26 @.@ 3 million today ) , including a $ 600 @,@ 000 to $ 750 @,@ 000 bond issue by the Drake Hotel Company . In the 1920s , the Drake Hotel Company undertook some financing arrangements which included extending their debt to construct the Drake Hotel . They used the Blackstone Hotel as collateral for one loan in 1927 . The Wall Street Crash of 1929 rippled into the hotel industry , leaving the Chicago Title and Trust Company with 30 Chicago hotels in receivership and causing the Drakes to default in 1932 . After going into receivership , the hotel closed and was refurbished , but it was reopened in time for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition .

 The Blackstone Hotel has been dubbed " The Hotel of Presidents " . It was once considered one of Chicago 's finest luxury hotels , and a dozen 20th @-@ century U.S. presidents have stayed at the hotel . In addition , the Blackstone has also become part of Chicago 's history as the city that has hosted more United States presidential nominating conventions ( 26 ) than any other two American cities , a history which goes back to the 1860 Republican National Convention hosted at the Wigwam . The hotel has a special room designed for use by presidents which was separated from the rest of the hotel by hollowed out walls in which the Secret Service could operate . In 1911 , Republican businessman and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald — then president of Sears , Roebuck & Company — invited African American educator Booker T. Washington and a few dozen of Chicago 's leading citizens to discuss raising funds for Washington 's Tuskegee Institute . Washington became the hotel 's first African American guest . As a result of the meeting , Rosenwald became a supporter and trustee of Tuskegee , and the following year initiated a campaign to fund the construction and support of schools throughout the South to provide an education to black children , by the time of his death building nearly 5000 schools educating well over half a million African American children . 
 In 1920 , Warren G. Harding was selected as the Republican candidate for the presidency at the Blackstone . Although the convention was being held at the Chicago Coliseum , a group of Republican leaders met at the Blackstone on the night of June 11 to come to a consensus . When Raymond Clapper of United Press reported on the decision @-@ making process , the reporter stated it had been made " in a smoke @-@ filled room " . The phrase entered American political parlance to denote a political process which is not open to scrutiny . 
 In addition , the Blackstone is where Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's third @-@ term Democratic presidential nomination was forged in 1940 , where Harry S. Truman stayed when he received the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and where Dwight D. Eisenhower heard the news of his first @-@ ballot 1952 Republican presidential nomination . In all , guests have included at least 12 U.S. presidents : Theodore Roosevelt , William Howard Taft , Woodrow Wilson , Warren Harding , Calvin Coolidge , Herbert Hoover , Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , and Jimmy Carter . During Kennedy 's visit he was informed of the Cuban Missile Crisis . The hotel was purchased by Sheraton in the 1950s and spent more than twenty years under the name Sheraton @-@ Blackstone Hotel . Despite the hospitality enjoyed by its elite guests , the hotel endured some troubles in the 1960s and 1970s as the neighborhood surrounding the hotel declined .

 The hotel closed in 2000 after Occupational Safety and Health Administration building inspectors found safety problems during a 1999 inspection . The building 's owner , Heaven on Earth Inns Corp , run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , looked into several options before selling the property to Rubloff , Inc . , which in 2001 announced plans to convert the building into condominiums priced as high as $ 8 @.@ 5 million . Rubloff 's plans were unsuccessful due to financing difficulties and a lackluster market for buyers of Blackstone condominiums . Even two rounds of price cuts were not enough to spur interest in the condo opportunities and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 's non @-@ profit organization was unable to obtain financing . 
 The years of neglect following the closing of the hotel took a toll on the building 's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling . In 2005 , it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $ 112 million renovation and acquisition with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International / Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality , a Denver , Colorado @-@ based company . The hotel 's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage . $ 22 million of the expected $ 112 million was the cost associated with the acquisition . Sage sought $ 22 million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission . They eventually were approved for $ 18 million in tax @-@ increment financing . The final cost of the restoration came to $ 128 million , of which the city of Chicago provided $ 13 @.@ 5 million for street @-@ front improvement , including the restoration and recasting of over 10 @,@ 000 pieces of decorative terra cotta , and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark . The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks . 
 Sage had been interested in the property long before the condominium conversion was attempted . The newly restored building retains its historic name ; however , it operates as a Marriott brand under the " Renaissance Hotels " label . Sage uses the Renaissance brand " for hotels that are very unique in terms of location , style , design , or historic values " . The other parties involved in the restoration were local architect Lucien Lagrange and hotel interior design , development , and procurement firm Gettys , for design work . James McHugh Construction Co. was responsible for construction . The engineering firm handling the exterior renovation was Illinois @-@ based Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates , Inc . 
 The restoration resulted in 332 rooms , 12 suites , and 13 @,@ 230 square feet ( 1 @,@ 229 m2 ) of meeting space . The 21 @-@ story hotel is now equipped with a health club , a business center , and a street @-@ level Starbucks cafe with outdoor seating area . As part of the restorations , sconces and chandeliers were restored . Many of the details , such as brass fittings , several of the statues and the original chandeliers , had been sold off . However , Sage was able to repurchase many of them on eBay and <unk> many others . The primary historic facades were fully restored , including the hotel 's ornate terra cotta @-@ clad exterior . All the guest @-@ room floors were reconfigured and dramatically enlarged . Some have described the restoration as " garish " . The hotel also features a hotel within a hotel called Hubbard Place , in honor of Balbo Drive 's former name . It will be a premium service private lounge located in a rooftop area that formerly housed mechanical equipment . 
 Only two guest rooms were preserved during the restoration : the famous ninth @-@ floor " smoke @-@ filled room " and the original tenth @-@ floor presidential suite . They both retained their original floors , fireplaces , and structural shapes . However , the Presidential Suite 's famed hidden passage behind the fireplace — which allowed the president to exit through the hotel 's eastern stairwell unnoticed — has been converted into closet space . Notable features that failed to survive the renovation were a barbershop , which has been converted to a rentable meeting room named " the barbershop " , and the theater , which was converted to the Blackstone 's bar and restaurant . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Blackstone Hotel was designed by architect Benjamin Marshall , of Marshall and Fox , in 1909 . Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building . According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago 's Department of Planning and Development , the hotel 's exterior and interior are considered an excellent example of neoclassical Beaux @-@ Arts architecture ; the nomination form for the building 's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire . However , the two styles are related , and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools . The design was influenced by Marshall 's trip to Paris , after which he completed the hotel . 
 The Blackstone is a 22 @-@ floor rectangular structure and its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing . On the exterior south and east ( front ) elevations is a one @-@ story base of pink granite , with high arched openings ; it supports the red <unk> and terra cotta @-@ trimmed building shaft . Above the granite base are four stories of white , glazed terra cotta . The large windows of the second and third floor , which once poured natural light into the lobby , ballroom , and restaurants , have mostly been covered for a theater . The majority of the building rises as a 12 @-@ story shaft of red brick dotted with white , terra cotta window surrounds ; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick . Above this , the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast iron railing . This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick , flush with the rest of the building . The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter , and 2 very tall flagpoles .

 In addition to its celebrity guests and its contributions to political parlance , the Blackstone has a place in popular culture . Among its uses in cinema , it hosted the banquet where Al Capone smashes a guest 's head with a baseball bat in the Brian De Palma film The Untouchables , a party in The Hudsucker Proxy , and Tom Cruise 's pre @-@ pool tourney stay in The Color of Money . Also , the 1996 – 2000 television series Early Edition was set in this building , featuring a man ( Kyle Chandler ) who lives in the hotel and receives the newspaper a day in advance . During the 1980s and 1990s , the hotel was the home of Joe Segal 's Jazz Showcase , the premiere Chicago host of international jazz stars including Ahmad Jamal , Dizzy Gillespie , ' Swingin ' Conor McHale , Miles Davis , Jay <unk> , and Johnny Griffin , to name only a very few . 
 = Women 's suffrage in Wales = 
 Women 's suffrage in Wales has historically been marginalised due to the prominence of societies and political groups in England which led the reform for women throughout the United Kingdom . Due to differing social structures and a heavily industrialised working @-@ class society , the growth of a national movement in Wales grew but then stuttered in the late nineteenth century in comparison with that of England . Nevertheless , distinct Welsh groups and individuals rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage in Wales and the rest of Great Britain . 
 In the early twentieth century , Welsh hopes of advancing the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , David Lloyd George , one of the most important Welsh politicians of the day . After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to materialise into political change , suffragettes and in particular members of the more militant Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , took a hard line stance towards their Members of Parliament , engaging in direct action against them . 
 Militant action was not a hallmark of the movements in Wales and Welsh members , who more often identified themselves as suffragists , sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means . In 1918 , across the United Kingdom , women over the age of 30 gained the right to vote , followed by the Representation of the People ( Equal Franchise ) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote as men . 
 = = The History of Women 's Suffrage in Wales = = 
 = = = Early Women 's Suffrage in Wales , 1832 – 1884 = = = 
 Women were not explicitly banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act . In England the suffrage movement existed before and after the 1832 act , but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women 's Suffrage in 1872 . Although there were notable exceptions such as the working @-@ class areas of Lancashire , the women 's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle @-@ class movement . In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas . Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low @-@ waged , densely @-@ populated , industrialised valleys of the south . At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction , but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground . The coal mining industry , with its absence of pithead baths , led to unpaid women 's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family 's menfolk clean became a never ending task . This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam , a matriarch of the home , but little could be further from the truth in a society controlled by men . 
 The increase of wealth created by the mining and metalworking industries saw the creation of new upper @-@ class families who often built their wealthy homes in the centre of the community from which they prospered . Whereas the pit and foundry owners were initially men , many of whom had political ambitions , their wives sought more charitable activities often connected to improving the lives of the women and children of their husband 's workers . In Dowlais , the heart of the ironworking industry of Wales , Rose Mary Crawshay , the well @-@ to @-@ do English @-@ born wife of Robert Thompson Crawshay , passed her time in such charitable work . She set up soup kitchens , gave to the poor and established no less than seven libraries in the area , but apart from this work , for which she would be expected to do , she was also a staunch feminist . Living under the rule of a notoriously tyrannical husband , for whom she bore five children , she showed a strong @-@ will and was known in feminist circles in London from the 1850s . In 1866 she and 25 other signatories , all based in Wales , signed the country 's first women 's Suffrage Petition . 
 In June 1870 , Rose Crawshay held a public meeting at her home , probably the first in Wales to discuss women 's suffrage , but she was later taken to task by the local newspaper for disturbing the peace and leading Wales ' women astray . The first suffrage tour of Welsh towns was conducted the following year by Jessie <unk> , who travelled the south of the country visiting Pontypool , Pembroke Dock , Neyland , <unk> and Newport . On 4 March 1872 , Mrs. Crawshay held a second meeting , in Merthyr <unk> , which resulted in a new petition being delivered , the effect of which saw the signing of petitions from Glamorgan , Monmouthshire , Denbighshire and Cardiganshire . Later that year the Bristol & West of England Society for Women 's Suffrage sent two of their members , Caroline Biggs and Lilias Ashworth , on a sponsored speaking tour of south Wales which took in Pontypool , Newport , Cardiff and Haverfordwest . Despite the actions of several prominent Welsh women , such as Lady Amberley and Miss Gertrude Jenner of Wenvoe , no real suffrage movements took hold in the 1870s and the country was reliant on speaking tours from members of English societies , predominantly from Bristol , London and Manchester . 
 On 25 February 1881 , Gertrude Jenner addressed a meeting held in Cardiff Town Hall to " consider means of promoting interest in Cardiff " towards female voting rights . This was a preliminary to a larger meeting that was held on 9 March which was attended by local dignitaries , Miss Jenner , Helen Blackburn and was chaired by the Mayor of Cardiff . Despite there being a great deal of suffrage activity in the lead up to the The Third Reform Act of 1884 , there was little campaigning in Wales during the early 1880s . One act of significant importance that did occur during this period was the decision in late 1884 by the delegates of the Aberdare , Merthyr and Dowlais District Mine Association to support a series of talks by Jeanette Wilkinson on the right of women 's votes . This is the first recorded instance of interest by Welsh working men supporting female suffrage . 
 = = = Suffragist societies in Wales , 1884 – 1906 = = = 
 The publication of the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 , both of which extended suffrage for men in the United Kingdom , led to large @-@ scale political organisation . These combined with the outcome of the Corrupt Practices Act of 1883 , which prevented the payment of <unk> , led to both Conservative and Liberal Parties approaching female supporters to aid them in political campaigning . The Conservatives were first to offer a political role for women in Wales with the opening of branches of the Primrose League , but campaigning for women 's rights was not its priority and merely aimed to ' interest women in politics ' . 
 In response the Liberal Party launched Women 's Liberal Associations which allowed women more freedom to allocate a role and voice for themselves and were not a mere subsidiary of the national party . The organisation of women in the Liberal Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan , Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas . In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women 's Liberal Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting in both English and Welsh . By 1893 there were said to be 7 @,@ 000 members of the Welsh Union of Women 's Liberal Associations which had raised to 9 @,@ 000 by 1895 . At a meeting of the North Wales Liberal Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women 's Liberal Federation would merge with Cymru <unk> , a political pressure group for home rule , to form a new Welsh Liberal Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation . Despite some early successes Liberal organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes , many of the branches had closed by 1907 . 
 = = = Pressure groups = = = 
 1897 saw the foundation of the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies ( NUWSS ) under the leadership of Millicent Fawcett . This was a non @-@ political organisation which was formed out of the seventeen strongest societies throughout England . It took until 1907 before the first branch of the NUWSS was formed in Wales . This occurred during a meeting at the Llandudno Cocoa House which saw Mrs. Walton @-@ Evans become the president of the local cell . Other branches soon began forming across Wales , with the creation of the Cardiff and District branch in 1908 followed by Rhyl , Conwy and Bangor in 1909 . 
 The more militant arm of the suffrage movement , the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , was not strong in Wales . In 1913 it had five branches in Wales compared to 26 for the NUWSS . That said the WSPU had been active in promoting itself in Wales long before this with Emmeline Pankhurst and Mary Gawthorpe holding meetings throughout Wales in 1906 . In 1908 both the WSPU and the NUWSS were active in Pembrokeshire to campaign at a by @-@ election . Their slogan of ' Keep the Liberals Out ' , would not have resonated with the Welsh voters , as in the election of 1906 not a single Tory had won a seat in Wales . Nonetheless , their main political target was Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith who was vehemently opposed to the enfranchisement of women . 
 = = = David Lloyd George and the suffrage movement , 1907 – 1912 = = = 
 Attitudes towards the suffragette movement as a whole were badly affected by militant actions led mostly by members of the WSPU . In July 1908 the Women 's National Anti @-@ Suffrage League ( WNASL ) was inaugurated , with Welsh MP Ivor Guest severing as treasurer . The initial involvement of Ermine Taylor led to a branch of the WNASL being formed in <unk> the following year . Undeterred the pro @-@ suffrage groups continued to take direct action . In Bristol in 1908 , Winston Churchill had been threatened by WSPU members , and the widespread anger after the event led to a Cardiff meeting led by Charlotte Despard being abandoned . In Merthyr the speakers were drowned out and herrings and tomatoes thrown at them . Despite being a ' favoured son of Wales ' and outwardly pro @-@ women 's suffrage , Liberal MP , and from 1908 , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , David Lloyd George was often a target of suffragette activity . Although Lloyd George always stated his support to the suffrage movement in public speeches , the failure of the Liberal Government to make any progress on implementing change led Christabel Pankhurst to believe him to be a secret anti @-@ suffragist . Pankhurst was quoted in the Times in November 1911 declaring " ' Lloyd <unk> ' seemed to be a disease which afflicted men to @-@ day with very few exceptions . But women saw through him . They had always known him as an anti @-@ suffragist , and they must fight him here and now . " Pankhurst 's assumptions had a basis of truth , as a month before Lloyd George had written to the Liberal Party chief whip bemoaning the fact that the forthcoming Conciliation Bill would hand hundreds of thousands of votes to the Tory party . 
 The year 1912 saw a marked increase in militant action in Wales . Anger at the defeat of the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon . The protesters , male and female , were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas . Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod . Just two weeks later one of the most notorious events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place , when Lloyd George returned to his home town of <unk> to open the village hall . No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of ' Votes for Women ! ' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd . One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below . As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident . The local press not only attacked the suffragettes , but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful , Nonconformist , chapel @-@ going Wales . The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women 's suffrage in Wales . 
 = = = March to Victory , 1912 – 1918 = = = 
 As the 1910s unfolded , attitudes hardened on both sides of the emancipation issue . In 1912 the anti @-@ suffrage WNASL was amalgamated into the newly formed National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage ( NLOWS ) , and that year a branch of the NLOWS was established in Bangor . Of the 286 branches of the organisation , 19 were eventually formed in Wales . Two of the most prolific supporters of the NLOWS in Wales were both Members of Parliament ; Ivor Guest ( Cardiff ) and J. D. Rees ( Montgomery ) . 
 In the years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns . In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office . 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non @-@ party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund ( EFF ) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party . Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women ’ s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy . There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central ' English feminist agenda ' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social , cultural and political views . The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914 . 
 In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised , to end with a rally in Hyde Park , London on 26 July . It was an attempt to remind the public of the larger constitutional and non @-@ militant wing of the movement , and routes were planned from 17 British towns and cities , including Wales . Twenty @-@ eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches left from Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support and hostility . A further branch left Cardiff on 7 July . 
 1913 also saw a continuation of more hard @-@ line methods , with the WPSU firebombing a house which was being built for Lloyd George . Between April and September 1913 , hoax bombs were set at both Cardiff and Abergavenny , and at Llantarnam , telegraph wires were cut . This period also saw the actions of one of Wales ' most notable suffragettes , Margaret Haig Mackworth , daughter of MP D. A. Thomas and his activist wife Sybil Thomas . Mackworth had been recruited into the WPSU in 1908 and had been a vocal and active member from that date , later founding the Newport branch of the organisation . In 1913 she was convicted of setting fire to a post box and after refusing to pay the fine was sent to prison at Usk . While imprisoned Mackworth went on hunger strike , but was released under the ' Cat and Mouse Act ' . 
 By 1914 the non @-@ militant elements of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and , although damaged by the bad press violent action brought , they also gained from the publicity . A summer school had been set up by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given . In south Wales signs of working @-@ class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women 's Co @-@ operative Guild , with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews . 
 With the outbreak of the First World War , all WSPU activity came to a halt and the NUWSS turned much of their focus to relief work . The WPSU , reformed as the Women 's Party from 1917 , sent members across Wales , no longer to rally for suffrage but to encourage male volunteers to join the British Army . In 1915 Flora Drummond attended a rally in Merthyr to demand that men leave occupations that women could undertake , and to stop ' hiding behind the petticoats ' . Women in Wales took up employment en masse , especially in newly opened munitions factories , and in 1918 the Newport Shell Factory had a female workforce of 83 per cent while the Queensferry factory was 70 per cent . 
 The militant suffragettes , who were at one point public enemies , were now seen as fierce nationalist and patriots . Old foes became allies and vice @-@ versa . Lloyd George was now referred to as ' that great Welshman ' while Labours ' Kier Hardie , the WSPU 's staunchest defender before the war , was lambasted for his pacifist stance . There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to keep pushing the agenda of emancipation . Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU ( <unk> ) , amongst their members were Conway @-@ born Helena Jones , who continued to campaign for women 's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet . 
 The Representation of the People Act was passed in 1918 which gave women over the age of 30 , who met a property qualification , the right to vote . Several factors led to the passing of the Act , including the efforts of working women , the dilution of anti @-@ suffrage rhetoric and political change in London , where Asquith had been replaced as Prime Minister by Lloyd George . The government believed that six million voters would be added by the 1918 Act , in Wales the electorate rose from 430 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 172 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Legacy - After the Peoples Act 1918 = = = 
 During the First World War , relief work helped keep the women 's societies in Wales active , though membership numbers began to fall . After the People 's act of 1918 , many of the regional branches began to wither . The Llangollen <unk> resolved to disband in December 1918 , handing their marching banner to the National Council , believing their work was done . While others , such as the Newport branch , revised their aims to form a Women 's Citizen Association taking an active interest in welfare and social issues . Other branches continued the political vision of equal suffrage , notably Bangor , while the Cardiff <unk> busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts . The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus , and the first point of order was the bill to admit women as MPs . This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election . There was one female candidacy in Wales , Millicent Mackenzie , a former professor of education from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire , who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat . It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP , Megan Lloyd George , the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister . 
 In 1921 Margaret Mackworth , now the second Viscountess Rhondda , launched the Six Point Group , an action group that focused heavily on the equality between men and women and the rights of the child . Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and emerged as one of the leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter @-@ war period . She established a number of women 's organisations , pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide . She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords , fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women . 
 Equal franchise was eventually won with the passing of the Representation of the People Act 1928 . This was not achieved through a matter of course , but through a constant campaign of organised pressure . The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship ( <unk> ) , taking on a broader range of issues to secure more widespread support . The Women 's Freedom League ( WFL ) , which was formed in 1907 out of schism caused by Emmeline Pankhurst 's desire for a more authoritarian style of leadership within the WSPU , was a vocal advocate of equal rights throughout the 1920s . In 1919 there were four WFL branches in Wales , and , although the Aberdovey and Cardiff branches had disbanded by 1921 , both Montgomery Boroughs and Swansea remained staunchly active throughout the decade .

 The women 's suffrage movement in Wales has historically been held in poor regard with little research undertaken before the end of the twentieth century . Initial impressions of women 's voting rights in the country can appear to suggest apathy or even hostility towards suffrage , but historians such as Kay Cook and Neil Evans writing in 1991 , and built upon by Dr. Kirsti <unk> , argue specific cultural environments led to a more cautious and considered political ideology . The type of militancy advocated by Emmeline Pankhurst 's Women 's Social and Political Union appears to have been rejected by the majority of Welsh suffrage campaigners , especially in the north of Wales , but Cook claims that the origin of this lies in the 1847 governmental " Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales " , commonly known as the Treachery of the Blue Books . 
 In 1846 , after a Parliamentary speech by radical MP William Williams , concerns were raised regarding the level of education in Wales . This resulted in an enquiry carried out by three English commissioners appointed by the Privy Council , none of whom had any knowledge of the Welsh language , Nonconformity or elementary education . The findings of the report were immensely detailed and were damning towards not only the state of education in Wales but drew a very critical picture of the Welsh as a people , labelling them as immoral and backwards . Within its pages Welsh women were labelled as licentious and " cut off from civilising influences by the impenetrable Welsh language " . The report drew questions over the chastity of the poor and was just as damning to the wealthier women of the country ; claiming that English farmers ’ daughters were respectable ; while their Welsh counterparts Wales were in the " constant habit of being courted in bed " . The result of the report led to a concerted effort to ensure that Welsh women would in future be above rebuke , and several Welsh periodicals were launched in the decades following aimed at improving housekeeping and to improve the morality of the Welsh readership . 
 One of the first periodicals to launch after the publication , and in direct response to , the ' Blue Books ' was Y Gymraes ( The <unk> ) . Its editor Evan Jones ( 1820 @-@ 1852 ) known by his bardic name of " <unk> Gwynedd " was seen as a champion of Welsh women following his detailed defence of their morality following the controversy surrounding the Report . Y Gymraes , launched in January 1850 , set out to create the ' perfect ' <unk> , a virtue of morality , sobriety and thrift , a beacon that would see the Welsh nation above all future criticism . As early as the autumn of 1851 , with the health of its editor failing , Y Gymraes was merged with the monthly penny periodical Y <unk> ( The Guide ) , and became Y <unk> a 'r Gymraes in early 1852 . Despite its title the majority of the contributors were men , and the publication continued to emphasise the importance of high moral standards rather than give practical advice . Although the publication continued into the 1880s , it eventually made way for Y <unk> ( The Female Briton ) under the editorship of Sarah Jane Rees . Although these periodicals had their roots in the temperance movement , and many of the articles within their pages were frivolous , by the 1880s they began broaching the topic of female emancipation . 
 Jane Aaron in 1994 described how the desire for Welsh womanhood to be seen as respectable in the eyes of its " colonial " neighbour endured even when their English counterparts had decided to take up an aggressive or ' unwomanly ' mantle to achieve their goals of female emancipation . <unk> builds on this hypothesis stating that the " idealised Welsh woman , inspired by England ’ s middle @-@ class angel of the house , would represent Welsh respectability long after English women had abandoned their haloes in favour of bicycles . " 
 = = How Welsh was Welsh Suffrage = = 
 An argument exists that the women 's suffrage movement in Wales was not truly ' Welsh ' , based on the fact that it was organised and orchestrated by an Anglicised , English @-@ speaking , middle @-@ class movement that had little bearing on the true voice of the country . As it has been shown , the first people to embrace the suffrage movement were English @-@ born and wealthy . Rose Mary Crawshay , was born in Berkshire before moving to Wales after her marriage ; Millicent Mackenzie was born in Bristol and University educated . In addition , the societies that sprang up in the wealthier coastal towns of the north and south were run by middle @-@ class women , normally of English background with little or no understanding of the Welsh language . <unk> Lloyd @-@ Morgan , writing in 2000 , linked support for women 's suffrage from an earlier campaigning group , the temperance movement , and although the temperance movement reached out through Welsh @-@ language periodicals such as Y <unk> and Y Gymraes , she too concluded that the cross @-@ over was " dominated by immigrant middle @-@ class women " . 
 Cook and Evans argue that , despite suffrage in Wales being introduced by a new generation of immigrant middle @-@ class women , there was still a definite ' Welshness ' to the ideology fostered by the nation , which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts . Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution , despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption . In 1911 , after the Women 's Coronation Procession , Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union , a Welsh society based in London . It attempted to link women 's suffrage with Wales and Welshness , and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause . They distributed hand @-@ bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill . The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings . In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill , Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union , which had a more militant policy . Members wore red dragon badges with the motto ' O Iesu , n 'ad <unk> ' ( ' Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness ' ) . 
 Although the suffrage movement in Wales attempted to show a level of independence , it was always following rather than leading a national agenda . It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings , but still relied on a network of now forgotten non @-@ militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level . And , although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh @-@ speaking heartland to its cause , it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England . 
 = = Welsh suffragists = = 
 Due to her family connections and high @-@ profile militant action , Margaret Mackworth , the 2nd Viscountess Rhondda , is probably the most well @-@ known Welsh suffragette . Her mother Sybil Thomas and Merthyr Ironmaster 's wife , Rose Mary Crawshay , were both well connected suffragists whose work is well documented . Millicent Mackenzie and to a lesser extent Amy Dillwyn are remembered more for connections outside the sphere of women 's suffrage , but were both important Welsh activists for the cause . The majority of suffragists either working in Wales or Welsh suffragists who were active outside the country are many but poorly documented . Alice <unk> , a renowned speaker and activist , was the daughter of the High Sherriff of Carmarthenshire . She later became the chairperson of the Federated Council of Suffrage Movements . Rachel Barrett , a science teacher from south Wales , rose to prominence within the WSPU and was chosen by Annie Kenney to assist in running the WSPU national campaign from 1912 . She was also assistant editor of The Suffragette . 
 Trade unionists Vernon Hartshorn and George Barker were vocal supporters of the suffrage movement , while James Grant a socialist propagandist and keen seller of the The Suffragette was imprisoned for five days after being arrested for obstruction while lecturing in Treorchy Square . Mary Keating Hill , a forty @-@ year old wife of a Cardiff insurance manager , spent three weeks in jail for resisting the police and disorderly conduct . She had been given a similar conviction days prior but her brother paid the fine ; but she was determined to be imprisoned . On 21 November 1911 , after the failure of the Conciliation Bill , anger spilled over into direct action and 223 suffragettes were arrested during a campaign of window smashing . Among the arrests were seven women with Welsh connections , including Edith Mansell Moullin , Mildred Mansell , the sister of Ivor Guest , MP , and Janet Boyd , sister of Sybil Thomas . 
 In the period between 1918 and 1928 , the WFL in Swansea produced two prominent activists in Emily Frost Phipps and her close friend Clara Neal , who were founder members of their branch . Phipps and Neal were teachers and activists , both serving as president of the National Union of Women Teachers and used that platform to press for equal franchise . Phipps also used her position as editor of the Woman Teacher to urge her colleagues to support public meetings and demonstrations .

 = Rachel Berry = 
 Rachel Barbra Berry is a fictional character and de facto female lead from the Fox musical comedy @-@ drama series Glee . The character is portrayed by actress Lea Michele , and has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode , first broadcast on May 19 , 2009 . Rachel was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan . She is the glee club star of the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima , Ohio , where the show is set . Her storylines have seen her suffer peer alienation due to her Broadway ambitions , and develop romantic feelings for Jesse St. James ( Jonathan Groff ) , a member of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline , but primarily for quarterback and glee club co @-@ captain Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) , to whom she eventually becomes engaged . 
 Michele bases Rachel on herself when she was younger , and also draws inspiration for the character variously from films including Election , and television portrayals such as the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf . " Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren 't considered beautiful , " said Michele , " and when I was in high school it was the same for me . I didn 't get a nose job , and every single girl around me did . Therefore , I was out . What 's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts , but it doesn 't matter : You can still be who you want to be . " 
 Rachel is a " strong , driven girl " but somewhat neurotic , and Glee follows Rachel 's journey to become more of a team player as well as fulfil her own aspirations . Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2010 , and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2010 and 2011 for her performance in the role . Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics : Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised Michele for making the character " more than a humorless stereotype " , though The Wall Street Journal 's Raymund Flandez has described Rachel as " insufferable " . Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as singles , available for digital download , and also feature on the show 's soundtrack albums . 
 Rachel is the most frequently seen character on the series , with " The Role You Were Born to Play , " " Dynamic Duets " and " Shooting Star " ( all in season 4 ) being the only episodes where she does not appear .

He returns the day of the group 's first major competition , the Sectionals , to undo sabotage by cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) ; the group makes up a completely new set list , which Rachel opens with a solo of " Don 't Rain on My Parade " , and New Directions wins by unanimous decision . 
 For a short time Rachel believes that she is dating Finn , but he tells her that he needs to take time out for himself . He changes his mind soon after , but Rachel has already begun dating Jesse St. James ( Jonathan Groff ) , the lead singer of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline . The rest of the glee club presses Rachel to break off with Jesse , but he transfers to William McKinley and joins New Directions , which defuses their concerns . She tells Jesse that her dream is to find her birth mother , and he offers to help her do so .

When Rachel discovers that Shelby is her mother , they both confess to not feeling an immediate attachment and eventually decide not to pursue a relationship .

Though this and Finn 's temporary ouster from the football team test their relationship , it remains quite strong through the beginning of season two ; the two work together to throw the glee club 's duets competition so newcomer Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) wins instead . Rachel eventually discovers that Finn slept with cheerleader Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) the previous year while Rachel was dating Jesse , and lied about it , though Rachel herself had lied and said she had slept with Jesse when she hadn 't ; hurt , she makes out with Puck to hurt Finn back ; this betrayal causes Finn to break up with her .

 Just before junior prom , Jesse returns , having flunked out of UCLA , and Rachel invites him to the prom with her , Sam and Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) . Jesse and Finn are kicked out of the prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor , which effectively ends Finn and Quinn 's campaign for prom king and queen . Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel , despite the fact that she and Jesse seem to be a couple again . At Nationals , as the New Directions are about to go on stage , Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him , but though she professes her love , she refuses , still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him . At the end of their duet — " Pretending " , written by Finn — an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong , unscripted kiss ; the glee club comes in twelfth . Back in Ohio , Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York ; he kisses her , and their relationship resumes .

 = = = Casting and creation = = = 
 Rachel is regularly portrayed by Lea Michele , and as a child has been played by Lauren Boles . In casting Glee , series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles . Instead of using traditional network casting calls , he spent three months on Broadway , where he found Lea Michele , who starred in Spring Awakening . The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele . In an interview with The Washington Post , Michele commented on her casting , saying : " I was kind of just thrown into this — this is one of the first television jobs I 've ever had . Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort . The character I 'm playing is really outgoing — she performs in her everyday life as though she 's performing in front of a huge audience . " 
 In December 2010 , Ryan Murphy announced that the cast of Glee would be replaced at the end of the Season 3 to coincide with their graduation . Murphy said : " Every year we 're going to populate a new group . There 's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot . " He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012 : " I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers ' lives . " Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season , and Michele commented on the matter , saying : " We always knew we 'd graduate in real time . It 's all part of the plan and it 's all good ! It 's going to make Season 3 amazing ! This is just the beginning ! " However , Falchuk later stated that while Michele , along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith , will graduate at the end of the third season , " because they 're graduating doesn 't mean they 're leaving the show . " Falchuk insisted " it was never our plan or our intention to let them go … . They are not done with the show after this season . " 
 Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly commented on the original news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate , and said : " Indeed , a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past . I 'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the ' new kids ' on Friday Night Lights , which ends its run tomorrow on NBC , but it was a well @-@ done transition . What I loved most was that the new blood didn 't try to be the new versions of the old characters . They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals . Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished : a seamless , realistic transition . The problem ? ' Seamless ' and ' realistic ' have never been Glee 's strong points , which is not to say they couldn 't be . But the question is : Is Glee looking to be the less @-@ attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights … or Saved By the Bell : The New Class ? "

 She took the role because of Rachel 's characterization , and explained : " Not only is she a singer , but she has so much heart — I think it 's what we need on TV . A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny . It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are . " Michele described the first thirteen episodes of the series as " Rachel 's journey of finding herself within the Glee club " , and said that " she 's learning how to be a team player and work within this group . She 's a very strong , driven girl , who 's sometimes a little misunderstood . " 
 Glee 's costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel 's costuming in an interview with Entertainment Weekly : " Originally , the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election — very buttoned @-@ down , preppy , obnoxious , squeaky clean , nerdy . But she 's got at least 12 costume changes each episode . That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear , so we spread it out a lot . We try to have her buttoned @-@ up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress , like she doesn 't quite get it right . Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats . She makes it her way , which is more quirky . The popular girls find a way to make it look cool , but Rachel makes it look nerdy . But it 's not old @-@ school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors . She thinks she 's taking a trend and making it cool , but she wears it wrong . " 
 Michele bases Rachel on herself when she was younger , and also draws inspiration from the film Election , and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf ( Leighton Meester ) . She has explained : " [ Blair ] is shady , but you still love her . She 's still vulnerable . That 's what I try to do with Rachel . Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren 't considered beautiful , and when I was in high school it was the same for me . I didn 't get a nose job , and every single girl around me did . Therefore , I was out . I was not cool . What 's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts , but it doesn 't matter : You can still be who you want to be . And in four years , high school will be over and all of that crap won 't matter anyway . "

 Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as singles , available for digital download , also featuring on the soundtracks Glee : The Music , Volume 1 and Glee : The Music , Volume 2 . Rachel has received positive reviews from critics . The role saw Michele nominated for the Emmy for Best Leading Actress in a Comedy Series at the 2010 Primetime Emmy Award , which were hosted on August 29 ; and for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards . Robert A. George of the New York Post has deemed Rachel " the only female [ in Glee ] who doesn 't come across as manipulative or <unk> helpless " , while the Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan wrote , " Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character , spoiled diva Rachel Berry , more than a humorless stereotype . " Denise Martin of The Los Angeles Times commented in her review of the episode " The Rhodes Not Taken " : " if there 's any justice in the world , Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel " . 
 Following the episode " Hairography " in which Rachel is badly made @-@ over by Kurt , Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for negatively highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters . He said that while he understood this stance , he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly . However , he wrote that " it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a ' sad clown hooker . ' Come on . She looked fantastic . " Zap2it 's <unk> Ghosh has deemed Rachel 's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck , commenting : " when we saw Rachel fall for them , she was actually relatable . <unk> even . The type @-@ A , uber @-@ talented , self @-@ involved know @-@ it @-@ all who 's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side . And , as a bonus , we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships . " 
 Conversely , Ghosh assessed her low point as being her romancing of Will , writing : " Sure , Schue 's got it going on , what with the rapping , the break dancing , the boy band 'ing and the <unk> hopping too . But Rachel 's eye @-@ on @-@ the @-@ prize , I 'll @-@ get @-@ what @-@ I @-@ want attitude coupled with her inappropriate crush on the teacher just made her creepier than usual . Infiltrating his home , cooking and cleaning for him right under his crazy wife 's nose . Come on , Berry , you 're better than that ... " Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode " Preggers " : " Rachel has become insufferable . The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bonafide triple @-@ threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to the rest of Glee . " Eric Goldman for IGN agreed : " It 's hard not to be annoyed by Rachel " . James Poniewozik of Time has suggested that Rachel 's negative character traits may actually be an asset , commenting on her performance of " Don 't Rain on My Parade " in the episode " Sectionals " : " The number reminded me how much I like what the show 's done with Rachel : she 's a lead character , yet the show allows her to be annoying — but at the same time , her dedication makes her likeable . And as we see here , as much of a pill as she can be , her ability to whip out a performance she 's been working on since age four is an asset . "

 = Famous Fantastic Mysteries = 
 Famous Fantastic Mysteries was an American science fiction and fantasy pulp magazine published from 1939 to 1953 . The editor was Mary Gnaedinger . It was launched by the Munsey Company as a way to reprint the many science fiction and fantasy stories which had appeared over the preceding decades in the Munsey magazines , such as Argosy . The first issue was dated September / October 1939 ; the magazine was immediately successful , and less than a year later a companion magazine , Fantastic Novels , was launched . 
 Frequently reprinted authors included George Allan England , A. Merritt , and Austin Hall ; the artwork was also a major reason for the success of the magazine , with artists such as Virgil Finlay and Lawrence Stevens contributing some of their best work . In late 1942 Popular Publications acquired the title from Munsey , and Famous Fantastic Mysteries stopped reprinting short stories from the earlier magazines . It continued to reprint longer works , including titles by G. K. Chesterton , H. G. Wells , and H. Rider Haggard . Original short fiction also began to appear , including Arthur C. Clarke 's " Guardian Angel " , which would later form the first section of his novel Childhood 's End . In 1951 the publishers experimented briefly with a large digest format , but returned quickly to the original pulp layout . The magazine ceased publication in 1953 , almost at the end of the pulp era . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 By the early decades of the 20th century , science fiction ( sf ) stories were frequently seen in popular magazines . The Munsey Company , a major pulp magazine publisher , printed a great deal of science fiction in these years , but it was not until 1926 that Amazing Stories , the first pulp magazine specializing in science fiction appeared . Munsey continued to print sf in Argosy during the 1930s , including stories such as Murray Leinster 's The War of the Purple Gas and Arthur Leo Zagat 's " Tomorrow " , though they owned no magazines that specialized in science fiction . By the end of the 1930s science fiction was a growing market , with several new sf magazines launched in 1939 . That year Munsey took advantage of science fiction 's growing popularity by launching Famous Fantastic Mysteries as a vehicle for reprinting the most popular fantasy and sf stories from the Munsey magazines . 
 The first issue was dated September / October 1939 , and was edited by Mary Gnaedinger . The magazine immediately became successful and went to a monthly schedule starting in November 1939 . Demand for reprints of old favorites was so strong that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine , Fantastic Novels , in July 1940 . The two magazines were placed on alternating bimonthly schedules , but when Fantastic Novels ceased publication in early 1941 Famous Fantastic Mysteries remained bimonthly until June 1942 . Munsey sold Famous Fantastic Mysteries to Popular Publications , a major pulp publisher , at the end of 1942 ; it appears to have been a sudden decision , since the editorial in the December 1942 issue discusses a planned February issue that never materialized , and mentions forthcoming reprints that did not appear . The first issue from Popular appeared in March 1943 , and only two more issues appeared that year ; the September 1943 issue marked the beginning of a regular quarterly schedule . It returned to a bimonthly schedule in 1946 which it maintained with only slight deviations until the end of its run . 
 In 1949 , Street & Smith , one of the longest established and most respected publishers , shut down all of their pulp magazines : the pulp era was drawing to a close . Popular Publications was the biggest pulp publisher , which helped their titles last a little longer , but Famous Fantastic Mysteries finally ceased publication in 1953 , only a couple of years before the last of the pulps ceased publication . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 Munsey 's plan for the magazines was laid out in a note that appeared in the first four issues : " This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years , demanding a second look at famous fantasies which , since their original publication , have become accepted classics . Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction . " The first issue included Ray Cummings ' " The Girl in the Golden Atom " and A. Merritt 's " The Moon Pool " , both popular stories by well @-@ known authors . Merritt 's sequel , " The Conquest of the Moon Pool " , began serialization in the next issue , with illustrations by Virgil Finlay . Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime , and became one of its most popular artists . Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue ; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers . The first five covers were simply tables of contents , but with the sixth issue , dated March 1940 , pictorial covers began , with Finlay the artist for that first cover . Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul , but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay , Lawrence Stevens , or his son , Peter Stevens , including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950 . The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine one of the most popular of its day , and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay 's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation . 
 The decision to launch Fantastic Novels was taken partly because there were a great many book @-@ length works that readers wanted to see reprinted . Gnaedinger commented that " Everyone seems to have realized that although [ the ] set @-@ up of five to seven stories with two serials running , was highly satisfactory , that the long list of novels would have to be speeded up somehow " . When Fantastic Novels was launched , Famous Fantastic Mysteries was partway through serialization of The Blind Spot , by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint , with the third episode appearing in the May / June 1940 issue . Rather than complete the serialization , Gnaedinger decided to print the novel in its entirety in the first issue of Fantastic Novels , ensuring that readers of Famous Fantastic Mysteries would also acquire the new magazine . After Fantastic Novels ceased publication in 1941 , Famous Fantastic Mysteries changed its policy , and began publishing a complete novel in every issue , rather than several stories and one or two serials running concurrently . Usually there were also short stories , but occasionally a particularly long novel would appear alone in the issue : this happened , for example , with the February 1942 issue , which contained Francis Stevens ' The Citadel of Fear , and no other fiction . 
 When Munsey sold Famous Fantastic Mysteries to Popular , the editorial policy changed again , to exclude reprints of short fiction that had previously appeared in magazine form . Book length fiction continued to be reprinted , as did some shorter works that had appeared only in books , such as William Hope Hodgson 's " The Derelict " , and Robert W. Chambers ' " The Mask " , both of which appeared in the December 1943 issue . The reprinted novels included G. K. Chesterton 's The Man Who Was Thursday , H. G. Wells ' The Island of Dr. Moreau , H. Rider Haggard 's The Ancient Allan , and works by Algernon Blackwood , Lord Dunsany , and Arthur Machen . Some of the reprinted material was abridged , but despite this , Famous Fantastic Mysteries did an important service to its readers by making works available that had been long out of print , and which in some cases had only been previously published in the U.K. , making their appearance in the magazine the first chance many subscribers would have had to read them . 
 Some original material also appeared after Popular acquired the magazine . Contributors who published original stories in Famous Fantastic Mysteries included Henry Kuttner , Ray Bradbury , and C. L. Moore . Arthur C. Clarke 's story " Guardian Angel " appeared in the April 1950 issue ; it was later turned into the first section of his novel Childhood 's End .

 Mary Gnaedinger was the editor of Famous Fantastic Mysteries for all 81 issues . The magazine was launched as a bimonthly in September 1939 , and was converted to monthly from the second issue , in November 1939 . The May 1940 issue was followed by August 1940 , which began a bimonthly sequence that lasted until June 1942 , which began another monthly sequence that ran through the end of 1942 . The next issue , March 1943 , was followed by a September issue that inaugurated a quarterly sequence that ran until December 1945 , which began another bimonthly run . This lasted until the final issue in June 1953 with only two irregularities : October 1950 was followed by January 1951 , and July 1951 was followed by October 1951 . Famous Fantastic Mysteries was published by the Munsey Corporation until the end of 1942 , and by Popular Publications , thereafter . The magazine was initially 128 pages long . This was cut to 112 pages with the October 1940 issue , and then returned to 128 pages for the June 1941 issue . From June 1942 to March 1944 the page count was 144 ; it was cut to 132 in June 1944 and again to 112 in January 1951 , where it remained until the end of the run . The price was 15 cents throughout , except for the period from October 1940 to April 1941 during which it was 10 cents . Famous Fantastic Mysteries began as a pulp , and remained in that format throughout its run except for a brief experiment in 1951 in which it was reduced to large digest size . 
 A Canadian reprint edition , with identical contents and dates , began in February 1948 , from All Fiction Field , Inc . ; in October 1951 the publisher became Popular Publications , Toronto , but this was just a name change rather than a change of ownership . The final Canadian issue was dated August 1952 ; these issues were half an inch longer than the U.S. versions . In addition , the Canadian edition of Super Science Stories , which had initially reprinted from its U.S. namesake and from the U.S. edition of Astonishing Stories , began to reprint almost entirely from Famous Fantastic Mysteries beginning with the August 1944 Canadian issue . As a nod to the change in source material , the title of the Canadian edition was changed to Super Science and Fantastic Stories starting with the December 1944 issue . A Mexican magazine , Los <unk> <unk> , which published 44 issues between 1948 and 1953 , reprinted stories from both Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Astounding Science Fiction , mostly ( though not entirely ) without obtaining permission first . 
 An anthology , Famous Fantastic Mysteries : 30 Great Tales of Fantasy and Horror from the Classic Pulp Magazines Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels , appeared in 1991 , edited by Stefan R. Dziemianowicz , Robert E. Weinberg and Martin H. Greenberg , and drawing almost all of its contents from Famous Fantastic Mysteries . 
 = Speechless ( Fred Frith album ) = 
 Speechless is a 1981 solo album by English guitarist , composer and improviser Fred Frith of the group Henry Cow . It was Frith 's third solo album , and was originally released in the United States on LP record on The Residents ' Ralph record label . It was the second of three solo albums Frith made for the label . 
 Speechless was recorded in France , Switzerland and the United States , and featured Frith with French Rock in Opposition group Etron Fou Leloublan on the first side of the LP , and Frith 's New York City band Massacre on the second . It is mostly a studio album with extracts from a Massacre concert mixed into four of the tracks on side two of the LP . 
 Speechless has been described as a mixture of folk music , free improvisation , avant @-@ rock and noise . AllMusic said that it is often regarded as one of Frith 's best solo albums . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Speechless was the second of a series of three solo albums Frith made for The Residents 's record label Ralph Records , the first being Gravity ( 1980 ) , an avant @-@ garde " dance " record that drew on rhythm and dance from folk music across the world , and the third being Cheap at Half the Price ( 1983 ) . He had recorded with The Residents in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and appeared on several of their albums . Gravity was well received by music critics . 
 Just as he had worked with two backing bands on Gravity ( Swedish Rock in Opposition group Samla Mammas Manna and United States progressive rock group The Muffins ) , on Speechless Frith used French Rock in Opposition group Etron Fou Leloublan and his own New York City band Massacre . Side one of the LP record was recorded with Etron Fou Leloublan at Studio Freeson in Pujaut , France and at Sunrise Studios , Kirchberg , Switzerland in July and August 1980 . Side two of the LP consists of four tracks built around extracts from a Massacre concert at CBGB in New York City in April 1980 : " A Spit in the Ocean " , " Navajo " and " Saving Grace " were later altered and added to by Frith at Sunrise Studios in July and August 1980 , while " Conversations With White Arc " is an unaltered improvised piece . The remaining four tracks of side two were recorded by Frith at Sunrise during the same period . 
 On Speechless , Frith continued his exploration of world folk and dance music that he had begun on Gravity , but unlike Gravity , Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings . Frith said that many of the tapes were made while walking the streets of New York City , and include street fairs and demonstrations . Recordings were also made while visiting friends : the title song 's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson 's kitchen . 
 At the time Frith had a passion for tape manipulation and " sound malfunctions " . In a 1982 interview with Down Beat magazine Frith said that so much more can be done with tape : " I 'm interested in using the studio for things that you couldn 't possibly do in a performance , to use the medium of tape in a way that is intrinsic to it . " He added that hardware malfunctions often result in more interesting sounds than was originally intended : " [ A ] lot of the sounds that I get in the studio have been specifically the result of overloading or causing to malfunction various pieces of technology , like <unk> or digital delays . " 
 Frith described the theme of Speechless as revolving around " questions of power and language , of striving to find a voice but remaining always on the edge being understood . " This notion came to him when he once tried to listen to a recording of an interview he had done , and the cassette machine played back both sides of the tape at the same time , backwards , rendering the words unintelligible . Andrew Jones wrote in <unk> , ' <unk> & pop mechanics : an introduction to musique <unk> that Speechless is " ultimately about being unable to articulate the words that once flowed freely . " 
 = = Music = = 
 Speechless is an instrumental album that includes elements of folk music , free improvisation , avant @-@ rock and noise , plus field recordings and tape manipulation . Featured are also many " happy accidents " that resulted from " sound malfunctions " in the studio . The tracks on the album vary from folk and melodic pieces ( including the waltz ballad " Domaine de <unk> " ) , to noisy avant @-@ rock ( " A Spit in the Ocean " ) , to layered sound collages ( " Speechless " ) . 
 Glenn <unk> at Jazz Review said that the listener can expect " the unexpected , amid pounding backbeats , variable rhythmic flows , and <unk> soundscapes . " Peter Marsh at BBC Music described the music as being an " unholy alliance " between Captain Beefheart 's Magic Band and King Crimson . 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 Rock critic Peter Marsh , in a BBC Music review , described Speechless as " beautifully progressive <unk> that doesn 't take itself too seriously . " Glenn <unk> at Jazz Review said the album was " highly recommended " , adding that " Frith ’ s off @-@ kilter methodologies translate into a fun @-@ filled production , awash with a cartoon @-@ like rationale . " Tom Schulte at AllMusic wrote that Speechless is often regarded as one of Frith 's best solo albums , and that its " inspired manipulations hold up under repeated scrutiny . " 
 The waltz ballad " Domaine de <unk> " was performed live by Frith several times , including at the 4th Festival International de Musique <unk> de Victoriaville in Victoriaville in Quebec , Canada with René Lussier in October 1986 , and at the Bahnhof Langendreer in Bochum , Germany with Frith 's band , Keep the Dog in mid @-@ 1991 . The performance with Lussier was released as " Domaine Revisited " on Nous Autres in 1987 , and the performance with Keep the Dog was released as " Domaine de Langendreer " on That House We Lived In in 2003 . " Conversations With White Arc " was revisited on Massacre 's 1998 album , Funny Valentine as " Further Conversations With White Arc " .

 Cody Rhodes and Goldust ( also known as The Brotherhood , The Rhodes Brothers , or Gold and Stardust ) were a professional wrestling tag team that competed in WWE . Cody and Goldust are half @-@ brothers in real life and were once managed by their father , WWE Hall of Famer " The American Dream " Dusty Rhodes . 
 The tag team was formed when Cody was fired from the WWE after losing to Randy Orton in a match prompted by Cody 's questioning of the company 's chief operating officer Triple H 's authority . The following week , Goldust fought Orton in an attempt to have Cody rehired , but was also fired after he lost . Dusty attempted to convince The Authority to rehire his sons . Eventually , Triple H and his wife Stephanie McMahon decided that the half @-@ brothers would face the two members of The Shield , Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins , at Battleground , but stipulated that if Cody and Goldust lost , they would never work in the WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the Performance Center . This match marked the debut of Cody and Goldust as a tag team and their victory over Reigns and Rollins led to an immediate return of their jobs . However , after almost eight months , they were disbanded at Payback due to the number of times Cody and Goldust lost . Cody suddenly returned to revive the tag team in June 2014 on Raw under his new gimmick as " Stardust " . 
 They became two @-@ time WWE Tag Team Champions . The first being in October 2013 after they captured the title in a no disqualification match against The Shield ( Reigns and Rollins ) with help from Big Show on Raw as Cody Rhodes and Goldust , and on September 21 , 2014 when they defeated The Usos at the Night of Champions event as Gold and Stardust .

 In 1995 , Dustin Runnels ( better known by his ring name Goldust ) , the son of WWE Hall of Famer Virgil Runnels ( better known as Dusty Rhodes ) was re @-@ signed by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) , as it was then known . The character of " The Bizarre One " ( the character 's nickname ) , is somewhat spooky and mysterious , with sexually suggestive mannerisms . Vince McMahon , the promotion 's chairman , described it as " androgynous " . In his period of time with the WWF , Goldust went on to become a three @-@ time Intercontinental Champion , a nine @-@ time Hardcore Champion , and a one @-@ time World Tag Team Champion with Booker T. However , his contract expired in the World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , as it is now known , and he refused to renew it in December 2003 . In 2008 , Runnels returned to WWE as Goldust at Cyber Sunday . After a four @-@ year stint in WWE , he was released in 2012 . 
 His half @-@ brother Cody Runnels ( known by his ring name Cody Rhodes ) is also fathered by Dusty Rhodes . Cody began wrestling in WWE 's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) in June 2006 . On 2 July 2007 , Cody made his television debut in a backstage segment with his father Dusty and Randy Orton , where Orton introduced himself to Cody and disrespectfully slapped Dusty . On 9 July , Rhodes slapped Orton in return and , the following week , Cody faced Orton in his debut WWE match , but lost . In the following years , he would become a two @-@ time Intercontinental Champion and a four @-@ time Tag Team Champion ( three World Tag Team Championships and one WWE Tag Team Championship ) with Hardcore Holly , Ted DiBiase Jr . ( as part of the Legacy group ) , and Drew McIntyre . 
 In January 2009 , Goldust participated in the annual Royal Rumble match and stared down Cody who ultimately eliminated him . Goldust married WWE Diva Aksana on 2 November 2010 on NXT , with Dusty and Cody in attendance . In 2013 , Goldust was a surprise entrant for the Royal Rumble match on January 26 and was once again eliminated by his half @-@ brother . Although he hinted at a possible feud with Cody , he later confirmed in an interview that his return was a one night only deal .

 On 2 September 2013 on Raw , Cody Rhodes was fired from the WWE after failing to defeat the WWE Champion Randy Orton , a non @-@ title match into which Rhodes was forced after he questioned the company 's chief operating officer Triple H 's authoritarian rule . Goldust returned the following week and similarly lost to Orton in a non @-@ title match , thus failing to get his half @-@ brother rehired . Eventually , their father Dusty Rhodes returned to Raw in an attempt to convince Stephanie McMahon to give his sons their jobs back . Instead , McMahon propositioned that Dusty could choose either one of his sons to receive a job , but not both . Dusty refused and Big Show knocked out Dusty as per McMahon 's orders . In return , the Rhodes Brothers ambushed Triple H 's henchmen the Shield on Raw . The next week , Triple H and Stephanie McMahon ( later known as the Authority ) offered the brothers their jobs back if they could defeat the Shield 's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns ( the WWE Tag Team Champions ) at Battleground . If they lost , they would never work in WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center . All three members of the Rhodes family were then attacked by the Shield . On October 6 at Battleground , the Rhodes Brothers made their debut match as a tag team with Dusty backing them up at ringside . The final member of the Shield , Dean Ambrose , attempted to interfere , and was taken out by Dusty . Soon after , Cody pinned Rollins in the non @-@ title match to earn the brothers ' jobs back . Various WWE wrestlers and agents came out to celebrate with the Rhodes family , including Arn Anderson , Dean Malenko , and Dave Finlay . 
 On October 11 on SmackDown , the Rhodes Brothers marked the first ever main @-@ roster loss of the Wyatt Family . The Rhodes Brothers heaped more misery on the Shield as they captured the WWE Tag Team Championship for the first time by winning a no disqualification match on October 14 on Raw ( with the help of the Big Show ) over Reigns and Rollins . This was Goldust 's first championship in WWE in nearly 11 years . 
 On the following Raw , the Shield faced the Usos in a number one contender 's match , in which the winner has the right to face the tag team champions for the title . The Rhodes Brothers were commentating and eventually interfered in the match , causing a no contest . As a result , the Rhodes Brothers faced both the Shield and the Usos in a triple threat tag team match for the tag titles at Hell in a Cell and successfully retained it . The night after the pay @-@ per @-@ view event , the brothers experienced their first loss as champions to The Real Americans in a non @-@ title match . 
 In a continuation of their feud against the Authority , on November 11 on Raw , the half @-@ brothers defeated Randy Orton in a handicap match . It was announced the following week that at Survivor Series , the Rhodes Brothers would team up with the Usos and Rey Mysterio against the Shield and the Real Americans in the traditional Survivor Series elimination match , but they were beaten with Reigns the only survivor of the fight . On November 22 on SmackDown , the half @-@ brothers defeated the Real Americans to retain their tag title . The Rhodes Brothers were scheduled to face the team of Ryback and Curtis Axel , the team of Rey Mysterio and Big Show , and the Real Americans at Tables , Ladders & Chairs , as they had recently been defeated by each of these teams . Once again , they successfully defended their title . 
 On the 3 January 2014 on SmackDown , the Rhodes Brothers defeated Luke Harper and Erick Rowan , members of the Wyatt Family to retain the title and marked their first win of the year . They once again defended the gold on the special Old School Raw episode when they won against the Real Americans . However , on the 17 January episode of SmackDown , the half @-@ brothers were defeated in a non @-@ title match by the New Age Outlaws ( Road Dogg and Billy Gunn ) after a distraction from the General Manager of SmackDown Vickie Guerrero . As a result , the Outlaws were named the number one contenders of the title . At the Royal Rumble pre @-@ show , on 26 January the Outlaws defeated the Brotherhood to end their championship reign . Later that day on the Royal Rumble main show , the Rhodes Brothers participated in the Rumble match ; Goldust eliminated Cody , but was then quickly eliminated . The following day on Raw , their rematch for the tag team belts was inconclusive when the Brotherhood were attacked by Brock Lesnar . Thus , the Brotherhood received another rematch but in a steel cage ; they ended up losing to the Outlaws . 
 In the following weeks , the Brotherhood feuded with different tag teams and stables . On 10 February on Raw , they teamed with Rey Mysterio and challenged the Wyatt Family , but The Rhodes Brothers yielded . On Friday , with the Usos on their team , they won against Ryback , Curtis Axel , and the Outlaws . This led to a victorious tag team match between the Brotherhood and RybAxel ( with Larry Hennig ) at the Elimination Chamber Kickoff . At WrestleMania XXX , the half @-@ brothers participated in the 31 @-@ man battle royal for the André the Giant Memorial Trophy , and were both eliminated by Alberto Del Rio . 
 The Brotherhood then returned for tag team action with consecutive losses to RybAxel and the Usos ; after the latter loss on April 21 , dissension was teased between the brothers when Cody shoved Goldust and left by himself . After that , more tension was built up when Cody began frequently losing singles matches while Goldust frequently won ; Goldust notably scored wins over Alberto Del Rio and Curtis Axel , two opponents which Cody lost to . When Cody managed a win over Damien Sandow in May , it was only because he resorted to cheating . The team disbanded at Payback on June 1 when they lost to RybAxel , with Cody telling Goldust to look for a new partner , after he felt he was the weak link in the team . Cody then attempted to find a new tag team partner for Goldust , such as Sin Cara or R @-@ Truth , but the new teams still lost their tag matches .

 On the 16 June episode of Raw , Cody announced that he had found the perfect tag partner for Goldust . This turned out to be himself , appearing under the ring name Stardust while wearing a jumpsuit and face paint similar to Goldust . The two quickly defeated RybAxel on that night , and also at the Money in the Bank . 
 After weeks of primarily appearing in vignettes cryptically expressing their desires to acquire " The Cosmic Key " ( their name for the WWE Tag Team Championships ) that The Usos now have , they successfully defeated The Usos in a non @-@ title match on the August 18 episode of Raw . On the August 25 episode of Raw , they challenged The Usos for the Tag Team Championships and won by countout , thus not winning the championships . They would accuse the Usos of a purposeful countout to retain the titles , and then attacked them , turning heel in the process . 
 At Night of Champions , Goldust and Stardust , now referred to simply as Gold and Stardust , defeated The Usos for their second WWE Tag Team Championship , and successfully retained them against the Usos in a rematch at Hell in a Cell . They also successfully retained their titles the following night on Raw ; after Mark Henry turned on his partner Big Show to give Stardust the pin . After trading wins throughout the tag division over the next few weeks ; Gold and Stardust lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to The Miz and Damien Mizdow in a Fatal 4 @-@ Way match in Survivor Series that also included the Usos and Los Matadores , ending their second title reign at 63 days . After failing in regaining their titles the next night on Raw , the following SmackDown , the duo cut a more sinister promo than usual on their loss of the Cosmic Key , claiming that " science " had failed them and adding that " darkness would fall on the New Day " , possibly referring to a stable that had debuted on the same episode . After being hastily defeated in a number one contender Tag Team Turmoil on the December 2nd edition of Raw by Kofi Kingston and Big E ; Gold and Stardust returned later on in the match and attacked their manager , Xavier Woods , distracting them enough to cost them the match , thus setting up a feud . A match between the two teams was scheduled for the Kick @-@ Off show of TLC : Tables , Ladders and Chairs on December 14 , where Big E and Kingston defeated Gold and Stardust . 
 = = = Disbandment and feud = = = 
 In early 2015 , the two again began showing signs of tension between them - with Stardust becoming further entrenched in his gimmick , leaving Goldust to have to try to communicate with his brother , Cody ; through his new entity . Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown . On the February 16th edition of Raw - for the first time since their debut , Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having . Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family , after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day , Stardust hit his old finisher Cross @-@ Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely . After , when Dusty approached Stardust backstage , Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age . He then stated that Cody , and now his own family , were dead to him . A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood . Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody , Goldust won their first encounter via roll @-@ up . Backstage , Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family 's fault for his mental decline . 
 On November 22 at Survivor Series , Goldust returned teaming up with The Dudley Boyz , Neville and Titus O 'Neil to face his half @-@ brother Stardust , The Ascension , The Miz and Bo Dallas in an ten @-@ man tag team match , which Goldust 's team emerged victorious . The following night on Raw , Goldust teamed up with The Prime Time Players taking on his brother Stardust and The Ascension one more time which Goldust 's team won also after O 'Neil hit <unk> with his move Clash of the Titus .

 = 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was a below active season in terms of tropical cyclone formation . The season had no official bounds , but most storms formed in either May or after October . No depressions or storms formed during the monsoon season from July to September , the first such instance on record . There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean – the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent – and the Arabian Sea to the west of India . The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) releases unofficial advisories . An average of four to six storms form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November . Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45 ° E and 100 ° E are included in the season by the IMD . 
 Overall , there was a total of seven depressions and four cyclonic storms . The most intense and deadly tropical cyclone of the season , the West Bengal cyclone , lashed that province of India and Bangladesh in the month of November . Rough seas offshore caused at least 173 drownings offshore Bangladesh and India , while over 100 people were left missing . In West Bengal alone , 124 fatalities were reported , with over one hundred people still missing . Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh , particularly the capital city of Dhaka . Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May . It made a rare landfall in the Omani region of Dhofar . The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman , which in turn brought flooding to the region . Nine people drowned and damage to property , crops , and transportation reached $ 25 million ( 2002 USD ) . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Overall , the season was inactive in terms of tropical cyclone formation . The IMD tracked six tropical cyclones , which was below the average of 13 to 14 per season . No storms were active from June to September during the monsoon season , the first such instance of no depressions in the 115 year record of the IMD . Collectively , the storms of this season resulted in at least 182 deaths and $ 25 million ( 2002 USD ) in damage , all of which can be attributed to ARB 01 and BOB 04 . 
 The first storm of the season , ARB 01 , developed on May 6 out of an area of low pressure over the Arabian Sea . It peaked winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) before making landfall near Salalah , Oman on May 10 . The storm dissipated shortly thereafter . A deep depression , classified as BOB 02 , developed in the Andaman Sea on May 10 . The deep depression remained disorganized and made landfall near Yangon , Burma before dissipating on May 12 . Later that month , a tropical depression , recognized only by the Thailand Meteorological Department , developed in the Bay of Bengal and also made landfall in Burma . Activity in the North Indian Ocean then went dormant for over five months , a direct result of the monsoon season in the region . Tropical cyclogenesis resumed with the development of Tropical Depression BOB 03 forming near Andhra Pradesh on October 22 . 
 On November 11 , a severe cyclonic storm – numbered BOB 04 – developed in the Bay of Bengal . It soon became the strongest tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . BOB 04 made landfall in Bangladesh on November 12 , hours before dissipating . Later in November , another cyclonic storm – assigned to BOB 05 – formed in the Bay of Bengal on November 23 . It moved northward before eventually curving westward and dissipating on November 28 . The final tropical cyclone developed southwest of Sri Lanka on December 21 . The system headed generally east @-@ northeastward and strengthened into cyclonic storm on December 24 , before <unk> well east of Sri Lanka on the following day .

 A low pressure area in the Arabian Sea developed into a depression while located a few hundred miles west @-@ northwest of Maldives at 0300 UTC on May 6 . By the following day , it had intensified into a deep depression . However , dry air diminished convection , causing the cyclone to weaken to a depression on May 8 at 0300 UTC . Nine hours later , it was upgraded back to a deep depression . On May 8 , the cyclone turned west @-@ northwestward . Further intensification occurred , with the deep depression becoming a cyclonic storm at 0600 UTC on May 9 . The storm maintained its intensity until weakening slightly early on May 10 , while briefly tracking northwestward . Shortly thereafter , it made landfall near Salalah , Oman . The cyclone rapidly weakened and dissipated inland later on May 10 . 
 Waves up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) lashed the coast of Oman , though no coastal flooding occurred . Wind gusts reaching 106 km / h ( 66 mph ) affected some areas of Oman , while light winds were reported in Al <unk> , Yemen . The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Dhofar region of Oman , peaking at 251 mm ( 9 @.@ 88 in ) in the city of <unk> . Areas in the vicinity of the landfall location of the storm experienced the highest precipitation totals in 30 years . As a result , wadis quickly became rivers , sweeping away cars and drowning nine people . Additionally , property , crops , and transportation suffered impacts from flooding . Damage from the storm totaled to $ 25 million , all of which was in Oman . 
 = = = Deep Depression BOB 02 = = = 
 A tropical disturbance near Sumatra was tracked starting on May 7 . Although the system was disorganized and convection was sporadic , it managed to develop a low @-@ level center of circulation on May 9 . After significant strengthening on May 10 , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was issued later that day . Shortly thereafter , the disturbance became Tropical Cyclone 02B at 1200 UTC , while located about 230 km ( 145 mi ) southeast of Port Blair , Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Deep convection continued to be sporadic until becoming persistent early on May 11 . Around that time , the deep depression reached 3 @-@ minute sustained winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . 
 Later on May 11 , Cyclone 02B unexpectedly accelerated to the north @-@ northeast while crossing the northern Andaman Sea . At 2300 UTC on May 11 , the cyclone made landfall just east of Yangon , Burma . By early on the following day , it weakened to a depression . The final warning on Cyclone 02B was issued at 0600 UTC on May 12 and indicated that the storm dissipated about 175 km ( 110 mi ) . The city of Yangon experienced wind gusts of about 47 km / h ( 29 mph ) , according to the JTWC . Cyclone 02B co @-@ existed in a pair , with the southern counterpart being Tropical Cyclone Errol , which was in the South Indian Ocean within Australian Bureau of Meteorology 's responsibility .

 The Thailand Meteorological Department began issuing advisories on a tropical depression in the Bay of Bengal on May 17 . Several hours later , the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system . Minimal strengthening occurred as the depression tracked rather swiftly toward the coast of Myanmar . At 0900 UTC on May 18 , the depression made landfall near Taungup , Rakhine State , with winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . The JTWC cancelled the TCFA seven hours later , having never classified the system as a tropical depression . It weakened inland and dissipated over eastern Myanmar at 0300 UTC on May 19 . Impact from this system is unknown .

 The JTWC issued a TCFA late on October 22 for a depression located about 235 km ( 145 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Chennai , Tamil Nadu . By 0300 UTC on the following day , the India Meteorological Department issued a bulletin on the depression . Due to multiple low @-@ level center of circulations and an ill @-@ defined structure , the depression was difficult to track . It moved in a quasi @-@ stationary motion offshore Andhra Pradesh . Minimal intensification occurred , and by 1930 UTC on October 25 , the depression dissipated about 235 km ( 145 mi ) north of Chennai .

 Tropical Cyclone 04B developed as a depression near Chennai , India on November 10 . Later that day , it intensified into a deep depression while tracking northward . As the storm was moving to the northeast , it was upgraded to a cyclonic storm , due to gale force winds . The cyclone came under the influence of mid @-@ latitude trough , which caused the storm to accelerate to the north @-@ northeast . Early on November 12 , it was upgraded to a severe cyclonic storm , as maximum sustained winds reached 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Later that day at 0900 UTC , the storm made landfall near Sagar Island , West Bengal . The cyclone quickly weakened inland and by 1200 UTC on November 12 , the IMD issued its final advisory , while the system situated about 200 km ( 125 mi ) northeast of Kolkata . 
 Rough seas offshore Orissa caused two fishing trawlers to collide , resulting in 18 fatalities , while two additional trawlers were reported missing . In West Bengal , the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall , as well as causing two deaths . Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Bangladesh impacted many cities and villages , including the capital city of Dhaka , forcing thousands to evacuate . Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150 men sank offshore Bangladesh . Eight additional boats carrying 60 occupants were reported missing . Along coastal areas of the country , winds destroyed bamboo huts , uprooted trees , and disrupted road transport between various towns and villages . The storm was attributed to at least 51 deaths , while between 111 and 560 people were classified as missing .

 A low pressure area developed within an equatorial trough centered over the southeastern Bay of Bengal on November 22 . After tracking northwestward for about twenty @-@ four hours , the system developed into Tropical Cyclone 05B , while located about 815 km ( 505 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Chennai , Tamil Nadu . While moving northward , it intensified into a deep depression at 1800 UTC on November 23 . Strengthening continued and early on November 24 , the deep depression was upgraded to a cyclonic storm . Later that day , the storm turned northwestward and later curved westward . 
 As it was moving westward , the system became disorganized and the center was difficult to track . Despite significant convection , the JTWC discontinued advisories on the storm at 1200 UTC on November 25 , possibly in anticipation that it would soon dissipate . However , it remained a tropical cyclone for almost three more days . By 1200 UTC on November 27 , the storm was downgraded to a deep depression . The system moved northwestward and weakened further to a depression six hours later . It degenerated into an area of low pressure area while located over the central Bay of Bengal on November 28 .

 A low pressure area developed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Sri Lanka on December 20 . Early on December 21 , the system developed into a depression . The JTWC issued a TCFA at 1251 UTC on December 22 , while it was centered 340 kilometres ( 210 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Sri Lanka . By 1800 UTC on December 23 , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 06B , which was located about 160 km ( 100 mi ) southeast of Dondra Head , Sri Lanka . At that time , the storm had intensified into a deep depression . Further strengthening occurred , and it was upgraded to a cyclonic storm early on December 24 . 
 After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) on December 24 , the storm soon weakened and convection diminished , possibly due to interaction with a nearby tropical disturbance . By early on the following day , it was downgraded to a deep depression while moving toward the northeast . Later that day , Cyclonic Storm BOB 06 weakened to a depression . At 1800 UTC on December 25 , the JTWC issued a final advisory on the cyclone , citing that it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area while located about 685 km ( 425 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Dondra Head , Sri Lanka . 
 = USS Porter ( DD @-@ 59 ) = 
 USS Porter ( Destroyer No. 59 / DD @-@ 59 ) was a Tucker @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of both David Porter and his son David Dixon Porter . 
 Porter was laid down by the William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia , in August 1914 and launched in August of the following year . The ship was a little more than 315 feet ( 96 m ) in length , just over 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 long tons ( 1 @,@ 110 t ) . She was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 10 cm ) guns and had eight 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . Porter was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) . 
 After her April 1916 commissioning , Porter conducted her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Porter was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas . Patrolling the Irish and Celtic Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland , Porter severely damaged the German submarine U @-@ 108 in April 1918 . 
 Upon returning to the United States after the war , Porter operated off the east coast until she was decommissioned in June 1922 . In June 1924 , Porter was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the " Rum Patrol " . She operated under the name USCGC Porter ( CG @-@ 7 ) until 1933 , when she was returned to the Navy . Later that year , the ship was renamed DD @-@ 59 to free the name Porter for another destroyer . She was sold for scrap in August 1934 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Porter was authorized in 1913 as the third ship of the Tucker class which , like the related O 'Brien class , was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia , which laid down her keel on 24 August 1914 . Twelve months later , on 26 August 1915 , Porter was launched by sponsor Miss Georgiana Porter <unk> , a descendant of the ship 's namesakes , Commodore David Porter ( 1780 – 1843 ) and son Admiral David Dixon Porter ( 1813 – 1891 ) , both notable U.S. Navy officers . As built , Porter was 315 feet 3 inches ( 96 @.@ 09 m ) in length and 30 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 30 m ) abeam and drew 9 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 84 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 long tons ( 1 @,@ 110 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 205 long tons ( 1 @,@ 224 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Porter had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes . The power plant could generate 18 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) and move the ship at speeds up to 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) . 
 Porter 's main battery consisted of four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) / 50 Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 pounds ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 @-@ pound ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 feet per second ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yards ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 Porter was also equipped with eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the Tucker @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Porter or any of the other ships of the class .

 USS Porter was commissioned into the United States Navy on 17 April 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ward K. Wortman . Following her commissioning , Porter 's shakedown was conducted in the Caribbean . 
 After the United States entry into World War I on 6 April 1917 , Porter was readied for overseas duty and departed from New York on 24 April with the other five ships of her division — Wadsworth ( the flagship ) , Davis , Conyngham , McDougal , and Wainwright . The sextet arrived at Queenstown , Ireland , on 4 May and began patrolling the southern approaches to the Irish Sea the next day . Based at Queenstown , Porter met and escorted convoys from the United States as they entered the war zone . 
 On 16 October 1917 , Porter came to the aid of American destroyer Cassin , which had been torpedoed by German submarine U @-@ 61 about 20 nautical miles ( 37 km ) south of Mine Head , Ireland . Cassin 's stern had nearly been blown off and her rudder was gone , leaving the ship unable to steer . Porter arrived at about 16 : 00 and stayed with Cassin until dusk when two British sloops , Jessamine and Tamarisk , took over for Porter ; Cassin was towed to safety and later returned to patrol duty . 
 On 28 April 1918 , Porter severely damaged U @-@ 108 while that German submarine was steaming to intercept a convoy . The destroyer was transferred to Brest , France , on 14 June . She returned to the United States at the end of the war , and operated off the East Coast until she was decommissioned on 23 June 1922 .
