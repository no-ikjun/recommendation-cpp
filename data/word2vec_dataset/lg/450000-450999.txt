 Rutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration [ Rn ] 5f14 <unk> 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table . It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4 + ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid , hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions . 
 The most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the radioisotope <unk> .

 Era Vulgaris is the fifth full length studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age . The album was completed in early April 2007 and released on June 8 , 2007 in some countries , June 11 , 2007 in the United Kingdom and June 12 , 2007 in the United States . The tracks " Sick , Sick , Sick " and " 3 's & 7 's " were released as singles in early June , with a third single " Make It wit Chu " released around Halloween of 2007 . 
 The album debuted at # 14 on the US Billboard 200 charts selling 52 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , which was a decline in comparison to the previous album , which opened at # 5 with 91 @,@ 000 copies sold in its debut week . In other countries it has reached much loftier debut positions , mostly in the top ten , such as number five in Canada where it sold approximately 10 @,@ 000 copies in its opening week . 
 = = Overview and background = = 
 While 2002 's Songs for the Deaf was said to be inspired by Josh Homme 's tedious drive through the Southern Californian desert , the inspiration for Era Vulgaris came from Homme 's daily drive through Hollywood . He described the record as " dark , hard , and electrical , sort of like a construction worker , " " … it 's like dirt , clearly seen . " The album 's title Era Vulgaris refers to the Latin term for Common Era . The title was chosen by Homme because he thought " it sounds like ' the Vulgar Era ' , which I like , because that sounds like something that I would like to be part of … I mean I think we 're in it , and I 'm stoked " . 
 Two tracks from the album had previously been released or performed elsewhere . " Into the Hollow " had been performed by producers Josh Homme and Chris Goss as The 5 : <unk> , and " Make It wit Chu " had been recorded as a Desert Sessions track , as well as appearing on the Queens ' live album Over the Years and Through the Woods .

 In June 2006 , in an interview on the Australian radio station Triple J , Jesse F. Keeler , the bassist from Death from Above 1979 , revealed that he would be playing bass on an upcoming Queens of the Stone Age album , but said that he would more than likely not be touring with the band due to his desire to spend more time with his girlfriend . Eventually on the DFA internet forum , Keeler revealed that due to conflicting schedules , he would not be appearing on the album . In a July interview with NME , Homme confirmed that the band was back in the studio , writing , but he remained unwilling to reveal who would appear in the band on the new record : 
 That 's not a healthy question . You 'll ruin the surprise . We 've gotta keep our cool . 
 The album was expected to include guest performances by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails , Julian Casablancas from The Strokes , former band member Mark Lanegan , Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , and ( jokingly ) deceased humorist Erma Bombeck . Of these , however , only Casablancas ' and Lanegan 's tracks appear on the U.S. release : Casablancas performed synth guitar and backing vocals on " Sick , Sick , Sick " , and Lanegan sang backing vocals on " River in the Road " . Ultimately , scheduling conflicts prevented Gibbons from appearing , while Reznor 's track " Era Vulgaris " was released separately on the You Know What You Did promotional CD and the UK edition of the album . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 The album was recorded " with exactly zero input from [ record label ] Interscope Records " between July 2006 and April 2007 at Cherokee Studios , Hollywood , Steakhouse Studios , Los Angeles and Sound City Studios , Van Nuys and mixed at Bay 7 Studios , North Hollywood , California . The album was recorded and mixed by Alain Johannes , while it was produced by Josh Homme and Chris Goss as the <unk> <unk> . The primary contributors to the recording were Homme , Troy van Leeuwen , Joey Castillo , Johannes and Goss . 
 We basically started a year ago . And like I said , we didn ’ t really have anything written . So it was a long process . It was the longest I 've ever taken to make a record , frankly . I 've made records over the process of a year but this was the first time it 's ever been my total focus for that long . This was the first time I 've ever done that ... total focus for 10 months . 
 Goss and Johannes were replaced by Dean Fertita ( keyboard ) and Michael Shuman ( bass ) for later bonus track recordings and the subsequent supporting tour . Regarding the band 's line @-@ up changes for Era Vulgaris , Homme commented , " I like combinations that no one would expect … It 's the cool part of any surprise party . " 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Era Vulgaris displays influences from many different genres . The album departs from the softer , <unk> guitar sound of their previous album Lullabies to Paralyze with heavy , crunchy guitars and adding in some electronic influences . Rolling Stone noted the influence of " New Wave synth geek Gary Numan … all over this record . " Musically , the album has been described as " brand new retro " , a fusion of " punk , rock , blues and southern grit " ( FHM ) , and slower , moodier , and <unk> than the band 's previous efforts .

 Shortly after the album 's announcement in February 2007 , a video was posted on the band 's official website showing Homme , Castillo and Van Leeuwen jamming . Along with brief footage of the recording session for " Misfit Love " , the last 6 – 7 seconds of the video contained footage of the recording of " 3 's & 7 's " accompanied by studio @-@ mastered audio . A second video of the recording of the album surfaced subsequently on YouTube , depicting the band ( this time including Alain Johannes ) recording a new track , " Turning on the Screw " in studio . 
 In early April , the official band website was updated with a 37 second excerpt from " Sick , Sick , Sick " . This was replaced by the complete song , " 3 's and 7 's " , which was later removed . QOTSA fansite <unk> announced a promotional contest for fans to win " a special package " from the band , confirmed as legitimate by the band 's webmaster . On April 13 , packages were sent to selected winners containing a CD entitled You Know What You Did with the sole track " Era Vulgaris " , which Homme separately confirmed would not be appearing on the record , although it was included as a bonus track on the UK edition . The CD was accompanied by a handwritten letter asking fans to share the song in any way possible : 
 Hello friend - 
 Thank you for accepting this gift . Included you will find the will to dance & the song ERA <unk> . It was pulled from the new album ( of the same name ) so that it could be to you and become an example of how we think " from now on " should be . As in - We do for you , you do for us .

 Is it a new recipe on Rachel Ray 's site ? Is it a new Nickelback song on their board ? A secret Gov 't document ? Video game cheats ? Sex site password ? Fuckin ' whatever ? You decide . Then tell us how you shoved this song into the guts of the internet & we ( both ) can smile wide with pride at our new relationship .

 The full track " Sick , Sick , Sick " was leaked onto the Internet , countered by the posting of a promotional video to the official site featuring a " sales pitch " for Era Vulgaris by two talking lightbulbs , followed by a streaming of " Sick , Sick , Sick " with official lyrics displayed in the background . 
 On May 2 , 2007 , Homme , Van Leeuwen and new band member Dean Fertita appeared on London radio station Xfm , performing an acoustic set that included the tracks " 3 's & 7 's " , " Into the Hollow " and " Suture Up Your Future " . 
 It was announced that tracks from the band would appear in the video games Madden NFL 08 , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock and Rock Band , specifically that the track " 3 's & 7 's " would be featured in Madden NFL 08 and Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock . Both " 3 's & 7 's " and " Sick , Sick , Sick " are available as downloadable content on Rock Band and Rock Band 2 , as they share the same Music Store . In addition , " Make It Wit Chu " was later included in the tracklist of Guitar Hero 5 . 
 = = Artwork = = 
 The album 's cover features the two lightbulbs from the promotional video , Bulby and his pirate accomplice ( pictured right ) , marking a change from the plainer designs of the bands ' previous albums . According to Homme , the light bulb represented " … what you perceive to be a great idea that really is not that great of an idea " . The cover was a slip of paper , with a simplified credits page on the back side , marked with the outline of the record . The typography follows an Old English style font ; Blackmoor , with the ' <unk> Q ' seen on their album Songs for the Deaf . 
 An art booklet was also included , featuring " Bulby " and several other characters which unfolded to display a pin @-@ up advertisement for the album , following the 50 's advertising satire as the rest of the album art followed . The lack of liner notes for the album was remedied when the official website allowed users to view an e @-@ booklet , containing more detailed liner notes , lyrics , and previously unseen artwork . The green light bulb with the pirate hat , eye patch and peg leg is known as " Stumpy " . 
 Some copies of the album cover contain a red and yellow rectangle spoofing the Parental Advisory seal , reading " Rental Advisory : Freedom Not for Purchase " . Coincidentally , it was the first Queens of the Stone Age album since Rated R to not bear a genuine Parental Advisory seal . 
 The lightbulb characters were created by Morning Breath Inc. with overall art direction from Jason Noto and Doug Cunningham of Morning Breath Inc .

 Reviews for the album were generally positive , earning a rating of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic , a decline from their previous two studio albums . Uncut and Allmusic 's reviews were particularly glowing , with the latter noting how Era Vulgaris is " as different from Lullabies as that was to their dramatic widescreen breakthrough , Songs for the Deaf " . Originally awarding the album with a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star rating , Allmusic changed this to a four @-@ star rating in 2013 , upon the release of the band 's follow @-@ up , ... Like Clockwork . 
 The Observer also commented on the album 's change in direction , commenting that the band had " turned its back on the mainstream " and that the album was " uneasy and brooding " and " <unk> stuff " . Rolling Stone gave the album four stars for the first time since the band 's self titled debut , commenting that " Era Vulgaris is Homme 's fifth Queens album , and like the others , it 's intricately crafted , meticulously polished and ruthlessly efficient in its pursuit of depraved rock thrills . " New York Times critic Jon Pareles selected the album as the 10th best release of 2007 . 
 A number of reviews were negative , however ; Q magazine gave the album two stars out of five , while The Village Voice criticized Homme for lack of originality , describing the record 's sound as " listless and drained of ideas " . The Guardian slated the record as lyrically clichéd and lacking the input of former bassist Nick Oliveri , and Entertainment Weekly delivered the closing indictment that " there isn 't a single song here that you 'll remember , or want to return to , two summers hence . " 
 Era Vulgaris had sold 198 @,@ 000 copies in the US , and 521 @,@ 000 copies worldwide before falling off the charts . The US sales are a decline from their previous album , as Lullabies to Paralyze , had sold 342 @,@ 000 copies in the US by March 2007 .

 = SMS Yorck = 
 SMS Yorck ( " His Majesty 's Ship Yorck " ) was the second and final ship of the Roon class of armored cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy . Yorck was named for Ludwig Yorck von <unk> , a Prussian field marshal . She was laid down in 1903 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg , and finished in November 1905 , at the cost of 16 @,@ 241 @,@ 000 marks . She displaced up to 9 @,@ 875 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 719 long tons ; 10 @,@ 885 short tons ) and was armed with a main battery of four 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns . Her top speed was 20 @.@ 4 knots ( 37 @.@ 8 km / h ; 23 @.@ 5 mph ) . 
 The ship had a short career ; she served with the fleet for the first seven years , after which she was decommissioned and placed in reserve . After the outbreak of World War I , she was reactivated and returned to front @-@ line service . After returning from the raid on Yarmouth on 3 – 4 November 1914 , the ship made a navigational error in heavy fog and accidentally sailed into a German defensive minefield . The ship sank quickly with heavy loss of life , though sources disagree on the exact number of fatalities . Her commander was court @-@ martialled and imprisoned for disobedience and negligent homicide . Yorck was broken up incrementally , with work occurring in 1929 – 30 , 1965 , and finally completed in 1982 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Yorck was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Deutschland and built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 167 . Her keel was laid in 1902 and she was launched on 14 May 1904 . Fitting @-@ out work was completed by 21 November 1905 , being commissioned into the Imperial German Navy the same day . She had cost the Imperial German Government 16 @,@ 241 @,@ 000 Goldmarks . 
 Yorck displaced 9 @,@ 087 t ( 8 @,@ 943 long tons ) as built and 9 @,@ 875 t ( 9 @,@ 719 long tons ) fully loaded , with a length of 126 @.@ 50 m ( 415 ft 0 in ) , a beam of 19 @.@ 60 m ( 64 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 43 m ( 24 ft 5 in ) forward . She was powered by three vertical triple expansion engines , which developed a total of 17 @,@ 272 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 880 kW ) and yielded a maximum speed of 20 @.@ 4 knots ( 37 @.@ 8 km / h ; 23 @.@ 5 mph ) on trials . She carried up to 1 @,@ 630 t ( 1 @,@ 600 long tons ) of coal , which enabled a maximum range of up to 5 @,@ 080 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 410 km ; 5 @,@ 850 mi ) at a cruising speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 She was armed with four 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns arranged in two twin gun turrets , one on either end of the superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of ten 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns , four in single turrets arranged two each on either side , the rest in casemates amidships , fourteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns and four 45 cm ( 18 in ) underwater torpedo tubes , one in the bow , one in the stern , and one on both beams .

 Yorck was launched on 14 May 1904 , and commissioned into the German navy on 21 November 1905 . At the commissioning Field Marshal Wilhelm von <unk> spoke , saying , " old wisdom , si vis pacem , para bellum — he who wants peace shall be prepared for war ... may the guns and machines of the Yorck be operated only by men with iron hearts and an iron will , men who know no other order than to put their lives at risk when the might , the greatness and honor of the German people are being fought for . " After her commissioning , Yorck served with the fleet in the cruiser squadron . In 1908 – 1909 , Erich Raeder served aboard the ship as Yorck 's navigation officer . From 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912 , Franz von Hipper , later commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the German navy , served as the ship 's commanding officer . 
 In early March 1913 , the fleet conducted maneuvers off the island of Helgoland in the North Sea . Early on 4 March , the destroyer <unk> fell out of formation in heavy seas and attempted to cross in front of Yorck . The destroyer was caught by a large wave and thrown into Yorck , which cut <unk> in half . Out of a crew of 83 men , only 13 were pulled from the stormy sea . Yorck was decommissioned and laid up in the reserve fleet in May 1913 with most of her crew transferring to the newly completed battlecruiser Seydlitz . Hipper , by now the deputy commander of the battlecruiser squadron , stated that " the Seydlitz has a fine spirit and high morale , having carried over the spirit of the old Yorck crew . " On 12 August 1914 Yorck was recommissioned and assigned to III Scouting Group . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 On 3 November , Yorck participated in the first offensive operation of the war conducted by the German fleet . She augmented the forces assigned to the I Scouting Group , which primarily consisted of the battlecruisers Seydlitz , Moltke , and Von der Tann and the large armored cruiser Blücher . The I Scouting Group , commanded by Rear Admiral Hipper , was ordered to bombard Great Yarmouth on the English coast . The four large cruisers bombarded the port but inflicted little damage ; minelayers laid minefields off the coast , which sank British submarine D5 . Upon returning to the Heligoland Bight late that day , Hipper 's forces encountered heavy fog . The fog prevented the ships from entering Wilhelmshaven ; instead , they anchored for the night in the Schillig roadstead . Yorck attempted to enter Wilhelmshaven early on the 4th , but her crew made a navigational error which led the ship into a German defensive minefield . She struck two mines , and capsized and sank with heavy loss of life . 
 Sources disagree on the exact figures ; V. E. Tarrant 's Jutland : The German Perspective , states that 127 men out of a crew of 629 were rescued , while Erich Gröner 's German Warships 1815 – 1945 indicates that there were only 336 fatalities . Daniel Butler 's Distant Victory states that " some 235 " men perished in the sinking . The Norddeutsche Volksblatt reported " the loss of over 300 men " at the time of the court @-@ martial on the sinking ; this report was echoed around the world . 
 Yorck 's commanding officer , Captain Piper , was among those rescued . In December 1914 he was court @-@ martialled and sentenced to two years ' imprisonment for negligence , disobedience of orders , and homicide through negligence . The ship 's wreck was partially scrapped in 1929 – 30 ; more work was done in 1965 , though the ship was not completely removed until work resumed in 1982 . 
 = Sheamus = 
 Stephen Farrelly ( Irish : <unk> Ó <unk> ; born 28 January 1978 ) is an Irish professional wrestler and actor . He is signed to the American professional wrestling promotion WWE , where he performs under the ring name Sheamus ( pronounced / <unk> / ) shortened from his previous ring name Sheamus O 'Shaunessy . 
 Prior to joining WWE , Farrelly wrestled on the European circuit and was a two @-@ time International Heavyweight Champion during his tenure in Irish Whip Wrestling ( IWW ) . 
 After becoming part of the WWE main roster in 2009 , he would go on to be a four @-@ time world champion in WWE , having held the WWE ( World Heavyweight ) Championship three times and the World Heavyweight Championship once . He is also a two @-@ time United States Champion . In addition to these championships , he has won the 2010 King of the Ring tournament , the 2012 Royal Rumble match and the 2015 Money in the Bank ladder match , making him only the second wrestler ( after Edge ) to achieve all three accomplishments . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Farrelly was born in Cabra , Dublin , Ireland and was raised in the city . He speaks fluent Irish , having attended Scoil <unk> Primary and Coláiste <unk> Secondary School , a Gaelscoil . During his school years , he sang in the Palestrina Choir until the age of 13 ; during this time , he appeared on the Late Late Show and Live at Three . He played Gaelic football for the Erin 's Isle team where once he was proclaimed sports star of the month . He also played rugby for the National College of Ireland , where he gained a National Diploma . He has been a fan of Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. since childhood and also supports both rugby union clubs London Irish and Leinster and rugby league club the New Zealand Warriors . He is a former IT technician , and also worked as security for a nightclub , which led to him to occasionally working as a bodyguard for Bono and Larry Mullen , Jr. of U2 , as well as Denise van Outen .

 = = = Training and character development ( 2002 – 2004 ) = = = 
 Farrelly 's inspiration into a professional wrestling career came from watching both British wrestling from ITV 's World of Sport and American wrestling from the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) on Sky One . On the advice of Bret Hart , Farrelly began training in Larry Sharpe 's Monster Factory wrestling school in April 2002 , alongside Tank Toland , Cliff Compton , and Cindy Rogers . Six weeks later he officially debuted as a fan favorite under the name Sheamus O 'Shaunessy against Robert Pigeon . It was during this time that he developed the nickname the " Irish Curse " after low @-@ blowing an opponent . He soon suffered a serious neck injury after botching a hip toss which sidetracked his career for two years . 
 Farrelly soon developed his wrestling character by drawing on Celtic mythology . Wanting to move away from limiting Irish stereotypes of lucky charms , leprechauns , and alcoholism , he instead wanted to portray an Irish warrior . Going to a Gaelscoil , <unk> grew up aware of the four cycles of Irish mythology and , inspired by the artwork of Jim Fitzpatrick , incorporated the sword and axe @-@ wielding imagery into his gimmick . This included the design of his own pendant , the <unk> , which combines the Celtic cross with a Celtic War sword to illustrate his character 's " indigenous origins with a hybrid of warrior strength matched with a strong ethical centre " . 
 = = = Irish Whip Wrestling ( 2004 – 2006 ) = = = 
 In May 2004 , still using the ring name Sheamus O 'Shaunessy , Farrelly returned to wrestling at the newly opened Irish Whip Wrestling ( IWW ) school in Dublin . He then made his debut match for the promotion at their Mount Temple show on 9 July against Mark Burns , where he picked out an easy win . He went on to win a battle royal the following month . 
 O 'Shaunessy spent the rest of the year engaged in a rivalry with Vid Vain after losing to his tag team partner Joey <unk> the same night he won the battle royal . On 22 and 23 October they traded wins , leading to O 'Shaunessy recruiting help from CJ Summers to help defeat the tag team on 24 October . O 'Shaunessy was still unsuccessful to defeat Vain in singles action the following day . Despite these losses , his impressive showings earned him a place against Alex Shane in a guest match for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance ( FWA ) British Heavyweight Championship . Although he put on a proficient exhibit and came close to win , his friend Red Vinny interfered in the match and cost him the championship . 
 In March 2005 , he avenged this loss by teaming with Raven to defeat Shane and Vinny . This victory was part of a winning streak over the end of March where O 'Shaunessy wrestled twice a day on 24 , 25 , 26 – including an 11 @-@ man Rumble win – and 27 March with a standard tag match and a ten @-@ man tag team match . This series of victories , aside from one loss by disqualification to Vain , put him to a good form for the one @-@ day tournament held in County Kildare to crown the inaugural IWW International Heavyweight Champion . On 28 March , O 'Shaunessy put an end to his main rivalries when he defeated Vinny and then Vain in the quarter and semi finals , respectively . He met Darren Burridge in the final match and won to become IWW 's first champion , but had to compete again in an evening show in Dublin , defeating Burridge and Vinny once more in a tag match alongside Vain . 
 O 'Shaunessy 's first successful title defence came against Burridge the following month but Burridge would not let his grudge rest , continuing to attack O 'Shaunessy and finally costing him the title during a match against D 'Lo Brown on 29 May . O 'Shaunessy earned revenge in July by defeating Burridge in a grudge match , though lost to him in an arm wrestling contest the following day . Still , he continued on his quest to regain the title by winning a contendership three way match against Vinny and Red Viper in August setting him up to regain the International Heavyweight Championship in October from Brown in Newcastle upon Tyne in England . 
 After defending his title against Vampiro and Viper , O 'Shaunessy found himself embroiled in a new feud with rising Scottish wrestling star " Thee " Drew Galloway , whom he later admitted was his toughest opponent . On 28 January 2006 , he received his first championship match , evolving their rivalry from previous non @-@ title contests . The rivalry quickly took on a patriotic flavour , with Galloway 's blue colours of Scotland clashing O <unk> 's green colours of Ireland , mirroring the Old Firm football derby between Rangers and Celtic , respectively . This football allusion became particularly prominent when the two met again at Verona Football Club again for the title , though the match changed into a Lumberjack match , the result and champion remained the same . 
 With Galloway defeated , O 'Shaunessy continued to dominate by again defending his title against Vampiro on 17 March . Galloway earned himself a two out of three falls match against the champion the following day , however , which O 'Shaunessy won two falls to one ; the next day produced the same result in a match O 'Shaunessy claimed was his best on the independent circuit . With Galloway briefly answered , O 'Shaunessy took on the newcomer Pierre <unk> and defeated him in two successive title matches only to find Galloway had earned another shot . With their rivalry intensifying , Galloway 's next challenge to O <unk> was given the stipulation of a Last Man Standing match . O 'Shaunessy retained the title , as he also did in June with the same stipulation . Finally , on 28 August , O 'Shaunessy lost the IWW International Heavyweight Championship in a singles match to Galloway in what would be his last appearance with the promotion .

 As well as wrestling in Ireland , O 'Shaunessy occasionally travelled to Great Britain to make appearances on the British independent circuit . In April 2006 he was brought into Wales ' Celtic Wrestling promotion as a contender for their top title but was defeated by the champion , Chris Recall . Later that year in November , he was employed by London 's LDN Wrestling to appear on their Capital TV show where , after quickly defeating William Hill , he gained an LDN Championship match against Tex Benedict which ended with Benedict winning by disqualification and O 'Shaunessy attacking him after the match . 
 During his time overseas he worked for Brian Dixon 's All Star Wrestling , which gave him a taste of large audiences that he had not experienced in Ireland , as well as wrestling English veteran Robbie Brookside and other British wrestling luminaries , including Nigel McGuinness and Doug Williams . He also represented the UK in a Battle of the Nations tag team match between the UK and Austria alongside Drew McDonald and The Celtic Warrior in a losing effort against Chris <unk> , Michael Kovac , and Robert Ray Kreuzer at the European Wrestling Association 's Night of Gladiators . 
 As well as making top contender appearances based on his growing reputation , O 'Shaunessy also brought with him to Britain his long @-@ standing rivalry with Galloway . He had already wrestled in Galloway 's home promotion , British Championship Wrestling ( BCW ) , twice in 2005 , losing to Jay Phoenix on the day before Phoenix lost to Galloway in March , and returning in September to defeat one of BCW 's top stars , Wolfgang , via countout . In the middle of their IWW feud the following year , O 'Shaunessy went back to Scotland to take part in BCW 's Path To Glory tour , defeating Galloway on the first night but conceding a loss to him the next night in May . Though their feud finished in Ireland in August 2006 , it continued on across the Irish Sea when the two wrestled for the umbrella promotion Real Quality Wrestling ( RQW ) the following year . The two first met during April 's Taking On The World show which ended in a double countout . The lack of a decision led to a rematch in June , and one of O 'Shaunessy 's last on the independent circuit , where Galloway picked up the victory in a No Holds Barred match ahead of an RQW Heavyweight Championship match .

 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Kawada 's musical style mainly fuses rock with trance . When Kawada debuted in 2001 , she originally felt that the music she earned in her career was pocket money . She also felt happy that she could be based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends , as well as to I 've Sound whom she felt was like a second family to her . After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004 , I 've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut . At first , she was a bit hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight , but eventually she accepted the idea . For the first ten years of her career , she always felt that she was a beginner , but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister . 
 In an interview with Famitsu , Kawada related her experience writing the lyrics for " Joint " . Kawada said that she was challenged in writing lyrics for the song , since her previous single " Get My Way " was different from her previous singles . Kawada would read the source material of every anime before writing lyrics for its theme songs . She named the song " Joint " because of Shana II 's theme of characters Shana and Yūji Sakai fighting together . In response to comments that the expressions in her voice were very varied , Kawada stated that she simply sings with the music in the way that she most enjoys . 
 Kawada 's primary producer was I 've producer Tomoyuki Nakazawa , who produced " Radiance " as well as her first three albums . Nakazawa also came up with each album 's concept and title . However , in 2010 , Kawada began to cooperate more with other producers . She also began working more in Tokyo . When producing Square the Circle , Nakazawa asked Kawada what sort of album and what sort of songs did she want . Kawada said that she wanted an album whose songs would be reminiscent of her visual image and stage persona , as opposed to her private self . 
 In making the album Parablepsia , Kawada describes the concept of the album as " <unk> " , which stands for " Electric . Mami Kawada . Rock " . She considers " Borderland " to be most representative of her style , so she wanted to make an album which included songs which sounded similar to it . Originally , she only wanted a single song to convey the theme of the album , but for Parablepsia , several songs do . This includes the title song " Parablepsia " , which she describes as a song about not losing yourself in a society which moves around in circles , " Fly Blind " , which is a song about not always allowing yourself to be influenced by society , " Eager Eyes " , which is the song in the album which has the closest style to " Borderland " , " It 's no big deal " , which takes inspiration from a phrase that her father used to say to her , and " Dendritic Quartz " , which is about flowers which constantly bloom and will never wither ; " Dendritic Quartz " takes inspiration from a pendant she owns which has a pattern of trees .

 = Gargi Vachaknavi = 
 Gargi Vachaknavi ( born about 700 BC ) was an ancient Indian philosopher . In Vedic Literature , she is honored as a great natural philosopher , renowned expounder of the Vedas , and known as <unk> , a person with knowledge of Brahma Vidya . In the Sixth and the eighth Brahmana of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , her name is prominent as she participates in the <unk> , a philosophic debate organized by King Janaka of Videha and challenges the sage Yajnavalkya with perplexing questions on the issue of atman ( soul ) . She is also said to have written many hymns in the Rigveda . She remained a celibate all her life and was held in veneration by the conventional Hindus . 
 Gargi , the daughter of sage <unk> in the lineage of sage Garga ( 800 @-@ 500 BCE ) was named after her father as Gargi Vachaknavi . From a young age she evinced keen interest in Vedic scriptures and became very proficient in fields of philosophy . She became highly knowledgeable in Vedas and Upanishads in the Vedic times and held intellectual debates with the male @-@ philosophers .

 Gargi was the daughter of sage <unk> in the lineage of sage Garga ( 800 @-@ 500 BCE ) and hence named after her father as Gargi Vachaknavi . Right from a young age , Vachaknavi was very intellectual . She acquired knowledge of the Vedas and scriptures and became renowned for her proficiency in these fields of philosophy ; she even surpassed men in her knowledge . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Gargi , along with <unk> <unk> and Sulabha Maitreyi are among the prominent females who figure in the Upanishads . She was as knowledgeable in Vedas and Upanishads as men of the Vedic times and could very well contest the male @-@ philosophers in <unk> name appears in the <unk> Sutras of <unk> . She had even awakened her Kundalini ( indwelling spiritual energy ) . In her dialogue with Pandit Mandan Mishra on the subject of sex she had won her arguments as she was a realized soul . She was a leading scholar who also made rich contributions to propagate education . 
 = = Debate with Yajnavalkya = = 
 According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , King Janaka of Videha Kingdom held a <unk> Yagna and invited all the learned sages , kings and princess of India to participate . The yagna lasted for many days . Large quantities of sandalwood , ghee ( clarified butter ) and barley ( cereal grain ) were offered to the Yagna fire creating an atmosphere of spiritual sanctity and aroma . Janaka himself being a scholar was impressed with the large gathering of learned sages . He thought of selecting a scholar from the assembled group of elite scholars , the most accomplished of them all who had maximum knowledge about Brahman . For this purpose , he evolved a plan and offered a prize of 1 @,@ 000 cows with each cow dangled with 10 grams of gold on its horns . The galaxy of scholars , apart from others , included the renowned sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi Vachaknavi . Yajnavalkya , who was aware that he was the most spiritually knowledgeable among the assembled gathering , as he had mastered the art of Kundalini Yoga , ordered his disciple <unk> to drive away the cow herd to his house . This infuriated the scholars as they felt that he was taking way the prize without contesting in a debate . Some of the local pundits ( scholars ) did not volunteer for debate with him as they were not sure of their knowledge . However , there were eight renowned sages who challenged him for a debate , which included Gargi , the only lady in the assembled gathering of the learned . 
 Sages like <unk> , the priest in Janaka 's court , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Uddalaka debated with him and asked questions philosophical subjects to which Yajnavalkya provided convincing replies and they lost the debate . It was then the turn of Gargi to take up the challenge . Gargi , as one of the disputants in the debate , questioned Yajnavalkya on his claim of superiority among the scholars . She held repeated arguments with him . Gargi and Yajnavalkya 's exchange centered on the ultimate " warp " of reality ( " warp " means " the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity ) . Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical , such as unending status of the soul , away from practical situations . She then changed her approach and asked him pointed questions related to the environment existing in the world , the question of the very origin of all existence . Her question was specific when she asked him " since this whole world is woven back and forth on water , on what then is woven back and forth " , a question that related to the commonly known cosmological metaphor that expressed the unity of the world , its essential interconnectedness . In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ( 3 @.@ 6 ) , the sequence of her posing a bevy of questions to Yajnavalkya and his replies is narrated as : 
 She continued with an array of questions such as what was the universe of the suns , what were the moon , the stars , the gods , Indra , and Prajapati . Gargi then pressed on with two more questions . Gargi urged Yajnavalkya to enlighten her on the weave of reality and asked : 
 Gargi was not satisfied and then posed the next question : 
 Then she asked a final question , on what was Brahman ( world of the imperishable ) ? <unk> put an end to the debate by telling Gargi not to proceed further as other wise she would lose her mental balance . This riposte put an end to their further dialogue at the conference of the learned . However , at the end of the debate she conceded to the superior knowledge of Yajnavalkya by saying : " venerable Brahmins , you may consider it a great thing if you get off bowing before him . No one , I believe , will defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman . " 
 Her philosophical views also find mention in the Chandogya Upanishad . Gargi , as <unk> , composed several hymns in Rigveda ( in X 39 . <unk> ) that questioned the origin of all existence . The Yoga Yajnavalkya , a classical text on Yoga is a dialogue between Gargi and sage Yajnavalkya . Gargi was honoured as one of the <unk> ( nine gems ) in the court of King Janaka of Mithila .

 = = Production = = 
 Even though " He That Believeth in Me " is the continuation of the season three finale , " Crossroads , Part 2 " , the episode is often referred to as the third episode in the fourth season , since the producers widely regard Razor as the first two episodes in production . In the battle sequence for the teaser of the episode , Ronald D. Moore wanted to keep " the ring ship " ( later known in the series as the Zephyr ) from being destroyed , as he had gotten fond of the ship , and always wanted to have the interior of the ship in some sequences , so the ship was only damaged in the episode instead . 
 Moore called the battle sequence " remarkable " , even though the series had already included several space battles . Moore felt they were not going to top the previous ones , but the visual effects team were able to pull it off as " the best battle sequence we 've ever done . " A scene cut from the teaser 's battle sequence showed Samuel Anders aiming his Viper 's guns at Diana <unk> 's ship after discovering his Cylon nature . Another Anders cut scene focused on cutting the cast off his leg , due to the absence of his leg injury sustained from " The Son Also Rises " . With Baltar 's storyline , the writers refer to the rooms used by his cult as " Baltar 's lair " . Also , as the writers were aware that Baltar himself was visually similar to Jesus , Moore points out that he is not Jesus , though he admitted that the visual similarities help to " drive some things home " . 
 Aaron Douglas , who portrays Galen Tyrol , attempted an ad lib on one of his scenes . On that particular scene , Tyrol told the Viper pilots in the hangar , " Let 's go , nuggets ! Your <unk> aren 't going to save ya today . " In one take , Douglas replaced this with " drop your dicks and grab your sticks ! " According to Douglas , " five seconds later Harvey [ <unk> ] ( producer ) says from video village , ' you can 't say dicks on TV ' . We had to do it again . [ ... ] It 's great to be back but it 's sad to see it go . " 
 The scene where Saul Tigh has the vision of shooting William Adama was not filmed in one shot , but was edited in such a way that the cut would only become noticeable if one looks at the scene closely . Moore considered cutting the scene despite loving it , but eventually decided to keep it .

 = Caelum = 
 Caelum / <unk> / is a faint constellation in the southern sky , introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations . Its name means “ chisel ” in Latin , and it was formerly known as Caelum <unk> ( “ the engravers ’ chisel ” ) ; It is a rare word , unrelated to the far more common Latin <unk> , meaning “ sky , heaven , atmosphere ” . It is the eighth @-@ smallest constellation , and subtends a solid angle of around 0 @.@ 038 <unk> , just less than that of Corona Australis . 
 Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way , Caelum is a rather barren constellation , with few objects of interest . The constellation 's brightest star , Alpha Caeli , is only of magnitude 4 @.@ 45 , and only one other star , ( Gamma ) γ 1 Caeli , is brighter than magnitude 5 . Other notable objects in Caelum are RR Caeli , a binary star with one known planet approximately 20 @.@ 13 parsecs ( 65 @.@ 7 ly ) away ; X Caeli , a Delta Scuti variable that forms an optical double with γ 1 Caeli ; and <unk> @-@ 2958 , a Seyfert galaxy that at first appeared as just a jet , with no host galaxy visible . 
 = = History = = 
 Caelum was first introduced in the eighteenth century by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille , a French astronomer who introduced thirteen other southern constellations at the same time . Lacaille gave the constellation the French name Burin , which was originally Latinized to Caelum <unk> ( “ The Engravers ’ Chisel ” ) . 
 Francis Baily shortened this name to Caelum , as suggested by John Herschel . In Lacaille 's original chart , the constellation was shown both as a burin and an <unk> , although it has come to be recognized simply as a chisel . Johann Elert Bode stated the name as plural with a singular possessor , <unk> <unk> – in German ( die ) <unk> ( “ the Engraver ’ s <unk> ” ) – but this did not stick . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Caelum is bordered by Dorado and Pictor to the south , Horologium and Eridanus to the east , Lepus to the north , and Columba to the west . Covering only 125 square degrees , it ranks 81st of the 88 modern constellations in size . It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Southern Hemisphere 's summer , and the whole constellation is visible for at least part of the year to observers south of latitude 41 ° N. Its main asterism consists of four stars , and twenty stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . 
 The constellation ’ s boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a 12 @-@ sided polygon . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 04h <unk> and 05h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 27 @.@ 02 ° and − 48 @.@ 74 ° . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) adopted the three @-@ letter abbreviation “ Cae ” for the constellation in 1922 .

 Caelum is a faint constellation : It has no star brighter than magnitude 4 and only two stars brighter than magnitude 5 . 
 Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations , labeling them Alpha ( α ) to Zeta ( ζ ) in 1756 , but omitted Epsilon ( ε ) and designated two adjacent stars as Gamma ( γ ) . Bode extended the designations to Rho ( ρ ) for other stars , but most of these have fallen out of use . Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear Flamsteed designations . 
 The brightest star , ( Alpha ) α Caeli , is a double star , containing an F @-@ type main @-@ sequence star of magnitude 4 @.@ 45 and a red dwarf of magnitude 12 @.@ 5 , 20 @.@ 17 parsecs ( 65 @.@ 8 ly ) from Earth . ( Beta ) β Caeli , another F @-@ type star of magnitude 5 @.@ 05 , is further away , being located 28 @.@ 67 parsecs ( 93 @.@ 5 ly ) from Earth . Unlike α , β Caeli is a subgiant star , slightly evolved from the main sequence . ( Delta ) δ Caeli , also of magnitude 5 @.@ 05 , is a B @-@ type subgiant and is much farther from Earth , at 216 parsecs ( 700 ly ) . 
 ( Gamma ) γ 1 Caeli is a double @-@ star with a red giant primary of magnitude 4 @.@ 58 and a secondary of magnitude 8 @.@ 1 . The primary is 55 @.@ 59 parsecs ( 181 @.@ 3 ly ) from Earth . The two components are difficult to resolve with small amateur telescopes because of their difference in visual magnitude and their close separation . This star system forms an optical double with the unrelated X Caeli ( previously named γ 2 Caeli ) , a Delta Scuti variable located 98 @.@ 33 parsecs ( 320 @.@ 7 ly ) from Earth . These are a class of short @-@ period ( six hours at most ) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology . X Caeli itself is also a binary star , specifically a contact binary , meaning that the stars are so close that they share envelopes . The only other variable star in Caelum visible to the naked eye is RV Caeli , a pulsating red giant of spectral type M1III , which varies between magnitudes 6 @.@ 44 and 6 @.@ 56 . 
 Three other stars in Caelum are still occasionally referred to by their Bayer designations , although they are only on the edge of naked @-@ eye visibility . ( Nu ) ν Caeli is another double star , containing a white giant of magnitude 6 @.@ 07 and a star of magnitude 10 @.@ 66 , with unknown spectral type . The system is approximately 52 @.@ 55 parsecs ( 171 @.@ 4 ly ) away . ( Lambda ) λ Caeli , at magnitude 6 @.@ 24 , is much redder and farther away , being a red giant around 227 parsecs ( 740 ly ) from Earth . ( Zeta ) ζ Caeli is even fainter , being only of magnitude 6 @.@ 36 . This star , located 132 parsecs ( 430 ly ) away , is a K @-@ type subgiant of spectral type K1 . The other twelve naked @-@ eye stars in Caelum are not referred to by Bode 's Bayer designations anymore , including RV Caeli . 
 One of the nearest stars in Caelum is the eclipsing binary star RR Caeli , at a distance of 20 @.@ 13 parsecs ( 65 @.@ 7 ly ) . This star system consists of a dim red dwarf and a white dwarf . Despite its closeness to the Earth , the system 's apparent magnitude is only 14 @.@ 40 due to the faintness of its components , and thus it cannot be easily seen with amateur equipment . In 2012 , the system was found to contain a giant planet , and there is evidence for a second substellar body . The system is a post @-@ common @-@ envelope binary and is losing angular momentum over time , which will eventually cause mass transfer from the red dwarf to the white dwarf . In approximately 9 – 20 billion years , this will cause the system to become a cataclysmic variable . 
 = = = Deep @-@ sky objects = = = 
 Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way , Caelum is rather devoid of deep @-@ sky objects , and contains no Messier objects . The only deep @-@ sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is <unk> @-@ 2958 , an unusual Seyfert galaxy . Originally , the jet 's host galaxy proved elusive to find , and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing . Although it has been suggested that the object is an ejected supermassive black hole , the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy .

 The London Necropolis Railway was a railway line opened in November 1854 by the London Necropolis Company ( LNC ) , to carry cadavers and mourners between London and the LNC 's newly opened Brookwood Cemetery 23 miles ( 37 km ) southwest of London in Brookwood , Surrey . At the time the largest cemetery in the world , Brookwood Cemetery was designed to be large enough to accommodate all the deaths in London for centuries to come , and the LNC hoped to gain a monopoly on London 's burial industry . The cemetery had intentionally been built far enough from London so as never to be affected by urban growth and was dependent on the recently invented railway to connect it to the city . 
 The railway mostly ran along the existing tracks of the London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) but had its own branches from the main line at both London and Brookwood . Trains carried coffins and passengers from a dedicated station in Waterloo , London , onto the LSWR tracks . On reaching the cemetery , the trains reversed down a dedicated branch line to two stations in the cemetery , one for the burial of Anglicans and one for Nonconformists ( non @-@ Anglicans ) and those who did not want a Church of England funeral . The station waiting rooms and the compartments of the train , both for living and for dead passengers , were partitioned by both religion and class to prevent both mourners and cadavers from different social backgrounds from mixing . As well as the regular funeral traffic , the London Necropolis Railway was used to transport large numbers of exhumed bodies during the mass removal of a number of London graveyards to Brookwood . 
 The company failed to gain a monopoly of the burial industry , and the scheme was not as successful as its promoters had hoped . While they had planned to carry between 10 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 bodies per year , in 1941 after 87 years of operation , only slightly over 200 @,@ 000 burials had been conducted in Brookwood Cemetery , equalling roughly 2 @,@ 300 bodies per year . 
 On the night of 16 – 17 April 1941 , the London terminus was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable . Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery , the London Necropolis Railway was never used again . Soon after the end of the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space , and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed . The part of the London building which housed the LNC 's offices survives today . The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished . The site of the northern station , serving the Nonconformist cemetery , is now heavily overgrown . The site of the southern , Anglican , station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr , which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels . 
 = = London burial crisis = = 
 London 's dead had traditionally been buried in and around local churches , and with a limited amount of space for burials , the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials . In the first half of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled , from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851 . Despite this rapid growth in population , the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300 acres ( 0 @.@ 5 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) , spread across around 200 small sites . <unk> became very congested . Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera , smallpox , measles and typhoid . Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory ( the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease ) , and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern . A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London 's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one . 
 In 1848 – 49 a cholera epidemic killed 14 @,@ 601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely . Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial , and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials . 
 = = = Proposed solutions = = = 
 In the wake of public concerns following the cholera epidemics and the findings of the Royal Commission , the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis ( Burials Act ) was passed in 1851 . Under the Burials Act , new burials were prohibited in what were then the built @-@ up areas of London . Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or were in the process of opening , and temporarily became London 's main burial grounds . The government sought a means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds . Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery northwest of the city , which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London . A large tract of land on the Thames around 9 miles ( 14 km ) southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London . The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick 's scheme would ever be financially viable , and it was widely unpopular . Although the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 authorised the scheme , it was abandoned in 1852 . 
 = = London Necropolis Company = = 
 An alternative proposal was drawn up by Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye , who planned to use the emerging technology of mechanised transport to resolve the crisis . The scheme entailed buying a single very large tract of land around 23 miles ( 37 km ) from London in Brookwood near Woking , Surrey , to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis . At this distance , the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city 's growth . The London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) — which had connected London to Woking in 1838 — would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply . Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains , each carrying 50 – 60 bodies , travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night , and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral . Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day . 
 Broun calculated that a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 3 sq mi ; 6 @.@ 1 km2 ) site would accommodate a total of 5 @,@ 830 @,@ 500 individual graves in a single layer . If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted , the site was capable of accommodating 28 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 bodies . Assuming 50 @,@ 000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave , Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of the cemetery . Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London , Broun and Sprye argued that the speed of the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries , all of which required a slow and expensive horse @-@ drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site . 
 Shareholders in the LSWR were concerned at the impact the cemetery scheme would have on the normal operations of the railway . At a shareholders ' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted . The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators , other than promising them the use of one train each day . Charles Blomfield , Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes , arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service . Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train , and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives . 
 On 30 June 1852 the promoters of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed , and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company ( LNC ) was formed . The former Woking Common near Brookwood , owned by the Earl of Onslow , was chosen as the site for the new cemetery . To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery , the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic , but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate . 
 Broun 's scheme had envisaged the cemetery running along both sides of the LSWR main line and divided by religion , with separate private railway halts on the main line , each incorporating a chapel , to serve each religion 's section . The new consulting engineer to the company , William Cubitt , rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line , served by a private branch line through the cemetery . The company also considered Broun 's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic , arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased 's family . 
 Internal disputes within the LNC led to Broun and Sprye losing control of the scheme , and later delays and allegations of mismanagement caused further changes to the scheme 's management . In September 1853 under a new board of trustees work began on the scheme . A site for the London rail terminus was identified and leased , and a 2 @,@ 200 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 4 sq mi ; 8 @.@ 9 km2 ) tract of land stretching from Woking to Brookwood was purchased from Lord Onslow . The westernmost 400 acres ( 0 @.@ 62 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) , at the Brookwood end , were designated the initial cemetery site , and a branch railway line was built from the main line into this section . On 7 November 1854 the new cemetery opened and the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner , Bishop of Winchester . At the time it was the largest cemetery in the world . On 13 November the first scheduled train left the new London Necropolis railway station for the cemetery , and the first burial ( that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street , Borough ) took place . 
 = = Cemetery railway branch = = 
 William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch at the west of the cemetery . Work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854 . The single @-@ track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later , at a total construction cost of £ 1419 17s 6d ( about £ 115 @,@ 000 in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) . The junction with the LSWR , known as Necropolis Junction , was west @-@ facing , meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch . No run @-@ around loop was provided at Necropolis Junction , and a single crossover allowed trains from the Necropolis branch to reverse onto the northern ( London @-@ bound ) track of the LSWR . 
 The new branch ran east from Necropolis Junction on a downhill gradient . After passing through white gates marking the boundary of the cemetery , it curved south into the northern , Nonconformist section of the cemetery , the site of North station . The line straightened and ran southeast over a level crossing across Cemetery Pales , the road dividing the northern and southern halves of the initial cemetery site . After crossing Cemetery Pales the branch turned east and ran through the southern , Anglican , section of the cemetery , terminating at South station near the road from Bagshot to Guildford ( today the <unk> ) which marked the eastern boundary of the site . Along with the major roads and paths in the cemetery , the entire branch was lined with giant sequoia trees , the first significant planting of these trees ( only introduced to Europe in 1853 ) in Britain . Aside from a short 100 @-@ yard ( 91 m ) siding just south of Cemetery Pales , built in 1904 – 05 to serve the LNC 's new masonry workshop , the layout of the branch remained unchanged throughout its operation . In 1914 a brick water tower was added near the masonry works siding , to allow the LNC 's locomotives to refill their tanks before returning to London and thus avoid the need to interrupt their journey to refill at Woking . 
 The poor quality gravel soil , which had been the initial reason for the site 's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery , was poorly suited as a railway trackbed . The LNC 's rails , and in particular its sleepers , deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced . 
 In the early years of the cemetery 's operation , the locomotives hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery , as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey . Instead , the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction , and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine . A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations . While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line . 
 In 1864 Brookwood ( Necropolis ) railway station on the LSWR opened , immediately east of Necropolis Junction . In conjunction with the building of the station a run @-@ around loop was added at Necropolis Junction , allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front to the rear of the train . From then on , on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned , but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear , under the close supervision of LNC staff . This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery , after which it would use the run @-@ around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London . Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks ; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line . Brookwood station was rebuilt , and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines . 
 = = Operations = = 
 The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals , which also determined the type of railway ticket sold to mourners and the deceased . A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral to select the grave site of their choice anywhere in the cemetery ; at the time of opening prices began at £ 2 10s ( about £ 212 in 2016 terms ) for a basic 9 @-@ by @-@ 4 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m × 1 @.@ 2 m ) plot with no special coffin specifications . It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral . Second class funerals cost £ 1 ( about £ 85 in 2016 terms ) and allowed some control over the burial location . The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings ( about £ 42 in 2016 terms ) ; if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re @-@ use the grave in future . Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals ; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish . Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves ( other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave ) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased , third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site . ( The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third @-@ class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial , but this practice was rare . ) 
 At the time the service was inaugurated , the LNC 's trains were divided both by class and by religion , with separate Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first , second and third class compartments within each . This separation applied to both living and dead passengers . This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment , rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner ; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design , and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors . At 11 @.@ 35 am ( 11 @.@ 20 am on Sundays ) the train would leave London for Brookwood , arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12 @.@ 25 pm ( 12 @.@ 20 pm on Sundays ) . 
 The LNC 's trains were capable of transporting large numbers of mourners when required ; the funeral of businessman Sir <unk> <unk> on 25 July 1938 saw 155 mourners travelling first class on a dedicated LNC train . For extremely large funerals such as those of major public figures , the LSWR would provide additional trains from Waterloo to Brookwood station on the main line to meet the demand . Charles Bradlaugh , Member of Parliament for Northampton , was a vocal advocate of Indian self @-@ government and a popular figure among the Indian community in London , many of whom attended his funeral on 3 February 1891 . Over 5 @,@ 000 mourners were carried on three long special LSWR trains , one of which was 17 carriages long . The mourners included the 21 @-@ year @-@ old Mohandas Gandhi , who recollected witnessing a loud argument between " a champion atheist " and a clergyman at North station while waiting for the return train . 
 The return trains to London generally left South station at 2 @.@ 15 pm and Necropolis Junction at 2 @.@ 30 pm ; the return journey initially took around an hour owing to the need to stop to refill the engine with water , but following the construction of the water tower in the cemetery this fell to around 40 minutes . An 1854 agreement between the LNC and LSWR gave consent for the LNC to operate two or three funeral trains each day if demand warranted it , but traffic levels never rose to a sufficient level to activate this clause . 
 The train only ran if there was a coffin or passengers at the London terminus waiting to use it , and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning . It would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried , and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service . Generally the trains ran direct from London to the cemetery , other than occasional stops to take on water . Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London who did not want to travel via Waterloo , but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated . After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued , and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required . 
 = = = Fares = = = 
 The Act of Parliament establishing the LNC had specified maximum ticket prices for the railway , and traffic never rose to the level at which it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation . As a consequence , despite the effects of inflation , competition and variable costs the fares of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation . Live passengers were charged 6s in first class , 3s 6d in second class and 2s in third class ( in 1854 worth about £ 25 , £ 15 and £ 8 respectively in 2016 consumer terms ) for a return ticket , while dead passengers were charged £ 1 in first class , 5s in second class and 2s 6d in third class ( in 1854 worth about £ 85 , £ 21 and £ 11 respectively in 2016 consumer terms ) for a one @-@ way ticket . As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals , the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London . In 1918 the LSWR ( which provided the LNC 's passenger carriages ) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers , but continued to separate coffin tickets into first , second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked . 
 Intentionally set at a low level at the time the cemetery and railway opened , in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood ( in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC 's equivalent ) . Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery . The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885 , as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC 's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR 's cargo rate ( 24 shillings in 1885 ) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium . 
 In its last two years of operation , wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare structure untenable , and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares . The live passenger rates rose to 7s 5d in first class and 2s 6d in third class , with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins . These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway ( SR ) , which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain 's railways . The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services , for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR 's platforms at Waterloo station , but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery .

 I did it wholesale and had 220 very large cases made each containing 26 human bodies besides children and these weighed 43 ⁄ 4 cwt . There were 1 @,@ 035 cwt of human remains sent in these cases alone . They were conveyed in the night and the Cemetery Company made arrangements for them . Each body has cost us less than three shillings . It was fortunate that such reasonable terms could be made at Woking Cemetery . A more horrible business you can scarcely imagine ; the men could only continue their work by the constant sprinkling of disinfectant powder . Mine was no easy task for the Bishop , the Warden , the parishioners and particularly the relatives have watched the steps taken , and the interviews with people and the correspondence has been great but all are more satisfied than could be expected . 
 As well as taking over new burials from London 's now @-@ closed burial grounds , the LNC also envisaged the physical relocation of the existing burial grounds to their Necropolis , to provide a final solution to the problems caused by burials in built @-@ up areas . The massive London civil engineering projects of the mid @-@ 19th century — the railways , the sewer system and from the 1860s the precursors to the London Underground — often necessitated the demolition of existing churchyards . The first major relocation took place in 1862 , when the construction of Charing Cross railway station and the railway lines into it necessitated the demolition of the burial ground of Cure 's College in Southwark . Around 5 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 800 m3 ) of earth was displaced , uncovering at least 7 @,@ 950 bodies . These were packed into 220 large containers , each containing 26 adults plus children , and shipped on the London Necropolis Railway to Brookwood for reburial , along with at least some of the existing headstones from the cemetery , at a cost of around 3 shillings per body . At least 21 London burial grounds were relocated to Brookwood via the railway , along with numerous others relocated by road following the railway 's closure . 
 = = = Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial = = = 
 In 1929 a section of the LNC 's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial , the sole burial ground in Britain for US military casualties of the First World War . As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and been buried there the number interred at Brookwood was small , with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery . After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged , with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942 . With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England , a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood . By August 1944 over 3 @,@ 600 bodies had been buried in the American Military Cemetery . At this time burials were discontinued , and US casualties were from then on buried at Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial . 
 On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin , Quartermaster General of the United States Army , the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January – May 1948 . Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial , and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge . ( Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom , whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet . They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948 , but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise @-@ Aisne American Cemetery Plot E , a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War . ) The railway service had been suspended in 1941 , and North station ( renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services ) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge . As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use , temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving the National Rifle Association 's shooting range at Bisley , on the opposite side of the LSWR line from the cemetery . Following the removal of the US war graves the site in which they had been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war . 
 = = Rolling stock = = 
 = = = Locomotives = = = 
 Under the terms of the 1852 agreement and Act of Parliament establishing the London Necropolis Company , the LSWR ( after 1923 the SR ) provided the locomotives and crew for London Necropolis Railway operations . There was no dedicated LNC locomotive , and the trains were worked by whichever suitable engine happened to be available . ( Before the 1864 improvements to Necropolis Junction , locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line itself and the trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses . ) Towards the end of the railway 's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives , usually No. 255 . 
 = = = Passenger carriages = = = 
 The passenger carriages used on the London Necropolis Railway were not owned by the LNC , but loaned from the LSWR . A set of carriages was permanently loaned , rather than carriages being lent as needed , as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might be discouraged from using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently . 
 The original set of carriages , used between 1854 and 1899 , were four @-@ wheeled carriages to a design by Joseph Hamilton Beattie . Little is recorded about the number and specifications of the carriages . The same set of carriages remained in use for over 40 years , prompting increasingly strong complaints from the LNC about their deteriorating quality . 
 As part of an 1896 agreement by which the LSWR re @-@ equipped the LNC in conjunction with the repositioning of the LNC 's London terminus , the LNC demanded that the new passenger carriages to be supplied by the LSWR be " of a quality and a character not inferior to [ the LSWR 's ] ordinary main line traffic " . These new carriages were supplied late in the 19th century , probably in December 1899 . They were all six @-@ wheeled , and comprised two 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) passenger brake vans each containing three third class compartments , a baggage compartment and the guard 's compartment ; a 34 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) passenger carriage divided into three first class and two second class compartments ; and a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) passenger carriage divided into five third class compartments ( also used as all second class ) . Although not recorded , it is likely that other carriages were also permanently loaned to the LNC for use as needed . 
 This set of carriages only remained in use for a short period , and in 1907 was replaced by a new set of carriages of which little is known . In 1917 this set was itself replaced by two 51 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) passenger brake vans each containing two first and four third class compartments , a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) carriage with three first and three third class compartments , and a 46 @-@ foot ( 14 m ) carriage with six third class compartments . 
 This set operated for most of the inter @-@ war period , being withdrawn in April 1938 . It was replaced by a very similar set of coaches at this time , which was withdrawn in September 1939 after the outbreak of hostilities for use in troop trains . The carriages were replaced by the former Royal Train , built 1900 – 04 , of the now @-@ defunct South Eastern and Chatham Railway . These ornately decorated carriages were those destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus . 
 = = = Hearse vans = = = 
 Unlike the loaned locomotives and passenger carriages , the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright . Despite this , they were always painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR ( SR after 1923 ) , to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC . 
 As with the carriages for living passengers , the hearse vans were designed to prevent bodies mixing with those from different backgrounds . Each of the original vans was partitioned into twelve sections in two rows of six , each capable of holding one coffin ; later vans were of a slightly different design and probably carried 14 coffins . The vans were fitted with internal partitions to divide first , second and third class coffins . The LNC intended to use half the hearse vans for Anglican and half for Nonconformist coffins , to prevent Anglicans from sharing a carriage with Nonconformists , but in practice this arrangement was little used . Unlike traditional Victorian funerals , in which the hearse invariably led the funeral procession , photographic evidence shows that the LNC sometimes placed the hearse van at the rear of the train . ( Because trains reversed from Necropolis Junction into the cemetery , no matter which arrangement was used the hearse van would inevitably be at the rear of the train for part of the journey . ) 
 The LNC ordered six hearse vans in 1854 , two of which were operational at the time the cemetery and Necropolis Railway opened . Their origins are not recorded , although they were bought very cheaply suggesting that they were conversions of existing carriages rather than built to order . Many LNC records from this period have been lost and it is not certain how many hearse vans were delivered , and how they were used ; records suggest that anything between three and ten hearse vans were bought or leased by the LNC in the early years of operations . ( As each van carried 12 – 14 coffins and it is known that some funeral trains in the late 19th century carried over 60 coffins , at least six hearse vans must have been in use . ) 
 As part of the settlement during the relocation of the London terminus , two new hearse vans were given to the LNC by the LSWR in 1899 . These new hearse vans were longer , and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each , for a total of 24 coffins per van . These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway . One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus ; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950 . The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space , and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the luggage space . 
 = = Cemetery stations = = 
 On William Cubitt 's advice the two stations in the cemetery were built as temporary structures , in the expectation that they would need to be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer . Both were designed by Sydney Smirke , who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854 . 
 Each station was built as a one @-@ storey building around a square courtyard . The side adjacent to the railway line was left open , and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side . Other than the brick platform faces , chimneys and foundations , the stations were built entirely of wood . Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners , a first class and an ordinary refreshment room , and a set of apartments for LNC staff . The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed ( permitted to sell alcohol ) . The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London , and on at least one occasion ( on 12 January 1867 ) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London . This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch , provided they drank no more than one pint of beer . 
 In mid @-@ 1855 cellars were dug beneath the stations , and the coffin reception rooms at each station were converted into " pauper waiting rooms " . Neither station was equipped with gas or electricity ; throughout their existence the buildings were lit by oil lamps and coal ranges were used for heating and cooking . The platform faces themselves incorporated an indentation , one brick @-@ width deep and the width of the courtyard . This indentation facilitated the unloading of coffins from the lower levels of the hearse carriages . 
 On arrival at the stations coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand @-@ drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff to the appropriate chapel . While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station . On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service ( third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried ) . For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC 's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave . 
 = = = North station = = = 
 North station , serving Roman Catholics , Parsees , Jews and Nonconformist Christians as well as some groups with dedicated plots in the northern cemetery such as actors and Oddfellows , was the first station on the branch . At the time the cemetery opened North station incorporated the lodgings of James Bailey , superintendent of the Nonconformist cemetery . In 1861 Bailey became the sole cemetery superintendent and moved into a cottage elsewhere on the grounds , and his apartment was given to Richard Lee , a cemetery porter . Census records show Lee living at North station , until 1865 with his mother Ann and later with his wife Charlotte , until at least 1871 . A number of cemetery staff lived in the station apartment until the 1950s . By this time the railway itself had closed but the station 's refreshment kiosk remained open . Steps led from the 210 @-@ foot ( 64 m ) long platform to a path leading to a chapel , on a hilltop behind the station . 
 Between 1942 and 1944 large numbers of Allied service personnel were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery . On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin , Quartermaster General of the United States Army , 3 @,@ 600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January – May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial . The railway service had been suspended in 1941 , and North station ( renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services ) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA . 
 On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy , who operated the refreshment kiosk in the station building from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment , the building was abandoned . It was demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot . 
 = = = South station = = = 
 The design of South station was broadly similar to that of North station . Unlike the platform steps of North station , the platform of South station had a ramp leading to an Anglican chapel at the northern end of the platform . A shed adjacent to the station held hand @-@ drawn <unk> , used to transport coffins around the large southern cemetery . At the time the branch line opened the platform of South station was only 128 feet ( 39 m ) long , far shorter than the 210 @-@ foot ( 64 m ) platform of North station . At some point the platform was greatly extended south from the station building to a total length of 256 feet ( 78 m ) , allowing equipment to be unloaded discreetly without disturbing users of the station . 
 At the time of opening the apartment in the station housed George <unk> , superintendent of the Anglican cemetery . As with the North station , once James Bailey became sole cemetery superintendent in 1861 the use of the apartment was granted to a cemetery porter , and housed a succession of cemetery staff over the years . Following the suspension of railway services in 1941 the building was renamed South Bar , and remained in use as a refreshment kiosk . The last operators of the kiosk , Mr and Mrs Ladd , retired in the late 1960s and from then on the station building was used as a cemetery storeroom . Around half the building was destroyed by fire in September 1972 . The building was popular with railway and architectural enthusiasts as a distinctive piece of Victorian railway architecture , but despite a lobbying campaign to preserve the surviving sections of the station the remaining buildings ( other than the platform itself ) were demolished shortly afterwards . By the time of its demolition the " temporary " structure was 118 years old . 
 = = = Brookwood station = = = 
 At the time the cemetery opened , the nearest railway station other than those on the cemetery branch was Woking railway station , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) away . As only one train per day ran from London to the cemetery stations and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place , access to the cemetery was difficult for mourners and LNC staff . Although in the negotiations leading to the creation of the cemetery the LSWR had told the LNC that they planned to build a main line station near the cemetery , they had not done so . 
 In 1863 , with the cemetery fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic , the LSWR agreed to build a mainline station at Brookwood , along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard , provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster 's house for the new station . The new station , called Brookwood ( Necropolis ) railway station ( the suffix was gradually dropped ) , opened on 1 June 1864 . A substantial commuter village grew around the northern ( i.e. non @-@ cemetery ) side of the new station , and the station building ( on the northern side of the tracks ) was enlarged in 1890 . In conjunction with these works , a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association 's shooting range at Bisley , running west to the north of the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley . 
 In 1903 the quadrupling of the LSWR tracks necessitated a major rebuilding of the station . The down ( westbound ) platform was demolished , and a new 576 @-@ foot ( 176 m ) long down platform was built , along with a second station building facing the cemetery , from which a footpath led across the cemetery branch 's tracks and into the cemetery . 
 = = London stations = = 
 A site for the London terminus near Waterloo was suggested by Sir Richard Broun . Its proximity to the Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London , and the area was easily accessed from both north and south of the river by road . The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station ( now London Waterloo station ) were easily converted into mortuaries . Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners ; while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings or through densely populated areas , at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside . The LNC also contemplated taking over the LSWR 's former terminus at Nine Elms railway station ( which following the 1848 opening of the much more convenient Waterloo Bridge station was used only for goods traffic , chartered trains taking migrants to North America , and the private trains of the royal family ) as either the main or a secondary terminus . Despite objections from local residents concerned about the effects of potentially large numbers of dead bodies being stored in a largely residential area , in March 1854 the LNC settled on a single terminus in Waterloo and purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street ( now Leake Street ) for the site . Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station , which was approved in June 1854 . 
 = = = First London terminus ( 1854 – 1902 ) = = = 
 Tite and Cubitt 's design was based around a three storey main building , separated from the LSWR 's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC 's twin rail lines , intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly , and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road . The building housed two mortuaries , the LNC 's boardroom and funerary workshops , and a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending first , second and third class funerals . A steam @-@ powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above . Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel , on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church . On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel . 
 As the site of the station was adjacent to the arches of the LSWR 's viaduct , it blocked any increase in the number of lines serving Waterloo station ( renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886 ) . Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London , through which trains from Waterloo ran , led to congestion at the station and in 1896 the LSWR formally presented the LNC with a proposal to provide the LNC with a new station in return for the site of the existing terminus . The LNC agreed to the proposals , in return for the LSWR granting the LNC control of the design of the new station and leasing the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity , providing new rolling stock , removing any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service , and providing the free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in the cemetery . Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands , in May 1899 the companies signed an agreement , in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand . In addition the LSWR paid £ 12 @,@ 000 compensation ( about £ 1 @.@ 22 million in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices , and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo , Vauxhall or Clapham Junction . 
 = = = Second London terminus ( 1902 – 1941 ) = = = 
 A site for the replacement terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899 , south of the existing site and on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge Road . It was completed on 8 February 1902 , and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station , destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus . 
 The new building was designed for attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry . A narrow four @-@ storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC 's offices . Behind it was the main terminal ; this held a communal third @-@ class waiting room , mortuaries and storerooms , the LNC 's workshops , and a sumptuous oak @-@ panelled Chapelle Ardente , intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood to pay their respects to the deceased . This building led onto the two platforms , lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office . 
 = = = Destruction = = = 
 During the Second World War Waterloo station and the nearby Thames bridges were a significant target for Axis bombing , and there were several near @-@ misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940 – 41 . Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line , the Necropolis station was undamaged during the early stages of the bombing campaign . During the night of 16 – 17 April 1941 , in one of the last major air raids on London , bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area . The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned , and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged , but the terminal building itself remained unscathed . 
 At 10 @.@ 30 pm multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building . While the office building and platforms survived , the workshops , driveway and Chapelle Ardente were destroyed , along with the third class waiting room . The Southern Railway 's Divisional Engineer inspected the damage at 2 @.@ 00 pm on 17 April , and his report read simply " Necropolis and buildings demolished " . On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed . 
 The last recorded funeral party carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish ( 1868 – 1941 ) , buried on 11 April 1941 . The Southern Railway offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued , but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from the cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day , meaning those visiting the cemetery other than members of funeral parties had little reason to choose the LNC 's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR 's fast and frequent services to Brookwood . The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11 @.@ 57 am service to Brookwood ( the SR service closest to the LNC 's traditional departure time ) , but the SR management , themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage , refused to entertain any compromise . 
 = = Closure = = 
 In September 1945 , following the end of hostilities , the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway . Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition , the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus . With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained , the branch line was in extremely poor condition . 
 Although the original promoters of the scheme had envisaged Brookwood Cemetery becoming London 's main or only cemetery , the scheme had never been as popular as they had hoped . In the original proposal , Richard Broun had calculated that over its first century of operations the cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50 @,@ 000 per year , the great majority of which would have utilised the railway . In reality at the time the last train ran on 11 April 1941 , almost 87 years after opening , only 203 @,@ 041 people had been buried in the cemetery . Before the outbreak of hostilities , increased use of motorised road transport had damaged the profitability of the railway for both the LNC and the Southern Railway . Faced with the costs of rebuilding the cemetery branch line , building a new London terminus and replacing the rolling stock damaged or destroyed in the air raid , the directors concluded that " past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train obsolete " . In mid @-@ 1946 the LNC formally informed the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road terminus would not be reopened . 
 The decision prompted complicated negotiations with the SR over the future of the LNC facilities in London . In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement . The railway @-@ related portions of the terminus site ( the waiting rooms , the caretaker 's flat and the platforms themselves ) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR , while the remaining surviving portions of the site ( the office block on Westminster Bridge Road , the driveway and the ruined central portion of the site ) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit . The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for £ 21 @,@ 000 ( about £ 741 @,@ 000 in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) , and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent 's Office at Brookwood . The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s , before clearing what remained of their section of the site . 
 While most of the LNC 's business was now operated by road , an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC to make use of SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals , subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR ( British Railways after 1948 ) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train . Although one of the LNC 's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used , and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR 's coaches . Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations , or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road . 
 Although the LNC proposed to convert the cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery , this never took place . The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947 , and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath . The run @-@ around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings , before being dismantled on 30 November 1964 . After the closure of the branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks , and were renamed North Bar and South Bar . 
 = = After closure = = 
 Following the 1947 nationalisation of Britain 's railways , the use of the railway to transport coffins to Brookwood went into steep decline . New operating procedures required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo ; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans , coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for the last part of the journey , or a special train had to be chartered . The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979 , and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether . Since Mountbatten , the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp , carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001 . 
 = = = Stations = = = 
 Most of the site of the 1902 London terminus was built over with new office developments in the years following the end of the Second World War , but the office building on Westminster Bridge Road , over the former entrance to the station driveway , remains relatively unaltered externally although the words " London Necropolis " carved into the stone above the driveway have been covered . Refurbishments and cleaning in the 1980s restored the facade of the building to an appearance similar to that of the time of its building . Other than iron columns in Newnham Terrace which once supported the Necropolis Railway tracks , and a surviving section of the internal driveway used as a car park , the Westminster Bridge Road building is the only surviving part of the London Necropolis Railway in London . 
 Brookwood station on the former LSWR line ( now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line ) is little changed since the 1903 expansion and rebuilding . It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown to the north of the railway line , and by visitors to the cemetery to the south of the line . A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway , consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed , was erected in 2007 outside the southern ( cemetery @-@ side ) entrance to the station . 
 The site of North station has significantly changed . The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al @-@ Hussein Ben Ali ( d . 1998 ) stands directly opposite the remains of the platform . The operators of the Shia Islamic section of the cemetery have planted <unk> along the boundary of their section of the cemetery , which includes the platform of North station . Unless the trees are removed , the remains of the station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth . 
 The land surrounding the site of South station and the station 's two Anglican chapels were redundant following the closure of the railway . As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused original Anglican chapel into a crematorium , using the newer chapel for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations . Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by a succession of hostile takeover bids , the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme and the buildings fell into disuse . The station building was demolished after being damaged by a fire in 1972 , although the platform remained intact . 
 Since 1982 the site of South station has been owned by the St. Edward Brotherhood , and forms part of a Russian Orthodox monastery . The original Anglican chapel is used as a visitor 's centre and living quarters for the monastery , while the larger Anglican chapel built in 1908 – 09 immediately north of the station is now the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Edward the Martyr , and houses the relics and shrine of Edward the Martyr , king of England from 975 – 978 AD . The site of the former station buildings is now the main monastery building , while the platform itself remains intact and now marks the boundary of the monastic enclosure . 
 = = = Brookwood Cemetery and the LNC = = = 
 The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery , but were unable to come to any agreement . In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s 6d ( compared to the standard rate of 9s 4d ) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood . By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road . The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway , and the proposal was abandoned . 
 With the area around Woking by this time heavily populated , the LNC 's land holdings had become an extremely valuable asset , and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators . In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company , bringing over a century of independence to an end . Alliance Property was a property company with little interest in the funeral business , and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds . Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness . This trend continued under a succession of further owners . 
 The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 authorised the cemetery 's owners ( at that time Maximilian Investments ) to sell surplus land within the cemetery 's boundaries , leading to the construction of a major office development on the site of the former Superintendent 's office , near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries . The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s , and were then converted into office buildings and named <unk> 's Court . In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by Ramadan Güney , whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011 . The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery , and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery . 
 While it was never as successful as planned , Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world . Although not the world 's only dedicated funeral railway line , the London Necropolis Railway was the first , the longest lasting and by far the best known . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 As well as forming a key element of Basil Copper 's novel Necropolis ( 1980 ) , the railway and cemetery received widespread attention following the 2002 publication of Andrew Martin 's novel The Necropolis Railway ( 2002 ) . Both books were critically acclaimed and led to increased public interest in the London Necropolis Company and its railway operations . 
 On 31 July 2015 , the opening episode of the third series of the BBC television drama Ripper Street featured a collision between a mainline locomotive and a LNC train which had been diverted by criminals onto the wrong line . 
 = Sigurd the Stout = 
 Sigurd <unk> ( circa 960 – 23 April 1014 ) , popularly known as Sigurd the Stout from the Old Norse Sigurðr <unk> , was an Earl of Orkney . The main sources for his life are the Norse Sagas , which were first written down some two centuries or more after his death . These engaging stories must therefore be treated with caution rather than as reliable historical documents . 
 Sigurd was the son of Hlodvir <unk> and ( according to the Norse sagas ) a direct descendent of Torf @-@ Einarr <unk> . Sigurd 's tenure as earl was apparently free of the kin @-@ strife that beset some other incumbents of this title and he was able to pursue his military ambitions over a wide area . He also held lands in the north of mainland Scotland and in the <unk> , and he may have been instrumental in the defeat of Gofraid mac Arailt , King of the Isles . The Annals of Ulster record his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 , the earliest known reference to the earldom of Orkney . 
 The saga tales draw attention to Sigurd 's conversion to Christianity and his use of a totemic raven banner , a symbol of the Norse God Odin . This ambiguous theme and the lack of detailed contemporary records of his life have led to a variety of interpretations of the saga material by modern scholars . 
 = = Family background = = 
 The Orkneyinga Saga reports that Sigurd was the son of Hlodvir , one of the five sons of Thorfinn Skull @-@ <unk> , and Eithne . She is said to be a daughter of a " King Kjarvalr " . The period after Earl Thorfinn 's death was one of dynastic strife ; three of Earl Hlodvir 's brothers ruled before him , although he died in his bed before being succeeded by Sigurd , probably in the 980s . 
 Sigurd 's patronymic is an unusual one and there would appear to be a connection with this name and the early roots of the modern French name " Louis " . 
 = = Rule = = 
 Sigurd was in the fortunate position that on his accession to the earldom there seem to have been no other serious contenders . In this respect his rule was unlike that of the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and of the next generation in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods . 
 Sigurd 's great @-@ grandfather , Torf @-@ Einarr , lost the <unk> rights of the Orkney and Shetland farmers as part of a deal he brokered with the Norwegian crown . These rights were restored by Sigurd . The Burray hoard of silver ring @-@ money has been dated to the period 997 @-@ 1010 , during Earl Sigurd 's reign . 
 = = = Mainland Scotland = = = 
 Sigurd 's domain included not just Orkney itself but also Shetland , which formed part of the earldom and also extensive lands on mainland Scotland . For the latter his overlords were the Kings of Scotland rather than of Norway . The extent of these mainland dominions is uncertain . According to the rather dubious source , Njal 's Saga , they included Ross , Moray , Sutherland and the Dales . At the time Moray would have included districts on the west coast including Lochaber . Smyth ( 1984 ) notes the density of <unk> placenames on Scotland 's west coast and it has even been suggested that " the Dales " is a reference to Dalriada , although it is more likely that it means Caithness . During Sigurd 's tenure the earldom approached its high point and his influence was perhaps only exceeded by that of his son Thorfinn . 
 Sigurd 's uncle Ljot had been killed in war against the Scots , and Sigurd soon faced trouble from his southern neighbours . According to the Orkneyinga saga " Earl <unk> " ( Findláech of Moray ) led an army against him which outnumbered Sigurd 's forces by seven to one . The saga then records Sigurd 's mother 's reply when he went to her for advice : 
 Had I thought you might live for ever I 'd have reared you in my wool @-@ basket . But lifetimes are shaped by what will be , not by where you are . Now , take this banner . I 've made it for you with all the skill I have , and my belief is this : it will bring victory to the man it 's carried before , but death to the one who carries it . 
 The Raven banner worked as just Sigurd 's mother said : he was victorious but three standard @-@ bearers in succession were killed . 
 A battle was fought between Norwegian forces and Malcolm II of Scotland at Mortlach c . 1005 which may have involved or been led by Sigurd . Although victory went to the Scots , the Norwegians had clearly spent some considerable time encamped in Moray and came equipped with a large fleet . However , Orcadian influence in this part of Scotland is likely to have been temporary and on other occasions , such as during his uncle Ljot 's earldom , Scottish forces had pushed north into Caithness . 
 = = = The Hebrides = = = 
 Sigurd the Stout also took control of the Hebrides , and placed a jarl called Gilli in charge . Njal 's Saga records an expedition that took place c . 980 in which Kari , Sigurd 's bodyguard , plundered the Hebrides , Kintyre and " <unk> " ( probably Strathclyde ) . On another occasion Kari sailed through The Minch in order to collect tribute from Gilli , whose base may have been either Colonsay or Coll . 
 The Annals of Ulster record a raid by " the Danes " on Iona on Christmas Night in which the abbot and fifteen of the elders of the monastery were slaughtered and this may have been connected with the successful conquering of the Isle of Man by Sigurd and Gilli between 985 and 989 . Njal 's Saga records a victory for Sigurd over Gofraid mac Arailt , King of the Isles with the former returning to Orkney with the spoils . The contemporary Annals of Ulster record a similar event in 987 although with the reverse outcome . Here it is claimed that 1 @,@ 000 Norsemen were killed , among them the Danes who had plundered Iona . Two years later Njal 's Saga reports a second campaign in the southern Hebrides , Anglesey , Kintyre , Wales and a more decisive victory in Man . Irish sources report only the death of King Gofraid in Dál Riata , an event that Thomson ( 2008 ) ascribes to Earl Gilli 's Gall @-@ <unk> forces . 
 The Eyrbyggja saga records the payment of silver tribute from Man to Sigurd , and , although this is a rather unreliable source , there is corroboration of such an event occurring in 989 in a Welsh source , with payment being made of a penny each from the local population to " the black host of the Vikings " . It has been suggested that the much later use of ounceland and <unk> assessments in the Gàidhealtachd may date from the time of Earl Sigurd and his sons . 
 By 1004 the western isles ' independence from Orkney had been re @-@ asserted under Ragnal mac Gofraid , who died in that year . It is possible the rules overlapped , with Gilli 's zone of influence to the north and Ragnal 's to the south . On Ragnal 's death Sigurd re @-@ asserted control , which he held until his own death a decade later after which the islands may have been held by Håkon Eiriksson . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 According to the Orkneyinga saga , the Northern Isles were Christianised by King Olaf Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway . The King summoned jarl Sigurd and said " I order you and all your subjects to be baptised . If you refuse , I 'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel . " Unsurprisingly , Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke . 
 This tale is repeated in St Olaf 's Saga , ( although here Olaf lands at South Ronaldsay ) as is a brief mention of Sigurd 's son " Hunde or Whelp " who was taken as a hostage to Norway by King Olaf . Hunde was held there for several years before dying there . " After his death Earl Sigurd showed no obedience or fealty to King Olaf . " 
 = = Death at Clontarf = = 
 The Orkneyinga Saga blandly reports that " five years after the Battle of Svolder " Earl Sigurd went to Ireland to support Sigtrygg Silkbeard and , after taking up the raven banner , was killed in a battle that took place on Good Friday . ( The chronology is slightly awry in that Sigurd 's death is known to have taken place 14 years after Svolder . ) 
 Njal 's Saga provides a little more detail , alleging that Gormflaith ingen Murchada prompted her son Sigtrygg into getting Sigurd to fight against her former husband , Brian <unk> : " She sent him to Earl Sigurd to beg for help ... Then King Sigtrygg fared south to Ireland , and told his mother that the Earl had undertaken to come . " 
 The 12th @-@ century Irish source , the Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh , records the events of the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 . The " foreigners and Leinstermen " were led by Brodir of the Isle of Man and Sigurd , and the battle lasted all day . Though Brian was killed in the battle , the Irishmen ultimately drove back their enemies into the sea , and Sigurd himself was killed . His death is corroborated by the Annals of Ulster , which record that amongst the dead was " <unk> son of <unk> , <unk> Innsi <unk> " ( i.e. of Sigurd , son of Hlodvir , Earl of Orkney ) . This is the earliest known contemporary reference to the earldom of Orkney . 
 = = Succession and other relatives = = 
 Sigurd left four sons : <unk> , <unk> , Einar and Thorfinn , each of whom would also bear the title Earl of Orkney ; the lands were initially divided amongst the three older brothers , Thorfinn being only five years old at the time .

 Njal 's Saga provides the names of various other relatives of Sigurd 's . <unk> , who was killed at <unk> ( the modern Freswick in Caithness ) is referred to as his brother @-@ in @-@ law . Sigurd is said to have given his sister <unk> ( also called <unk> ) in marriage to Earl Gilli .

 Sigurd 's earldom " exerted a magnetic attraction for high @-@ born Icelanders " and inspired many tales of military prowess in their own family sagas . 
 " King Kjarvalr " , Sigurd 's supposed grandfather , appears as Kjarvalr <unk> in the Landnámabók and has been identified as Cerball mac <unk> , King of <unk> who died in 888 . There is clearly a chronological problem with Sigurd 's mother being the daughter of a king who died more than 70 years before the death of his own grandfather , Earl Thorfinn . Furthermore , Thorstein " the Red " Olafsson ( fl. late 9th century and Hlodvir 's great @-@ grandfather ) was apparently married to a granddaughter of Kjarvalr . Woolf ( 2007 ) concludes that the saga writers may have confused this story about the provenance of Sigurd <unk> with one about Thorstein , a close ally of Sigurd Eysteinsson . 
 Drawing on Adam of Bremen 's assertion that Orkney was not conquered until the time of Harald Hardrada , who ruled Norway from 1043 – 66 , Woolf ( 2007 ) speculates that Sigurd may have been the first Earl of Orkney . He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth , circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier . He concludes that " If there were no earls in Orkney before <unk> 's time it might help to explain the islands ' low profile in the annals since these , for the most part , record only the deaths of great men . " However , the absence of comment on this subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd 's death there is hardly surprising . Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and " not much concerned " with Orkney . Smyth ( 1984 ) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf @-@ Einarr " may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney " . 
 The conflict between Sigurd and Olaf Tryggvasson probably predates their chance meeting at Kirk Hope as the latter is known to have been raiding in the <unk> during the period 991 @-@ 94 . His motives for a determined pursuit of Christian obedience are likely to have been essentially political rather than religious . His journey back to Norway was in order to bid for the kingship there , and securing a passive Orkney in advance of this was therefore greatly to his advantage . Although Sigurd 's marriage to an unnamed daughter of Malcolm of Scotland is mentioned in the Orkneyinga Saga immediately after the death of Hunde and the earl 's consequent break with Olaf Tryggvasson , Thomson ( 2008 ) views this nuptial arrangement as a joint attempt by the Orcadians and Scots to align themselves against the " common threat from Moray " rather than as a slight to Norway . 
 When the sagas were written down Orkney had been Christian for 200 years or more and the conversion tale itself is " blatantly unhistorical " . When the Norse arrived in the Northern Isles they would have found organised Christianity already thriving there , although there is no mention of this at all in the sagas . Furthermore , the Norse dragon motif of the whale @-@ bone plaque found at the Scar boat burial was found in conjunction with the grave of an elderly woman who had died by 950 AD at the latest , and the weight of archaeological evidence suggests that Christian burial was widespread in Orkney by Sigurd 's time . The intention may have been to disown the influence of indigenous elements of Orcadian and Shetlandic culture and emphasise that positive cultural developments came from Scandinavia , whilst at the same time critiquing the unduly blunt method of Norwegian interference in this case . The inclusion of the tale of the raven banner in the saga material may convey the idea of a revival of heathenism in Orcadian society and a reaction to Norwegian attempts to control the islands . However , in the Orkneyinga Saga there is a vivid contrast between Sigurd 's death clutching the raven banner and the later career of his son Thorfinn , who is credited with several achievements in bringing Orkney into mainstream Christendom . Taken as a whole the intention may be to draw attention to this transition . 
 = Just Be Free = 
 Just Be Free is a demo album released by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera . After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club , a then fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey @-@ based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown . The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music with the understanding that they could use the material for their own purpose , but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings . Musically , the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads , and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs . The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera 's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels , a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics . Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success , Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128 @,@ 000 copies in the United States .

 After news that The New Mickey Mouse Club would be filming its final season , Aguilera sought out a record deal . She spent time in Philadelphia to record demo tracks with various producers , hoping to have an album released by the time she had finished high school . While taping the final season of the show , she began working with New Jersey based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown . The pair eventually built a relationship with Aguilera and her family , offering her studio time . They told her that the demo recordings she would produce would be their property , but also that they would never commercially release the material . She recorded eleven " rough and unfinished " tracks which then went on to become the Just Be Free studio sessions . 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 The early tapes were conceived as a way of introducing Aguilera to the music industry , described as a " foot in the door " attempt to build interest in her musical abilities . During the recording sessions , Aguilera experimented with different languages , recording songs such as the title track " Just Be Free " in Spanish . Although the rightful writers of the content have been disputed , the recording sessions have been described as influential on future recordings from Aguilera . Musically the album generally consisted of ballad material which was created in an effort to showcase Aguilera 's vocal talents although in addition to the ballads recorded in these sessions , dance music became a prominent theme throughout the eleven tracks she recorded during this time . 
 = = Lawsuit and release = = 
 After discovery that Alleca and Brown would be releasing the album , Aguilera started developments to sue the pair in an effort to stop the release . Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and <unk> Music for " improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free " . Carla Christofferson , her lawyer at the time , explained that " We 're trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now . " However , Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material , he found it to be a look into her life at the time of recording . He stated " It 's a great look at what she was doing , We 're pleased [ to be putting the record out ] . I 'm more pleased for the album 's producers who wanted to get it out . I hope the fans can appreciate it . " Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to " boot strap " on Aguilera 's success . In response to the lawsuit , Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record . During the proceedings , Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release Just Be Free after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates . She allowed the release under the condition that the label would have to include a letter written by Aguilera in each album released . Since November 13 , 2015 , the album is available to stream on Spotify and <unk> .

 The album received generally negative reviews from critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic understood why Aguilera was dissatisfied with the release of the material , calling the songs " pre @-@ professional " and " generic early- ' 90s dance @-@ pop " . He noted that Just Be Free did not match the quality of her self @-@ titled debut album due to its " bland " production . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a D @-@ rating , citing the album 's production and describing the content as " teen @-@ jailbait " due to lyrics such as " Why don 't you stay with me tonight " . 
 Pier Dominguez , author of A Star is Made , commented that the sessions demonstrated " Christina 's raw vocal agility " despite calling the content " dull " , adding " Christina 's hunger for success actually comes through in these songs , as she sings her heart out with strained emotion , trying to sound as if she 's letting all her inhibitions run free . If she did in fact co @-@ write the songs then they were also a demonstration of Christina 's songwriting dexterity , because the album 's lyrics could be called unoriginal and perhaps even cheesy , it could not be said that they were not catchy " . Similarly , Stephanie McGrath from JAM ! Music also saw why Aguilera would not want the album released . Although she recognized Aguilera 's potential as a vocalist , she wrote " The songs themselves are terrible , dated club tracks , overwhelmed by poor effects and mundane beats . " Despite the negative critical reception , the album has sold over 128 @,@ 000 copies in the United States and peaked at number 71 on the Billboard 200 .

 = Astronomical Observatory ( University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign ) = 
 The University of Illinois Astronomical Observatory , located at 901 S. Mathews Avenue in Urbana , Illinois , on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign , was built in 1896 , and was designed by Charles A. Gunn . It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since November 6 , 1986 , and on December 20 , 1989 , was designated a National Historic Landmark . 
 Though none of the astronomical instruments are being used for professional research today , the observatory still contains a 12 " Brashear refractor . The observatory played a key role in the development of astronomy as it was home to a key innovation in the area of astronomical photometry . The facility has been directed by such noted scientists as Joel Stebbins and Robert Horace Baker . 
 Erected at the behest of the Illinois General Assembly , the University of Illinois Observatory became important in the development of astronomy due , in large part , to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins , from 1907 to 1922 . Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy . The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979 , when the department moved into a new , larger building to house its growing staff . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Astronomy classes at the University of Illinois date to its earliest days . The first courses focused on measurement of the night sky and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills . A small observatory consisting of a 4 @-@ inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872 . The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s , several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy . An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility . The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois , providing $ 15 @,@ 000 for construction . The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue , just north of the Morrow Plots , a National Historic Landmark that is the nation 's oldest experimental field . Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn , the architect and an instructor on campus , and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896 . The building was completed by August at a total cost of $ 6 @,@ 800 . The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897 . 
 The first director of the observatory was George W. Myers . Myers was an Champaign county native who graduated from the university in 1888 . He remained as a mathematics instructor also teaching the spring Descriptive Astronomy course . In preparation for the directorship he spent two years in Munich earning his Ph.D in astronomy . In his first year as director , G.W. Myers announced the discovery of the source of the variability in the star Beta Lyrae at the opening conference for Yerkes Observatory . He served as director from 1897 until 1900 when he left for the University of Chicago . W.C. <unk> , an astronomy instructor , served as acting director until a new director was hired in 1903 . 
 = = = Stebbins ' research = = = 
 Before 1907 , all magnitude measurements for stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness , a process that was slow and inexact . Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate . Regardless , neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements . The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy . Joel Stebbins ' pioneering research for astronomical photometry took place at the observatory . 
 Stebbins arrived as director of the University of Illinois Observatory after he completed his Ph.D. at the University of California , Berkeley in 1903 . Once Stebbins arrived fresh from his dissertation completed at Lick Observatory , he began a two @-@ year study of the brightness of 107 binary stars using a Pickering visual photometer . The research , with the assistance of his wife , May Stebbins , investigated the relative brightness on binary stars using visual techniques . In a 1957 speech at the American Astronomical Society , Stebbins recalled the events which led up to the electric cells : 
 " She ( May Stebbins ) wrote down the numbers as the observer called them , but after some nights of recording a hundred readings just to get one magnitude , she said it was pretty slow business . I responded that someday we would do all this by electricity . That was a fatal remark . Thereafter she would often prod me with the question , " When are you going to change to electricity ? " It happened that within two or three months , the Department of Physics gave an open house , and one of the exhibits was in ( the ) charge of a young instructor , F.C. Brown . He showed how , when he turned on a lamp to illuminate a selenium cell , a bell would ring , when the lamp was off , the bell would stop . Here was the idea : Why not turn on a star to a cell on a telescope and measure a current ? " 
 Stebbins and Fay C. Brown soon became friends and in time , they had a selenium cell positioned on the 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) telescope at the observatory . In the summer of 1907 , after several attempts , the two achieved a light curve for Earth 's moon and measured the moon 's brightness during a lunar eclipse . This marked the first time in America that electricity was used to measure astronomical brightness . Later Stebbins went further , discovering that by cooling the cell to zero degrees Fahrenheit he would double the cell sensitivity and diminish irregularities in the circuit tenfold , still further , by reducing the size of the cell the irregularities were reduced more . The pair went on to detect stellar intensity and activity that were previously unrecorded . In 1909 their observations of Algol detected for the first time the second minimum as well as limb brightening . The coming of Comet Halley in 1910 allowed Stebbins , in May , to use his selenium photometer to study the comet . Two years later Stebbins used the photometer and discovered four stars to be eclipsing binary stars : Beta Aurigae , Spica , Alpha Coronae Borealis and Delta Orionis . 
 Although the selenium cell photometer was proving successful , it was difficult to use and not very sensitive . Illinois physics professor Jakob Kunz suggested that Stebbins try a photoelectric cell . Kunz had been doing experimentation on an improved photoelectric cell which was alkali based . Kunz 's cell was the predecessor of the modern day " electric eye . " Stebbins left for a sabbatical in Europe in fall of 1912 . While he was gone , Kunz and another Illinois physicists W.F. Schulz successfully tested a photoelectric cell photometer at the Observatory . 
 Upon his return from sabbatical in August 1913 , Stebbins ended his pioneering work with the selenium cell and began working with Kunz on the new photometer . A number of other notable astronomical discoveries occurred at the observatory through the years . In 1915 Stebbins ' object of study became the star involved in Myers ' first big discovery at the observatory , Beta Lyrae . He thus began an aggressive research program produced a series of papers in the Astrophysical Journal on eclipsing binaries Lambda Tauri , Algol , 1H Cassiopeiae ( HR <unk> ) , ellipsoidal variables <unk> Orionis , and b Persei , and Nova Aquilae ( <unk> Aquilae ) in 1918 . Stebbins and Kunz also travelled to Wyoming to study the solar eclipse . . Dr. Elmer <unk> joined the Observatory staff in 1917 and rebuilt the photometer in the summer of 1919 . By 1922 , Charles Wylie completed the first Illinois astronomy doctorate for his photoelectric studies of the Cepheid Η Aquilae , and Sigma Aquilae noting its variations due to tidal distortions . 
 Stebbins research earned him several honors while at Illinois . In 1913 he was awarded the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Science , and in 1915 the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences . The research was also supported by grants from the Draper fund of the National Academy of Sciences and the Rumford Fund of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He served as an officer of the American Astronomical Society and was one of the American delegates in 1918 to attend the organizational meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Brussels . After numerous discoveries , Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 for the Washburn Observatory in Wisconsin and Dr. Robert H. Baker took over as the new Director of the University of Illinois Observatory . However , because the observatory lost its pioneering researcher in Stebbins did not mean that discovery and science did not continue at the university 's observatory . 
 = = = Robert Baker , third director = = = 
 When Robert Baker arrived he continued a photoelectric photometry program focusing on variable stars . He continued to use the 12 @-@ inch refractor until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30 @-@ inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex . He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s . On May 27 , 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which fell onto a photo cell in the observatory 's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World 's Fair . 
 The Great Depression was soon in full <unk> and the department budget fell from $ 1000 to a mere $ 200 . It was during this time that Dr. Baker authored a number of books . Baker was an extremely gifted writer whose clear simple work helped him explain what was going on up there to an entire generation . In 1930 , he authored the textbook Astronomy , followed in 1932 by The Universe Unfolding , and his revision of Simon Newcomb 's Astronomy for Everyone . In 1934 Baker described an imaginary trip to the moon in When the Stars Come Out . His second textbook , An Introduction to Astronomy also appeared in 1934 . Introducing the Constellation was published in 1937 and , with the help of Howard Zim in 1951 , Stars : A Guide to the Heavens . His textbooks were used across the entire country for undergraduate astronomy courses and praised as classics . 
 After two sabbaticals to Harvard , Baker 's interest moved from photometry to the Milky Way . In 1939 the 30 @-@ inch reflector was replaced with a Ross photographic telescope and for more than ten years after that , 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory 's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard 's Star Counting Circuit . This would be the primary research until Baker 's retirement in 1951 . The 12 @-@ inch refractor was only used for instruction , public open houses and for visiting school groups . 
 = = = Modern department = = = 
 The university decided that it was time to increase the size of the department and hired Dr. George C. McVittie as the next director . After his arrival in the fall of 1952 , McVittie began the refurbishment of the Observatory 's major instruments . The 12 @-@ inch refractor and the 3 @-@ inch transit telescope were restored in 1954 by J.W. <unk> Company . He also began expanding the faculty . Dr. Stanley Wyatt joined the faculty in 1953 , George Swenson and Ivan King in 1956 , <unk> <unk> , John Dickel and James Kaler in 1964 and Edward Olson in 1966 . With George Swenson 's arrival , Illinois began a program of radio astronomy resulting in the Vermillion River Radio Observatory that opened in 1962 . Prairie Observatory was an optical observatory consisting of a 40 @-@ inch telescope and was completed in 1967 . By the time of Dr. McVittie 's retirement in 1971 , the one @-@ astronomer department had expanded to nine faculty with research interests in relativity , cosmology , celestial mechanics , perturbation theory , dynamics of star clusters , planetary nebulae , planets , supernovae and radio astronomy . The department which produced only five advanced degrees prior to 1951 graduated 29 Masters and 14 Doctoral student during the McVittie administration . 
 On October 4 , 1957 , the very evening of the launch of Sputnik , students and faculty met at the Observatory and constructed an improvised radio interferometer . They published the first precise ephemeris in Nature in November . Their success helped gather momentum and funding for the radio astronomy program .

 The observatory underwent major renovations and additions in 1956 and 1966 to accommodate the growing faculty ( see architecture section below ) . In 1967 , the 12 inch telescope at the observatory made its last professional photometric observations . The University of Illinois ' Astronomy Department moved out of the building in 1979 . The same year the observatory received recognition by the National Register of Historic Places , 1986 , thousands gathered at the site to observe Comet Halley 's journey into the inner solar system . 
 The observatory is no longer used for research purposes , though the telescope is still used as a teaching tool in the university 's astronomy classes . In addition , a University of Illinois student astronomy organization uses the telescope . The observatory dome underwent a renovation that included repainting in 1996 . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 The primary instrument is a refractor of 12 @.@ 4 inches clear aperture and of 15 ft. focal length . The optics are by John A. Brashear of Pittsburgh and the mechanical parts by the Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland . <unk> provide magnification ranging from 130 to 720 power . 
 It is mounted on a rectangular cast @-@ iron column of two @-@ tons weight that rests on the masonry pier . Through a glass door in the column you can see the driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go , so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it . The telescope turns on two axes at the top of the column . One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens ; the other at right angles to it , and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached . Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates . The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky . It is a heavy instrument , but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand . 
 The principle transit circle was a 3 @-@ inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope designed by Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois . The objective , by John Brashear , was held in place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses . Designated as model M @-@ 505 , the transit included a handing level , micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism . This transit was located in the east @-@ central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window . The instrument cost $ 1200 in 1896 . 
 The transit circle was capable of determining both right ascension and declination of a star , unlike the more simple and common transit instrument that can only determine the right ascension . Such an instrument could also be used to set the Observatory ’ s clocks by observing standard stars whose position was precisely known . 
 In addition there were three other smaller transit telescopes , two clocks by Clemens <unk> of Munich , and other accessories including <unk> , chronometers , and teaching tools . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The building , itself , is in a traditional observatory design , Colonial Revival style , following a T @-@ plan . The dome rises 35 feet ( 11 m ) in the air . The observatory was built on a one story T @-@ plan , facing north , of buff @-@ colored Roman brick ( from Indiana ) and features limestone lintels and sills . The cross of the T is 75 feet ( 23 m ) long east to west and 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) deep , its stem is located to the south , centered along the east @-@ west axis and is 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) deep by 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide . The octagonal observation tower rises 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) into the air at the intersection of the T where it becomes a dome and continues to a height of 35 feet ( 11 m ) . At floor level of the second equatorial room a balustrade circles around the exterior of the tower . The tower is capped by a great circular limestone plate , which carries the dome track . Internally , the diameter of the dome is 24 @.@ 5 feet ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) and its zenith 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) above the floor . The dome slit , which still operates , has an opening of 44 inches ( 1 @,@ 100 mm ) and can be opened or closed by hand in seconds . The dome tower and equatorial room are original save a motor drive which replaced the old rope and sheave method of rotating the dome . As of September 2014 , the motor drive is being serviced and the rope and sheave method is once again in use . 
 In the center of the equatorial room is the 1896 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) refractor telescope . Built by the firm of Warner and Swasey , Cleveland , Ohio , the scope is stabilized on a brick pier which extends down into the bedrock and is not attached to the building in any way . The telescope cost $ 4 @,@ 500 and still has the original observer 's chair mentioned in the contract with Bevis and Company at a cost of $ 25 . The entrance hall , below the equatorial room , octagonal in shape , is centered on a brick pier . The entrance hall retains original stairs , newel posts , balustrades , and wood floors ; it is still used for its original purpose , storage . 
 The east and west wings of the building once each contained a transit room . Each of the rooms had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier ; the piers are still visible in the basement below the transit rooms . The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s . The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently . 
 The exterior of the observatory building has a brick cornice , with stone sills and lintels , stone water course , ornamental gutters , and original copper downspouts . Most of the building 's windows are of the wooden double @-@ hung variety and original , as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop . The original front balustrade has been replaced , however , the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original . 
 Aside from the transit room conversion to office space the building has seen other major work in the past . The southwest corner of the building was built in 1956 , of cream colored brick , to house additional classrooms and office space . The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color . Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing . Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition , it also tried to mimic the building 's finer details . The 1966 east wing addition provided for , again , more office space , but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory . The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society , a student organization on campus . 
 = = Historic significance = = 
 The observatory holds significance in astronomy because of its association with the development of selenium and photoelectric cell . The cell revolutionized the science of astronomical photoelectric photometry by the use of electricity to measure the brightness of stars by providing a more precise and accurate measurement compared to the visual and photographic methods common at that time . This branch of astronomy measures stellar magnitude . The research regarding photometry was conducted on a 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) Warner and Swasey refractor telescope in the second @-@ story equatorial room . As a result of Dr. Stebbins ' work determining stellar magnitude using photoelectric photometry , it became standard technique . Due to this astronomical importance the observatory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 6 , 1986 and on December 20 , 1989 the U.S. Department of Interior designated the U of I Observatory a National Historic Landmark .

 The two ends of SR 16 were added to the state highway system by the third bond issue , passed by the state 's voters in 1919 : Route 50 from Lower Lake east to Rumsey and Route 54 from the Sacramento @-@ Amador County line east to Drytown . Each was connected to Sacramento by existing or planned paved county highways . Although the exact alignment of Route 50 was not specified , the state Department of Engineering had already surveyed a 35 @-@ mile ( 56 km ) route through Cache Creek Canyon pursuant to a 1915 law , which defined the Yolo and Lake Highway " following generally , the meanderings of Cache creek " but did not make it a state highway . By 1924 , the California Highway Commission 's engineers had realized that building Route 50 through the canyon was impractical , and adopted a substitute plan for two highways connecting Lower Lake and Rumsey with the planned Route 15 ( Tahoe @-@ Ukiah Highway , now State Route 20 ) to the north in September 1925 . The western connection , to Lower Lake , became part of Route 49 ( now State Route 53 there ) , which continued south from Lower Lake to Calistoga . 
 Each route was extended to Sacramento in 1933 over the aforementioned county highways , taking Route 50 southeast from Rumsey to Woodland near Cache Creek and then alongside the Sacramento River to the I Street Bridge , and Route 54 west from the county line to Route 11 just outside Sacramento . The entirety of both routes , from SR 20 near Wilbur Springs through Sacramento to State Route 49 just north of Drytown ( and initially overlapping SR 49 to Jackson ) , was included in the initial state sign route system in 1934 as Sign Route 16 . Through downtown Sacramento , SR 16 followed U.S. 40 ( Legislative Route 6 ) and U.S. 50 ( Legislative Route 11 ) , mostly on Capitol Avenue , while Legislative Route 50 continued south on 5th Street ( later a one @-@ way pair of 3rd and 5th Streets ) and turned east on Broadway , carrying Sign Route 24 most of the way to Freeport Boulevard . In the 1964 renumbering , Route 16 became the new legislative designation , and Sign Route 24 through Sacramento was replaced with State Route 99 and State Route 160 . As neither of these used what had been Sign Route 24 along 3rd and 5th Streets and Broadway , part of Route 16 's new definition ( " Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento " ) was used for several years on this alignment until it became part of State Route 99 later that decade . This left the western segment of SR 16 ending at Interstate 5 near the east end of the I Street Bridge until 1984 , when the Woodland @-@ Sacramento portion , which had become redundant with the parallel Interstate 5 complete , was deleted from the legislative definition . It was at about this time that SR 16 was rerouted from the intersection with County Route E7 to continue north on a bypass of Woodland instead of east to Interstate 5 . 
 On September 15 , 2014 , Assembly Bill No. 1957 was passed , authorizing relinquishment of the segment of SR 16 in Eastern Sacramento near US 50 .

 " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " is the second episode of the tenth season of The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 20 , 1998 . In the episode , Homer has a midlife crisis realizing his life is half over and he has not accomplished anything . He begins to admire Thomas Edison and decides to create inventions to follow in Edison 's footsteps and make his life worthwhile . 
 The idea behind " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " came from Dan Greaney , who assigned John Swartzwelder to write the episode . While directing the episode , Mark Kirkland visited the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange , New Jersey to receive inspiration for several scenes in the episode that take place in this museum . William Daniels made a guest appearance in the episode as the character KITT from the television series Knight Rider . 
 " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " was viewed in approximately 7 @.@ 95 million households . In general , it received positive reviews from television critics , with many singling it out as a strong beginning to a season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer is shocked to hear on the radio that the average life expectancy for men is now 76 @.@ 2 years , which makes him realize that , at 38 @.@ 1 , his life is half over . Marge informs him that he is actually 39 , which depresses him even more . Homer thinks he has not accomplished anything that will be considered worthwhile after he dies . His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan of . When the film projector stops working , Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the projector as well as many other inventions . Homer decides to learn more about Edison and eventually idolizes him . He becomes so obsessed with him that he unknowingly begins to annoy people with stories about Edison 's life and inventions . In an attempt to follow in Edison 's footsteps , Homer quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor . 
 Homer gets to work and develops a few inventions , such as an alarm that beeps every three seconds when everything is okay , a shotgun which shoots make @-@ up onto women 's faces , an electric hammer , and a reclining chair which has a built @-@ in toilet . None of these inventions are well received by his family and he feels disappointed over his failure to invent anything useful . However , he soon becomes encouraged when he discovers that the family likes one of his other inventions – a chair with two hinged legs on the back , making it impossible to tip over backwards . His hopes are destroyed when he notices his poster of Edison , which shows Edison sitting in the same type of chair , indicating that he has already invented Homer 's <unk> chair . Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison 's inventions , and that maybe no one knows he invented it . 
 Homer and Bart therefore set out to the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange , New Jersey with his electric hammer to destroy the chair . Before he smashes the chair , Homer notices a poster of Edison 's which shows he had fewer inventions than Leonardo da Vinci . This means that Edison compared himself to Leonardo , much like Homer compares himself to Edison . Feeling a renewed connection to Edison , Homer decides not to destroy the chair . Homer also suggests that they destroy some of Leonardo 's creations , but when Bart points out those are in Italy , Homer settles for taking it out on Eli Whitney . 
 Homer and Bart return to Springfield , without knowing that they left Homer 's electric hammer behind at the museum . Later when the family watches the news on television , Kent Brockman announces that the chair and the electric hammer have just been discovered at the Edison Museum and are expected to generate millions for Edison 's already wealthy heirs . After Lisa complains that it should have been Homer 's money , Homer angrily comments that it is a good thing he is sitting on his reclining toilet chair . 
 = = Production = = 
 " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " was written by John Swartzwelder , who had a deal with the producers of the show to write five scripts for season ten . Although he was the one who wrote the episode , Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it . Greaney based Homer 's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life , he would badger and bore people with details of it . " Homer 's relationship to Thomas Edison 's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy , " Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode . The <unk> chair was also an idea of Greaney 's ; while working on the episode , he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards . He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer . Soon after coming up with the story , Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script . Greaney said " it couldn 't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it . " 
 Mark Kirkland was the director of " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " . He recalls that when he attended the table @-@ read for the episode , the staff thought it was " hilarious " and they could tell it was " going to be a good one . " It was the last episode to be produced during the season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete the production of a single episode , it had to air as a hold @-@ over in the upcoming tenth season . It was decided that " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " would be the premiere episode of season ten . As a result , the annual premiere party was held at the Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles – it was a tradition for the premiere party to be related to the premiere episode . 
 Kirkland cites his assistant director Matthew Nastuk as a big influence on the episode . He became heavily involved with the animation because he had grown up in New Jersey , where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located . To help make the museum look as authentic as possible , Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio . At one point in the episode , Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard . The producers wanted them to be actual formulas , so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them . 
 The episode features a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT , a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan . KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile . In the episode , after failing to cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life , the family shows him a video featuring KITT . The automobile , seen driving in the desert , tells Homer the following : " Hello Homer . It 's me , KITT , from TV 's Knight Rider . Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ... " ; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence . This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed . Daniels ' appearance in " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " was the first and only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000 . He recalls that " when I told my son in New York that I was going to be on The Simpsons , I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing ! The Simpsons is a great show and I 'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes . "

 In its original American broadcast , " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " finished 25th in the ratings for the week of September 14 – 20 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 0 , equivalent to approximately 7 @.@ 95 million viewing households . It tied with Beverly Hills , 90210 and Home Improvement for the 25th place . The episode was the third highest @-@ rated show ( tied with Beverly Hills , 90210 ) on the Fox network that week , following Ally McBeal and Party of Five . 
 " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " has received generally positive reviews from critics . The Daily Mail cited as a " superb " and " hilarious " episode , and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it " a terrific episode , full of wit and sly digs at our expectations of Homer 's abilities . The fact that he invents things that other people find useful ( and steal the credit for ) is both amusing and a little sad . Poor Homer . " Writing for DVD Movie Guide , Colin Jacobson commented that " though ' Wizard ' borders on ' Homer ’ s wacky scheme ' territory , his attempts to come up with something significant offer amusement . At no point does ' Wizard ' threaten to become a particularly strong episode , but it entertains to a reasonable degree . I do like the ' Everything ’ s Okay Alarm ' and the makeup gun , though . " 
 Although " Lard of the Dance " aired as a teaser episode a month earlier , " The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace " was the official season premiere of The Simpsons ' tenth season . Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe wrote that " It is gratifying to report that , based on the season premiere , The Simpsons promises to remain the most reliable half @-@ hour of laughs on television . " Similarly , David Bianculli of The New York Daily News reported that " The Simpsons is one series that , year after year , remains fresh and funny and lively and surprising . Based on tonight 's season premiere , that amazing streak is in no danger of ending . " Lauri <unk> of The Buffalo News gave the episode a 5 / 5 rating , commenting that it shows that " This cynical , bleak yet somehow still hopeful comedy is nowhere near midlife crisis with Season No. 10 . It 's still fall @-@ down funny . Thank God . " She cited Homer 's line to Marge as he and Bart leave for the Edison Museum , " I 'm @-@ taking @-@ Bart @-@ over @-@ state @-@ lines @-@ back @-@ soon @-@ I @-@ have @-@ your @-@ wallet @-@ bye ! " , as the best line of the episode . 
 Lexington Herald @-@ Leader 's Heather <unk> was not as pleased . She stated that " As always , the show is better written than most anything on TV , but for a 10th season premiere , it didn 't blow me out of the water . " In addition , Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal gave the episode a C grade , calling it an " off episode " . He commented that it " doesn 't have the zing that most Simpsons episodes do . " Kloer did , however , enjoy Homer 's inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs and the make @-@ up gun , and Homer 's line to Marge before he shoots her with it : " Try to keep your nostrils closed . " Marge 's response after being shot , " Homer ! You ’ ve got it set on whore ! " , was commended by The Gazette , DVD Verdict , and Ian Jane of DVD Talk , who called the scene the highlight of the episode . 
 In his 2015 book The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets , Dr Simon Singh wrote that in the episode , Homer writes an equation on a chalkboard and “ If you work it out , you get the mass of a Higgs boson that ’ s only a bit larger than the nano @-@ mass of a Higgs boson actually is . It ’ s kind of amazing as Homer makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered . ” He stated that the mathematical backgrounds of many of the show 's writers made it the " most mathematical TV show on prime @-@ time television in history " , and it could " encourage and nourish " young people with an interest in mathematics .

 CD Projekt S.A. ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ̪ <unk> <unk> : ] , formerly CD Projekt Sp. <unk> ) is a Polish video game developer , publisher and distributor based in Warsaw , which was founded in 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński . Iwiński and Kiciński were video game retailers before they founded the company . CD Projekt is best known for their The Witcher series of video games and their digital @-@ distribution service GOG.com. 
 The company began translating major Western video @-@ game releases into Polish , collaborating with Interplay Entertainment for two Baldur 's Gate games . CD Projekt was working on the PC version of Baldur 's Gate : Dark Alliance when Interplay experienced financial difficulties . The game was cancelled and the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game . It became The Witcher , a video game based on the works of Andrzej <unk> . 
 After the release of The Witcher , CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher : White Wolf ; but development issues and increasing costs almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy . CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt which received positive critical reviews . The company 's upcoming project is Cyberpunk 2077 , an open @-@ world role @-@ playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop system . 
 A video game distribution service , GOG.com was established by CD Projekt to help players find old games . Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management ( DRM ) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games . The company opposes DRM in video games , and hopes that free downloadable content becomes an industry standard . CD Projekt considers maintaining their independence one of their most important strategies . The company currently focuses on the international market , particularly Europe and North America , and spun off its Polish business <unk> in 2014 .

 = = = Founding = = = 
 CD Projekt was founded in 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michal Kiciński . According to Iwiński , although he enjoyed playing video games as a child they were scarce in Poland ( which was in the Soviet Union 's sphere of influence at the time ) . Polish copyright law did not exist and Iwiński , in high school , sold cracked copies of Western video games at a Warsaw marketplace . In high school Iwiński met Kiciński , who became his business partner ; at that time , Kiciński also sold video games . 
 Wanting to conduct business legitimately , Iwiński and Kiciński began importing games from US retailers and were the first importers of CD @-@ ROM games . After the transition to a primarily market @-@ based economy in the early 90s , they founded their own company . Iwiński and Kiciński founded CD Projekt in the second quarter of 1994 . With only $ 2 @,@ 000 , they used a friend 's flat as a rent @-@ free office . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 When CD Projekt was founded , their biggest challenge was overcoming video game piracy . The company was one of the first in Poland to localize games ; according to Iwiński , most of their products were sold to " mom @-@ and @-@ pop shops " . CD Projekt began partial localization for developers such as Seven Stars and <unk> @-@ <unk> in 1996 , and full @-@ scale localization a year later . To sell their games , they approached BioWare and Interplay Entertainment for the Polish localization of Baldur 's Gate . They expected the title to become popular in Poland , and no retailer would be able to translate the text from English version to Polish . To increase the title 's popularity in Poland , CD Projekt added items to the game 's packaging and hired well @-@ known Polish actors to voice its characters . Their first attempt was successful , with 18 @,@ 000 units shipped on the game 's release day ( higher than the average shipments of other games at the time ) . 
 The company continued to work with Interplay after the release of Baldur 's Gate , collaborating on a PC port for the sequel Baldur 's Gate : Dark Alliance . To develop the port , CD Projekt hired Sebastian Zieliński ( who had developed <unk> 2093 @-@ 1944 ) and Adam Badowski , who became head of the company 's game @-@ development division CD Projekt RED . Six months after development began , Interplay experienced financial problems and cancelled the PC version . CD Projekt continued to localize other games after Dark Alliance 's cancellation , and received Business Gazelle awards in 2003 and 2004 . 
 = = = Game development = = = 
 Enthusiasm for game distribution ebbed , and CD Projekt 's founders wondered if the company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliance 's cancellation . With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt , the company planned to use them to develop their first original game . They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej <unk> 's Wiedźmin books ( which were popular in Poland ) and the author accepted the company 's development proposal . The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio , but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise . According to Iwiński , he and Kiciński had no idea how to develop a video game at that time . 
 To develop the game , the company formed a video @-@ game development studio ( CD Projekt RED , headed by Sebastian Zieliński ) in Łódź in 2002 . The studio made a demonstration game , which Adam Badowski called " a piece of crap " in retrospect . The demo was a role @-@ playing game with a top @-@ down perspective , similar to Dark Alliance and Diablo , and used the game engine which powered <unk> . Iwiński and Kiciński pitched the demo to a number of publishers , without success . The Łódź office closed and the staff , except for Zieliński , moved to the Warsaw headquarters . 
 Zieliński left the company , and Kiciński headed the project . Although the game 's development continued , the demo was abandoned . According to CD Projekt , the development team had different ideas for the game and lacked overall direction ; as a result , it was returned to the drawing board in 2003 . The team , unfamiliar with video @-@ game development , spent nearly two years organising production . They received assistance from BioWare , who helped promote the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to Jade Empire . BioWare also licensed their Aurora game engine to the company . 
 The game 's budget exceeded expectations . The original 15 @-@ person development team expanded to about 100 , at a cost of 20 million złoty . According to Iwiński , content was removed from the game for budgetary reasons but the characters ' personalities were retained ; however , there was difficulty in translating the game 's Polish text into English . Atari agreed to publish the game . After five years of development , The game would bring Wiedźmin to an international audience , and so the company came up with an English name : The Witcher . The Witcher was released in 2007 to generally positive reviews . 
 Sales were satisfactory , and the development of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher 's release . The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 ( again powered by the Aurora Engine ) , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3 . Their development was halted when the team began work on The Witcher : White Wolf , a console version of The Witcher . Although they collaborated with French studio Widescreen Games for the console port , it entered development limbo . Widescreen demanded more manpower , money and time to develop the title , complaining that they were not being paid ; according to Iwiński , CD Projekt paid them more than their own staff members . The team cancelled the project , suspending its development . Unhappy with the decision , Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2 . CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008 . 
 The dispute over White Wolf was costly ; the company faced bankruptcy , with the financial crisis of 2007 – 08 a contributing factor . To stay afloat , the team decided to focus on The Witcher 2 with the Witcher 3 engine . When the engine ( known as <unk> ) was finished , the game could be ported to other consoles . To develop The Witcher 2 , the company suspended development of Metropolis ' first @-@ person shooter They . After three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years of development , The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings was released in 2011 to critical praise and sales of more than 1 @.@ 7 million copies . 
 After The Witcher 2 CD Projekt wanted to develop an open @-@ world game of a quality similar to their other games , and the company wanted to add features to avoid criticism that it was Witcher 2 @.@ 5 . They wanted to push the game 's graphics boundaries , releasing it only for the PC and eighth @-@ generation consoles . This triggered debate on the team , some of whom wanted to release the game for older consoles to maximise profit . The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt took three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years to develop and cost over $ 81 million . After multiple delays , it was released in May 2015 to critical praise . Wild Hunt was commercially successful , selling six million copies in its first six weeks and giving the studio a profit of 236 million złoty ( $ 62 @.@ 5 million ) in the first half of 2015 . The team released 15 content downloads and two expansion , Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine . CD Projekt released two other The Witcher games : The Witcher Adventure ( a board game for PC , iOS and Android ) and The Witcher : Battle Arena , a multiplayer online battle arena game for iOS and Android . At E3 2016 , the company announced Gwent : The Witcher Card Game , based on the popular card mini @-@ game Gwent from The Witcher 3 . 
 In December 2015 , CD Projekt RED won the " Developer of the Year " award at The Game Awards 2015 . In March 2016 , the company announced that they had another role @-@ playing game in development , and that the title is scheduled to be released in the period 2017 to 2021 . They also announced plans for expansion , where the RED division will expand two @-@ fold .

 CD Projekt is a game distributor , and their Polish company ( a digital distribution platform focusing on the Polish market ) was renamed <unk> in 2012 . The service , which provided technical assistance , expanded to movies , electronic books and comics . <unk> was later separated , with CD Projekt holding a controlling share . CD Projekt reduced its share to 8 @.@ 29 percent , since the company wanted to aim at the global market rather than the Polish one . The companies would co @-@ operate with each other for the distribution of games . 
 In 2008 the company introduced Good Old Games , a distribution service with a digital rights management @-@ free strategy . The service aims to help players find " good old games " , preserving old games . To do so , the team needed to unravel licensing issues for defunct developers or negotiate with publishers for distribution rights . To recover old code for conversion to modern platforms , they had to use retail versions or second @-@ hand games . CD Projekt partnered with small developers and large publishers , including Activision , Electronic Arts and Ubisoft , to broaden the service 's portfolio of games to triple @-@ A and independent video games . Despite suspicions that it was a " doomed project " , according to managing director Guillaume <unk> , it has expanded since its introduction . Income from GOG.com ( known internally as CD Projekt Blue ) accrues to CD Projekt RED .

 CD Projekt developed three Witcher titles before deciding that The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt would be the final game in the series with <unk> .

Introduced in May 2012 with an international development team , it was described by CD Projekt as " far bigger " than The Witcher III . Another CD Projekt office in Krakow , which had assisted the development of CD Projekt 's previous games , is expected to develop their own games in the future . 
 Regarding the future of the Witcher series , Konrad <unk> , game director of The Witcher 3 , stated in May 2016 that he hoped to continue working with the series sometime in the future , but had nothing planned at the time .

 They decided to focus on a few aspects and assess the value of other features . This approach , they hope , helps to maintain the quality of their games . The company focused on the development of role @-@ playing games , with the team working on established franchises with a fan base and introducing lesser @-@ known franchises to a wide audience . When the team develops an open @-@ world game , they prioritise quest design over the size of its world in the belief that having choices to make encourages players to immerse themselves in the game . 
 The team makes the players their priority ; according to Iwiński , support from players " drives " the company ( which considers themselves " rebels " ) . The team focuses on creative strategy over business strategy . CD Projekt RED opposes the inclusion of digital @-@ rights @-@ management technology in video games and software . The company believes that DRM is ineffective in halting software piracy , based on data from sales of The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings . CD Projekt RED found that their initial release ( which included DRM technology ) was pirated over 4 @.@ 5 million times ; their DRM @-@ free re @-@ release was pirated far less , and The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt was released without DRM technology . The team , believing that free downloadable content should be an industry standard , published 15 free DLC releases for Wild Hunt as an example to others in the industry . 
 According to Adam Badowski , head of CD Projekt RED , maintaining its independence is a company priority . They avoided becoming a subsidiary of another company for financial and creative freedom and ownership of their projects . Electronic Arts was rumoured to be attempting to acquire CD Projekt . This was quickly denied by Iwiński , who said that maintaining the company 's independence is something he " will be fighting for " . 
 The company aims to follow the Rockstar Games model , where the company works on a single project with a large team , and avoids working on multiple projects at the same time .

 On 2 October 2008 it was reported that Nick Cotton , played by John Altman would return to EastEnders in Christmas 2008 . After spending time in Walsall , Nick would return with an eight @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Dotty . The part of Dotty was cast to Molly Conlin , speaking of her casting , Conlin said , " I 'm really excited about it because I have always wanted to be in EastEnders . " Conlin was considered too old for the part of Tiffany Dean which she a previously auditioned for but she succeeded in impressing the producers , who offered her the role of Dotty instead . The part of Tiffany went to Maisie Smith . Dotty was originally eleven years old , but on Conlin 's casting , they changed her age to seven . Introduced as a guest character by Santer she made her first appearance on 25 December 2008 . 
 Starting to appear more frequently , Dotty became a recurring character . Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty 's storyline would go " to a very , very dark place ! " He questioned whether the character was born bad or if her father had made her that way , and if she could be more dangerous than Nick . As the storyline between Dot , Dotty and Nick progressed , Nick 's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty . A BBC source told The Sun , " [ Dot 's ] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale . He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine . She always knew Nick would sell his soul for the price of some pick ’ n mix but she had no idea he ’ d sell his own daughter . " In a further plot twist , it was revealed to the audience in 2009 , that Dotty was colluding with her father all along . The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman 's departure from the show for the fourth time . Dotty later left on 23 February 2010 .

 Dotty is a seven @-@ year @-@ old child who has pigtails . The EastEnders website describes her as " butter wouldn 't melt when it comes to this cockney sparrow , but underneath she 's a devil in disguise " , as well as conniving , backstabbing and cold @-@ hearted . Altman described Dotty as " a chip off the old block " , as did Nancy Banks @-@ Smith from The Guardian though the Daily Record described Dotty as " a chip off her grandma 's block " . Charlie Clements , who played Bradley Branning , said that Dotty , being Nick 's daughter , was " bound to be a bit iffy . " He also called her " evil " , as did several critics . Simon called Dotty " [ the ] apple that hasn 't fallen far from the tree . " On Holy Soap , Dotty is called a " demon child " and " sweetness and light " on the surface , " but underneath lurks a devil ! " . Nancy Banks @-@ Smith from The Guardian described Dotty as " enigmatic " , while Kris Green from Digital Spy compared Dotty 's image to that of Damien Thorn from The Omen and Regan MacNeil from The Exorcist . The Sun said " Dotty is one of the youngest , most wicked female soap villains " .

 Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror criticised Dotty 's accent and the storyline surrounding poisoning Dot . Stuart Heritage from The Guardian said that Dotty gave him " the willies " . He said , " Technically Dotty has already left EastEnders , but it was an open @-@ ended goodbye and she 's free to return whenever she likes . This must not happen , simply because she gives me the willies more than anything else I 've ever seen " , Simon similarly opined saying that she was glad to see Dotty leave . Brown opined that Dot and Nick 's storyline with Dotty was one of her highlights of the series , as did Altman . Santer praised Conlin for her portrayal of Dotty saying , " I love that little girl because she 's having to play all these layers . Normally , what kids have to do of that age is say lines and be cute . She , though , has to play layers of deception . She has to play a character who 's acting . " 
 = Otto Frederick Hunziker = 
 Otto Frederick Hunziker ( 25 December 1873 – 16 November 1959 ) was a pioneer in the American and international dairy industry , as both an educator and a technical innovator . Hunziker was born and raised in Switzerland , emigrated to the U.S. , and studied at Cornell University . He started and developed the dairy program at Purdue University when such programs were at their infancy . At this same time , Hunziker was heavily involved with the development of the American Dairy Science Association ( ADSA ) and the standardization and improvement of many dairy tests and processes . Hunziker wrote several of the leading dairy processing texts , which continue to be cited . After leaving Purdue University , Hunziker managed research and operations at a large , national <unk> , continued to drive ADSA 's standardization and publishing efforts , represented the U.S. at international dairy congresses , and facilitated dairy industry improvements across the globe . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Otto Frederick Hunziker was born in Zürich , Switzerland , on 25 December 1873 to Karl Otto and Luise ( <unk> ) Hunziker . Otto 's siblings were Karl Rudolf ( born 5 February 1870 , Zürich ) , Barbara Luise ( 17 June 1871 – 16 October 1871 ) , and Marie Julie ( 23 July 1872 – 30 June 1938 ) . Hunziker spent many early years in Goldbach , Switzerland , where his father was a pastor , professor , and member of the canton parliament . Otto attended the two @-@ year course of studies at <unk> Agricultural College in Zürich , graduating at age 19 . In 1893 , Otto Frederick Hunziker emigrated to the United States . 
 During this time period , significant new development in dairy processing technology was occurring on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean . In 1890 , Stephen Babcock published specifications for the Babcock test for milk fat content . In 1892 , Dr. Niklaus Gerber acquired a Swiss patent on the Gerber method for analyzing fat content in milk . Dr. Gerber was based in Zürich , had studied at the University of Zürich , and worked for two years at the Swiss @-@ American Milk Company in Little Falls , New York . Hunziker would spend a substantial amount of time studying and improving these analytic methods . 
 In the United States , Hunziker worked for two years as a laborer on a dairy farm near Attleboro , Massachusetts . To improve his English and commercial skills , he studied at Bryant and Stratton Business College ( now Bryant University ) , Providence , Rhode Island in 1896 . He returned to Switzerland briefly in 1898 before returning to receive a B.S. Agriculture in 1900 and <unk> in 1901 from Cornell University . He served as an assistant in charge of dairy bacteriology at Cornell University until 1902 , when he equipped and operated a dairy manufacturing research laboratory for the Scranton Condensed Milk Company in Ellicottville , New York . Otto Frederick married Florence Belle Burne on 10 April 1905 in Portville , Cattaraugus County , New York . 
 = = Professorship at Purdue = = 
 In 1905 Hunziker accepted a position at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana as head of Purdue 's Dairy Department . Dairy departments were relatively new at American colleges . ( The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the University of Wisconsin in 1890 . ) Hunziker led Purdue 's dairy department through significant growth . 
 In the summer of 1906 , Hunziker was among 18 teachers and investigators meeting at the University of Illinois , Urbana , to found what was then known as National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators . ( The following year , this association changed its name to " Official Dairy Instructors ' Association " and , in 1916 , changed its name to " American Dairy Science Association " ( ADSA ) . ) From 1910 to 1926 , Hunziker chaired ADSA 's Committee on Official Methods of Testing Milk and Cream for <unk> . In 1911 , this committee met in Washington , D.C. with the U.S. Bureau of <unk> , the U.S. Bureau of Standards and manufacturers of glassware . Standard specifications for Babcock glassware were published as a result of this meeting . Hunziker actively pursued numerous improvements to the testing methodology , which improved the quality and safety of dairy products . Hunziker was the third president of ADSA from 1910 through 1911 . During Hunziker 's presidency , ADSA also : created a national score card for scoring dairies ; standardized dairy judging contests ; secured scholarships for student contests ; improved national milk standards ; developed ties with breed associations ; and , provided fora for industry discussions on dairy instruction and extension services . 
 Apart from application of improved pedagogy and scientific methodology , Hunziker oversaw planning and construction of Smith Hall , the building which thereafter housed Purdue 's dairy manufacturing group , extension service , and creamery . While at Purdue , he published over 50 bulletins , leaflets , and scientific treatises addressing dairy farm and plant problems . In 1917 , Hunziker left Purdue to manage manufacturing and research at the Blue Valley Creamery Company in Chicago , Illinois . 
 = = Professional life = = 
 Hunziker wrote dairy articles and textbooks used throughout the world , developed dairy curricula , advocated for dairy laws , and developed standard testing methodology . In particular , Hunziker authored The Butter Industry , Prepared for Factory , School and Laboratory , a well @-@ known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions ( 1920 , 1927 , 1940 ) . A book that Hunziker originally self @-@ published in 1914 , " Condensed Milk and Milk Powder : Prepared for the Use of Milk <unk> , Dairy Students and Pure Food Departments " , was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press . According to one book review : " The popularity of this book may be judged by the fact that this is the fourth edition , the three previous editions having long since been exhausted . The book is the most important contribution on the condensed milk and milk powder industry . It should be in the library of the teacher , the student or factory man interested in any phase of the condensed milk and milk powder industry . " Both books are listed by Cornell University as " Core Historical Literature of Agriculture " . In the 1920s , Hunziker initiated a " dairy school over the air " — a radio program on WGN for which dairy experts were invited to discuss various issues . Hunziker was a director of the National Dairy Council and is listed in The Ten Master Minds of <unk> . When the World 's Dairy Congress was held in the U.S. in 1923 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture selected Hunziker to head the industry and economics program . He later represented the United States at World Dairy Congresses in London , 1928 ; Copenhagen , 1931 ; Berlin , 1937 ; Stockholm , 1949 ; and The Hague , 1953 . He obtained several United States patents , including : US <unk> , Hunziker , O F , " Apparatus for <unk> cream " , published 1925 @-@ 06 @-@ 30 and US <unk> , Hunziker , O F , " Process for treating milk and its products " , published 1929 @-@ 08 @-@ 06 . At Blue Valley , Hunziker established a research program for 22 <unk> and two milk plants . In 1932 , Purdue University bestowed an honorary doctoral degree in science . He retired from Blue Valley Creamery in 1939 to work as a consultant . In 1942 , O F Hunziker was honored with the first ADSA honorary life membership . Hunziker was awarded numerous international honors for his work , including : 
 Diploma from Italian government for scientific papers at Milan International Exposition 
 1927 : Australian Dairy Council 
 1928 : Swiss gold medal 
 1934 : <unk> Distinguished Service Scroll 
 1942 : " Grande Diploma de Honra " , Brazilian Instituto ― Tecnico Industrial

 = St Ffinan 's Church , Llanffinan = 
 St Ffinan 's Church , Llanffinan is a small 19th @-@ century parish church built in the Romanesque revival style , in Anglesey , north Wales . There has been a church in this area , even if not on this precise location , since at least 1254 , and 19th @-@ century writers state that St Ffinan established the first church here in the 7th century . The church was rebuilt in 1841 , reusing a 12th @-@ century font and 18th @-@ century memorials , as well as the cross at the eastern end of the roof . 
 The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of eight in a combined parish , and services are held weekly . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is considered to be " a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style " . The church is at the end of a gravel track in the countryside of central Anglesey , about 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) from Llangefni , the county town . It is also on a footpath to Plas Penmynydd , once home to Owen Tudor , founder of the Tudor dynasty .

 St Ffinan 's Church is in the countryside in the centre of Anglesey , north Wales , near the village of Talwrn , and about 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) away from Llangefni , the county town of Anglesey . The parish church is at the end of a gravelled track , off a country lane between the lower part of Talwrn and the hamlet of <unk> to the south . It can also be accessed by public footpath from Plas Penmynydd , once home to Owen Tudor , grandfather of King Henry VII and founder of the Tudor dynasty . The parish takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , with " <unk> " denoting the saint . 
 The date of construction of the first church in this area is uncertain , although a church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation of churches . The 19th @-@ century writers and antiquarians Angharad Llwyd and Samuel Lewis said that St Ffinan , to whom the church is dedicated , established the first church here towards the beginning of the 7th century , possibly around 620 . Llwyd described the old church in 1833 as " a small neat edifice " . The current building was designed by the architect John Welch and erected in 1841 , with the first service held on 6 July of that year . Welch also designed the church of St Nidan , Llanidan , in the south of Anglesey , which was built between 1839 and 1843 . 
 St Ffinan 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of eight churches in a combined parish called Bro Cadwaladr . It is within the deanery of Synod Ynys Mon , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2016 , the vicar is Emlyn Williams , assisted by an associate priest , E. R. Roberts . Williams was appointed in 2007 ; before that , the position had been vacant for 20 years despite many attempts by the Church in Wales to fill it . Services are held at St Ffinan 's on the first to fourth Sundays of every month , either <unk> <unk> ( Welsh : Holy Communion ) or <unk> <unk> ( Morning Prayer ) ; on the fifth Sunday of the month , a service of Holy Communion is held at one of the churches in the parish . There are no midweek services . 
 John Jones , who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727 , was also rector of St Ffinan 's during that time , as it was one of the benefices attached to the deanery . Jones is <unk> by a stone tablet on the wall of St Mary 's Church , Pentraeth , also in Anglesey . The antiquarian Nicholas Owen was perpetual curate here from 1790 until his death in 1811 ; he is buried at St Tyfrydog 's Church , Llandyfrydog , Anglesey . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church is small and rectangular , built from stone with a slate roof ; there is a bellcote at the west end of the roof . There is no internal structural division between the nave and the chancel . The style is Romanesque revival . There is a round @-@ headed window in each of the three bays of the church , and a three @-@ part window in the chancel . The doorway at the west end has small windows on either side , and a window above ; a stone slab between the upper window and the doorway has " 1841 " upon it . Stained glass has been inserted into the windows in memory of parishioners . 
 A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a number of items that had been preserved from the old church . The circular font , made of gritstone , dates from the 12th @-@ century ; it has a " very crude interlacing strap ornament " , and has been fitted upon a more modern base . There are two memorials from the 18th century , one dated 1705 to " Iohn Lloyd of <unk> <unk> " and one dated 1764 to " Hugh , son of Richard Hugh of Ty @-@ hen " . The churchyard contains one Commonwealth war grave from the First World War , of Private Evan Oswald Thomas , a Royal Welsh Fusiliers soldier from Talwrn . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 St Ffinan 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is considered to be " a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style " . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) describes it as " a small rural church " . 
 Samuel Lewis said that the new church was " a plain structure in the old English style , with strong buttresses , which have a good effect , being so well suited to the exposed situation of the building . " Writing in 1846 , the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church , " a modern erection of the Pseudo @-@ Norman style " , stood in " a highly picturesque situation . " He said that the cross at the east end of the roof came from the old church . 
 A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region describes the 1841 rebuilding work as " rectangular and harsh " . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that it is " a good example of the small rural church " , set in a " well @-@ maintained churchyard " . It also notes that its style " is quite different to most Anglesey churches " .

 What is now MS 172 was originally designated as part of the Lee Highway auto trail in 1920 before becoming part of US 72 when the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926 . The route was briefly US 78 before being redesignated US 72 by 1932 . The route was fully paved by the end of the 1930s and served as a part of US 72 until 1986 , when a new divided highway was built to the south . By 1998 , the former routing of US 72 was designated MS 172 .
