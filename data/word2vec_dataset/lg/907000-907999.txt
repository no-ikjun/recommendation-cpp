 = 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans = 
 The 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans was the 75th Grand Prix of Endurance , and took place at the Circuit de la Sarthe , Le Mans , France from 16 – 17 June 2007 . Four classes of cars raced together , with each class having honors for its highest finishers . The faster LMP1 and LMP2 classes were for custom @-@ built Le Mans Prototypes ( LMP ) , and the slower GT1 and GT2 classes were for modified grand <unk> ( GT ) road cars . 
 The LMP1 class saw the first competition between the new diesel engined Peugeot 908 HDi FAP prototype and the diesel Audi R10 TDI , the 2006 Le Mans winner ; the Audi once again achieved an overall victory . There was heavy attrition in the LMP2 class , in which only two competitors finished the race . In the GT1 class , Aston Martin achieved its first win over the Corvette since returning to the event in 2005 . The GT2 class was a battle between Ferrari and Porsche , won by Porsche . The race was attended by over 250 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 = = Track changes = = 
 Between the 2006 and 2007 races , the Circuit de la Sarthe was upgraded , most obviously by the reprofiling of the Tertre Rouge corner . The new corner was moved inward , to create a long flowing curve instead of the single point apex it had been previously , shortening the lap distance by 21 meters to a revised 13 @.@ 629 km . A new pedestrian tunnel – below the Mulsanne Straight , immediately after Tertre Rouge – was also built . The work had been planned to be carried out before the 2006 event , but it was delayed because of budgetary concerns . 
 Nine new garages were built at the end of the pit lane , replacing the four temporary garages that had been built a few years earlier . The additional garages allowed the ACO to increase the number of entries it could grant from 50 to 55 . The paddock behind the garages was also re @-@ organized with more facilities added for spectators , including more shops , new landscaping , and the Audi Tower monument . 
 The public roads from the Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re @-@ surfaced . Run @-@ off areas at the Dunlop Chicane , Tertre Rouge , Indianapolis , and Ford Chicanes were also partially asphalted in order to avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course . This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow themselves more efficiently using their brakes and tyres on tarmac . 
 = = Rule changes = = 
 Several months before the event , the ACO announced rule changes for all Le Mans @-@ based series ( American Le Mans Series , Le Mans Series , and Japan Le Mans Challenge ) , effective in 2007 for all four classes : 
 <unk> with diesel engines had their fuel tank capacity decreased from 90 litres to 81 litres . <unk> with petrol engines kept their 90 litre tanks . 
 LMP2 , GT1 , and GT2 class cars had to be fitted with 5 % smaller air <unk> than they had run in 2006 , in order to decrease power . 
 GT1 and GT2 classes were allowed to run ethanol and other alternative fuels if approved by the ACO . 
 The International Motor Sports Association ( IMSA ) initially decided to not abide by the LMP2 restrictor change for the American Le Mans Series , although that decision was reversed following Le Mans . <unk> decided not to fully conform to the new ACO regulations in the Japan Le Mans Challenge until 2008 . 
 The ACO also announced rule changes specific to Le Mans : 
 The number of invited entries was increased from 50 to 55 , with this number to be increased in subsequent years . 
 All entries had to run Shell fuel in either diesel or petrol form . 
 The temperature inside closed @-@ cockpit cars was not to exceed 32 ° C in cars with air conditioning or 10 ° C above the ambient air temperature in cars without . The ACO would monitor cockpit temperature , and stop any car in which those limits were exceeded . 
 Noise level regulation was revised : the noise emitted from the car had to be less than 113 dB ( measurement taken at 15 meters from the edge of the track ) . 
 Older LMP900 and <unk> class prototypes were not allowed to be entered . Only newer LMP1 and LMP2 class cars were allowed to compete . 
 It was also decided that the race would start at 3 : 00 pm local time , one hour earlier than the normal 4 : 00 pm , to allow French spectators more time to vote in the 17 June French legislative election . 
 = = Entries = = 
 = = = Automatic invitations = = = 
 Teams earned automatic invitations to the event from the ACO for winning certain races and championships in their respective classes . Teams were limited to no more than two entries . If a team had already earned its two entries , additional invitations were extended to the next best @-@ performing competitor . Cars running outside of the ACO 's rules were also skipped and the invitation given to the next competitor . 
 On 13 December 2006 , the ACO released its official list of automatic entries from the multiple Le Mans backed series and races . On 22 December , the ACO announced that it would add four more automatic entries , this time chosen from the 2006 FIA GT Championship season 's team champions and runners @-@ up in each class , as part of an agreement between the ACO and FIA GT 's <unk> organisation . 
 All other teams had to apply to the ACO for an invitation . The ACO then decided on the remainder of the entry list based on each team 's recent performances , as well as its originality in chassis and engine design . 
 = = = = List of automatic entries = = = = 
 On 19 January 2007 , the ACO announced that 24 of the 28 teams had accepted their automatic entries before the deadline . Penske Racing turned down both of its invitations , and Ray Mallock , Ltd. rejected its second entry because of a lack of funding . Vitaphone Racing Team rejected its invitation because its Maserati MC12 did not comply with the ACO 's GT1 rules , although the team later attempted to gain entry in another class through application . 
 = = = Official entry list = = = 
 On 27 February 2007 , the ACO published the official entry list , which included the full 55 entries and 8 reserves . 
 Although drivers were not listed , Tom Kristensen 's injury in the opening round of the 2007 Deutsche <unk> Masters season made his participation in the race questionable . As the driver with the most wins at Le Mans , he was intended to be part of Audi 's factory team . Fellow Audi DTM driver Mattias Ekström was nominated as his possible replacement by Audi . However , on 11 June 2007 Kristensen was cleared by doctors to race , leaving Ekström 's services unneeded . 
 = = = = Reserve entries = = = = 
 A total of eight reserve entries were listed by the ACO in its initial published list . Reserves were added to the entry list when a competitor already on the list withdrew . The ACO determined the order in which reserve entries were considered for addition to the entry list . 
 Two cars officially withdrew from the entry list in April , with their places taken by the following reserve entries : 
 On 3 April 2007 , <unk> Racing announced that its LMP2 Radical @-@ Judd entry had been withdrawn due to the car being purchased by Embassy Racing . The PSI Experience Chevrolet Corvette <unk> took its place on the entry list . 
 On 11 April 2007 , Petersen / White Lightning announced that its GT2 Ferrari entry had withdrawn due to financial strain for the team , leaving it to concentrate solely on the American Le Mans Series . The <unk> Sport Ferrari F430 took its place on the entry list . 
 JMB Racing also withdrew its entry from the reserve list due to its drivers reaching an agreement with AF Corse to run in its entry instead . 
 = = Test session = = 
 The official test session for Le Mans was held on 3 June , and was the only practice session that was not part of qualifying timing . A total of eight hours of track time was allowed for teams to find their set @-@ ups and for rookie drivers to get in their required ten laps to learn the circuit . 
 The sessions were led by Sébastien Bourdais , with his Peugeot 908 HDi FAP setting a lap time of 3 : 26 @.@ 707 , a second and a half ahead of two trailing Audis . Pescarolo Sport had the fastest gasoline @-@ powered car in fourth . In the LMP2 class , the pair of Barazi @-@ Epsilon entries led with identical times of 3 : 39 @.@ 016 ; ASM Team Racing for Portugal trailed the pair in class . 
 In GT1 , the No. 63 Corvette recorded the fastest time of the day with a 3 : 49 @.@ 207 , followed by the No. 007 Aston Martin and the second factory Corvette . GT2 was dominated by Porsche , with the top three positions being taken by the new <unk> . IMSA Performance Matmut led with a 4 : 01 @.@ 598 , while Autorlando and Flying Lizard followed behind . The Risi Competizione entry was the fastest Ferrari , in fourth place . 
 Although there were various small incidents , three major accidents led to a red flag for the session . The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry , driven by Guillaume Moreau , went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour . The car could not return to the test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact . The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov , becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall . In the final incident , almost in the last hour of the session , the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves , and briefly caught fire . 
 The damage to the Arena Zytek led to the car being withdrawn during scrutineering a week and a half later , just before the actual race . The team decided that it was not able to repair the damage in time for the car to pass scrutineering . 
 = = Qualifying = = 
 Qualifying was held on 13 – 14 June , with two two @-@ hour sessions each night ; one run at dusk , the other in darkness . New drivers were again required to run a set number of laps to learn the circuit and be allowed to race : three in daylight and three at night . The best overall time from all four sessions determined the starting grid . 
 = = = Wednesday = = = 
 The first qualifying session began under the threat of rain , so most of the teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated . The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times , and at the end of the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3 @.@ 28 @.@ 301 . The No. 33 Barazi @-@ Epsilon Zytek led LMP2 , after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired . Oreca 's <unk> were the fastest two GT1 cars , while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2 . The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago , driven by Marco Apicella , hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane . The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd . Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began . The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag . 
 The second session started several minutes late due to the damp conditions from the earlier rain . A red flag briefly came out for the No. 5 Swiss Spirit Lola a few minutes after the session began due to the car being stopped at the side of the track . Although the track was drying , it was not until the last half hour that teams were able to improve on their first session times . The No. 2 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot swapped the pole position multiple times before the session ended with the No. 8 Peugeot claiming the top position on the final lap of the session with a time of 3 : 26 @.@ 344 . In GT1 the No. 008 <unk> Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3 : 50 @.@ 761 . The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement ; the class leading teams remained the same . 
 It was later announced by the ACO that JLOC Isao Noritake would be allowed to use another Lamborghini Murciélago R @-@ GT chassis , borrowed from the French <unk> team , but Marco Apicella was not allowed to drive in the race due to the head injuries he sustained in his accident during qualifying , leaving the team with two drivers . 
 = = = Thursday = = = 
 The first session on Thursday began in heavy rain . Although some cars attempted to carry out wet weather testing , the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages . Once the rain began to slacken off cars returned to the track , but the rain continued throughout the entire session . No one was able to improve on their qualifying times from the previous day . 
 The rain continued throughout the second session , so most teams concentrated on their wet weather setups in preparation for a wet race . About halfway through the session the No. 7 Peugeot in the hands of Marc Gené missed the turn at <unk> and hit a tire barrier . The car was unable to return to the pits and was taken behind the wall by the marshals . This was soon followed by the No. 73 Luc <unk> Corvette missing the same turn as well , but it continued on without significant damage . The No. 70 PSI Corvette had a minor accident in the last five minutes of the session , bringing out the only red flag of the day and ending all of qualifying . 
 Audi led the wet sessions with a 4 : 01 @.@ 257 time for the No. 1 car , followed by the No. 3 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot within a second . No. 33 Barazi @-@ Epsilon again led the times for the second day in LMP2 , while the No. 54 Oreca <unk> continued to show strong pace with the fastest time in GT1 . The No. 93 Autorlando Sport Porsche was the fastest GT2 class entry in the rain .

 The race began at 3 : 00 pm local time ( GMT + 1 ) , with the track still damp following a wet morning warm @-@ up . Sébastien Bourdais 's Peugeot 908 HDi FAP led the field into the Dunlop Chicane , which he overshot , handing the lead to the No. 2 Audi R10 TDI . The three Audis took over the lead during the opening hour , before pit stops began . 
 The rebuilt Lamborghini of JLOC Isao Noritake was the first retirement of the race when the gearbox failed on the Mulsanne during its second lap of the race . Shortly after the first hour of the race had been completed , heavy rain resulted in the safety car being brought out again . 
 Soon after the field was released , the safety car was once again required after an accident in which Mike Rockenfeller spun his No. 3 Audi R10 TDI on the exit from Tertre Rouge , hitting the safety barriers on the Mulsannes Straight backwards . While crews fixed the barrier , Rockenfeller attempted to repair his Audi , but he was finally forced to retire . This caution period also saw an early retirement for the No. 64 Corvette when a part of its drivetrain broke while following the safety car . Oliver Gavin attempted to return to the pits using battery power but was stopped by the marshals , forcing him to abandon the car . The race eventually continued after nearly an hour under caution . 
 = = = Night = = = 
 As dusk began to fall on the drying track , the No. 8 Peugeot suffered from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage . 
 This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place . Jacques Villeneuve 's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time , which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi . The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi 's rear end . The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane 's gravel trap , and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop . 
 A third safety car period was caused by the Creation <unk> entry , which ran into the tire barriers at the Porsche Curves and needed to be extracted . The Creation returned to the pits but eventually retired . The Kruse Motorsport entry also suffered problems when it briefly stopped at the pit entrance during the caution period , blocking other cars attempting to make their own pit stops . The Kruse entry eventually succeeded in getting to its garage . 
 As the night continued and the race neared its halfway point , many cars suffered mechanical failures , putting them out of the race . They included a large number of the LMP2 class cars such as Team ASM and Ray Mallock Ltd . , both of which had led the class at one point . In GT1 , the two factory Aston Martins led the lone remaining factory Corvette by one lap , while the No. 97 Risi Competizione Ferrari had a two @-@ lap lead in the GT2 class . 
 = = = Morning = = = 
 In the early hours , fluids were spilled on the track by the leader in GT2 , the Risi Competizione Ferrari . This caused numerous competitors to spin , and required the Ferrari to undergo major front @-@ end repairs , resulting in the car falling several laps behind . 
 The biggest problem of the morning though occurred shortly before the completion of the 17th hour , when the race @-@ leading No. 2 Audi of Rinaldo Capello lost a left rear wheel at high speed at the Indianapolis corner . Unable to control the car he went straight on into a tire barrier . Although Capello attempted to get the car back to the pits , it was too badly damaged to be drivable . Television footage had recorded the No. 2 Audi being dropped off its <unk> before the left rear wheel was attached on the prior pit stop , but Audi claimed that this was likely not the cause of the wheel coming off at speed . 
 With two Audis out , this left the lone No. 1 Audi to take over the race lead , with the two Peugeots four and six laps behind respectively . Just before to the No. 2 Audi 's accident , the GT1 @-@ leading Aston Martin had also come off the track , damaging its front splitter . The necessary repairs led to the car spending eight minutes in the garage , dropping it to fourth in class . The lone factory Corvette gained a place to take over second in class . Scuderia Ecosse 's Ferrari briefly took over the GT2 lead after Risi 's problems , but it too broke down on the track , handing the lead to the IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche . Binnie Motorsport 's entry had a sizable lead in its class , having not suffered the many problems its LMP2 competitors had . 
 = = = Finish = = = 
 After having held off for most of the race , the rain began to fall once more during the final three hours . This caused numerous incidents , including the No. 93 Autorlando Porsche missing a Mulsanne chicane and plowing through a temporary tire barrier . The No. 7 Peugeot made an unscheduled garage stop and retired one lap after re @-@ entering the race , claiming oil pressure problems . 
 The rain eventually became heavier , making the conditions treacherous and bringing the safety car back out . This put a temporary stop to the battle between Aston Martin and Corvette for first and second place in the GT1 class . The second place Corvette had been quicker in the wet conditions , but it was not allowed to further close on the Aston Martin during the safety period . After problems for both of the Barazi @-@ Epsilon <unk> , Binnie Motorsports brought its class leading LMP2 car to the garage to ensure that the car was prepared for the weather and could hold on to the lead until the finish . 
 After over an hour behind the safety car , the field was released to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining . With no close contests between the competitors , the field continued to run at less than racing pace , in preparation for the finish . The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits , before returning to the track . To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race , and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner , Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap . Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag , Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well . The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third , the highest placed petrol car . 
 The No. 009 Aston Martin took the GT1 class win by a single lap over the Corvette , earning Aston Martin its first victory since its overall win in 1959 . The No. 76 IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche was the GT2 winner , with a six lap margin of victory . Only two cars finished in the LMP2 class . The No. 31 Binnie Motorsports Lola took the victory in spite of finishing 18th overall . Of the 54 starters , only 29 cars finished the race . The GT1 class cars proved themselves to be the most reliable , losing only two competitors over the 24 hours .

 = Action of 24 March 1811 = 
 The Action of 24 March 1811 was a minor naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars , fought as part of the Royal Navy blockade of the French English Channel ports . By 1811 , Royal Navy control of the French coast was so entrenched that French ships were unable to travel safely even in French territorial waters . In late 1810 , French frigates Elisa and Amazone sailed from Le Havre to join with a larger squadron at Cherbourg , but were intercepted by a British frigate squadron and forced to shelter at Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue . There they came under sustained attack and Elisa was destroyed , Amazone successfully slipping back to Le Havre under cover of darkness . To prevent Amazone from escaping once more , the British blockade squadron was reinforced . 
 On the evening of 23 March 1811 , Amazone left Le Havre once more , sailing west towards Cherbourg through the night . Escaping the ships watching Le Havre , Amazone was sighted at dawn on 24 March weathering Cape Barfleur by ship of the line HMS Berwick , which pursued the French frigate into a bay 1 nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) west of the Phare de <unk> lighthouse . There Berwick , reinforced by a squadron of smaller ships , attacked Amazone but was unable to approach through the rocks and shoals of the coast . Plans were made overnight to attack the frigate with ship 's boats , but on the following day the French Captain Bernard @-@ Louis Rosseau set his ship on fire to prevent its capture . 
 = = Action = = 
 By the autumn of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy , over the course of the conflict , had been successively driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy close blockade , ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour . In 1809 , the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out into open water , only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads . Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders , including privateers and frigate squadrons , often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel . The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy , each of which maintained squadrons . In 1810 , Cherbourg 's anchorage held two ships of the line and a large , newly built frigate Iphigénie , while the frigates Elisa and Amazone were stationed at Le Havre . 
 Both ports were watched closely by a blockade squadron detached from the Channel Fleet , including ships of the line off Cherbourg and two frigates , HMS Diana and HMS Niobe , off Le Havre . On 12 November 1810 Elisa and Amazone attempted to break out of Le Havre and join with the squadron at Cherbourg , slipping past the blockade in the darkness . Spotted in the early hours of 13 November , the frigates managed to anchor at the well @-@ defended harbour of Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue , where on 15 November they were attacked by the combined blockade forces from Cherbourg and Le Havre . Although the attack was beaten back , Elisa was too badly damaged to continue the mission and on 27 November Amazone successfully returned to Le Havre without encountering the British forces . Elisa was subsequently driven onshore and destroyed by the British squadron . 
 = = = Amazone 's journey = = = 
 Amazone , commanded by Captain Bernard @-@ Louis Rosseau , attempted to sail to Cherbourg again on 23 March 1811 . On this occasion Rosseau successfully evaded the blockade of Le Havre and by dawn on 24 March was weathering the point of Cape Barfleur . As the frigate passed the Phare de <unk> lighthouse , only a few miles from her destination , she was spotted by a British ship of the line recently sailed from the British fleet anchorage at St Helens , the 74 @-@ gun HMS Berwick under Captain James Macnamara , then sailing approximately 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ) offshore . Macnamara took Berwick in pursuit , seeking to cut off Rosseau 's advance , and the French captain managed to evade Berwick by taking shelter in a small bay 1 nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) west of the lighthouse . 
 Navigation through the rocks of the bay had been difficult , and as she entered the bay Amazone 's rudder had been torn away , rendering the ship <unk> . With Amazone trapped , Macnamara called up the rest of the Cherbourg squadron , the frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and the brig @-@ sloops HMS Goshawk under Commander James Lilburn and HMS Hawk under Commander Henry Bourchier . This force was required to remain a substantial distance offshore as the rocky coastline posed a considerable danger to the British ships . Macnamara 's plan was to wait for high tide and then bring the squadron closer inshore to bombard the French frigate into surrender . As they waited , the squadron was joined by Niobe from the Le Havre under Captain John Wentworth Loring . At 16 : 00 the tides were optimal for the attack and Niobe , Amelia and Berwick sailed into the bay . However , Rosseau had situated Amazone in a strong position , protected from close attack by rocks and shoals and in consequence the British ships could only fire as they wore around , resulting in scattered and inaccurate fire . As they advanced , the British ships came under fire from Amazone , which killed one sailor on Berwick and killed one and wounded another on Amelia , while the British fire had no effect on the French ship . At 18 : 00 , Macnamara withdrew his ships from the bay , all three vessels having suffered considerable damage to their rigging and sails from Amazone 's shot . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Macnamara considered plans to use ship 's boats to attack Amazone directly , but resolved to attempt to enter the bay again on the morning of 25 March . As dawn broke however it became apparent that Rosseau had abandoned his damaged ship with his crew , setting the frigate on fire as he departed . By the end of the day Amazone had been burnt to the waterline and destroyed . Macnamara 's squadron returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg . The remaining frigate in the region , Iphigénie , did eventually succeed in breaking out of Cherbourg , but was intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814 . 
 = B movie = 
 A B movie is a low @-@ budget commercial motion picture that is not an arthouse film . In its original usage , during the Golden Age of Hollywood , the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less @-@ publicized , bottom half of a double feature . Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s , the term B movie continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today . In its post – Golden Age usage , there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition : on the one hand , the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient ; on the other , many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity . 
 In either usage , most B movies represent a particular genre — the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple , while low @-@ budget science @-@ fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s . Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character . Almost always shorter than the top @-@ billed films they were paired with , many had running times of 70 minutes or less . The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners ; individual B films were often ignored by critics . 
 Latter @-@ day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels , but series are less common . As the average running time of top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line films increased , so did that of B pictures . In its current usage , the term has somewhat contradictory connotations : it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is ( a ) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or ( b ) a lively , energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively " serious " independent film . The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher @-@ budgeted , mainstream films with exploitation @-@ style content , usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie . 
 From their beginnings to the present day , B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning . Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies . They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established , and they have provided work for former A movie actors , such as Vincent Price and Karen Black . Some actors , such as Béla Lugosi , Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier , worked in B movies for most of their careers . The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1927 – 28 , at the end of the silent era , the production cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $ 190 @,@ 000 at Fox to $ 275 @,@ 000 at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer . That average reflected both " specials " that might cost as much as $ 1 million and films made quickly for around $ 50 @,@ 000 . These cheaper films ( not yet called B movies ) allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio 's more important productions , while also breaking in new personnel . Studios in the minor leagues of the industry , such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America ( FBO ) , focused on exactly those sort of cheap productions . Their movies , with relatively short running times , targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs , particularly small @-@ town and urban neighborhood venues , or " <unk> " . Even smaller production houses , known as Poverty Row studios , made films whose costs might run as low as $ 3 @,@ 000 , seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns . 
 With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929 , many independent exhibitors began dropping the then @-@ dominant presentation model , which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film . A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice : a newsreel , a short and / or serial , and a cartoon , followed by a double feature . The second feature , which actually screened before the main event , cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts . The majors ' " clearance " rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents ' timely access to top @-@ quality films ; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead . The additional movie also gave the program " balance " — the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill . The low @-@ budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature , the B movie , of Hollywood 's Golden Age . 
 = = = Golden Age of Hollywood = = = 
 = = = = 1930s = = = = 
 The major studios , at first resistant to the double feature , soon adapted . All established B units to provide films for the expanding second @-@ feature market . Block booking became standard practice : to get access to a studio 's attractive A pictures , many theaters were obliged to rent the company 's entire output for a season . With the B films rented at a flat fee ( rather than the box office percentage basis of A films ) , rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie . The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs ' quality — even when booking in less than seasonal blocks , exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen . The five largest studios — Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , Paramount Pictures , Fox Film Corporation ( 20th Century Fox as of 1935 ) , Warner Bros. , and RKO Radio Pictures ( descendant of FBO ) — also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains , further securing the bottom line . 
 Poverty Row studios , from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures , Tiffany Pictures , and Sono Art @-@ World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations , made exclusively B movies , serials , and other shorts , and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films . In no position to directly block book , they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to " states rights " firms , which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors , typically six or more pictures featuring the same star ( a relative status on Poverty Row ) . Two " major @-@ minors " — Universal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures — had production lines roughly similar to , though somewhat better endowed than , the top Poverty Row studios . In contrast to the Big Five majors , Universal and Columbia had few or no theaters , though they did have top @-@ rank film distribution exchanges . 
 In the standard Golden Age model , the industry 's top product , the A films , premiered at a small number of select first @-@ run houses in major cities . Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues . As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein , " During these first runs , films got their reviews , garnered publicity , and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising . " Then it was off to the subsequent @-@ run market where the double feature prevailed . At the larger local venues controlled by the majors , movies might turn over on a weekly basis . At the thousands of smaller , independent theaters , programs often changed two or three times a week . To meet the constant demand for new B product , the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro @-@ budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long ; these were known as " quickies " for their tight production schedules — as short as four days . As Brian Taves describes , " Many of the poorest theaters , such as the ' grind houses ' in the larger cities , screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule , sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all @-@ night show that changed daily . " Many small theaters never saw a big @-@ studio A film , getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product . Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course : for an A picture , along with the trailers , or screen previews , that presaged its arrival , " [ t ] he new film 's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got " , writes Epstein . Aside from at the theater itself , B films might not be advertised at all . 
 The introduction of sound had driven costs higher : by 1930 , the average U.S. feature film cost $ 375 @,@ 000 to produce . A broad range of motion pictures occupied the B category . The leading studios made not only clear @-@ cut A and B films , but also movies classifiable as " programmers " ( also known as " in @-@ <unk> " or " intermediates " ) . As Taves describes , " Depending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill , a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee . " On Poverty Row , many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major 's A film , with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $ 5 @,@ 000 . By the mid @-@ 1930s , the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model , and the majors responded . In 1935 , B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of studio output . The unit was headed by Bryan Foy , known as the " Keeper of the Bs . " At Fox , which also shifted half of its production line into B territory , Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s . 
 A number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated : Sono Art joined another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade . In 1935 , Monogram , Mascot , and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures . The former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new Monogram production house . Into the 1950s , most Republic and Monogram product was roughly on par with the low end of the majors ' output . Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns — with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest , Empire , Imperial , and Peerless — continued to churn out dirt @-@ cheap quickies . Joel <unk> has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938 , indicating the studios ' relative emphasis on B production ( United Artists produced little , focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits ; Grand National , active 1936 – 40 , occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row , releasing mostly independent productions ) : 
 Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies . Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms , approximately 75 percent of Hollywood movies from the decade , more than four thousand pictures , are classifiable as Bs . 
 The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and , to a lesser degree , the 1940s . Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that " the ' B ' product of the Thirties — the Universal films with [ Tom ] Mix , [ Ken ] Maynard , and [ Buck ] Jones , the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy , the RKO George O 'Brien series , the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three <unk> ... achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well @-@ made story . " At the far end of the industry , Poverty Row 's Ajax put out <unk> starring Harry Carey , then in his fifties . The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series , the American Rough Rider series , and the Morton of the Mounted " northwest action thrillers . " One low @-@ budget <unk> of the era , made totally outside the studio system , profited from an outrageous concept : a Western with an all @-@ midget cast , The Terror of Tiny Town ( 1938 ) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution . 
 Series of various genres , featuring recurrent , title @-@ worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles , were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film . Fox 's many B series , for instance , included Charlie Chan mysteries , Ritz Brothers comedies , and musicals with child star Jane Withers . These series films are not to be confused with the short , cliffhanger @-@ structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program . As with serials , however , many series were intended to attract young people — a theater that twin @-@ billed part @-@ time might run a " balanced " or entirely youth @-@ oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night . In the words of one industry report , afternoon moviegoers , " composed largely of housewives and children , want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want ' something good and not too much of it . ' " Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category , but even here there is ambiguity : at MGM , for example , popular series like the Andy Hardy chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A @-@ level at some of the lesser majors . For many series , even a lesser major 's standard B budget was far out of reach : Poverty Row 's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan , the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of <unk> Dog Features .

 By 1940 , the average production cost of an American feature was $ 400 @,@ 000 , a negligible increase over ten years . A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade , including the ambitious Grand National , but a new firm , Producers Releasing Corporation ( PRC ) , emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram . The double feature , never universal , was still the prevailing exhibition model : in 1941 , 50 percent of theaters were double @-@ billing exclusively , and others employed the policy part @-@ time . In the early 1940s , legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures . Restrictions were also placed on the majors ' ability to enforce blind bidding . These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A @-@ film production , making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers . Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row , with even Republic 's and Monogram 's budgets rarely climbing over $ 200 @,@ 000 . Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors , with their proprietary distribution exchanges , now commanded about 95 percent of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts . In 1946 , independent producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated @-@ budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release . The distribution strategy was a major success , despite what was widely perceived as the movie 's poor quality . The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B movie industry in the late 1950s ; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that , the B movie would be hard hit . 
 Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous . Films shot on B @-@ level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits : One of 1943 's biggest films was Hitler 's Children , an RKO thriller made for a fraction over $ 200 @,@ 000 . It earned more than $ 3 million in rentals , industry language for a distributor 's share of gross box office receipts . Particularly in the realm of film noir , A pictures sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films . Programmers , with their flexible exhibition role , were ambiguous by definition . As late as 1948 , the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode — it was standard policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part @-@ time at an additional 36 percent . The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope : In 1947 , Monogram established a subsidiary , Allied Artists , to develop and distribute relatively expensive films , mostly from independent producers . Around the same time , Republic launched a similar effort under the " Premiere " rubric . In 1947 as well , PRC was subsumed by Eagle @-@ Lion , a British company seeking entry to the American market . Warners ' former Keeper of the Bs , Brian Foy , was installed as production chief . 
 In the 1940s , RKO stood out among the industry 's Big Five for its focus on B pictures . From a latter @-@ day perspective , the most famous of the major studios ' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton 's horror unit at RKO . Lewton produced such moody , mysterious films as Cat People ( 1942 ) , I Walked with a Zombie ( 1943 ) , and The Body Snatcher ( 1945 ) , directed by Jacques Tourneur , Robert Wise , and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect . The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir — Stranger on the Third Floor ( 1940 ) , a 64 @-@ minute B — was produced at RKO , which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein . The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s . Though many of the best @-@ known film noirs were A @-@ level productions , most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill . In the decades since , these cheap entertainments , generally dismissed at the time , have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood 's Golden Age . 
 In one sample year , 1947 , RKO produced along with several noir programmers and A pictures , two straight B noirs : Desperate and The Devil Thumbs a Ride . Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row 's big three — Republic , Monogram , and PRC / Eagle @-@ Lion — and one came from tiny Screen Guild . Three majors beside RKO contributed a total of five more . Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs , an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood . Still , most of the majors ' low @-@ budget production remained the sort now largely ignored . RKO 's representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series , thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon , Westerns starring Tim Holt , and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller . Jean Hersholt played Dr. Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941 . The Courageous Dr. Christian ( 1940 ) was a standard entry : " In the course of an hour or so of screen time , the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis , demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised , set an example for wayward youth , and calm the passions of an amorous old maid . " 
 Down in Poverty Row , low budgets led to less palliative fare . Republic aspired to major @-@ league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns , but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram " exploitation pictures " like juvenile delinquency exposé Where Are Your Children ? ( 1943 ) and the prison film Women in Bondage ( 1943 ) . In 1947 , PRC 's The Devil on Wheels brought together teenagers , hot rods , and death . The little studio had its own house auteur : with his own crew and relatively free rein , director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as " the Capra of PRC " . Ulmer made films of every generic stripe : His Girls in Chains was released in May 1943 , six months before Women in Bondage ; by the end of the year , Ulmer had also made the teen @-@ themed musical Jive Junction as well as Isle of Forgotten Sins , a South Seas adventure set around a brothel . 
 = = = Transition in the 1950s = = = 
 In 1948 , a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains . With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production schedules , the classic double feature vanished from many American theaters during the 1950s . The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling , offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films . With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series , the cinematic market for B <unk> in particular was drying up . After barely inching forward in the 1930s , the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s , reaching $ 1 million by the turn of the decade — a 93 percent rise after adjusting for inflation . 
 The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle @-@ Lion , which released its last films in 1951 . By 1953 , the old Monogram brand had disappeared , the company having adopted the identity of its higher @-@ end subsidiary , Allied Artists . The following year , Allied released Hollywood 's last B series Westerns . Non @-@ series B Westerns continued to appear for a few more years , but Republic Pictures , long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas , was out of the filmmaking business by decade 's end . In other genres , Universal kept its Ma and Pa Kettle series going through 1957 , while Allied Artists stuck with the Bowery Boys until 1958 . RKO , weakened by years of mismanagement , exited the movie industry in 1957 . Hollywood 's A product was getting longer — the top ten box @-@ office releases of 1940 had averaged 112 @.@ 5 minutes ; the average length of 1955 's top ten was 123 @.@ 4 . In their modest way , the Bs were following suit . The age of the hour @-@ long feature film was past ; 70 minutes was now roughly the minimum . While the Golden Age – style second feature was dying , B movie was still used to refer to any low @-@ budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers ( sometimes referred to as B actors ) . The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots , " stock " character types , and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy . At the same time , the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation , both serious and outlandish . 
 Ida Lupino , well known as an actress , established herself as Hollywood 's sole female director of the era . In short , low @-@ budget pictures made for her production company , The Filmakers , Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950 's Outrage and 1953 's self @-@ explanatory The <unk> . Her most famous directorial effort , The Hitch @-@ Hiker , a 1953 RKO release , is the only example of film noir 's classic period directed by a woman . That year , RKO put out another historically notable film made at low cost : Split Second , which concludes in a nuclear test range , is perhaps the first " atomic noir " . The most famous such movie , the independently produced Kiss Me Deadly ( 1955 ) , typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture , as Richard Maltby describes : a " programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre 's double @-@ bill , [ it was ] budgeted at approximately $ 400 @,@ 000 . [ Its ] distributor , United Artists , released around twenty @-@ five programmers with production budgets between $ 100 @,@ 000 and $ 400 @,@ 000 in 1955 . " The film 's length , 106 minutes , is A level , but its star , Ralph Meeker , had previously appeared in only one major film . Its source is pure pulp , one of Mickey Spillane 's Mike Hammer novels , but Robert Aldrich 's direction is self @-@ consciously <unk> . The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb . 
 The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union , along with less expressible qualms about radioactive fallout from America 's own atomic tests , energized many of the era 's genre films . Science fiction , horror , and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low @-@ budget end of the business . Most down @-@ market films of the type — like many of those produced by William Alland at Universal ( e.g. , Creature from the Black Lagoon [ 1954 ] ) and Sam Katzman at Columbia ( e.g. , It Came from Beneath the Sea [ 1955 ] ) — provided little more than thrills , though their special effects could be impressive . But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies . Director Don Siegel 's Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) , released by Allied Artists , treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting , allegorical fashion . The Amazing Colossal Man ( 1957 ) , directed by Bert I. Gordon , is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and " a ferocious cold @-@ war fable [ that ] spins Korea , the army 's obsessive secrecy , and America 's post @-@ war growth into one fantastic whole . " 
 The Amazing Colossal Man was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets . American International Pictures ( AIP ) , founded in 1956 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation ( ARC ) , soon became the leading U.S. studio devoted entirely to B @-@ cost productions . American International helped keep the original @-@ release double bill alive through paired packages of its films : these movies were low @-@ budget , but instead of a flat rate , they were rented out on a percentage basis , like A films . The success of I Was a Teenage Werewolf ( 1957 ) thus brought AIP a large return — made for about $ 100 @,@ 000 , it grossed more than $ 2 million . As the film 's title suggests , the studio relied on both fantastic genre subjects and new , teen @-@ oriented angles . When Hot Rod Gang ( 1958 ) turned a profit , hot rod horror was given a try : Ghost of <unk> Hollow ( 1959 ) . David Cook credits AIP with leading the way " in demographic exploitation , target marketing , and saturation booking , all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass @-@ market ' event ' films " by the late 1970s . In terms of content , the majors were already there , with " J.D. " movies such as Warner Bros. ' Untamed Youth ( 1957 ) and MGM 's High School Confidential ( 1958 ) , both starring Mamie Van Doren . 
 In 1954 , a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists ' Highway Dragnet . Corman soon independently produced his first movie , Monster from the Ocean Floor , on a $ 12 @,@ 000 budget and a six @-@ day shooting schedule . Among the six films he worked on in 1955 , Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release , Apache Woman , and Day the World Ended , half of Arkoff and Nicholson 's first twin @-@ bill package . Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films through 1990 . As of 2007 , he remained active as a producer , with more than 350 movies to his credit . Often referred to as the " King of the Bs " , Corman has said that " to my way of thinking , I never made a ' B ' movie in my life " , as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures . He prefers to describe his metier as " low @-@ budget exploitation films " . In later years Corman , both with AIP and as head of his own companies , would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola , Jonathan Demme , Robert Towne , and Robert De Niro , among many others . 
 In the late 1950s , William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B movie publicity gimmick . Audiences of Macabre ( 1958 ) , an $ 86 @,@ 000 production distributed by Allied Artists , were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright . The 1959 creature feature The <unk> featured Castle 's most famous gimmick , <unk> : at the film 's climax , buzzers attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members , prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter . With such films , Castle " combine [ d ] the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor . " 
 The postwar drive @-@ in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B movie industry . In January 1945 , there were 96 drive @-@ ins in the United States ; a decade later , there were more than 3 @,@ 700 . <unk> pictures with simple , familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto @-@ based film viewing , with all its attendant distractions . The phenomenon of the drive @-@ in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s . At the same time , many local television stations began showing B genre films in late @-@ night slots , popularizing the notion of the midnight movie . 
 Increasingly , American @-@ made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and , where necessary , dubbed for the U.S. market . In 1956 , distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci @-@ fi horror film Godzilla . The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) and Dracula ( 1958 ) , major influences on future horror film style . In 1959 , Levine 's Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to Hercules , a cheaply made Italian movie starring American @-@ born bodybuilder Steve Reeves . On top of a $ 125 @,@ 000 purchase price , Levine then spent $ 1 @.@ 5 million on advertising and publicity , a virtually unprecedented amount . The New York Times was nonplussed , claiming that the movie would have drawn " little more than yawns in the film market ... had it not been [ launched ] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity . " Levine counted on first @-@ weekend box office for his profits , booking the film " into as many cinemas as he could for a week 's run , then withdrawing it before poor word @-@ of @-@ mouth withdrew it for him . " Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 theaters , and the strategy was a smashing success : the film earned $ 4 @.@ 7 million in domestic rentals . Just as valuable to the bottom line , it was even more successful overseas . Within a few decades , Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very like Levine 's .

 Despite all the transformations in the industry , by 1961 the average production cost of an American feature film was still only $ 2 million — after adjusting for inflation , less than 10 percent more than it had been in 1950 . The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent @-@ run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters . The AIP @-@ style dual genre package was the new model . In July 1960 , the latest Joseph E. Levine sword @-@ and @-@ sandals import , Hercules Unchained , opened at neighborhood theaters in New York . A suspense film , Terror Is a Man , ran as a " co @-@ feature " with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick : " The dénouement helpfully includes a ' warning bell ' so the sensitive can ' close their eyes . ' " That year , Roger Corman took AIP down a new road : " When they asked me to make two ten @-@ day black @-@ and @-@ white horror films to play as a double feature , I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color . " The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification . It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio , with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed . But it is generally seen as a B movie : the schedule was still a mere fifteen days , the budget just $ 200 @,@ 000 ( one @-@ tenth the industry average ) , and its 85 @-@ minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B : " Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes . " 
 With the loosening of industry censorship constraints , the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as exploitation films . The combination of intensive and gimmick @-@ laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and often outrageous imagery dated back decades — the term had originally defined truly fringe productions , made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system . Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices , particularly " sexual hygiene " . Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision . Such films were not generally booked as part of movie theaters ' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters ( they might also appear as fodder for " grindhouses " , which typically had no regular schedule at all ) . The most famous of those promoters , Kroger Babb , was in the vanguard of marketing low @-@ budget , sensationalistic films with a " 100 % saturation campaign " , inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium . In the era of the traditional double feature , no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as " B movies " . With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation @-@ style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry , " exploitation " became a way to refer to the entire field of low @-@ budget genre films . The 1960s would see exploitation @-@ style themes and imagery become increasingly central to the realm of the B. 
 Exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear : 1961 's Damaged Goods , a cautionary tale about a young lady whose boyfriend 's promiscuity leads to venereal disease , comes complete with enormous , grotesque closeups of VD 's physical effects . At the same time , the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a related , similarly venerable tradition : " nudie " films featuring nudist @-@ camp footage or striptease artists like Bettie Page had simply been the softcore pornography of previous decades . As far back as 1933 , This Nude World was " Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced ! " In the late 1950s , as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically to " adult " product , a few filmmakers began making <unk> with greater attention to plot . Best known was Russ Meyer , who released his first successful narrative nudie , the comic Immoral Mr. Teas , in 1959 . Five years later , Meyer came out with his breakthrough film , Lorna , which combined sex , violence , and a dramatic storyline . Faster , Pussycat ! Kill ! Kill ! ( 1965 ) , made for about $ 45 @,@ 000 , would ultimately become the most famous of Meyer 's so @-@ called sexploitation pictures . Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity , it was aimed at the same " passion pit " drive @-@ in circuit that screened AIP teen movies with wink @-@ wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo ( 1965 ) and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini ( 1966 ) , starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon . Roger Corman 's The Trip ( 1967 ) for American International , written by veteran AIP / Corman actor Jack Nicholson , never shows a fully bared , unpainted breast , but flirts with nudity throughout . The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer . 
 One of the most influential films of the era , on Bs and beyond , was Paramount 's Psycho . Its $ 8 @.@ 5 million in earnings against a production cost of $ 800 @,@ 000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960 . Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship . And , as William Paul notes , this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made , " significantly , with the lowest @-@ budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars . [ Its ] greatest initial impact ... was on schlock horror movies ( notably those from second @-@ tier director William Castle ) , each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than Psycho . " Castle 's first film in the Psycho vein was Homicidal ( 1961 ) , an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that would take off in the late 1970s . Blood Feast ( 1963 ) , a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $ 24 @,@ 000 by experienced nudie @-@ maker <unk> Gordon Lewis , established a new , more immediately successful subgenre , the gore or splatter film . Lewis 's business partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers — the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered — and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota , Florida — the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against , except Friedman had planned it . This new breed of gross @-@ out movie typified the emerging sense of " exploitation " — the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror , into other classic B genres , and into the low @-@ budget film industry as a whole . Imports of Hammer Film 's increasingly explicit horror movies and Italian gialli , highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence , would fuel this trend . 
 The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968 , to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system . That year , two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade , with major consequences for the B movie . One was a high @-@ budget Paramount production , directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski . Produced by B horror veteran William Castle , Rosemary 's Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades . It was a critical success and the year 's seventh @-@ biggest hit . The other was George A. Romero 's Night of the Living Dead , produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $ 114 @,@ 000 . Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues , it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts . Its greatest influence , though , derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation @-@ style imagery , low @-@ cost , truly independent means of production , and high profitability . With the Code gone and the X rating established , major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show " adult " imagery , while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded . In this transformed commercial context , work like Russ Meyer 's gained a new legitimacy . In 1969 , for the first time a Meyer film , Finders Keepers , Lovers Weepers ! , was reviewed in The New York Times . Soon , Corman would be putting out nudity @-@ filled sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses ( 1971 ) and Women in Cages ( 1971 ) . 
 In May 1969 , the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the Cannes Film Festival . Much of Easy Rider 's significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable , if still modest , budget and released by a major studio . The project was first taken by one of its <unk> , Peter Fonda , to American International . Fonda had become AIP 's top star in the Corman @-@ directed The Wild Angels ( 1966 ) , a biker movie , and The Trip , as in LSD . The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes . AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator , Dennis Hopper , also a studio alumnus , free directorial rein . Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution deal with Columbia , as two more graduates of the Corman / AIP exploitation mill joined the project : Jack Nicholson and cinematographer László Kovács . The film ( which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme , the redneck menace , as well as a fair amount of nudity ) was brought in at a cost of $ 501 @,@ 000 . It earned $ 19 @.@ 1 million in rentals . In the words of historians Seth <unk> and Philip <unk> , Easy Rider became " the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock / kitsch / hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies . "

 In the late 1960s and early 1970s , a new generation of low @-@ budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci @-@ fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s . Operations such as Roger Corman 's New World Pictures , Cannon Films , and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country . The major studios ' top product was continuing to inflate in running time — in 1970 , the ten biggest earners averaged 140 @.@ 1 minutes . The Bs were keeping pace . In 1955 , Corman had a <unk> hand in five movies averaging 74 @.@ 8 minutes . He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970 , two for AIP and three for his own New World : the average length was 89 @.@ 8 minutes . These films could turn a tidy profit . The first New World release , the biker movie Angels Die Hard , cost $ 117 @,@ 000 to produce and took in more than $ 2 million at the box office . 
 The biggest studio in the low @-@ budget field remained a leader in exploitation 's growth . In 1973 , American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma . Reviewing Sisters , Pauline Kael observed that its " limp technique doesn 't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore . ... [ H ] e can 't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the <unk> Republic picture of 1938 . " Many examples of the so @-@ called blaxploitation genre , featuring stereotype @-@ filled stories revolving around drugs , violent crime , and prostitution , were the product of AIP . One of blaxploitation 's biggest stars was Pam Grier , who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer 's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls ( 1970 ) . Several New World pictures followed , including The Big Doll House ( 1971 ) and The Big Bird Cage ( 1972 ) , both directed by Jack Hill . Hill also directed her best @-@ known performances , in two AIP blaxploitation films : <unk> ( 1973 ) and Foxy Brown ( 1974 ) . 
 Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central . Indeed , the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem ( 1970 ) , directed by Ossie Davis , is seen as the first significant film of the type . But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent : Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song ( 1971 ) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form : wildly experimental , borderline pornographic , and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution . Melvin Van Peebles wrote , co @-@ produced , directed , starred in , edited , and composed the music for the film , which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby . Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries , then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane " <unk> " and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill , as well as for its one in @-@ house production , The Man from <unk> ( 1970 ) . These sorts of films played in the " grindhouses " of the day — many of them not outright porno theaters , but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema . The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone , but a continuity of spirit was evident . 
 In 1970 , a low @-@ budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first @-@ time American director Barbara <unk> won the international critics ' prize at the Venice Film Festival . Wanda is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture . The crime @-@ based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old @-@ school B noir . The $ 115 @,@ 000 production , for which <unk> spent six years raising money , was praised by Vincent Canby for " the absolute accuracy of its effects , the decency of its point of view and ... purity of technique . " Like Romero and Van Peebles , other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut @-@ level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary . The first three features directed by Larry Cohen , Bone ( 1972 ) , Black Caesar ( 1973 ) , and Hell Up in Harlem ( 1973 ) , were all nominally blaxploitation movies , but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog @-@ eat @-@ dog capitalism . The gory horror film <unk> ( 1974 ) , directed by Bob Clark , is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam . Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious @-@ minded low @-@ budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential : Shivers ( 1975 ) , Rabid ( 1977 ) , The Brood ( 1979 ) . An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor , the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists ' biker @-@ themed Electra Glide in Blue ( 1973 ) , directed by James William <unk> . The New York Times reviewer thought little of it : " Under different intentions , it might have made a decent grade @-@ C Roger Corman bike movie — though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than <unk> . " 
 In the early 1970s , the growing practice of screening <unk> motion pictures as late shows , with the goal of building a cult film audience , brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema , now in a countercultural setting — something like a drive @-@ in movie for the hip . One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three @-@ year @-@ old Night of the Living Dead . The midnight movie success of low @-@ budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system , like John Waters 's Pink Flamingos ( 1972 ) , with its campy spin on exploitation , spurred the development of the independent film movement . The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) , an inexpensive film from 20th Century @-@ Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés , became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial , unprofitable release . Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon , it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie . 
 Asian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s . These " kung fu " films as they were often called , whatever martial art they featured , were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong – produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World . Horror continued to attract young , independent American directors . As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review , " Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they 're brought in at the right price . So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would @-@ be filmmakers who can 't get more conventional projects off the ground . " The movie under consideration was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . Made by Tobe Hooper for less than $ 300 @,@ 000 , it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s . John Carpenter 's Halloween ( 1978 ) , produced on a $ 320 @,@ 000 budget , grossed over $ 80 million worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror 's primary mode for the next decade . Just as Hooper had learned from Romero 's work , Halloween , in turn , largely followed the model of Black Christmas ( 1974 ) , directed by <unk> 's Bob Clark . 
 On television , the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime @-@ time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear . In the 1970s , original feature @-@ length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well . As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969 , soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features , time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory . Television films inspired by recent scandals — such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst , which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979 — harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold , FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes . Many 1970s TV films — such as The California Kid ( 1974 ) , starring Martin Sheen — were action @-@ oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production . Nightmare in Badham County ( 1976 ) headed straight into the realm of road @-@ tripping @-@ girls @-@ in @-@ redneck @-@ bondage exploitation . 
 The reverberations of Easy Rider could be felt in such pictures , as well as in a host of theatrical exploitation films . But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct — by 1973 , the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement . Rosemary 's Baby had been a big hit , but it had little in common with the exploitation style . Warner Bros. ' The Exorcist demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster : it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest @-@ earning horror movie yet made . In William Paul 's description , it is also " the film that really established gross @-@ out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema . ... [ P ] ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their <unk> . The Exorcist made cruelty respectable . By the end of the decade , the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice . " Writer @-@ director George Lucas 's American Graffiti , a Universal production , did something similar . Described by Paul as " essentially an American @-@ International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish " , it was 1973 's third biggest film and , likewise , by far the highest @-@ earning teen @-@ themed movie yet made . Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A @-@ level financial backing would follow in their wake .

 Most of the B movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field 's financial situation changed in the early 1980s . Even a comparatively cheap , efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars , as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies , raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects . <unk> of the trend were evident as early as Airport ( 1970 ) and especially in the mega @-@ schlock of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1973 ) , and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) . Their disaster plots and dialogue were B @-@ grade at best ; from an industry perspective , however , these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of star @-@ stuffed extravaganzas . The Exorcist had demonstrated the drawing power of big @-@ budget , effects @-@ laden horror . But the tidal shift in the majors ' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films : Steven Spielberg 's creature feature Jaws ( 1975 ) and George Lucas 's space opera Star Wars ( 1977 ) had each , in turn , become the highest @-@ grossing film in motion picture history . Superman , released in December 1978 , had proved that a studio could spend $ 55 million on a movie about a children 's comic book character and turn a big profit — it was the top box @-@ office hit of 1979 . Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original 1933 King Kong had once been exceptional ; in the new Hollywood , increasingly under the sway of multi @-@ industrial conglomerates , they would rule . 
 It had taken a decade and half , from 1961 to 1976 , for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $ 2 million to $ 4 million — a decline if adjusted for inflation . In just four years it more than doubled again , hitting $ 8 @.@ 5 million in 1980 ( a constant @-@ dollar increase of about 25 percent ) . Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased , the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar . With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters , it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit . Double features were now literally history — almost impossible to find except at revival houses . One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists , which declared bankruptcy in April 1979 . In the late 1970s , AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979 . The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980 . 
 Despite the mounting financial pressures , distribution obstacles , and overall risk , many genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters . Horror was the strongest low @-@ budget genre of the time , particularly in the slasher mode as with The Slumber Party Massacre ( 1982 ) , written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown . The film was produced for New World on a budget of $ 250 @,@ 000 . At the beginning of 1983 , Corman sold New World ; New Horizons , later Concorde – New Horizons , became his primary company . In 1984 , New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the punk scene written and directed by Penelope Spheeris . The New York Times review concluded : " Suburbia is a good genre film . " 
 Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as Q ( aka Q : The Winged Serpent ; 1982 ) , described by critic Chris Petit as " the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market : an imaginative , popular , low @-@ budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources , and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it . " In 1981 , New Line put out Polyester , a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old @-@ school exploitation gimmick : <unk> . That October The Book of the Dead , a gore @-@ filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $ 400 @,@ 000 , debuted in Detroit . Its writer , director , and co @-@ executive producer , Sam Raimi , was a week shy of his twenty @-@ second birthday ; star and co @-@ executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty @-@ three . It was picked up for distribution by New Line , retitled The Evil Dead , and became a hit . In the words of one newspaper critic , it was a " shoestring tour de force . " 
 One of the most successful 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era , Troma Pictures , founded in 1974 . Troma 's most characteristic productions , including Class of Nuke ' Em High ( 1986 ) , Redneck Zombies ( 1986 ) , and Surf Nazis Must Die ( 1987 ) , take exploitation for an absurdist spin . Troma 's best @-@ known production is The Toxic Avenger ( 1985 ) ; its hideous hero , affectionately known as <unk> , was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series . One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome @-@ based Empire Pictures , whose first production , Ghoulies , reached theaters in 1985 . The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics : Empire 's financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals , but only later , at the video store . A number of Concorde – New Horizon releases went this route as well , appearing only briefly in theaters , if at all . The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low @-@ budget film industry , as many B movies quickly wound up as " filler " material for 24 @-@ hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose . 
 = = = = 1990s = = = = 
 By 1990 , the cost of the average U.S. film had passed $ 25 million . Of the nine films released that year to gross more than $ 100 million at the U.S. box office , two would have been strictly B movie material before the late 1970s : Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy . Three more — the science @-@ fiction thriller Total Recall , the action @-@ filled detective thriller Die Hard 2 , and the year 's biggest hit , the slapstick kiddie comedy Home Alone — were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A @-@ list subject matter . The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non @-@ chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films . Drive @-@ in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape . 
 Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways . Releases from Troma now frequently went straight to video . New Line , in its first decade , had been almost exclusively a distributor of low @-@ budget independent and foreign genre pictures . With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Craven 's original Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) , whose nearly $ 2 million cost it had directly backed , the company began moving steadily into higher @-@ budget genre productions . In 1994 , New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System ; it was soon being run as a <unk> studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. within the Time Warner conglomerate . The following year , Showtime launched Roger Corman Presents , a series of thirteen straight @-@ to @-@ cable movies produced by Concorde – New Horizons . A New York Times reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as " vintage Corman ... spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind @-@ blowing quote from Thomas Mann 's Death in Venice . " 
 At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished , the independent film movement was burgeoning ; among the results were various crossovers between the low @-@ budget genre movie and the " sophisticated " arthouse picture . Director Abel Ferrara , who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer ( 1979 ) and Ms. 45 ( 1981 ) , made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation @-@ worthy depictions of sex , drugs , and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption : King of New York ( 1990 ) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant ( 1992 ) , $ 1 @.@ 8 million , was financed totally independently . Larry Fessenden 's micro @-@ budget monster movies , such as No Telling ( 1991 ) and Habit ( 1997 ) , reframe classic genre subjects — Frankenstein and vampirism , respectively — to explore issues of contemporary relevance . The budget of David Cronenberg 's Crash ( 1996 ) , $ 10 million , was not comfortably A @-@ grade , but it was hardly B @-@ level either . The film 's imagery was another matter : " On its scandalizing surface , David Cronenberg 's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick " , wrote critic Janet Maslin . Financed , like King of New York , by a consortium of production companies , it was picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features . This result mirrored the film 's scrambling of definitions : Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line , recently merged into the Time Warner empire — specifically , it was the old exploitation distributor 's arthouse division . Pulp Fiction ( 1994 ) , directed by Quentin Tarantino on a $ 8 @.@ 5 million budget , became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines , as James Mottram describes : " With its art house narrative structure , B @-@ movie subject matter and Hollywood cast , the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect . " 
 = = = Transition in the 2000s = = = 
 By the turn of the millennium , the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the $ 50 million mark . In 2005 , the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children 's fantasy novels , one extending and another initiating a series ( " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire " , " The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe " ) , a child @-@ targeted cartoon ( " Madagascar " ) , a comic book adaptation ( " Batman Begins " ) , a sci @-@ fi series installment ( " Star Wars : Episode III – Revenge of the Sith " ) , a sci @-@ fi remake ( " War of the Worlds ( 2005 film ) " ) , and a King Kong remake . It was a slow year for Corman : he produced just one movie , which had no American theatrical release , true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade . As big @-@ budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low @-@ rent genres , the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt . New York Times critic A. O. Scott warned of the impending " extinction " of " the cheesy , campy , guilty pleasures " of the B picture , as " the schlock of the past has evolved into star @-@ driven , heavily publicized , expensive mediocrities " . 
 On the other hand , recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something like the traditional A @-@ B split in major studio production , though with fewer " programmers " bridging the gap . According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone , " The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $ 60 m , rising to $ 100 m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch ( USA only ) is factored into the equation . However , we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers : large productions ( $ 120 – 150 m ) and niche features ( $ 5 – 20m ) . ... Fewer $ 30 – 70 m releases are expected . " Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006 , Fox Atomic , to concentrate on teen @-@ oriented genre films . The economic model was deliberately low @-@ rent , at least by major studio standards . According to a Variety report , " Fox Atomic is staying at or below the $ 10 million mark for many of its movies . It 's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally — a cheaper process that results in a grittier , teen @-@ friendly look . And forget about stars . Of Atomic 's nine announced films , not one has a big name " . The newfangled B movie division was shut down in 2009 . 
 As the Variety report suggests , recent technological advances greatly facilitate the production of truly low @-@ budget motion pictures . Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies , including Super 8 and 16 mm film , as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape , these mediums could not rival the image quality of 35 mm film . The development of digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low @-@ budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent , and not necessarily " grittier " , image quality and editing effects . As Marone observes , " the equipment budget ( camera , support ) required for shooting digital is approximately 1 / 10 that for film , significantly lowering the production budget for independent features . At the same time , [ since the early 2000s ] , the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically . " Independent filmmakers , whether working in a genre or arthouse mode , continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels , though so @-@ called digital end @-@ to @-@ end methods of distribution offer new opportunities . In a similar way , Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low @-@ budget motion pictures . 
 = = Associated terms = = 
 The terms C movie and the more common Z movie describe progressively lower grades of the B movie category . The terms drive @-@ in movie and midnight movie , which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena , are now often used as synonyms for B movie . 
 = = = C movie = = = 
 The C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie , or — in some taxonomies — simply below it . In the 1980s , with the growth of cable television , the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low @-@ quality genre films used as filler programming for that market . The " C " in the term then does double duty , referring not only to quality that is lower than " B " but also to the initial c of cable . Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 ( 1988 – 99 ) , which ran on national cable channels ( first Comedy Central , then the Sci Fi Channel ) after its first year . Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before , MST3K presented cheap , low @-@ grade movies , primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s , along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films ' shortcomings . Director Ed Wood has been called " the master of the ' C @-@ movie ' " in this sense , although Z movie ( see below ) is perhaps even more applicable to his work . The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi ( with its Sci Fi Pictures ) and HBO 's genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant a market for contemporary C pictures , many of them " direct to cable " movies — small budget genre films never released in theaters . 
 = = = Z movie = = = 
 The term Z movie ( or grade @-@ Z movie ) is used by some to characterize low @-@ budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even so @-@ called C movies . Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry . The micro @-@ budget " quickies " of 1930s fly @-@ by @-@ night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as Z movies avant la lettre . The films of director Ed Wood , such as Glen or Glenda ( 1953 ) and Plan 9 from Outer Space ( 1959 ) — frequently cited as one of the worst pictures ever made — exemplify the classic grade @-@ Z movie . Latter @-@ day <unk> are often characterized by violent , gory or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest ; much of which is destined for the subscription TV equivalent of the grindhouse . 
 = = = Psychotronic movie = = = 
 Psychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon — referred to by a fellow critic as " the historian of marginal movies " — to denote the sort of low @-@ budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment . Weldon 's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man ( 1980 ) , whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy . According to Weldon , " My original idea with that word is that it 's a two @-@ part word . ' Psycho ' stands for the horror movies , and ' <unk> ' stands for the science fiction movies . I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B @-@ movie . " The term , popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon 's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film and Psychotronic Video magazine , has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans . Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp .

 = Fuck the Millennium = 
 " Fuck the Millennium " , sometimes spelled " * * * K the Millennium " , is an electronic protest song that was released as a single in 1997 by 2K ( Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty , better known as The KLF and The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu ) . Based upon The KLF 's acid house track " What Time Is Love ? " , it was promoted as a comeback single and released to mark the tenth anniversary of Drummond and Cauty 's first collaborations ; however , it was also in part intended to mock the notion of the comeback . It remains the only commercial release by the duo since The KLF 's 1992 retirement . The single reached # 28 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1997 . 
 Drummond and Cauty 's campaign to " fuck the millennium " also involved an appearance by 2K at London 's Barbican Arts Centre and a number of outlandish proposals to ' commemorate ' the millennium under the moniker " K2 Plant Hire " . These activities were intended to culminate in the construction of " The People 's Pyramid " , a 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) -high structure built from recycled bricks , but the pyramid was never built . 
 = = Context = = 
 From 1987 to 1992 , Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty released music under names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu ( The JAMs ) and The KLF . Following a run of five consecutive UK top @-@ five singles , The KLF executed a high @-@ profile retirement from the music business and deleted their entire back catalogue , declaring that " For the foreseeable future , there will be no further record releases from any past , present or future name attached to our activities . " Drummond and Cauty 's subsequent art project , the K Foundation , disposed of The KLF 's earnings , including by burning one million pounds of it , money which was originally provisionally earmarked by the duo for millennial celebrations . Bill Drummond : " Originally we were going to invest the whole lot in some capital growth fund and spend it all on one big event , maybe at the millennium " . 
 In the four years following The KLF 's retirement , Drummond and Cauty 's musical output consisted only of a limited edition single released in Israel and Palestine ( " K Cera Cera " ) , and a contribution to The Help Album ( " The Magnificent " ) . 
 In 1997 , British artist Jeremy Deller pioneered the Acid Brass concept , collaborating with the Williams Fairey Brass Band to interpret and perform classic acid house tracks as brass arrangements . Deller was described by one source as a prankster , a notion frequently applied to Drummond and Cauty themselves . In February 1997 , Drummond was contacted by his former Big in Japan bandmate Jayne Casey , who was helping to organise an arts festival in Liverpool and had noticed that Acid Brass ' repertoire included The KLF 's " What Time Is Love ? " . Drummond attended the festival performance and heard " What Time Is Love ? " performed as the encore , during which he telephoned Cauty . Cauty and Drummond together attended a 19 April Acid Brass performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall , London . Collaborative work ensued between Drummond , Cauty , and Deller , in which the Acid Brass rendition of their track was incorporated into a composition designed to mark the tenth anniversary of Drummond and Cauty 's first work . 
 A comeback of The KLF was implied by two black @-@ and @-@ white full @-@ page adverts placed in the 21 August 1997 issue of Time Out . The first proclaimed " They 're Back . The Creators of Trance . The Lords of Ambient . The Kings of Stadium House . The Godfathers of Techno Metal . The Greatest Rave Band In The World . Ever ! 2K . For 23 minutes Only " . The second stated " ' Jeremy Deller presents ' 1997 What The Fuck 's Going On ' " , a reference to The JAMs ' debut album 1987 ( What the Fuck Is Going On ? ) . It continued , " Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed " . The Independent looked forward to the event , saying that " It was just a matter of time before Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond hatched another prank and put a grin back on the face of pop music . " " You just ache for them to be No. 1 again .... " , they said , but " One hopes they are not about to shoot themselves in the foot " because " the idea walks the tightrope between lunacy and brilliance .... the pop world 's countdown to the millennium surely starts here " . 
 = = Performance = = 
 " 1997 ( What The Fuck 's Going On ? ) " was performed by 2K as a one @-@ off event at London 's Barbican Arts Centre on 17 September 1997 with Acid Brass , the Liverpool Dockers , the Viking Society , and Drummond 's creative associates Mark Manning and Gimpo , who appeared , respectively , as " an axe @-@ wielding " <unk> " in a vicar 's collar and gold lame suit , and a shop steward character in a white coat with a megaphone " . The performance began with a screening of This Brick , a short 35mm film of a brick made from the ashes of the K Foundation 's million @-@ pound bonfire . Following an introduction by Factory Records founder Tony Wilson , Drummond and Cauty were then unveiled as pyjama @-@ clad , wheelchair @-@ using pensioners with grey hair and , strapped to their foreheads , prominent horns that had been used regularly in The KLF 's promotional videos . Drummond was also seen plucking feathers from a dead swan . According to a press release issued by Mute / Blast First ( Acid Brass ' and 2K 's record label ) , " Two elderly gentlemen , reeking of Dettol , caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs . These old <unk> , bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to <unk> Cauty and Drummond , claimed to have just been asked along . " The duo wheeled around the stage to the sound of Acid Brass ' " What Time Is Love ? " . They were supported variously by a male choir 's rendition of " K Cera Cera " , joined by opera singer Sally Bradshaw ; the Viking Society in costume as lifeboatmen ; and the politically topical Liverpool Dockers chanting " Fuck the Millennium " . Following the performance , every audience member received a " Fuck the Millennium " T @-@ shirt , poster , and bumper sticker in a carrier bag . 
 In a comprehensive assessment , The Observer rationalised the spectacle : " They did what they always do : too many things at the same time . Their points are lost along with the plot . So , just to explain : ... Bill and Jimmy were dressed as old men as a comment on elderly pop groups making a comeback . The brass band playing house music tunes was organised by Jeremy Deller as a comment on class culture ( working @-@ class band playing working @-@ class music ) . The dockers were asked along because their cause is important . " The Guardian called the performance " a glorious , jaw @-@ dropping mess " , and The Times commented that " the strongest point in its favour was its brevity " . Select said , " There was no press furore the next morning — merely the anticlimactic aftertaste left by 40 @-@ year @-@ old men miming to a seven @-@ year @-@ old song .... 2K was unquestionably a failure . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 A single , " Fuck the Millennium " was subsequently released , a studio @-@ based recording falsely promoted as an edited version of the Barbican performance . Comparing the single with the live performance , The Times said that " On CD , things become more orthodox , though no less entertaining , comprising an acid brass version of their classic , What Time Is Love ? and a young man shouting rude words . " 
 The unedited studio recording of " Fuck the Millennium " is a 14 @-@ minute composition , a protest song based around The KLF 's house music track " What Time Is Love ? " , drawing additionally on musical refrains and concepts from throughout Drummond and Cauty 's canon . The track contains three main segued parts : a house section led by the brass band Acid Brass , a choral rendition of the English hymn " Eternal Father , Strong to Save " , and a rhythmically hardened remix of " What Time Is Love ? ( Pure Trance Original ) " . The lead vocals before and after the hymn consist mainly of angry chants , with hundreds of instances of the word " fuck " . Apart from a small number of chord changes during the segues , " Fuck the Millennium " contains no new music . However , the lyrics and brass arrangement are not found elsewhere in Drummond and Cauty 's output . 
 The track is opened by Gimpo screaming " It 's 1997 : what the fuck is going on ? " . There follows a brass band version of " What Time Is Love ? ( Pure Trance Original ) " , with a house rhythm added , along with samples from The JAMs ' 1987 recordings " All You Need Is Love " , " Don 't Take Five ( Take What You Want ) " , " Whitney Joins The JAMs " and " Burn the Bastards " . Drummond leads a crowd of Liverpool Dockers in angry chants : " Fuck the millennium ! We want it now ! " . 
 Among the voices singing the three verses of the hymn are keyboardist Nick Coler , Drummond and Cauty , multiple recordings of whom are overlain to simulate a congregation . Mark Manning evangelically narrates its lyrics , and between verses , Gimpo screams for " Bill ! " ( Drummond ) and " Jimmy ! " ( Cauty ) — the only instance throughout their music that either of them is referred to without a pseudonym . 
 A Select journalist enthused about the track in the context of the duo 's wider catalogue : " As soon as it starts you immediately remember the excitement that comes from hearing a KLF record for the first time . The original ambient house melody kicks in – and it hasn 't dated a day . The chorus is given an extra kick by Acid Brass ' massed ranks of horns and trumpets .... It is quite brilliant . "

 Around the time of the single 's release , further full @-@ page adverts appeared in the national press , this time asking readers " * * * k The Millennium : Yes / No ? " , with a telephone number — the " Millennium Crisis Line " — provided for voting : " If you want to fuck the millennium , press ' 1' . If not , press ' 2' . " The adverts were placed under the pseudonym K2 Plant Hire Ltd . , who duly claimed that 18 @,@ 436 ( 89 % ) of respondents wished to fuck the millennium . Thus , on 31 October 1997 , K2 Plant Hire announced " The People 's Pyramid " , an estimated 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) -high structure built from as many house bricks as there were British 20th century births ( estimated by the duo as 87 million ) , with no cost to the taxpayer . According to Melody Maker , a statement posted on K2 Plant Hire 's website " pointedly contrast [ ed ] the intended virtues of their People 's Pyramid with the drawbacks of the officially sponsored Millennium Dome " . The Guardian noted drily that the idea " would appear to be far @-@ fetched even by their own standards " and " Planning permission might pose a problem . " The Pyramid was never built . 
 K2 Plant Hire also contributed a short story , written by Drummond , to editor Sarah Champion 's anthology Disco 2000 . Entitled " ' Let 's Grind ' or ' How K2 Plant Hire Went To Work ' " , the 1997 story is a fictional account of K2 Plant Hire 's plan to demolish Stonehenge on the eve of the millennium . Also in 1997 , Drummond and Cauty reportedly used K2 Plant Hire 's remaining funds to bid for purchase of the <unk> Stones ancient monument . <unk> Stewart Home alleged that despite K2 Plant Hire 's bid being the highest , the owners of the monument refused to trade with the duo . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Drummond and Cauty 's works were both highly self @-@ referential and rife with references to The Illuminatus ! Trilogy esoteric novel , from which The JAMs took their name . Their last work , as 2K and K2 Plant Hire , continued many of these themes . Their subversive attitude was exhibited in their attempt to undermine the pop comeback . They defaced a wall of the National Theatre the day after the Barbican performance : the graffiti " 1997 : What the fuck 's going on ? " referenced their similar graffiti of ten years earlier on the same wall of the arts establishment . The unusual show at the Barbican was typical of their previous confusing and humorous costumed appearances ; moreover , the horns strapped to their foreheads were previously used in The KLF 's cowl costumes . The advertising campaigns before and after the single 's release resumed Drummond and Cauty 's characteristic promotional tactic of cryptic , monochrome full @-@ page adverts placed in UK national newspapers and music press . 
 The duo 's tenth anniversary was prominently implied by the adverts and graffiti , and " Fuck the Millennium " contains many samples from their earliest works . The KLF 's " What Time Is Love ? " — a breakthrough track for Drummond and Cauty on two occasions — is also used extensively : " Fuck the Millennium " contains the entirety of " What Time Is Love ? ( Pure Trance Original ) " , as well as samples used in " What Time Is Love ? ( Live at Trancentral ) " . 
 Seafaring was a recurring element of Drummond and Cauty 's output , in lyrics from Who Killed The JAMs ? , The White Room and " America : What Time Is Love ? " , and in imagery used to illustrate The KLF 's retirement press notice . Prior to entering the music business , Drummond had worked as a <unk> . Samples of evangelists also feature in several KLF Communications recordings : the album Chill Out and the B @-@ sides " What Time Is Love ? ( Virtual Reality Mix ) " and " America No More " . " Fuck the Millennium " was a studio track promoted as a live recording and featuring sampled crowd noise , as were The KLF 's self @-@ named " Stadium House Trilogy " of singles . The use of an English hymn is central to The JAMs ' " It 's Grim up North " . All of The KLF 's chart singles either refer or allude to time , a theme continued by " Fuck the Millennium " . 
 2K 's lifespan was billed as the duration of the Barbican performance , 23 minutes . The number is given numerological significance in The Illuminatus ! Trilogy . The " Fuck the Millennium " sleevenotes state that " The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu appear courtesy of The Five " , a reference to the five Illuminati leaders of the novels . Drummond and Cauty took The JAMs ' name from the fictional cult in Illuminatus ! , wherein the fictional JAMs are long @-@ standing enemies of the Illuminati . K2 Plant Hire 's " The People 's Pyramid " recalled Drummond and Cauty 's " Pyramid Blaster " logo ( a ghetto blaster suspended in front of a pyramid ) , itself a reference to the all @-@ seeing eye icon used in Illuminatus ! . 
 Although the references to Illuminatus ! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty 's tradition , this was also in part intended to be a self @-@ parodying dredge of The KLF 's " myth " . Drummond 's opinions of the " rock ' n ' roll comeback " were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000 : " The history of rock ' n ' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks .... No comeback has ever worked . The motivation behind the comeback has never and will never be the same as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub @-@ cult .... If there was fresh original talent , it is now tired and tested , only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch . " Designing 2K 's parody of the comeback , Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were " getting totally into the institution of The Comeback , drawing on the sad , pathetic nature of the whole thing , the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth ... " . 
 = = After the event = = 
 Contemporary press reaction to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative . Since then , however , The Observer have held up the Barbican show as the model of a pop performance . " At one unfortunately memorable Stereophonics gig ... " , the paper said , " the extent of Richard Jones ' showmanship was to play his bass while standing on a rug .... this is hardly the pyjama @-@ clad KLF , horns strapped to their heads , whizzing around the Barbican in wheelchairs with Zodiac <unk> in a pulpit and hundreds of sacked Liverpool dockers yelling " Fuck the millennium ! " at the tops of their voices ... " Likewise , a 1999 feature on Drummond and Cauty in The Irish Times reported their millennium activities with some warmth . " As a critique of the sponsor @-@ saturated multi @-@ million pound Millennium Dome , " the editorial ran , " the ' people 's pyramid ' is unsurpassed . " 
 Recounting the exploits of 2K , and the press reaction , in his book 45 ( published in the millennium year , 2000 ) , Drummond said :

 = = Plot = = 
 Shiva ( Karthi ) is a young , carefree , unemployed man staying in Bangalore . He has a loyal group of friends including his best friend , a young woman named Priya ( Sonia Deepti ) with whom he shares his feelings . His friends are determined to get him a job . One day he sees a young , beautiful woman named Charulatha ( Tamannaah ) , who is also looking for a job . Shiva is immediately attracted to her . He subsequently spots Charulatha on various occasions and follows her , but loses sight of her each time . He even misses a job interview Priya has arranged for him . 
 Later , as Shiva waits at the railway station to pick up a friend and owner of the Mitsubishi Lancer Shiva and his friends use , he is confronted by a tense Charulatha , accompanied by her uncle . They assume that Shiva is a cab driver and ask him to take them to Chennai . An excited Shiva accepts the offer and takes them . While stopping to refuel the car , Charulatha suddenly requests Shiva to drive on , leaving her uncle behind ; Shiva does as she wishes and takes off . She first asks Shiva to drop her at the airport but she misses the flight and later at a railway station , she is unable to go by train , so she asks Shiva if he will take her to Mumbai by car . 
 Shiva instantly agrees and drives her to Mumbai . Shiva tries to get into a conversation with Charulatha . She initially refuses to talk , but eventually gives in and tells him about her background . It comes to light that Charulatha 's mother , who had always supported her daughter , died after a violent altercation with her father ; since then her father has tried to force Charulatha to marry an unknown man of his choice . Not willing to bow to her father 's wishes , she had escaped from home , but was later found by her father 's business partner , Jayaraman , her supposed uncle . He was about to take her to register the marriage arranged by her father when Charulatha tried to escape , leaving him behind at the filling station . Now she wants to head to Mumbai to stay at her grandmother 's home . 
 However , she is being followed by a gang , led by a furious Telugu @-@ speaking lady . Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang , but encounters a second gang . He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha , but himself , as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai @-@ based gangster Baali ( Milind Soman ) . He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai , when he stayed there at his friend Poochi 's ( Jagan ) house . He had beaten one of Baali 's men , who had attacked him , and later Baali himself , not knowing about him and his reputation in the city , and returned to Bangalore . Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their own ends . After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events , they end up at Poochi 's house . Poochi finds out where the grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there . Shiva , unable to bear the thought that the journey is complete , leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road . After hesitating , she reveals that her relatives had spoken ill about her parents , which prompted her leave , not wanting to push the matter further . While in a state of doubt , they are attacked by Baali 's gang , who have teamed up with Jayaraman . 
 Shiva saves Charulatha from the clutches of the goons by single @-@ handedly overpowering them . While on their way back to Bangalore , his friends arrive . Priya , whom Shiva has called often , tells Charulatha of his feelings for her . Charulatha reciprocates Shiva 's love , as she too has fallen for him during the journey , thus both unite .

 In September 2007 , while working on Bheema , a film starring Vikram , Linguswamy announced that Karthi would star in his next venture to be launched in January 2008 . He said that he had written a story " suitable for Karthi " , further adding that it would be " an action oriented film " . The following month , sources suggested that he was planning a bilingual project , filming simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu with Karthi and Ram Charan Teja , respectively . However , in early November , reports claimed that Vishal would portray the protagonist after Linguswamy had considered Jayam Ravi for the lead character . The reports proved to be false and Karthi was confirmed as the lead actor of the film . 
 The film failed to begin production in January 2008 , with sources reporting in March that Linguswamy was still working on the script . The film was yet to be titled . It was to feature the main crew members of Bheema , including music director Harris Jayaraj , cinematographer R. D. Rajasekhar and editor Anthony . Linguswamy later announced the film with an entirely new crew ; Yuvan Shankar Raja replaced Jayaraj as the film 's music composer , and <unk> was selected as the cinematographer , after Rajasekhar had opted out of the project as he was busy working on <unk> . Linguswamy chose Priya Manikandan , wife of cinematographer Manikandan , as the chief costume designer , for whom Paiyaa would be her first film project . Linguswamy further revealed that the film would be produced by his home production studio Thirupathi Brothers and denied that it was a remake of a Telugu film . Lingusamy disclosed later that he had written two scripts , out of which Karthi eventually chose Paiyaa , because he wanted to do an " urban love story " after two successive roles as a ruffian . Initially titled as Kuthirai , it was later renamed as Paiyaa , which was considered a tentative , working title only . Karthi said he was " ... dying to start shooting for Paiyaa " and to " ... wear good clothes ... and he accepted the film because he " ... desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen . 
 The filming was supposed to begin in August 2009 . However , due to the slow progress of Karthi 's ongoing project , Aayirathil Oruvan , Paiyaa was postponed several times , since Karthi needed to maintain the continuity of his looks for his role in Aayirathil Oruvan . Its producer Ravindran complained at the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments , which forced Linguswamy to readjust the schedules . The shooting finally began in December 2008 . The film 's music was released in November 2009 along with the trailer . In late 2009 , after finishing the filming of Paiyaa , Lingusamy disclosed his plans of remaking the film in Telugu and Hindi as well . Later , as <unk> Okkadu , the Telugu dubbed version of Karthi 's Aayirathil Oruvan , emerged as successful in Andhra Pradesh , the team instead decided to dub and release the film in Telugu to cash in on Karthi 's new @-@ found popularity in the state . The Telugu version was titled Awara and its audio was released in March 2010 ; Awara was released simultaneously with the Tamil version . In March 2010 , the film 's distribution rights were acquired by <unk> Alagiri 's Cloud Nine Movies . This film is also dubbed version in Hindi as " <unk> <unk> "

 In July 2008 , actress Nayantara was signed for the female lead role in Paiyaa for a record salary of ₹ 1 crore . Speaking about the issue , the director admitted that she was one of his favourite actress and he liked her performance in Yaaradi Nee Mohini . He also quoted : " The way her career graph shot up is intriguing . Unlike others her career progressed in reverse gear . She paired up with the superstar during the early years of her career and started accepting roles with heroes of next generation . " She also expressed her interest to work in the project . However , plans were made to trim the film 's budget due to the economic recession , and discussions were held with Nayantara to reduce her salary . The talks resulted in failure and Nayantara left the project in December 2008 . Later , she was accused of cheating the director by refusing to return an advance of ₹ 15 lakh she had taken before commencement , after walking out of the film . The director filed a complaint with the Tamil Film Producers Council , which decided to ban the actress . Subsequently Trisha was reported to have won the role , before Tamannaah was finalised as the female lead , who was signed for ₹ 80 lakh . Later in December 2008 , Milind Soman , who had last appeared in <unk> <unk> , was signed up for the main antagonist 's role , a Mumbai @-@ based don , with other minor antagonists numbering up to 18 .

 After Karthi had completed his film Aayirathil Oruvan , the principal photography for Paiyaa began on 24 December 2008 at a highway near Bangalore . Shooting carried on in and around Bangalore in the following weeks . The film 's main portions were extensively shot across some major highways , where the story plays , whilst the climax was filmed in Mumbai , where the journey would also end . The filming also took place in Tamil Nadu , Puducherry , Kerala and Andhra Pradesh . 
 In May 2009 , a street fight was filmed near the <unk> Lake in Chennai . Later that month , a song ( " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) , choreographed by <unk> Khan , was shot at Prasad Studios in Chennai , where a set had been erected by art director Rajeevan . The song was said to have featured computer graphics and visual effects with which forests and mountain ranges were created . In June 2009 , after nearly six months of shooting , more than sixty @-@ five percent of the project was completed , with a song and the climax sequences being the remaining parts to be filmed . A twenty @-@ five @-@ day schedule was to be held in Mumbai and Pune , but the shooting got halted in July due to heavy rains . In October 2009 , the final action scenes of the climax involving Karthi and Milind Soman were filmed in Mumbai and its suburbs in a ten @-@ day schedule , following which a rain song ( " <unk> <unk> " ) , featuring Karthi and Tamannaah , was shot at the <unk> waterfalls in Kerala .

 The soundtrack for Paiyaa was scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja , collaborating with Linguswamy again after <unk> ( 2005 ) . The audio launch function was held on 22 November 2009 at the Satyam Cinemas , which was attended by many prominent film personalities ; director Shankar released the soundtrack . The album originally features five songs with vocals by singers Karthik , Benny Dayal , Haricharan , Rahul Nambiar and composer Yuvan Shankar Raja himself . Three songs were reportedly composed and recorded in Singapore . The lyrics were provided by Na . Muthukumar . The album received highly positive reviews and responses from critics and audiences alike and the songs were considered to have played an important role for the film 's success .

 The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar TV . The film was initially scheduled for a late 2009 release , but was pushed to 14 January 2010 coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Thai Pongal . Karthi 's second film Aayirathil Oruvan , which was in production for nearly three years , was also planned to release on the same day . According to the Tamil Film Producers Council , two films starring the same actor could not be released on the same day , so Aayirathil Oruvan was given priority , whilst Paiyaa was postponed for 30 days . The release was postponed again for some reasons , before finally hitting the screens on 2 April 2010 . The film had its premiere at the Sathyam Cinemas , Chennai .

 Paiyaa got a solo release on 2 April 2010 , coinciding with Good Friday . It earned ₹ 71 lakh in the opening weekend across Chennai with an average occupancy of 90 % .

In the United Kingdom the film was distributed by <unk> and was released across six screens , grossing £ 21 @,@ 021 in the opening weekend , opening at the 23rd place .

 Upon release , the film generally received positive reviews , with most critics calling the film " summer entertainer " and lauding its technical aspects . Sify described the film as a " road movie laced with mass elements and extraordinary songs " , adding that it is a " jolly good ride " . The reviewer praised the " loveable lead pair " for their " credible performance , which makes up for the plot holes " . He said that technically the film was Linguswamy 's his best , with <unk> 's " eye @-@ catching camera work " , Antony 's " crisp editing " , Rajeevan 's " exotic set designs " , and praised composer Yuvan Shankar Raja , whose " foot @-@ tapping " songs " scorch just like the desert sun " and were all " rocking " , while his background score was a " perfect co @-@ ordination with the narration " . A reviewer from the Times of India , Bhama Devi Ravi , gave the film 3 out of 5 stars , writing that " the story is not earth @-@ shatteringly new , but what pulls you into the movie is the different spin that Lingusamy gives to the familiar story " . She praised the lead pair 's performance , particularly Karthi , who " comes up with an enjoyable performance " , as well as the film 's technical values , describing the camera work as " mind @-@ blowing " , Brinda <unk> 's dialogues as " thoroughly enjoyable " and Yuvan Shankar Raja 's songs as " a real treat " . <unk> described the film as a " racy action adventure " and " undeniably an entertainer this summer " , writing that Linguswamy has brought out " a classy entertainer " and Karthi and Tamannaah 's performances are " absolutely great " . Regarding the technical crew , the reviewer cited that the camera work was " immaculate " , while editor Anthony and stunt coordinator Kanal Kannan had done " an incredible and marvellous job " . The music , in particular , was described as " the greatest strength of the movie " and his background score as " excellent " . 
 Behindwoods gave the film 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , describing the film as " a stylish , light hearted family entertainer for the summer " and a " Pacy road show with a few humps on a straight run " . It too , like the other reviewers , cited that Karthi had brought out an " enjoyable performance " , whilst describing Yuvan Shankar Raja as " the major backbone of <unk> " . Moreover , he cited that Brinda <unk> 's dialogues " evoke laughter " , the car chasing sequence is " absolutely brilliant " , the cinematographer " needs plaudits " and the " crisp editing " by Anthony as a " major plus point . " In contrast , Rediff 's Pavithra Srinivasan cited that there was " [ n ] othing entertaining about <unk> " and that film was worth a watch only for Karthi 's screen presence , " pretty " Tamannaah and Yuvan 's songs , despite giving 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars . She criticised Linguswamy 's script as the film 's " biggest minus " , adding that the film " starts out so very promisingly " , describing the first half was " racy , peppy and enthusiastic , only to fizzle out with no appreciable sequences in the second half .

 = Jutsu ( Naruto ) = 
 In the manga and anime series Naruto , by Masashi Kishimoto , a jutsu ( <unk> , lit . " technique " or " skill " ) refers to the abilities that a ninja can use . The series occurs in a fictional universe in which different countries fight for power using ninja soldiers . The Naruto storyline follows a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure ( Hidden Leaf Village ) . In this series , ninja use jutsu by manipulating a form of energy known as chakra , a combination of the physical and mental energies into either of the other two main jutsus . 
 Series creator Masashi Kishimoto developed the concept of jutsu to explain the supernatural feats ninja perform in the series , and also to provide an original image of ninja in manga . The incorporation of jutsu into the series has received both praise and criticism from several anime and manga publications . T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews asserted that jutsu were the primary focus of Naruto and the source of its " highest accolades , " but criticized the overly repetitive use of certain jutsu in fight scenes . Anime News Network agreed with this sentiment , calling the fights " repetitive to a fault , " but praised the visual presentation of jutsu in both the anime and manga . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 Masashi Kishimoto developed the concept of jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series . He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga . The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources , and was based on the motions of ninja in various role @-@ playing games . The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac , which is a longstanding tradition in Japan , and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition . 
 Although the concept of chakra appears in Indian mythology , in Buddhism and in other belief systems , in an interview , Kishimoto claimed that none of these influences were the basis for his use of chakra in Naruto . He further asserted that it was a term to apply a concrete definition to ninjas ' ability to use jutsu in Naruto , and was comparable to the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role @-@ playing games . 
 = = Chakra = = 
 Chakra ( <unk> , <unk> ) is the basic energy source necessary for ninja in Naruto to perform most jutsu . Millennia ago , humans were originally born without Chakra until a young woman named Kaguya Ōtsutsuki stole the fruit of the Shinju and ate it to obtain the power of Chakra to end a war in her time . Her son , the Sage of the Six Paths , was born with ability to produce Chakra by combining the physical energy ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , drawn from the trillions of cells that make up the human body , and the mental energy ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , gained through experience and meditation . Once created , chakra moves throughout the body in a manner similar to the circulatory system and is delivered to one of 361 chakra release points . By performing a sequence composed of any of twelve different hand seals , chakra can then be manipulated to create supernatural effects , such as walking on water . The method of Chakra production is passed on to the Sage 's various descendants , both direct and indirect , along with other ninja . 
 During Part II of the series the concept of nature transformation ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , altering the quality of chakra , is introduced . Nature manipulation allows ninja , following certain training , to convert their chakra into one of five elements : earth , water , fire , wind , and lightning . Each element is stronger and weaker than another element ; for example , fire is weak against water , but can easily counter and even gets stronger when used against a wind @-@ based jutsu . Most ninja have a natural affinity for one of the five elements , allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease . Ninja with an affinity for fire , for instance , will be able to breathe fire much sooner than they will be able to manipulate water . 
 Skilled ninja can learn how to use other elements ; ninja of the <unk> rank typically are able to manipulate at least two elements . Kakashi Hatake has been shown using all 5 different elements in the Naruto series . Although these ninja can use their different elements separately with little effort , combining the two elements is impossible for ninja who do not have a genetic predisposition for it . Ninja with one of these genetic abilities can mix two specific elements to create an entirely new one . Haku , an antagonist introduced at the start of the series , can mix water and wind to create ice . Wood Style , a combination of earth and water unique to the First Hokage , Danzo and Yamato , which allows the user to produce wood . There is also the Yin @-@ Yang Style and its splintered forms , Yin Style and Yang Style , that only few master and can counter the other chakra natures . 
 = = = Eight Gates = = = 
 The Eight Gates ( <unk> , <unk> , English anime : " The Eight Inner Gates " ) are eight specific points along the chakra circulatory system that limit the overall flow of chakra within a person 's body , which enables the body from expiring too soon . Ninja devised the Eight Gates Released Formation ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> no Jin , English TV " Eight Inner Gates Formation " ) to surpass their own physical limits at the cost of various levels of damage to their own bodies . Each additional gate grants the user new levels of strength with additional injuries ; by opening all eight gates the user will become invincible in battle , but their body will be so damaged in the process that they will die afterwards . Having learned the release technique from his father , Might Guy taught Rock Lee to open his first five gates during Part I of the series , which , according to Kakashi Hatake is a very remarkable feat as he himself can only open the first gate . Guy himself can go further by activating all the way to the eighth gate during Part II , although he states that activating it would kill him . In the Naruto Shippūden 2 : Bonds movie , the villain <unk> mentions opening the eight gates when gaining the " perfect body " from his dark chakra transformation . 
 Gate of Opening ( <unk> , <unk> ) : Located in the brain , the gate removes the brain 's restraints on the muscles to use 100 % of their strength and makes them stronger . 
 Gate of Healing ( <unk> , <unk> , English TV " Gate of Rest " ) : Located in the brain , it forcibly increases one 's physical strength and temporarily empowers the body . 
 Gate of Life ( <unk> , <unk> ) : Located on the spinal cord , its release causes the skin to turn red from increased blood flow . 
 Gate of Pain ( <unk> , <unk> ) : Located on the spinal cord , its release increases the user 's speed and power at the cost of potential tearing in muscle tissue . 
 Gate of Limit ( <unk> , <unk> , English TV " Gate of Closing " ) : Located in the abdomen , its release further increases the user 's speed and power . 
 Gate of View ( <unk> , <unk> , English TV " Gate of Joy " ) : Located in the stomach , its release further increases the user 's speed and power to the point that bodies of water would converge around the user who to the enormous amounts of chakra being emitted . The technique associated with this gate is <unk> ( <unk> , Morning Peacock ) , kicking an opponent in the air to deliver a barrage of punches so fast that the air around the fist is set ablaze and a peacock @-@ like fan of flames is formed around the opponent . 
 Gate of Wonder ( <unk> , <unk> , English TV " Gate of Shock " ) : Located below the stomach , its releases causes every pour of the user 's body to emit a turquoise @-@ colored sweat that instantly evaporates and gives the illusion of a chakra coating . Unfortunately , the side effects of opening the seventh gate are that the user 's muscle fibers become fragile to the point that anything can rip them to shreds . The technique associated with this gate is <unk> ( <unk> , Daytime Tiger ) , a single punch that creates air pressure around the fist in the form of a tiger to land a death blow . 
 The Gate of Death ( <unk> , Shimon ) : Located at the heart , its release uses up all of the body 's energy while the sweat becomes a crimson color . With the heart pumping at maximum power , this gate makes the user the most powerful figure in a battle yet kills them shortly after . The two techniques associated with this gate are <unk> ( <unk> , Evening Elephant ) , a series of punches in which the shockwaves produced resemble giant elephant feet , and <unk> ( <unk> , Night Guy ) , in which the user manifests a dragon @-@ shaped aura and performs a kick which obliterates the target . 
 = = Jutsu types = = 
 Jutsu are divided into three categories : ninjutsu , genjutsu and taijutsu . Ninjutsu also has two sub @-@ categories : sealing jutsu and cursed seal jutsu , both of which are used to create seals for various purposes . Senjutsu , a concept introduced in Part II of the series , uses three types of energy : the mental and physical energies of the shinobi and the energy of nature . By channeling the energy of nature , the <unk> user can greatly increase the power of his or her other jutsu . Kekkei genkai abilities are genetically inherited traits that allow the user to perform unique techniques . 
 Jutsu are ranked in terms of how difficult they are to perform , an E @-@ rank denoting basic techniques and an S @-@ rank indicating jutsu that require years of practice to master . An S @-@ rank jutsu is not necessarily more effective than an E @-@ rank ability , as a jutsu 's effectiveness is largely based on individual skill . In addition to the six letter ranks , jutsu can also receive one of two informal ranks . " Secret " ( <unk> , <unk> ) jutsu are passed down from generation to generation within a clan . These jutsu are not ranked because no one outside the clan knows how to perform them . " Forbidden techniques " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , on the other hand , fall into one of the six main ranks , but are an exception because they are forbidden to learn or perform . A technique can be categorized as forbidden if it either causes great harm to the user , such as opening the Eight Gates or the execution of Naruto 's technique Wind Style : Rasenshuriken , or if the techniques are dark or sinister in nature , such as those used by Orochimaru . 
 = = = Ninjutsu = = = 
 Ninjutsu ( <unk> , lit . " ninja techniques " ) is a vague term referring to almost any technique that uses chakra and allows the user to do something that they otherwise would be incapable of doing . The ninjutsu that most contemporary ninja use is successor to what was called <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " ninja sect " ) , teachings created by the Sage of the Six Paths that allowed people to use chakra so they might connect with each other ; however , as time went by , people began to channel their chakra to their physical and spiritual energies instead , which weaponized the chakra into something they can inflict to others . Unlike genjutsu , which makes the opponent see illusions , the effects of ninjutsu are real . They vary greatly in purpose , with the simpler ninjutsu serving such tasks as transforming the user or allowing them to evade attacks . These techniques are often second @-@ nature for experienced ninja , who can use them at will . More complex ninjutsu manipulate one 's surroundings or utilize the elements , respectively serving such tasks as healing others or manipulating basic elements . Techniques that involve the manipulation of elements are called Nature Transformation . However , advanced elements can not be accessed by all ninja as advanced elements can only be used through the use of a <unk> genkai . 
 = = = Genjutsu = = = 
 Genjutsu ( <unk> , lit . " illusion techniques " ) are techniques that use the chakra in the victim 's mind system to create illusions . The most commonly seen genjutsu in the series is the simple creation of phantasms – causing the targeted person ( s ) to hear , see , smell , taste or feel sensations that are not actually there in order to manipulate them . Most genjutsu affects the five senses , though other applications of genjutsu exist . Those under the influence of genjutsu usually freeze in place or lose consciousness , depending on how capable they are in recognizing and defending against it . Depending on the purpose of the genjutsu , one could be running or jumping while under the genjutsu ( as seen when Itachi uses genjutsu on Naruto in part II , when he used the Rasengan on Itachi , only to find out it had been genjutsu and he had used it on air ) . A genjutsu can be broken in one of three ways . The first is " genjutsu cancel " ( <unk> , genjutsu kai ) , a disruption of the victim 's chakra flow either by themselves or their allies . Pain that is not a result of the genjutsu , such as stabbing oneself , is a second method of countering genjutsu . Finally , if the caster of the genjutsu loses focus for whatever reason , the jutsu will end and the victim is freed . 
 = = = Taijutsu = = = 
 Taijutsu ( <unk> , lit . " body techniques " ) refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the optimization of natural human abilities . Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user 's physical and mental energies . It relies on the stamina and strength gained through training . Because chakra does not need to be produced , taijutsu can typically be performed much faster than ninjutsu or genjutsu techniques . Rock Lee and his teacher Might Guy are examples of ninja who specialize in taijutsu . 
 = = = Kekkei genkai = = = 
 Kekkei genkai ( <unk> , lit . " bloodline trait " ) are abilities passed down genetically in ordinary clans . Most of these clans have developed special techniques that rely on their genetic abilities , as it gives them an advantage in battle that cannot be taught to or copied by opponents . 
 Kekkei genkai such as the Sharingan that work via the user 's eyes are called Dōjutsu ( <unk> , " eye techniques " ) . This particular type of jutsu was derived from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki , the mother of the Sage of the Six Paths and originator of the Three Great Dōjutsu , with both the Uchiha and Hyūga Clans her descendants . Other kekkei genkai such as Wood Style revolve around a simultaneous combination of two separate chakra elements to create an entirely new one . Kekkei Genkai have an advanced variation called Kekkei tōta ( <unk> , lit . " bloodline selection " ) . There is only one example of this variation : Particle Style , which involves the combination of fire , wind , and earth elements . An even more powerful variation is Kekkei mōra ( <unk> , lit . " bloodline encompassing " ) , which combines all elements of nature , including Yin @-@ Yang Style . An example of kekkei mōra is Rinne Sharingan , an ancient dojutsu possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki and the <unk> of Kaguya 's monstrous form , the Ten Tails . 
 = = = = Dojutsu = = = = 
 Dojutsu ( <unk> , lit . " eye techniques " ) is a form of kekkei genkai that utilizes the eyes . It grants the user with ocular abilities that may be ninjutsu , genjutsu , or something else . Because of the physical nature of eyes , dojutsu can be transplanted to another individual and still be functional , though if the user is not of the same family as the donor , they may have little control over when the dojutsu is activated or have their chakra taxed more than usual . In the Ninja World , there exists the " Three Great Dōjutsu " : the Byakugan that allows the user 360 degrees view within a certain distance and an individual 's chakra pathway system ; the Sharingan that allows the user to copy others ' jutsu and movements as well as a multitude of genjutsu and other abilities ; and the Rinnegan , the most " exalted " of the three that gives the user control over the Six Paths . There is also the Rinne Sharingan , the primeval form of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan , and the Tenseigan , a heightened form of Byakugan and very similar to the Rinnegan in power . There is only one individual who possesses all three of the Great Dojutsu : Kaguya Ōtsutsuki , who possesses both the Byakugan and the Rinne Sharingan . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Sealing jutsu ( <unk> , Fūin jutsu ) are techniques developed by the Sage of the Six Paths to seal something inside objects or living beings . The developing of new Sealing jutsus was continued by the Uzumaki Clan , a branch of Senju Clan who are descendants of the Sage , one of their works being one that seals Tailed Beasts into their Jinchuriki to be . The most common application of this is sealing weapons or other objects within scrolls to efficiently carry a large number of items . Sealing jutsu are also utilized to restrict access to things , such as chakra or entry to a building . The " Reaper Death Seal " is a unique sealing jutsu as the target 's soul is sealed with the Reaper , who is neither living nor an object . 
 = = = Senjutsu = = = 
 Senjutsu ( <unk> , lit . " sage techniques " ) is a form of jutsu introduced during Part II of the series that is taught from summons who have obtained the title of Sage , two of which are the Great Toad Sage and the White Snake Sage . A user can achieve mastering Senjutsu by combining the user 's chakra with " natures energy " , a task that can only be completed by ninja with particularly large chakra reserves who learn to harmonize with nature by remaining perfectly still — anyone else who tries is quickly overwhelmed by this natural energy , as seen in the case of Jugo 's Clan rendered mentally unstable with fits of rage . For those who learn under the Great Toad Sage , the overdose of natural energy turns them into giant stone toad statues though the effects can be neutralized with the sage 's beating stick . Even if the user is able to use Senjutsu , they only have a certain amount of time before the natural energies are used up , as the user will still need to move around the battlefield and Senjutsu requires to user to remain still , although it can be bypassed by certain methods , such as summoning frog assistants or using shadow clones to help gather the energy . Those who master Senjutsu are able to enter a state called " Sage Mode " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) where user adopts the physical features of his animal mentor . Because of the difficulty in maintaining the natural energy , only a few people have been able to properly master Senjutsu ; Naruto Uzumaki is stated to be the first Senjutsu user under the tutelage of the Great Toad Sage , <unk> , who has achieved such feat . Ninja who are able to use Senjutsu include Jiraiya , Minato Namikaze , Hashirama Senju , and Kabuto Yakushi are also able to use Senjutsu , seemingly without the aid of an animal mentor . Because the chakra utilized from the natural world , Senjutsu is an effective weapon against the Ten @-@ Tails and Yin @-@ Yang Style users . 
 = = Recurring jutsu = = 
 = = = Chidori = = = 
 The Chidori ( <unk> , lit . " One Thousand Birds " ) was created by Kakashi Hatake during his childhood , gaining its name when the channeling of strong lightning @-@ based chakra in one 's hand produces a sound reminiscent of chirping birds . Once enough lightning @-@ chakra has been collected , the user rushes at their target and thrusts the Chidori into it ; the speed of the attack and the amount of chakra used enable the user to penetrate most defenses easily . During Kakashi Gaiden , a short flashback to Kakashi 's childhood that divides Part I and II of the series , the Chidori is revealed to cause a tunnel vision effect because of the speeds at which the user moves , leaving them vulnerable to a counterattack . Because of this disability , only ninja with a Sharingan eye can use the Chidori effectively , as the Sharingan 's ability to notice even the slightest details counteracts the tunnel vision . As a result , Kakashi is able to teach the Chidori to Sasuke Uchiha during Part I. 
 Due to the large amounts of concentration and chakra needed to collect and control the lightning @-@ chakra , both Kakashi and Sasuke are initially limited to using Chidori only a few times a day . They are shown to have increased their limits in Part II , but to what extent is unclear . As the creator of the Chidori , Kakashi has reached a level of control great enough that he can split a bolt of lightning , resulting in his version being called the " Lightning Blade " ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Sasuke also reaches greater levels of control during Part II , which allows him to reshape the Chidori in his hand into solid form like a sword with more variations like Chidori Stream , Chidori Needles , or Chidori Spear . 
 = = = Summoning : Reanimation = = = 
 Summoning : Reanimation ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> : Edo Tensei , Summoning : Impure World Reincarnation ) is a forbidden summoning jutsu that is used to revive the dead in a state of near @-@ life . The process of this jutsu is obtaining a genetic sample from the deceased , either through grave robbery or blood stains and salvaged organs . From there , a living person is then sacrificed for the deceased spirit to inhabit and serve as a slave to the user 's will . However , the Jutsu can only function if the deceased soul is within the realm of Pure Land and not elsewhere in the afterlife like in the stomach of the Reaper . Though it was the Tobirama Senju who invented the Reanimation Jutsu for the purpose of creating an indestructible army used in suicide attacks , the jutsu was later completed by Orochimaru when he used it against the Third Hokage , Hiruzen Sarutobi by reviving Tobirama Senju and Hashirama Senju . However , Kabuto perfected the jutsu to the point where he is able to revive dozens of ninja in one execution , needing to focus all his mental energy to fully control them . People revived through this process are almost invulnerable to even the most fatal attacks , as they will simply regenerate any damage taken ( although it takes some time for especially damaging ones like Rasengan and they can also be paralyzed by specific attacks , such as poison ) . Having already died , the resurrected expel any basic needs living people required ; they have unlimited chakra and power due to not needing to replenish them . In addition , they cannot be subjected to genjutsu jutsu that affect living things like the Infinite Tsukuyomi . The only effective means to destroy a ninja brought back is with Yin @-@ Yang Style techniques that damages the body beyond regeneration to the point of death . 
 Despite Kabuto claiming that the technique is flawless , it does have several flaws , including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to drift back to the afterlife willingly . Those who are paralyzed , sealed , or subjected to certain genjutsu , such as <unk> , cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled . Also , the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled , as shown by Madara Uchiha . Furthermore , if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan 's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu , the living equivalent of that ninja 's body part is absent . 
 = = = Advanced Chakra Nature Transformation = = = 
 The advanced Chakra Nature Transformation is a type of kekkei genkai which allows the users to manipulate elements other than the five basic chakra nature ; fire , water , wind , lightning , and earth . The combination is usually achieved through mixing two ( or three in the case of kekkei tōta ) separate elements to create an entirely new one ; thus the users are able to use the elements that composed the advanced element in addition to the kekkei genkai ( such as Yamato being able to use water and earth in addition to the wood ) . Due to the nature of kekkei genkai , ninja with no blood limit required to use the elements are unable to use them even when they had mastered the basic components of the element . Some advanced elements may be unique to one person in the clan , the most notable being the Wood Style , which is only present in Hashirama Senju . The known advanced chakra nature transformations are as follows : 
 Ice Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Ice Release ) mixes water and wind elements to create ice . It is possessed by members of the Yuki clan , one of the once numerous clans with kekkei genkai in Kirigakure that has been exterminated to almost extinction during the Fourth Mizukage 's reign . The only known members of the clan are Haku and his mother , both of whom have died , leaving the technique 's existence uncertain . 
 Explosive Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Explosion Release ) allows the users to imbue objects with explosive chakra to make them explode . It is possessed by members of the <unk> Explosion Corps , which include Gari and Akatsuki member Deidara , thus being one of kekkei genkai possessed by ninja without familial connection with each other . It is named long after its introduction , previously being thought to be a variation of Earth Style . 
 Magnet Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Magnet Release ) allows the manipulation of chakra to attract objects or magnetize an object through simple touch . Though present in the Hidden Sand Village , its tailed beast Shukaku able to manipulate sand , neither of the two users appear to be related . These two are the Third Kazekage , whose development of his Iron Sand fighting style from studying the One Tail led to his death by Sasori , and the Fourth Kazekage who mixed gold dust in his sand . The Fourth Kazekage 's son , Gaara , who was once the host of Shukaku , is able to manipulate sand as well even after the tailed beast has been extracted from him . Naruto gained use of this chakra nature after a fragment of Shukaku is transferred into his body . <unk> of Kumogakure possessed a variation of the technique which is used to magnetize objects through skin contact . 
 Corrosion / Lava Style ( <unk> / <unk> , <unk> , Lava Release ) mixes fire and earth elements for diverse purposes . This nature is possessed by Son <unk> , which manifests through both the Four Tails Jinchuriki Roshi and Naruto in the form of molten rock and lava . The Lava Style is also of the kekkei genkai possessed by ninja without familial connection with each other : seen in the Fifth Mizukage Mei <unk> , <unk> of <unk> whose lava takes form of quicklime , <unk> of Kumogakure whose variation is said to take the form of vulcanized rubber . 
 Inferno Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Blaze Release ) , an advanced variation of Fire Style , allows manipulation of the virtually long @-@ lasting black flames of Amaterasu , regarded as the highest form of Fire Style techniques . Thus , it is only commanded by people who could cast Amaterasu , namely , Sasuke Uchiha and his brother , Itachi . 
 Gale / Storm Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Storm Release ) mixes water and lightning elements to create energy beams which can be guided like water . It is possessed by Kumogakure ninja , most notably <unk> . The third Shippūden film , Naruto Shippuden the Movie : The Will of Fire has a variation which allows manipulation of lightning clouds which are able to absorb chakra . The variation is possessed by Hiruko after stealing it from an unknown ninja . 
 Vapour Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Boil Release ) mixes fire and water elements to create powerful corrosive gas . It is one of the two advanced chakra nature possessed by Mei <unk> . 
 Particle Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Dust Release ) mixes fire , wind , and earth elements to create an expanding three @-@ dimensional object capable of disintegrating anything it touches at molecular level . It is the only example of kekkei tōta , an advanced variation of kekkei genkai which mixes three elements instead of two . Two ninja are known to possess it : <unk> and <unk> , both of which had no familial connection with each other . 
 Scorch Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Scorch Release ) allows manipulation of chakra taking form of fire orbs capable of heating up water inside a person 's body until they evaporate , effectively <unk> them . The only ninja known to possess the technique is <unk> from Sunagakure , who had already died . However , the technique created from the combination of Naruto and Sasuke 's wind and fire elements , respectively , is also named a Scorch Style technique by Minato Namikaze , though it might be attributed to it being a combination of two elemental natures and not due to being a genetic attribute . 
 The anime adaptation and the film series have also introduced several new advanced chakra nature transformations . These types have never been revisited in the manga . Those are as follows : 
 Crystal Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Crystal Release ) allows the user to create crystals from moisture in the air as weapons , crystallize objects , or manipulate already available crystals . The only known user of this kekkei genkai is Guren , who appears in the anime @-@ only Three Tails Arc . 
 Quick Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Swift Release ) allows the user to move at instantaneous speed , making them unable to be hit by most Taijutsu attacks . It appears in the third Naruto Shippūden film Naruto Shippuden the Movie : The Will of Fire , possessed by Hiruko after stealing it from an unknown ninja . 
 Shade Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Dark Release ) allows the user to absorb , manipulate , and release enemy 's chakra through a pair of diamond marks in the user 's hand . It appears in the third Naruto Shippūden film Naruto Shippuden the Movie : The Will of Fire , possessed by Hiruko after stealing it from an unknown ninja . 
 Steel Style ( <unk> , <unk> , Steel Release ) allows the user to transform the body into black steel , rendering it impenetrable . It appears in the third Naruto Shippūden film Naruto Shippuden the Movie : The Will of Fire , possessed by Hiruko after stealing it from an unknown ninja . 
 = = = = Wood Style = = = = 
 Wood Style ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Wood Release " ) is the kekkei genkai of Hashirama Senju . By combining earth and water @-@ based chakra , the user can produce trees or wooden objects from any surface . This allowed the First Hokage , Hashirama Senju , to create the foundation of Konohagakure . The objects created with the Wood Style vary in detail , ranging from a simple wall to a functioning copy of the user . During Part II , it was revealed that Yamato received the ability to use Wood Style techniques after being injected with Hashirama 's DNA by Orochimaru , though at a much lesser scale . A possibly unrelated technique , but unique to the First Hokage and Yamato , is the ability to suppress a tailed beast . This is accomplished by producing wooden poles from the ground that attach to the beast and force its chakra to recede . Similar to Yamato , Danzō Shimura also had Hashirama 's DNA injected into him by Orochimaru , granting him the ability to use Wood Style techniques , but only to a limited amount as Danzō can not have too much implanted as he would have been killed . Madara Uchiha is revealed to have successfully injected Hashirama 's DNA into him as well , becoming a genetic match to the Sage of the Six Paths and had used it to save his apprentice Obito Uchiha from dying . White <unk> and those mutated from being assimilated by the Shinju also possess Wood Style , with Madara deceived into thinking that they are essentially artificial humans he created through Hashirama 's DNA . After Naruto and Sasuke 's final battle end with them losing their right and left arms respectively , Tsunade offers to use her grandfather 's cells containing the Wood Style to fit them with prosthetic arms ; while Naruto accepts , Sasuke declines the offer . 
 = = = = Spirit Transformation Technique = = = = 
 Spirit Transformation Technique ( <unk> , Reika no Jutsu , Ghost Transformation Jutsu ) is the ability it allows the user 's soul to materialize and leave their body , makes them reminiscent of an " <unk> " ( <unk> , Literally meaning : living ghost ) , which is then able to take possession of a target , enabling them to freely manipulate the victim 's body at will or kill them . It can as well crossed a vast distance and also transfer chakra to them . The only known user of this technique is Dan Katō . 
 = = = Orochimaru 's cursed seals = = = 
 Orochimaru 's Cursed Seal Jutsu ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Cursed Seal Technique " ) is a special seal Orochimaru uses to increase the power level of his subordinates and control them . Having met Jugo , Orochimaru 's research of the youth 's ability to freely transform parts of his body led him to <unk> Cave where he gained the ability to assume Sage Mode yet could not properly use it due to the frailty of his hosts . However , to compensate for the flaw , Orochimaru devised the Cursed Seals by infusing his Senjutsu Chakra into the enzymes he extracted from Jugo 's body . From there , Orochimaru proceeded to bestow his Cursed Seals to those he intended to use as his strong and loyal followers due to a part of his consciousness influencing them through the Cursed Seals . Among those given the Cursed Seal are Anko , the Sound Five , Kimimaro and Sasuke . 
 The process upon being branded is a painful experience for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it . Once one 's body accepts the seal , they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user 's body , increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process . When the seal is deactivated , the user is left exhausted , having expended all their energy during its use . The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body , ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness . The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness . 
 Having gained his Cursed Seal by Orochimaru 's bite to his neck during the Chunin Exams , all to prepare him as the ninja 's next vessel , Sasuke survives the ordeal and briefly used its power before Kakashi set up an additional seal to keep the Cursed Seal at bay . But after gaining the Second Level with the Sound Four 's aid , Sasuke began training under Orochimaru and manages to isolate the level two transformation to specific parts of his body within a few years ' time before Itachi removed the Cursed Seal from him . Anko also had hers removed during the Fourth Great Ninja War when Sasuke transferred the consciousness within it into a new body . 
 = = = Puppet Technique = = = 
 The Puppet Technique ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , English manga : " Art of the Puppet Master " , English anime : " Puppet Master Jutsu " ) is a style of combat originating from the Ōtsutsuki clan . The village of Sunagakure that utilizes strings of chakra to control objects , typically puppets . The puppeteer connects one of their fingers to part of a puppet 's body with a chakra string , allowing them to remotely operate it in battle with the proper finger movements . Advanced puppeteers can control multiple puppets at once ; for instance , the Sunagakure ninja Chiyo can control ten puppets at once by having each finger control a different puppet . However , Sasori can control up to 100 different puppets , with the strings connected directly to his heart . He can do this because he turned himself into a puppet . Because they rely almost exclusively on the secret weapons and features of their puppets during battle , puppeteers are the most vulnerable component of this style , and go to lengths to remove themselves from combat . Puppets normally cannot use chakra ; the Akatsuki member Sasori creates puppets from human bodies , preserving the chakra and unique abilities the body originally had . Kankuro is the most commonly seen puppeteer in Naruto , and he adds additional puppets to his arsenal as the series progresses . 
 = = = Rasengan = = = 
 The Rasengan ( <unk> , lit . " <unk> Sphere " , English manga : " Spiral Chakra Sphere " , Naruto : Uzumaki Chronicles : " Power Strike " ) is a jutsu that Minato Namikaze created after three years of hard development by observing the Tailed Beast Bomb . It is a spinning ball of compressed chakra formed in the user 's hand that tears and grinds with great force into whatever it comes into contact with . The Rasengan is introduced in the series when Jiraiya , Minato Namikaze 's teacher , teaches it to Naruto Uzumaki , Minato 's son , to take the boy further in his training . Because it is a difficult jutsu , Jiraiya teaches it to Naruto in three stages : spinning the chakra , giving it sufficient force , and forming the chakra into a compressed spherical shape . Naruto struggles with the final step , and creates an alternative method using a shadow clone to mold the shape of the attack while he provides the chakra and controls it . 
 During Part II of the series , new variants of the Rasengan are seen . Both Naruto and Jiraiya are shown capable of forming a larger , Giant Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> Rasengan , Great Ball Rasengan ) that is stronger than the standard version . Kakashi Hatake , Minato 's student , and Konohamaru Sarutobi , Naruto 's " apprentice " , are also revealed to have been taught how to use the Rasengan . Later in Part II , having developed the Rasenshuriken and perfecting it with sage chakra to use the technique without any self @-@ damage , Naruto uses the sage chakra to create an enhanced version of Rasengan , the Sage Art : Super Big Ball Rasengan ( 仙法 ・ <unk> , Senpō : Chō <unk> Rasengan ) . After Naruto gains control over Kurama 's chakra , in the form of the Nine @-@ Tails Chakra Mode , many new variations are introduced , such as the Planetary Rasengan ( <unk> , Wakusei Rasengan ) , which places three regular Rasengan in synchronous orbit around a single Giant Rasengan similar to moons cycling a planet , the Rasen @-@ Rampage ( <unk> , <unk> ) which creates multiple Rasengan using chakra arms to attack multiple targets , and the Rasen @-@ Absorption ( <unk> , <unk> ) which uses the chakra arms to grab and smash his foes into a Giant Rasengan , creating the illusion of being " absorbed by Rasengan " . All of these variations can be multiplied through the use of shadow clones . After Naruto gains the chakra of the other Tailed Beast , Naruto invents other variations of the technique such as Shukaku 's Magnet Style for the Sage Art : Magnet Style Rasengan ( 仙法 ・ <unk> , Senpō : <unk> Rasengan ) . 
 The Naruto movies also introduce one @-@ time variations of the Rasengan : The Seven @-@ Coloured Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> no Rasengan ) , the <unk> Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> Rasengan ) , the Crescent Moon Rasengan ( <unk> , Mikazuki Rasengan ) , the Tornado Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> Rasengan ) , the Guts Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> Rasengan ) , and the Supreme Ultimate Rasengan ( <unk> , <unk> Rasengan ) . These variations have never been revisited in either the manga or anime . 
 = = = = Rasenshuriken = = = = 
 Kakashi reveals to Naruto that Minato intended to combine the Rasengan with his elemental chakra but was unable to complete the technique . Naruto is able to complete his father 's work through the use of shadow clones . In order to perform it , Naruto requires the aid of two shadow clones ; he provides the chakra , one clone is responsible for the shape transformation , and the other provides the nature transformation . By manipulating the wind @-@ natured chakra of the Wind Release : Rasengan , Naruto was able to create four large points , causing the Rasengan to take on the appearance of a giant <unk> shuriken , with the Rasengan in the center remaining a perfect sphere . The technique gives off a loud screech @-@ like noise during , and after formation . 
 The Rasenshuriken creates countless microscopic wind @-@ blades that severely damage the body on a cellular level . It produces so many individual strikes that even Kakashi Hatake is unable to count them all with his Sharingan . The wind @-@ blades sever all nerve channels in the body , leaving the target unable to move after being struck . They also attack the entire chakra circulatory system , which cannot be repaired by any form of medical ninjutsu whatsoever . 
 When Naruto first uses the Rasenshuriken against <unk> as a slashing weapon , it did cellular damage to Naruto 's arm with Tsunade labeling it a forbidden jutsu and comparing it to poison . But Naruto learns that sage mode heals things much quicker therefore he can use the Rasenshuriken as it will <unk> heal his arm . The Rasenshuriken 's flaw is removed and the damage is greatly increased to the point of cutting through rocky mountains and momentarily stun beings like Kurama . After receiving Hagoromo 's yang chakra , Naruto is able to infuse his Rasenshuriken with the elemental chakra provided by the Tailed Beasts inside him : using Son <unk> 's Lava Style with the Rasenshuriken to create Sage Art : Lava Style Rasenshuriken ( 仙法 ・ <unk> , Senpō : <unk> Rasenshuriken ) . Naruto can also create eight Shadow Clones to utilize all nine tailed beasts ' chakra in the Sage Art : Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken ( 仙法 ・ <unk> , Senpō : <unk> Rasenshuriken ) attack . In Naruto Shippuden : Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution , there is a very powerful variation called Tailed Beast Planetary Rasenshuriken . 
 = = = Reaper Death Seal = = = 
 Reaper Death Seal ( <unk> , Shiki Fūjin , lit . " Dead Demon Consuming Seal " ) is a suicidal forbidden Sealing Jutsu where the user summons an entity called the Reaper ( <unk> , Shinigami ) behind him , thrusting its arm through the user 's stomach to grab the soul of the target and drag it into the user 's body . Once the sealing is completed , the Reaper would consume the souls of both the user and the sealed , sentencing them to be locked in combat within its stomach for all eternity . However , in cases where only part of the target 's soul is sealed , the corresponding body part is paralyzed and suffers from extremely painful necrosis . Only the Fourth and Third Hokage executed the Reaper Death Seal during their respective battles with Kurama and Orochimaru . In both cases , both Hokage were forced to only take a part of their opponents down with them : Minato taking the Yin aspect of Kurama while Hiruzen is forced take the part of Orochimaru 's soul within his arms in an attempt to ensure his former pupil would never perform a jutsu again . Later , in the Part II during the events of the Fourth Great Ninja War , Orochimaru uses an Uzumaki clan mask to summon the Reaper in a risky move , and breaks the Reaper Death Seal by cutting the demon 's stomach wide open . With the Reaper Death Seal undone , the souls of the previous four Hokage are reanimated while Orochimaru regains the part of his soul he lost years ago . 
 = = = Ninja Art : Mitotic Regeneration = = = 
 Ninja Art : Mitotic Regeneration ( <unk> , Sōzō Saisei , lit . " Creation Rebirth " ) is the absolute pinnacle of medical ninjutsu , created by Tsunade , who is regarded as the greatest medical ninja in the ninja world . The user must first store a substantial amount of chakra to form the <unk> Seal ( <unk> , <unk> no In , lit . " Strength of a Hundred Seal " ) at the forehead . To activate the technique , the user releases the seal to forcibly release the stored chakra to the body . Through the input of the user , proteins hasten the creation of new cells through cell division , which regenerates any injuries sustained by the user . Thus , as long as the user have enough chakra , they are able to regenerate even the most fatal injuries , essentially making them " invincible " in combat . However , because body cells can only divide a number of times in life , the user is basically shortening their own lifespan by speeding up the process . Tsunade manages to counteract this to a certain extent through her long lifespan , thus she is able to live even after using the jutsu several times . The jutsu also has a variation , Mitotic Regeneration : One Hundred <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , lit . " Strength of a Hundred Technique " ) . Though it has the same effect as the original , the user does not need to input chakra to activate , thus injuries are automatically regenerated as the damages are done . Tsunade , for the longest time the only ninja who had mastered this technique , had made the rule that prohibits any medical ninja to directly participate in battles if they had not mastered this technique . Tsunade 's student , Sakura Haruno , is also able to use One Hundred <unk> after having stored her chakra for three years to form the <unk> Seal . 
 = = = Sexy Jutsu = = = 
 The Sexy Jutsu ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , Disney XD dub version : " Cutie Jutsu " ) is a transformation jutsu that Naruto Uzumaki invented , transforming the user into a nude woman , covered in a mist or dressed , in a seductive posture . While not an offensive attack , the Sexy Jutsu is mainly used for distractive purposes with a stronger effect on more perverted targets . Naruto also invented the more potent Harem Jutsu ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu ) , through his Shadow Clones , and the <unk> Jutsu ( Disney XD dub version : " Hottie Jutsu " ) where he adds an alluring outfit to his guise in order to add further enticement . Naruto also taught his jutsu to Konohamaru , who also invented his own more potent variations . During Part II , Konohamaru , who has been taught the technique by Naruto , creates a variation that transforms him into two nude men in suggestive positions instead . Meanwhile , Naruto combines that variation with more shadow clones to create the Reverse Harem Jutsu ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> no Jutsu ) for dealing with female opponents . 
 = = = Shadow Clone Jutsu = = = 
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu ( <unk> , Kage <unk> no Jutsu , English manga : " Art of the Shadow Doppelganger " ) is one of Naruto Uzumaki 's signature techniques , invented by Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki . Unlike regular clone jutsus , the Shadow Clones are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings , performing jutsu , and engaging in battle before dispersing in a puff of smoke when sufficiently damaged or at the user 's discretion . When clones are created , the user 's chakra is evenly distributed among them , making it easy for the user to quickly expend all their chakra . While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this , Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra . He can also combine it with his " Sexy Jutsu " to produce the " Harem Jutsu " . During Part II , having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it , Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred to him at the moment that the jutsu is canceled . This fact enables Naruto to make use of the Jutsu in gaining more experience within days of training that would last years and to cover more ground with by using his Shadow Clones as scouts . 
 = = = Shikotsumyaku = = = 
 Shikotsumyaku ( <unk> , Literally meaning " Dead Bone Pulse " ) is a kekkei genkai of the Kaguya clan , who are one of the many descendants of Kaguya Otsutsuki , the first human possessing chakra . Due to the clan 's barbaric and <unk> nature , the technique met its end with the clan 's last surviving member , Kimimaro , who is one of the few members to possess the technique as well as being terminally ill ; the technique is then lost after Kimimaro 's death until Kabuto Yakushi 's usage of Kimimaro 's DNA to gain the Shikotsumyaku through a construct of Kimimaro 's body . The Shikotsumyaku is the ability to manipulate the user 's own skeletal structure by using chakra infusions to manipulate the growth and properties of their bones for combat use . The user thus recovers heavy injuries fast and not hindered at all if their bones are broken ; in fact , the technique 's usage encourages the user to break up their bones , which are hardened almost like steel , for offensive use . Most of the technique 's names are named after plants , combined with a theme around " dances " , including the Dance of Willow ( <unk> , Yanagi no Mai ) , Dance of Camellia ( <unk> , Tsubaki no Mai ) , and Dance of Seedling Fern ( <unk> , <unk> no Mai ) . Meanwhile , the technique 's progenitor , Kaguya , uses an advanced variation called the All @-@ Killing Ash Bones ( <unk> , <unk> no <unk> ) : she manifests bones from her back and then fires bones from her palms at the intended target . When these bones hit a living organism , the target starts to deteriorate at a molecular level , reducing their bodies to nothing more than a pile of ash . She also used this attack in a variety of ways : as a projectile attack , incorporating the use of her dimension @-@ manifesting abilities to land a two @-@ sided attack as well as a close @-@ range melee attack . 
 = = = Byakugan = = = 
 The Byakugan ( <unk> , lit . " White Eye " , English manga : " Evil Eye " / " All @-@ Seeing Eye " ) is a genetic eye technique and one of the Three Great Dōjutsu that naturally occurs in members of the Otsutsuki clan as well as its descendants , the Hyuga clan . The Byakugan originated with Kaguya with her Hamura inheriting the dojutsu before he and most of his clan took residence on the moon where they nearly die out from infighting resulted in the clan having only one surviving descendant . Only one branch of Hamura 's clan remained behind and eventually become the Hyuga clan over many generations . Unlike the Sharingan and Rinnegan which are gained through experience and time , the Byakugan manifest at the moment of the user 's birth . While normally lavender @-@ white , pupil @-@ less eyes , Byakugan 's activation causes the pupils to become more distinct while the veins near their temples bulge . The Byakugan gives the user a nearly 360 degree field of vision . The user can concentrate his or her chakra in the blind spot to achieve a 360 degree angle . They can see and focus in on anything within a certain distance from themselves , the range of which can be extended through training . During Part I of the series , Neji Hyuga is limited to fifty meters , and by Part II , he can see objects at least eight @-@ hundred meters away . 
 The Byakugan can detect and see through anything within its range of sight . In battle , users of the Byakugan can see the flow of chakra within an opponent 's body . This enables the user to forcibly release their own chakra through one of the opponent 's 361 chakra release points , cutting off the flow of chakra or directly attacking the internal organs . Because this is accomplished through only the slightest amount of physical contact , this style of fighting is named " Gentle Fist " ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Due to the manifold techniques using the Byakugan and the Gentle Fist style , the Hyūga impose an elaborate family hierarchy for security reasons . The Gentle Fist 's secret techniques are only allowed to be learned by the clan 's " main house " , who are protected at all times by members of the " branch houses " . Branch house members are also branded with a cursed seal that destroys their Byakugan when they die , preventing enemy ninja from studying their bodies to learn the Byakugan 's secrets . In Part II , it is revealed that a Kirigakure ninja , Ao , had the Byakugan of a ninja he defeated transplanted into his right eye . Himawari Uzumaki has her variant of the Byakugan , which appears to function like a Sharingan rather than manifest at her birth . 
 = = = Tenseigan = = = 
 Tenseigan ( <unk> , lit . " Reincarnation Eye " ) is a term that refers to two different concepts : an eye technique and an object . The eye technique first manifested in Hamura Ōtsutsuki , the son of the first known Byakugan user , Kaguya . His descendants , the Hyūga and the Ōtsutsuki clans both inherit only Byakugan , but by combining the two bloodlines their Byakugan will evolve into Tenseigan ( similar to the Senju and Uchiha clans combination required to obtain Rinnegan ) . It is characterized by a blue pupil surrounded by a blue and white flower @-@ like iris . The Tenseigan allows the user to control both attractive and repulsive forces , similar to the Rinnegan . Additionally , it also grants the wielder Tenseigan Chakra Mode , which in turn gives the user an increase in speed , power , strength , durability , and reflexes . It also grants its user Truth @-@ Seeking Balls , thus granting the user all five nature transformations and Yin – Yang Style . 
 The second concept is a huge energy vessel hidden in the world inside the Moon and protected by the Ōtsutsuki clan . It is a yellow sun @-@ like object with a double @-@ layered hexagonal pupil surrounded by orange flower @-@ like iris . The center of the core also contains Hamura 's Tenseigan . The object is stored within a spherical case attached to Hamura 's shrine . It can only be touched by someone who possesses " the undiluted chakra of Hamura " . The vessel is a highly powerful object as it supports the life of the hollow world by providing the artificial sun . It was also used in warfare by the feuding main and branch families of the <unk> clan . However , to support the vessel , all Ōtsutsuki clan members have to give up and combine their Byakugan within the vessel . This includes <unk> , the last surviving member of the clan . 
 = = = Sharingan = = = 
 The Sharingan ( <unk> , lit . " Copy Wheel Eye " , English manga : " Mirror Wheel Eye " ) is a genetic attribute within the Uchiha Clan that is descended from Rinne Sharingan , an ancient dojutsu possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki ; the Sharingan retains its red iris and sclera as well as three of its tomoe . The Sharingan first manifests in Kaguya 's grandson , Indra , who became the founding ancestor of the Uchiha Clan . It is not immediately present from birth , and first activates when the user experiences a strong sensation of despair that causes a special chakra to be released from the brain and alter the user 's eyes . Because of the psychological effects it can have in obtaining it and evolving it , many have referred to the Sharingan as the " Curse of Hatred " , including the Second Hokage . After awakening the Sharingan , the user may use it freely . When first acquired , the Sharingan may have one or two tomoe , acquiring more tomoe until it fully matures , having three tomoe in each eye . It is possible for the user to have a different number of tomoe in each eye . Kakashi Hatake possessed a single , transplanted Sharingan in his left eye that he received from his teammate , Obito Uchiha . Because he is not a member of the Uchiha clan , Kakashi 's Sharingan is always active and he expends chakra rapidly when using it , forcing him to withdraw in combat or sacrifice his life energy and needing extended rest after long battles . Members of the Uchiha clan expend a mild amount of chakra when using the Sharingan ; Akatsuki member Itachi Uchiha keeps his Sharingan activated constantly . Danzo Shimura has also been shown to have a transplanted Sharingan in his right eye , taken from Shisui Uchiha , and ten more in his right arm , obtained from Orochimaru 's experimentation on Shin Uchiha . Sasuke Uchiha is also frequently shown using his Sharingan , only retracting it when exhausted . 
 Over the course of its development , the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities : The first being its famous ability for the user to instantly memorize and replicate any opponent 's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy . The Sharingan 's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception , allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of fast @-@ moving objects . This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra ( see chakra in different colors ) . Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent , acting as an effective way to produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person . 
 Those who possess the Sharingan also have access to two of the most powerful genjutsu , Izanagi ( <unk> ) and Izanami ( <unk> ) . Both techniques work in reverse : Izanagi allows the user to " alter destiny " ; they may turn moments inflicted on them ( such as injury or death blow ) into mere illusions , though only for several seconds , while Izanami is used to " determine destiny " ; it traps the target in reliving a moment in an infinite loop until accepting the truth or remain still and eventually die . However , both techniques are labeled as forbidden jutsu , as they will permanently close the user 's Sharingan eye . Danzō Shimura implanted numerous Sharingan eyes onto his right arm , allowing him to use Izanagi more than once , with one of the eyes being sealed per use , through Shisui Uchiha 's Mangekyō Sharingan . However , Obito Uchiha claimed that the Izanagi jutsu is " perfected " and more effective when a person has both the Sharingan and the Senju 's power , meanwhile labeling Danzō 's Izanagi as " imperfect " , as he lacks complete control over Hashirama 's cells . 
 Due to the massacre of the Uchiha clan , at the start of the series , there are only four living people who possess the Sharingan : Sasuke Uchiha ; his brother , Itachi ; Obito Uchiha ; and Kakashi Hatake . Itachi had died prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War , in which Obito meets his demise while Kakashi has his Sharingan taken out in exchange for his normal eye . Years after the Great Ninja War , it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru 's test subjects who has a unique ability of accepting tissue and organ transplantation , Shin Uchiha , came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan , the surviving ones of whom are taken care of in Konoha 's orphanage . Additionally , Sasuke 's daughter , Sarada , also eventually awakens her own Sharingan . 
 = = = = Mangekyō Sharingan = = = = 
 The Mangekyō Sharingan ( <unk> , Mangekyō Sharingan , lit . " Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye " ) is a heightened form of Sharingan introduced towards the end of Part I. At that time , the Mangekyō Sharingan is explained to be rare , even among the members of the Uchiha clan , and present only in those who have killed the person closest to them , be it their best friends , relatives , or significant others , either accidentally or intentionally . While Madara Uchiha is stated to be the first person to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan , which resulted in a common tradition for members of the Uchiha clan to follow his example by killing their friends , an ability of the Mangekyō ( Susanoo ) had been used since the time of the first Sharingan user , Indra . Also when one of the eyes from the same <unk> awakens the Mangekyō , the other eye awakens the Mangekyō too , causing Obito to awaken it , even if the one who killed his best friend was Kakashi , who has his other eye . As explained late to the Part II , the event is the end result of the " Curse of Hatred " , in which the brain releases special chakra to the eyes so much that the Sharingan eventually transforms into Mangekyō Sharingan . At the cost of increased power , the Uchiha clan members who possess the Mangekyō Sharingan will start to lose their sanity , eventually descending to complete madness as they gain more power . 
 Unlike the regular Sharingan , which appears identical from user to user , the Mangekyō Sharingan 's tomoe seal differs between individuals . Its abilities were usually derived from the Japanese mythology , hence giving the interpretation that they are one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used . Also , the Mangekyō seems to grant different kind of abilities to each of its users , though some might share the same jutsu , as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu , while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo . Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu . When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes , regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have , the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo . Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and <unk> ( <unk> ) , awakened in Shisui 's Mangekyō Sharingan , which granted him the ability to control other people 's minds without them knowing . 
 Once it has been gained , the Uchiha user suffers from ever @-@ deteriorating eyesight , a process that is aggravated by repeated use and culminates in blindness . One 's eyesight can be permanently restored by taking and transplanting the eyes of another Uchiha clan member , a process that results in the creation of an " Eternal " Mangekyō Sharingan ( <unk> , Eien no Mangekyō Sharingan ) . The tighter the blood ties are between the " donor " and the receiver , the better it is for compatibility , siblings for example . Not only does this process permanently restore one 's eyesight , with the exception of using Izanagi or Izanami , but it also gives the person even greater power . The Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan also seems to change form from the original , with what appears to be a fusion of the current owner 's Mangekyo with the previous owner 's . Madara was the first Uchiha to awaken the Eternal Mangekyō by taking his younger brother 's , Izuna , eyes to regain his sight , which gave him great power . After suffering from onset near @-@ total blindness from overuse of his ocular powers , Sasuke underwent the process himself with Itachi 's eyes , granting him all of Itachi 's ocular powers in addition to his own . However , the side effects of using the Mangekyō might not be applicable to all users , as Obito has been shown to use his Kamui ability nearly all the time and does not become exhausted or suffer from deteriorating eyesight from doing so . Mangekyō Sharingan can also evolve further to become Rinnegan , as in the case of Madara . However , he only managed to achieve that because he was the current reincarnation of one of the Sage of the Six Paths ' son , Indra , and had injected himself with the DNA of Hashirama ( the reincarnation of the Sage 's other son , Asura ) , which would grant the person with the Sage 's own power . The process also happens only near the end of the user 's natural lifespan . However , Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan unique to him in his left eye after receiving the Sage of the Six Paths ' Yin Chakra . His Rinnegan is a Six @-@ Tomoe variant . He has six tomoe on the first to rings of the Rinnegan . Although he awakened the Rinnegan , Sasuke can still access the powers of his Mangekyō Sharingan e.g. Amaterasu and Susano 'o . He also awakened a Perfect Susano 'o ( Complete Body 一 Susanoo ) that rivals Madara 's . His Susano 'o has wings that enable him to fly . 
 = = = = Tsukuyomi = = = = 
 Tsukuyomi ( <unk> ) is a genjutsu used by those of the Uchiha Clan who gained Mangekyō Sharingan , said to be the " Spiritual World and Darkness " ( <unk> , <unk> to Yami ) in opposition to Amaterasu . As one of the most powerful genjutsu , Tsukuyomi allows the user to trap his target in an illusionary realm where time is controlled by the user of this jutsu . In the case of those like Itachi , Tsukuyomi is used for the purpose of torturing an opponent at a psychological level . Besides added stress on the left eye unless it is an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan , the Tsukuyomi can be negated by an opponent who is a blood relative of the user . 
 A more powerful variant of the Tsukuyomi is the Infinite Tsukuyomi ( <unk> , Mugen Tsukuyomi , lit . Infinite Moon Reader ) , cast on the moon to subjugate every living things caught in its light , which momentarily shines bright enough that night appears to be day . This results with those inflicted to be robbed of their free will while experiencing their deepest desires . However , the Infinite Tsukuyomi can only be cast by someone with the Rinne Sharingan , either someone like Kaguya Ōtsutsuki or a <unk> to her Ten Tails form . People managing to avoid its light are not bound to the jutsu , as are people who are reincarnated with Summoning : Reanimation , as the jutsu only affects living things . During the events of Road to Ninja : Naruto the Movie , using the seven of the nine Tailed Beasts already in his possession , Obito developed a Limited Tsukuyomi ( <unk> , <unk> Tsukuyomi ) that he used on Naruto and Sakura . Unlike the Infinite Tsukuyomi , the Limited Tsukuyomi creates an alternate reality based on the targets ' inner thoughts . 
 = = = = Amaterasu = = = = 
 Amaterasu ( <unk> ) is the highest level of Fire Style jutsu exclusive to Itachi and Sasuke 's Mangekyō Sharingan , said to be the " Material World and Light " ( <unk> , <unk> to Hikari ) . It is the antipode of Tsukuyomi . Amaterasu produces black flames at the focal point of the user 's vision . Once created , it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights . The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal methods ; only the user can put the flames out . Said to be " the fires from hell " and to burn as hot as the sun itself , Amaterasu burns virtually any material , including other flames until nothing but ash remains . However , the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra , as they fail to burn into Naruto 's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara 's chakra @-@ infused <unk> technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person . Beyond mere offence , Amaterasu 's flames can be used as a deterrent , with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks . For more advanced users , they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations . Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user , usually causing their eyes to bleed . For all its lethal potential , Amaterasu burns fairly slowly , allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or , if it is too late for that , remove the burning body parts before it spreads . Other defensive options are pushing the flames away , absorbing them , certain space – time ninjutsu , or being the host of the Ten Tails . 
 = = = = Susanoo = = = = 
 Susanoo ( <unk> ) is the final ability of the Mangekyō Sharingan , also known as the <unk> God of Valor ( <unk> , <unk> no <unk> ) . The ability is gained by awakening the full power of both of the user 's eyes , thus , unlike the other abilities , all Mangekyō Sharingan users have the potential to summon their own Susanoo . By performing this technique , the user constructs a being of chakra , called Susanoo , which provides defense and offense . Susanoo originally appears in a skeletal form before assuming a complete form , and a " final " version . Each one is unique to the summoner with the most striking difference being the color : Itachi 's Susanoo is orange ( red in the anime ) , Sasuke 's and Indra 's are both purple , and Madara 's and Kakashi 's are both blue . Each Susanoo is also different in power ; Sasuke 's incomplete version is easily melted by Mei 's Vapor Style , while Madara 's final version , which is titanic in size , is said to be comparable to a tailed beast in power . The user additionally can infuse their Susanoo with another chakra , including Sage chakra owned by Sasuke , or equip it with " garments " , such as the reflective Yata Mirror ( <unk> , Yata no Kagami ) and the powerful sealing object Sword of Totsuka ( <unk> , Totsuka no <unk> ) , both used by Itachi . 
 = = = = Kamui = = = = 
 Kamui ( <unk> ) is an ability that is exclusive to Obito 's Mangekyo Sharingan , a space @-@ time ninjutsu that allows the user to transfer himself or anything into a pocket dimension . At the time , Obito could only use his right eye for close range while partially transporting himself between spaces to appear " intangible " for minutes . Through Obito 's left eye , Kakashi can create a long @-@ ranged portal that is primarily based on line of sight and can increase in size . As a result , Obito and Kakashi are unable to use Kamui against each other as their attack cancel each other out . Once Obito regained his left eye , his abilities are hasten to the point where he can use his eyes to create two distortions and then connect them to produce a wormhole from one location to another . However , as this ability has nothing to do with his pocket dimension , it places a significant strain on Obito . 
 = = = Rinnegan = = = 
 The Rinnegan ( <unk> , lit . " Saṃsāra Eye " ) is a unique eye technique and the third and most " exalted " of the Three Great Dōjutsu . The <unk> , along with Sharingan , is descended from Rinne Sharingan , retaining its ripple @-@ like pattern but with light purple iris and sclera . The first person to possess the dojutsu was Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki , whose mother , Kaguya , possessed its ancestor , the Rinne Sharingan . In addition to enabling the user to quickly master various jutsu , the user may also use all forms of chakra nature , including the Yin and Yang forms . Similar to Sharingan , the Rinnegan has its own exclusive abilities - the Six Paths ( <unk> , <unk> ) , based on the Desire realm in Buddhist cosmology : the Animal Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) that uses a variety of animal summons such as giant multi @-@ headed dogs ; the Asura Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) with access to an arsenal of weapons ; the Human Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) which enables reading mind and ripping souls ; the chakra absorbing Preta Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) ( this path can take chakra from ninjutsu , making Rinnegan users technically immune to them ) ; and the Naraka Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) that can summon the King of Hell ( <unk> , <unk> no Ō ) . 
 The sixth aspect of the Six Paths , the Deva Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) , provides five known abilities based on gravitation . The first is Almighty Push ( <unk> , Shinra Tensei , lit . " Heavenly Subjugation of the <unk> God " ) , which uses the user 's body as the epicenter of gravity and pushes away any technique of any force through gravity manipulation , though it has a five @-@ second limit after each use . It can be used for a large @-@ scale effect by placing a titanic gravity over a large area and blowing them ; in this case it can be used to destroy an entire village - at the cost of shortening the user 's lifespan and being unable to use it for several minutes . The second is Universal Pull ( <unk> , <unk> Ten 'in , lit . " Heavenly Attraction of All Creation " ) , a companion of Almighty Push and also manipulates gravity , but instead of pushing force , it pulls all things towards a center point . It also has the same five second limit , though it is unknown whether it can be used for a large @-@ scale effect . The third ability is Planetary Devastation ( <unk> , <unk> Tensei , lit . " Heavenly Body Bursts from the Earth " ) , which musters a large amount of user 's chakra to release a small black orb of energy with intense gravitational pull , enough to uproot trees and destroy mountains , that compacts any thing caught in its pull into an extraterrestrial body that serves to encase whoever is trapped within it . Hagoromo used this technique to seal the Gedo Statue with the moon created as a result . The fourth ability is Shattered Heaven ( <unk> , <unk> Shinsei , lit . " Heavenly Obstacle Quaking Star " ) , which pulls down double meteors to the Earth . The fifth ability is Limbo : <unk> ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , lit . " Wheel Grave : Limbo " ) , which sends as many as five shadowed duplicates of the user to an invisible world known as the Limbo ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Wheel Grave " ) . The shadow can attack in accordance with the user , capable of blowing all nine Tailed Beasts at once . It is normally undetectable by people without Rinnegan , however , Naruto is able to sense its presence after receiving some of Hagoromo 's power . Despite being invisible , the shadows can be bound , and if they expire , all damage they sustained are transferred to their user . 
 In conjunction to Six Paths , a Rinnegan gives its user access to a special path called the Outer Path ( <unk> , <unk> ) , which allows the user to control the aspect of life and death . Nagato used this Path to devise a means to animate six corpses , each with a sixth of his full power , that he can control them through first @-@ person view . The user can also use special chakra chains which can bind even Tailed Beasts . Lastly , the user may perform a technique called Outer Path : Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> : Rinne Tensei no Jutsu ) to fully resurrect the dead by offering their own lives . The Sage of the Six Paths possesses a unique technique not used by anyone else called the Creation of All Things ( <unk> , <unk> Sōzō ) which manipulates the Yin chakra to create physical forms out of nothingness , then bestows it with life force through the Yang chakra . 
 Due to the fact that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare , the Rinnegan has been regarded as some sort of legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it . However , the reincarnations of Hagoromo 's sons , Indra and Asura , can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations , as in the case of Madara ( Indra 's reincarnation ) , who obtained the DNA of Hashirama ( Asura 's reincarnation ) , although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan . This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra 's descendants to reconsider the act . The Rinnegan is shown to be <unk> , as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato , and Obito takes up Madara 's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan . After meeting with Hagoromo , Sasuke , who is the current reincarnation of Indra , awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye , which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern , making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance . His Rinnegan allows him to perform <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " Heavenly Hand Power " ) , which can shift himself , others , and objects a set distance away from his original location . He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space . Due to its speed , this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range . While there is no prerequisite for using the technique , it does have a recharging period after each use . Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his <unk> of its power for an extended period of time .

 The Rinne Sharingan ( <unk> , lit . " Saṃsāra Copy Wheel Eye " ) is a kekkei mōra dojutsu exclusive to Kaguya and the Ten Tails . As the Rinnegan and Sharingan originated from it , possessing the abilities that both eyes possess , the Rinne Sharingan resembles a red Rinnegan with nine tomoe in the irides . The Rinne <unk> first manifested through Kaguya Ōtsutsuki after eating the Shinju 's fruit , which in turn is present in her Ten Tails incarnation and those who become Jinchuriki of the Ten Tails . Besides the Infinite Tsukuyomi , the user of a Rinne Sharingan can use <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " Heavenly Governing Inside " ) to instantly teleport the user and anyone within a certain range to different dimensions . Those affected by it are caught completely off guard , as there seems to be no warning prior to its usage and have found themselves plunging into a river of lava and abruptly being encased within a block of ice . Having been sent to a different dimension , the presence of their chakra is completely erased in the normal world and cannot be sensed through traditional means . It has been compared to the creation of genjutsu due to the ability to instantly rewrite all aspects of the dimension ; however , it is noted to be very chakra taxing . There is also the <unk> Hirasaka ( <unk> , lit . " Underworld Comparing Skilled Hill " ) , a technique that allows the user to teleport themselves instantly through a dark portal , either partially or completely .

 The Summoning Jutsu ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu ) allows a ninja to summon anything to their side . One common use for Summoning <unk> are calling in creatures to fight by the summoner 's side . Before such a summon can be performed , a ninja must first sign a contract with the creature in their own blood . Even after that they need only perform the proper hand @-@ seals and press their hand to the ground , offering an additional donation of blood while providing an appropriate amount of chakra to bring the creature to their location . The Summoning Jutsu has been used by a number of different characters during the series , each of whom summons a different type of creature : The most common summons being the toads of Mount <unk> and snakes . Other summons include tortoises , hawks , dogs , slugs , puppets , and various other creatures . But as seen in Part II , the Summoning Jutsu can work both ways with a creature bringing its summoner to its location .

 Shonen Jump has featured several popularity polls for jutsu in the series . In every official poll , Rasengan has ranked first , and Chidori has ranked second . These results were reversed in a similar poll in the first Naruto <unk> , in which Chidori was ranked first , and Rasengan second . In a top ten list of jutsu compiled by IGN 's Ramsey Isler , Rasengan was ranked first , and Chidori second . Several pieces of merchandise have been released featuring Naruto characters performing jutsu , including action figures and clothing . 
 Several publications for anime and manga have commented on the use of jutsu in the series . IGN called jutsu " one of the most entertaining parts of the Naruto franchise " , and noted that " the complicated but impressive @-@ looking hand gestures , the unique physical attributes , and the pure unadulterated destructive power of the ninjutsu are some of the things that make the series wildly popular " . T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews claimed that it was in " fight / action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades " , and praised the " invigorating and unique fighting styles / techniques [ that ] manage to continuously infuse action sets with life " . However , it criticized the " <unk> of certain special techniques " such as Naruto Uzumaki 's Shadow Clone Technique , noting that the fights became " bland and repetitive " over time . Anime News Network ( ANN ) considered the structure of battles " repetitive to a fault — a series of competing power @-@ ups followed by an elegiac coda " , but mollified by the series ' " winning formula : the villains are vile , the heroes sympathetic , and the stakes high " . 
 In a review of the eighth through tenth volumes of the manga , ANN lambasted the fact the fights were frequently " interrupted by long @-@ winded ( and sometimes redundant ) explanations of strategies and special techniques " , but praised the visual presentation of the fights , noting that " the fights are staged with a clear eye for geography , movement and the human form , and are bursting with so much visual energy that not even the flashbacks and tedious explanations can dampen them " . For the visuals in the anime , ANN made note of the fight between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha in episodes 132 – 134 , noting the " impressiveness of the Sasuke fight 's visuals " , in which " Naruto clones explode from a lake like ninja @-@ shaped surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles and glowing energy limbs ambush enemies from underground and cling to rock faces like neon prehensile tails " . Although ANN praised the animators who " put all the love they could into the fight " , it criticized the slow plot pacing that led up to the fight , and the fight 's tedious structure .

 Chris Carter ( born October 13 , 1957 ) is an American television and film producer , director and writer . Born in Bellflower , California , Carter graduated with a degree in journalism from California State University , Long Beach before spending thirteen years working for Surfing Magazine . After beginning his television career working on television films for Walt Disney Studios , Carter rose to fame in the early 1990s after creating the science fiction @-@ supernatural television series The X @-@ Files for the Fox network . The X @-@ Files earned high viewership ratings , and led to Carter 's being able to negotiate the creation of future series . 
 Carter went on to create three more series for the network — Millennium , a doomsday @-@ themed series which met with critical approval and low viewer numbers ; Harsh Realm , which was canceled after three episodes had aired ; and The Lone Gunmen , a spin @-@ off of The X @-@ Files which lasted for a single season . Carter 's film roles include writing both of The X @-@ Files ' cinematic spin @-@ offs — 1998 's successful The X @-@ Files and the poorly received 2008 follow @-@ up The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe , the latter of which he also directed — while his television credits have earned him several accolades including eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations . The Amazon Studios television series The After was his most recent series .

 Chris Carter was born on October 13 , 1957 in Bellflower , California . His father worked in the construction industry . Carter has described his childhood as " fairly normal " , and was fond of both Little League Baseball and surfing ; his surfing stance is goofy footed . He attended California State University , Long Beach in Long Beach , graduated with a journalism degree in 1979 . An avid surfer , he began writing for Surfing Magazine , a San Clemente @-@ based journal , eventually becoming its editor at the age of 28 . Carter would work for the magazine for thirteen years , and credits his tenure there for teaching him how to run a business . It was also at this time that Carter began taking an interest in pottery , making " hundreds of thousands of pieces " of dinnerware as a hobby . He has compared the process of making pottery to Zen meditations , although he has since thrown out most of his work .

 = = = Starting in television = = = 
 In 1983 , Carter began dating Dori Pierson , whom he had met through a cousin of hers who worked with him at Surfing Magazine . Pierson 's connections at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter on a standard contract . Carter began writing television films for the studio , penning The <unk> Patrol in 1986 and Meet the <unk> in 1988 . These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio , and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead . 
 Carter met the then @-@ president of NBC , Brandon Tartikoff , at a company softball game in Brentwood , California . Tartikoff and Carter began talking between innings , and when Tartikoff eventually read some of Carter 's script work , he brought him over to write for the network . There , Carter developed a number of unproduced television pilots — Cameo By Night , featuring Sela Ward ; Brand New Life , which has been described as being similar to The Brady Bunch ; Copter Cop , a science fiction series that was hampered by Tartikoff 's injuries after a car accident ; and Cool Culture , influenced by Carter 's passion for surfing and experience with Surfing Magazine . During this time Carter would also work as a producer on Rags to Riches , a job he accepted in order to learn more about producing a series . 
 Peter Roth , at that time the president of Stephen J. Cannell Productions , obtained a copy of Carter 's pilot script for Cool Culture , and although the series was never picked up , Roth was interested in hiring Carter to work on the CBS series Palace Guard . However , Roth would soon leave CBS to work for Fox as the head of its television production wing . Carter was among the first wave of new staff hired by Roth in 1992 to develop material for the network , and he began work on a series based on his own childhood fondness for The Twilight Zone and Kolchak : The Night Stalker . 
 = = = The X @-@ Files and success = = = 
 Carter 's new series would take its stylistic inspiration from Kolchak , while thematically reflecting his experiences growing up during the Watergate scandal . Carter also drew inspiration from his friend John E. Mack 's survey of American beliefs in ufology , which indicated that three percent of the population believed they had been abducted by aliens . Roth warmed to the idea upon hearing of the influence of Kolchak , believing that vampires — one of the central antagonists of the original series — would be popular with audiences given the interest being shown in the upcoming film Interview with the Vampire : The Vampire Chronicles , although Carter insisted on an extraterrestrial @-@ focused series . However , Carter had never been interested in science fiction before this point , professing to have briefly read one novel each by Ursula K. Le Guin and Robert A. Heinlein . Basing his characters instead on those found in the English television series The Avengers , Carter took an eighteen @-@ page treatment for his new project — by now titled The X @-@ Files — to a pitch meeting at Fox , where it was soon rejected . With the help of Roth , Carter was able to arrange a second pitch meeting , at which the network reluctantly agreed to greenlight a pilot for the series . 
 After finding the series ' two starring leads in Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny , Carter was given a budget of $ 2 million to produce a pilot episode . The series aired on Friday nights on the Fox network , being broadcast in tandem with The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr. in what was perceived to be an unpopular timeslot . The series earned relatively impressive Nielsen ratings for its Friday timeslot , and was given a full twenty @-@ four episode order . The series ' popularity and critical acclaim built over the course of its second and third seasons , and saw it earning its first Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and breaking the record for highest price paid by a network for rights to air re @-@ runs , fetching $ 600 @,@ 000 per episode from Fox 's sister network FX . After Carter 's initial three @-@ year signing for Fox had ended , the success of the series allowed him to negotiate a five @-@ year contract with several additional perks , including the guarantee of a feature film adaptation to be produced by the parent company 's film studio , and the greenlighting of Carter 's next television project . In March 2015 , it was confirmed that Carter is set to executive produce and write the screenplays for the revival of The X @-@ Files , which is set for a six @-@ episode event series . 
 = = = Millennium = = = 
 Carter began work on a new series , Millennium . The genesis of this new project stemmed from " Irresistible " , a second @-@ season episode of The X @-@ Files which Carter had written , which focused on a sexually motivated serial killer with none of that series ' usual supernatural trappings . Carter fleshed out the basis of the new show 's protagonist , Frank Black , and travelled to Seattle for inspiration for a new setting . Influence was also drawn from the works of Nostradamus , and the increasing popular interest in eschatology ahead of the coming millennium . The central role of Black was eventually filled by Lance Henriksen , and the series began airing in the Friday timeslot formerly occupied by The X @-@ Files . " Pilot " , the début episode , was heavily promoted by Fox , and brought in over a quarter of the total audience during its broadcast . 
 The series also attracted a high degree of critical appraisal , earning a People 's Choice Award for " Favorite New TV Dramatic Series " in its first year . At the beginning of the second season , Carter handed over control of the series to Glen Morgan and James Wong , with whom he had previously worked on both Millennium 's first season and several seasons of The X @-@ Files . Despite its promising start , however , ratings for Millennium after the pilot remained consistently low , and it was cancelled after three seasons .

 During the production of the fourth season of The X @-@ Files , work on the first feature film adaptation of the series began . Also titled The X @-@ Files , Carter initially began a treatment for the script over Christmas holidays in Hawaii in 1996 . Series producer Frank Spotnitz collaborated on the story outline at this time . Carter would later return to Hawaii for a ten @-@ day stint in 1997 to begin fleshing out the finished script . Carter appointed frequent series director Rob Bowman as director of the film , which went on to feature many of the series ' regular cast , including Duchovny , Anderson , Mitch Pileggi and William B.

 The X @-@ Files premiered on June 19 , 1998 , eventually making a worldwide gross of $ 189 @,@ 176 @,@ 423 .

 Ten years after the success of the first film , and six years after The X @-@ Files final season had finished , Carter would both write and direct a second feature film , titled The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe . Filmed in British Columbia , I Want To Believe was released on July 25 , 2008 ; eventually grossing $ 68 @,@ 369 @,@ 434 worldwide .

 In 1999 , Carter began adapting the comic book series Harsh Realm as a television show , also titled Harsh Realm . Carter 's friend and frequent collaborator Daniel Sackheim had optioned the comics for adaptation in 1996 . However , when the series first aired on October 8 , 1999 , the comics ' writers Andrew Paquette and James Hudnall were given no writing credits for the work ; the two then filed suit against Fox to be credited for their work . Harsh Realm received disappointing viewing figures , and was cancelled after only three episodes had been broadcast . 
 Two years later , Carter launched a spin @-@ off of The X @-@ Files titled The Lone Gunmen , a series centred on three minor characters from the former series .

 = Louise Lehzen = 
 Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen ( 3 October 1784 – 9 September 1870 ) , better known as Baroness Louise Lehzen , was the governess , and later adviser and companion to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom . 
 Born to a Lutheran pastor in Hanover , in 1819 Lehzen entered into the household of the Duchess of Kent and her husband Prince Edward Augustus , Duke of Kent and Strathearn . Five years later , Lehzen became governess to their only child , Princess Victoria . Lehzen became strongly protective of the princess , who resided in a household dominated by the controlling Kensington System , implemented by the Duchess and her comptroller Sir John Conroy . " Dear , good Lehzen " soon came to supersede all others in Victoria 's eyes , including her own mother . 
 Victoria became second @-@ in @-@ line to the British throne in 1827 ; to prevent Victoria from being surrounded by commoners , King George IV named Lehzen a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover later that year . Lehzen encouraged the princess to become strong , informed , and independent from the Duchess and Conroy 's influence , causing friction between the two and Lehzen . Attempts to remove the governess , who had the support of George IV , his brother William IV , and Victoria 's uncle Leopold I of Belgium , were unsuccessful . 
 When Victoria became queen in 1837 , Lehzen served as a sort of unofficial private secretary , enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria . The queen 's 1840 marriage to Prince Albert led to significant changes in the royal household . Albert and Lehzen detested each other , and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841 , Lehzen was quietly dismissed . Her close relationship to the queen came to an end , though the two continued to write letters to each other . Lehzen spent her last years in Hanover on a generous pension , dying in 1870 . Historian <unk> Reynolds writes that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria 's character , in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen was born in Hanover on 3 October 1784 , the youngest of seven daughters and two sons of Lutheran pastor Joachim Friedrich Lehzen and his wife Melusine Palm . Forced by circumstances to work for her living since she was young , Lehzen was employed by the von <unk> , an aristocratic German family , where she earned glowing references . 
 Based on these references , Lehzen became part of the household of Princess Victoria of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld in December 1819 , when she served as governess to twelve @-@ year @-@ old Princess Feodora of Leiningen , the daughter of the princess by her first husband , the Prince of Leiningen . Princess Victoria was married to the Prince Edward Augustus , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , who was , at the time , fourth in line for the British throne . Lehzen and the entire household were moved to England in 1817 so that the new Duchess of Kent 's child might be born there , strengthening the child 's claim to the throne . The baby was a girl , christened " Alexandrina Victoria " after her mother and her godfather , Alexander I of Russia ; she would grow up to be Queen Victoria . 
 = = Tutor to Princess Victoria = = 
 The Duke of Kent died quite suddenly in 1820 , followed quickly by his father , King George III . Victoria 's uncle , the Prince Regent , ascended the throne as George IV . Victoria was now third in line for the crown , after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence , both of whom were well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs . As the likely eventual heiress , Victoria had to be educated accordingly . Feodora was now 14 , and no longer required the services of a governess . After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock , Lehzen – as she was always known in the household – took over five @-@ year @-@ old Victoria 's care in 1824 . The Duchess and her comptroller , John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German ( rather than English ) , but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independent of their wishes . 
 Twentieth century historian Christopher Hibbert describes Lehzen as " a handsome woman , despite her pointed nose and chin , clever , emotional , humourless . " At first fearing Lehzen 's stern manner , " dear , good Lehzen " soon came to occupy a place in Victoria 's heart that superseded all others , including her own mother , the Duchess of Kent . Lehzen encouraged the princess to distrust her mother and her mother 's friends , and to maintain her independence . The governess was uninterested in money and lacked ambition for herself , instead choosing to devote her time and energy to the princess . Victoria took to calling Lehzen " Mother " and " dearest Daisy " in private , writing Lehzen was " the most affectionate , devoted , attached , and disinterested friend I have . " As part of the controlling Kensington System devised by Conroy , after 1824 Victoria was to be accompanied by Lehzen at all times during the day ; consequently Lehzen was not allowed out to leave Victoria 's side until the Duchess dismissed her at nighttime , and was required to hold the princess ' hand when Victoria descended a staircase . 
 = = = Baroness Lehzen = = = 
 In 1827 , the Duke of York died , making the Duke of Clarence heir presumptive , and Victoria second @-@ in @-@ line to the throne . Conroy complained that the princess should not be surrounded with commoners , leading George IV to award them both titles ; Lehzen became a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover . George IV himself died in 1830 , and was duly succeeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence , who became King William IV . William formally recognised Victoria as his heiress @-@ presumptive . According to Lehzen , around this time the famous scene took place , in which Lehzen slipped a copy of the genealogy of the House of Hanover into one of the princess 's lesson books . After perusing it for some time , Victoria came to see that her father had been next in line after the king , and that Queen Adelaide had no surviving children . This was the first time Victoria came to realise the destiny that had been assumed by many since her birth ; that she would be the next British monarch . After a pause , Victoria is reported to have said " I will be good . " This story entered into folk legend for future English generations . 
 King William appointed his friend , the Duchess of Northumberland , as Victoria 's official governess in 1831 , but the role was mostly ceremonial , and the princess continued to depend on Lehzen . The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria 's mother , the Duchess of Kent , for attempting to become more influential in Victoria 's education . During this time , Lehzen held no official position at court ; despite her recently acquired title , her commoner status continued to be a hindrance . 
 = = = Educating Victoria = = = 
 The wish of the Duchess and Conroy to keep Victoria dependent on their will was circumvented by Lehzen , who wanted her charge to become a strong , informed woman . As Victoria grew older , attempts were made by Conroy and the Duchess for Lehzen 's removal , or at least the lessening of her influence . Such tactics proved unsuccessful , as the princess became more devoted to Lehzen than before , as evident in her journals . Lehzen 's only true friend in the household , Baroness Spath , had been suddenly dismissed in 1828 on the orders of Conroy ; rumours abounded that the baroness witnessed " familiarities " between him and the Duchess . Members of George IV 's court speculated that Lehzen would be the next to leave , but she remained silent on the issue and preserved her position . In 1835 , the Duchess of Kent wrote her daughter a stern letter demanding that Victoria develop a more formal and less intimate relationship with Lehzen . The same year ( in which Victoria turned sixteen ) , plans to dismiss Lehzen fell apart after she devotedly nursed Victoria through a five @-@ week illness . Lehzen aided a weakened Victoria in her refusal to sign a document prepared for her by Conroy and the Duchess that would guarantee him a position when she became queen . During her tenure , Lehzen had the support of George IV , William IV , and another of Victoria 's uncles , Leopold I of Belgium , who all believed that she was vital to the princess ' health , happiness , and continued resistance to Conroy 's influence . 
 The education Victoria received from Lehzen was rudimentary but solid . Contrary to the prevailing attitudes of the time , Lehzen , tutor Dr. George Davys , and others successfully encouraged Victoria to enjoy acquiring knowledge . Davys was put in charge of the " solid department of her studies " , while Lehzen concentrated on the " more ornamental departments " , such as dancing . Gaining an " enlightened education " , the princess learned to speak French , German , Latin , and English , liked history and was taught economics , geography , mathematics , politics , art , and music . Lehzen was strict , but rewarded the princess when she was obedient . In another departure from the era , Lehzen employed little to no corporal punishment ; at least , there is no record of it in the household accounts . 
 = = Victoria in power = = 
 When Victoria ascended the throne in 1837 , Lehzen enjoyed a prominent position at the coronation , and remained at court . Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace as a sort of unofficial private secretary , served as chief liaison for the royal residences , and carried the household keys as a sign of her position ; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen 's bills , for instance . At this point , it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria 's mother both in terms of influence and affection ; Lehzen 's apartments adjoined the queen 's , while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria 's . For the first few years of Victoria 's reign , especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha in 1840 , Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen 's outlook on both politics and personal matters , despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs . Even after the queen 's marriage , Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom , a source of displeasure for Albert . 
 = = = <unk> by Prince Albert = = = 
 The coming of Prince Albert led to significant changes in Victoria 's household . Lehzen had opposed Coburg ambitions of Victoria marrying Albert , believing the princess to be a " second Queen Elizabeth , virgin and independent of male influence . " Albert was well @-@ educated , and had just completed a tour of Europe , preceded by years at the University of Bonn . Victoria 's court dismayed his puritan German sensibilities . Lehzen and Albert soon developed a dislike for each other ; she sought to thwart Albert 's will in various ways and he found her personally repugnant and unworthy of befriending the queen , referring to her as " the hag " and a " crazy stupid intriguer " . 
 When Victoria 's first child , Victoria , Princess Royal , was born on 21 November 1840 , Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the arrangements for the nursery staff . Lehzen put the nursery in the hands of a Mrs. Southey , a Mrs. Roberts , and Sir James Clark , despite Albert 's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post , having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously . Eventually , the Princess Royal fell ill , but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment , incorrectly prescribing her with calomel . In fact , the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill . Albert , who was devoted to his first @-@ born , confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness . There was a quarrel , after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands , and be it on her head if the child died . Soon after this argument , Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen , ostensibly for her health . To Albert , Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life , and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone . 
 Reports of the reasons behind Lehzen 's departure varied ; court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving " for her health ( as she says ) , to stay five or six months , but it is supposed never to return . " The Times however reported that she was simply visiting friends in Germany . After her departure , family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair that " it was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting rid of [ Lehzen ] . She was foolish enough to contest his influence , and not to conform herself to the change in her position ... If she had done so , and <unk> the P [ <unk> ] , she might have remained in the Palace to the end of her life . " 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 When Lehzen was dismissed from the court in 1842 she returned to her native Germany , living in Bückeburg near Hanover . She lived with her sister on the generous pension that Victoria sent her , and covered the walls of her house with portraits of the queen . Though her sister died several months later , the baroness continued to support financially her many nieces and nephews . Lehzen continued to regard Victoria with affection , and the queen wrote regularly to her former governess , weekly at first and later monthly at Lehzen 's request . When visiting relations in Germany , the queen came to visit her twice in private . The Baroness Lehzen died in Bückeburg on 9 September 1870 , where she is buried in <unk> cemetery . Queen Victoria ordered the erection of a memorial to her . After Lehzen 's death , Queen Victoria spoke of her gratitude for their relationship , but commented " after I came to the throne she got to be rather trying , and especially so after my marriage ... [ This was not ] from any evil intention , only from a mistaken idea of duty and affection for me . " 
 During her time at the English court , Lehzen attracted attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria . She was criticised for her influence with the queen , particularly from those who disliked German influences at court . Pamphlets , many released by the Tory party , complained of the " stranger harboured in our country " and the " evil counsellors " surrounding Victoria . One in particular , published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen , declared that a " certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora was to be the first victim , " a reference to the Flora Hastings affair . More positive , The Times once described her as having simply " held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign . " As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed , in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been " converted " to the Whig party , and that she had been offered " an urgent proposal of marriage " by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne . Despite all of this criticism , historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal ; even after Victoria ascended the throne , she seems to have made no demands for money or rank , preferring instead to simply be in the queen 's company . Historian <unk> Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria 's character and moral development , in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship . Not all of her influence was positive however ; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria 's unwillingness to lose Lehzen . 
 Baroness Lehzen has been portrayed numerous times in film and television . She was played by Renée <unk> in the 1936 German film <unk> einer Königin , Greta Schröder in the films Victoria the Great and Sixty Glorious Years , Barbara Everest in 1941 's The Prime Minister , Magda Schneider in the 1954 television serial The Story of Vickie , Olga Fabian in an episode of Hallmark Hall of Fame , Patience Collier in Edward the Seventh , Diana Rigg in the 2001 television serial Victoria & Albert , and Jeanette Hain in the 2009 film The Young Victoria .

Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L @-@ 39 Albatros , and as the missile is too far along to be aborted , 007 hijacks the L @-@ 39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed . 
 The media baron Elliot Carver soon begins his plans to use an encoder stolen from the bazaar by his henchman , cyberterrorist Henry Gupta , to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom ; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights . <unk> the GPS signal using the encoder , Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off @-@ course into Chinese @-@ held waters in the South China Sea , where Carver 's stealth ship , commanded by Mr. Stamper , sinks it and steals one of its missiles , while shooting down a Chinese J @-@ 7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshire 's survivors with Chinese weaponry . The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate , and possibly retaliate , while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war . 
 M sends Bond to investigate Carver after he releases news articles about the crisis hours before MI @-@ 6 had learned of it . Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver 's wife , Paris , who is also Bond 's ex @-@ girlfriend , to get information that would help him enter Carver 's newspaper headquarters . He also knocks out three of Stamper 's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network . After Bond steals back the GPS encoder , Carver orders Paris and Bond killed . Paris is murdered by Carver 's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman , but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes , protecting the encoder . Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with , and goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck ( which was actually in Vietnamese waters ) . He and Wai Lin , a Chinese agent on the same case , explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing , but are captured by Stamper and taken to the <unk> tower in Ho Chi Minh City . They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation . 
 The two contact the Royal Navy and the People 's Liberation Army Air Force to explain Carver 's scheme ; Carver plans to use the stolen missile to destroy the Chinese government , and allow a Chinese general to step in and stop war between Britain and China , although not before both sides destroy each other at sea . They find Carver 's stealth ship , which had been built with stolen stealth material , in Ha Long Bay , and board it to prevent him from firing the stolen British cruise missile at Beijing . During the attempt , Wai Lin is captured , forcing Bond to devise a second plan . Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage , but Carver kills Gupta , claiming he has " outlived his contract . " Bond detonates an explosive which damages the ship , causing it to be visible to radar to both Chinese and British navies , who had just been warned of the plot , and thus making it vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack by HMS Bedford . While Wai Lin disables the engines , and is captured by Stamper , Bond attempts to halt the missile . After killing Carver with his own sea drill , Bond attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators , but Stamper appears and attacks him after sending Wai Lin into the waters to drown . Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and dives to save Wai Lin as the missile explodes , destroying the ship and killing Stamper . Later , Bond and Wai Lin share a romantic moment amidst the wreckage as the Bedford searches for them .

 Following the success of GoldenEye in reviving the Bond series , there was pressure to recreate that success in the film 's follow @-@ up production . This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner , billionaire Kirk Kerkorian , both of whom wished for the film 's release to coincide with their public stock offering . Co @-@ producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public 's expectations subsequent to the success of GoldenEye , commenting : " You realize that there 's a huge audience and I guess you don 't want to come out with a film that 's going to somehow disappoint them . " This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli , who had previously been involved with the series ' production since its beginning . The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $ 110 million . The producers were unable to convince Martin Campbell , the director of GoldenEye , to return ; his agent said that " Martin just didn 't want to do two Bond films in a row . " Instead , Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996 . Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 As had been the case with several previous films in the series , an entirely original story was required as there remained no Ian Fleming novels or stories to adapt . The scriptwriting process was finished very late due to lengthy disputes . 
 Initial writers on the project included John Cork , Richard Smith , and novelist Donald E. Westlake . In 1995 Westlake wrote two story treatments in collaboration with Wilson , both of which featured a villain who plans to destroy Hong Kong with explosives on the eve of the city 's July 1997 transfer of sovereignty to China . Director Roger Spottiswoode said that in January 1997 MGM had a script that was also focused on the Hong Kong handover ; however , this plot could not be used for a film opening at the end of the year , so they had to start " almost from scratch at T @-@ minus zero ! " 
 Bruce Feirstein , who had worked on GoldenEye , penned the initial script . Feirstein claimed that his inspiration was his own experience working with journalism , stating that he aimed to " write something that was grounded in a nightmare of reality . " Feirstein 's script was then passed to Spottiswoode who reworked it . He gathered seven Hollywood screenwriters in London to brainstorm , eventually choosing Nicholas Meyer to perform rewrites . The script was also worked on by Dan Petrie , Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein , who retained the sole writing credit , was brought in for a final polish . While many reviewers compared Elliot Carver to Rupert Murdoch , Feirstein based the character on Robert Maxwell . There is a reference to the mogul 's death when M instructs Moneypenny to issue a press release stating that Carver died “ falling overboard on his yacht . " 
 Wilson stated , " We didn 't have a script that was ready to shoot on the first day of filming " , while Pierce Brosnan said , " We had a script that was not functioning in certain areas . " The Daily Mail reported on arguments between Spottiswoode and the producers with the former favouring the Petrie version , but the latter reinstating Feirstein to rewrite it two weeks before filming was due to begin . They also said that Jonathan Pryce and Teri Hatcher were unhappy with their new roles , causing further re @-@ scripting . 
 The title was inspired by the Beatles ' song " Tomorrow Never Knows " . The eventual title came about by accident : one of the potential titles was Tomorrow Never Lies ( referring to the Tomorrow newspaper in the plot ) and this was faxed to MGM . But through an error this became Tomorrow Never Dies , a title which MGM found so attractive that they insisted on using . The title was the first not to have any relation to Fleming 's life or work . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Teri Hatcher was three months pregnant when shooting started , although her publicist stated the pregnancy did not affect the production schedule . Hatcher later regretted playing Paris Carver , saying " It 's such an artificial kind of character to be playing that you don 't get any special satisfaction from it . " Actress Sela Ward auditioned for the role , but lost out , reportedly being told the producers wanted her , but ten years younger . Hatcher was seven years Ward 's junior . According to Brosnan , Monica Bellucci also screen tested for the role but as Brosnan remarked , " the fools said no . " Daphne Deckers , who portrays the PR Lady , also confirms that she saw <unk> the same day she herself auditioned . Bellucci would later go on to play a role in the 24th Bond film , Spectre . 
 The role of Elliot Carver was initially offered to Anthony Hopkins ( who also had been offered a role in GoldenEye ) , but he declined in favor of The Mask of Zorro . 
 Natasha Henstridge was rumoured as cast in the lead Bond Girl role , but eventually , Yeoh was confirmed in that role . Brosnan was impressed , describing her as a " wonderful actress " who was " serious and committed about her work " . She reportedly wanted to perform her own stunts , but was prevented because director Spottiswoode ruled it too dangerous and prohibited by insurance restrictions . 
 When Götz Otto was called in for casting , he was given twenty seconds to introduce himself ; his hair had recently been cropped short for a TV role . Saying , " I 'm big , I 'm bad , and I 'm German " , he did it in five . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Second unit filming began on 18 January 1997 with Vic Armstrong directing ; they filmed the pre @-@ credits sequence at Peyresourde Airport in the French Pyrenees , and moved on to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese . The main unit began filming on 1 April . They were unable to use the Leavesden Film Studios , which they had constructed from an abandoned Rolls @-@ Royce factory for GoldenEye , as George Lucas was using it for Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace , so instead they constructed sound stages in another derelict industrial site nearby . They also used the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios . The scene at the " U.S. Air Base in the South China Sea " where Bond hands over the GPS encoder was actually filmed in the area known as Blue Section at RAF Lakenheath . The sea landing used the vast tank built for Titanic in Rosarito , Baja California , Mexico . The MH @-@ <unk> in the film was from the US Air Force 's <unk> Special Operations Group at RAF Mildenhall . Some scenes were planned to be filmed on location in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , and the production had been granted a visa . This was later rescinded , two months after planning had begun , forcing filming to move to Bangkok , Thailand . Bond spokesman Gordon Arnell claimed the Vietnamese were unhappy with crew and equipment needed for pyrotechnics , with a Vietnamese official saying it was due to " many complicated reasons " . Two locations from previous Bond films were used : Brosnan and Hatcher 's love scene was filmed at Stoke Park , which had been featured in Goldfinger , and the bay where they search for Carver 's stealth boat is Phang Nga Bay , Thailand , previously used for The Man with the Golden Gun . 
 Spottiswoode tried to innovate in the action scenes . Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle , a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created . Another innovation was the remote @-@ controlled car , which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW <unk> to put the steering wheel on the back seat . The car chase sequence with the <unk> took three weeks to film , with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location . A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated , causing a member of the public to call the fire brigade . The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water . 
 During filming , there were reports of disputes on set . The Daily Mail reported that Spottiswoode and Feirstein were no longer on speaking terms and that crew members had threatened to resign , with one saying " All the happiness and teamwork which is the hallmark of Bond has disappeared completely . " This was denied by Brosnan who claimed " It was nothing more than good old creative <unk> @-@ <unk> " , with Spottiswoode saying " It has all been made up ... Nothing important really went wrong . " Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film ; he said the producers asked him , but he was too tired . Apparently , Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day . The matter was quickly resolved though and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason . 
 Tomorrow Never Dies marked the first appearance of the Walther P99 as Bond 's pistol . It replaced the Walther PPK that the character had carried in every Eon Bond film since Dr. No in 1962 , with the exception of Moonraker in which Bond was not seen with a pistol . Walther wanted to debut its new firearm in a Bond film , which had been one of its most visible endorsers . Previously the P5 was introduced in Octopussy . Bond would use the P99 until Daniel Craig reverted to the PPK as 007 in Quantum of Solace in 2008 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Barbara Broccoli chose David Arnold to score Tomorrow Never Dies on a recommendation from prolific James Bond films composer John Barry . Arnold had come to Barry 's attention through his successful cover interpretations in Shaken and Stirred : The David Arnold James Bond Project , which featured major artists performing the former James Bond title songs in new arrangements . Arnold said that his score aimed for " a classic sound but [ with ] a modern approach " , combining techno music with a recognisably Barry @-@ inspired ' classic Bond ' sound – notably Arnold borrowed from Barry 's score for From Russia with Love . The score was done across a period of six months , with Arnold writing music and revising previous pieces as he received edited footage of the film . The music for the indoor car chase sequence was co @-@ written with the band Propellerheads , who had worked with Arnold on Shaken and Stirred . The soundtrack was well received by critics with Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks describing it as " an excellent tribute to the entire series of Bond score " . 
 At first , the theme song was to be written by Arnold himself , with the help of lyricist Don Black and singer @-@ songwriter David McAlmont , who recorded the demo . However , MGM wanted a more popular artist , and invited various singers to write songs before one was picked through a competitive process . There were around twelve submissions , including songs from Swan Lee , Pulp , Saint Etienne , Marc Almond , and Sheryl Crow . Crow 's song was chosen for the main titles . Arnold 's composition , " Surrender " , performed by k.d. lang , was still used for the end titles , and features the same prominent melodic motif as the film 's score . This was the fourth Bond film to have different opening and closing songs . Moby created a remake of The James Bond Theme to be used for the movie . Two different versions of the soundtrack album were released , the first featuring only music from the first half of the film , and the second rectifying this but cutting several tracks , including the songs , to make room for the missing score tracks . Pulp 's effort was re @-@ titled as " Tomorrow Never Lies " and appeared as a b @-@ side on their single " Help The Aged " . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The film had a World Charity Premiere at The Odeon Leicester Square , on 9 December 1997 ; this was followed by an after premiere party at Bedford Square , home of original Ian Fleming publisher , Jonathan Cape . The film went on general release in the UK and Iceland on 12 December and in most other countries during the following week . It opened at number 2 in the US , with $ 25 @,@ 143 @,@ 007 from 2 @,@ 807 cinemas – average of $ 8 @,@ 957 per cinema – behind Titanic , which would become one of the highest @-@ grossing films of its time . Tomorrow Never Dies ultimately achieved a worldwide gross of over $ 330 million , although it did not surpass its predecessor GoldenEye , which grossed almost $ 20 million more . 
 The critical reception of the film was mixed , with the film review collection website Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 58 % rating , and similar site Metacritic rating it at 56 % . In the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four @-@ stars , saying " Tomorrow Never Dies gets the job done , sometimes excitingly , often with style " with the villain " slightly more contemporary and plausible than usual " , bringing " some subtler @-@ than @-@ usual satire into the film " . James Berardinelli described it as " the best Bond film in many years " and said Brosnan " inhabits his character with a suave confidence that is very like Connery 's . " However , in the Los Angeles Times , Kenneth Turan thought a lot of Tomorrow Never Dies had a " stodgy , been @-@ there feeling " , with little change from previous films , and Charles Taylor wrote for Salon.com that the film was " a flat , impersonal affair " . 
 The title song sung by Sheryl Crow was nominated for a Golden Globe for " Best Original Song – Motion Picture " and a Grammy for " Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television " . The film received four nominations for Saturn Awards , with Brosnan winning " Best Actor " . It also won a MPSE Golden Reel Award for " Best Sound Editing – Foreign Feature " and a BMI Film Music Award . 
 The original UK release received various cuts to scenes of violence and martial arts weaponry , and to reduce the impact of sound effects , to receive a more box @-@ office @-@ friendly 12 certificate . Further cuts were made to the video / DVD release to retain this rating . These edits were restored for the Ultimate Edition DVD release in the UK , which was consequently upgraded to a 15 certificate . However , upon the release of the Blu @-@ ray in 2012 , it was rated back down to a 12 uncut .

 Tomorrow Never Dies was the first of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then @-@ current Bond novelist Raymond Benson . Benson 's version is expanded from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film . The novel traces Carver 's background as the son of media mogul Lord <unk> , whom Carver blackmails into suicide , later taking over his business . The novel also attempts to merge Benson 's series with the films , particularly by continuing a middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road approach to John Gardner 's continuity . Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said he had taken a course in Asian languages . Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter , although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency , which is thus exclusive to the literary series . Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by Tomorrow Never Dies , specifically Bond 's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99 . Benson said in an interview that he felt Tomorrow Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote . 
 The film was also adapted into a third @-@ person shooter PlayStation video game , Tomorrow Never Dies . The game was developed by Black Ops and published by Electronic Arts on 16 November 1999 . Game Revolution described it as " really just an empty and shallow game " , and IGN said it was " mediocre " . 
 = Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 = 
 Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a rubble masonry stone arch bridge over Plunketts Creek in Plunketts Creek Township , Lycoming County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania . It was built between 1840 and 1875 , probably closer to 1840 , when the road along the creek between the unincorporated villages of Barbours and Proctor was constructed . Going upstream from the mouth , the bridge was the third to cross the creek , hence its name . 
 The bridge was 75 feet ( 23 m ) long , with an arch that spanned 44 feet ( 13 m ) , a deck 18 feet 8 inches ( 5 @.@ 69 m ) wide , and a roadway width of 15 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 65 m ) . It carried a single lane of traffic . In the 19th century , the bridge and its road were used by the lumber , leather , and coal industries active along the creek . By the early 20th century , these industries had almost entirely left , and the villages declined . The area the bridge served reverted mostly to second growth forest and it was used to access Pennsylvania State Game Lands and a state pheasant farm . 
 Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was considered " significant as an intact example of mid @-@ 19th century stone arch bridge construction " , and was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) on June 22 , 1988 . Although it was repaired after a major flood in 1918 , a record flood on January 21 , 1996 , severely damaged the bridge , and it was demolished in March 1996 . Before the 1996 flood about 450 vehicles crossed it each day . Later that year , a replacement bridge was built and the old stone structure was documented by the Historic American Engineering Record . It was removed from the NRHP on July 22 , 2002 .

 = = = Early inhabitants and name = = = 
 Plunketts Creek is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin , the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Susquehannocks . Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois , and by 1675 they had died out , moved away , or been assimilated into other tribes . The West Branch Susquehanna River valley was subsequently under the nominal control of the Iroquois , who invited displaced tribes , including the Lenape ( Delaware ) and Shawnee to live in the lands vacated by the Susquehannocks . The French and Indian War ( 1754 – 1763 ) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin . On November 5 , 1768 , the British acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix , including what is now Plunketts Creek . The first settlement along the creek by European colonists took place between 1770 and 1776 . 
 Plunketts Creek is named for Colonel William Plunkett , a physician , who was the first president judge of Northumberland County after it was formed in 1772 . During conflicts with Native Americans , he treated wounded settlers and fought the natives . Plunkett led a Pennsylvania expedition in the Pennamite @-@ Yankee War to forcibly remove settlers from Connecticut , who had claimed and settled on lands in the Wyoming Valley also claimed by Pennsylvania . For his services , Plunkett was granted six tracts of land that totaled 1 @,@ 978 acres ( 800 ha ) on November 14 , 1776 , although the land was not actually surveyed until September 1783 . Plunkett 's land included the creek 's mouth , so Plunketts Creek was given his name . He died in 1791 , aged about 100 , and was buried in Northumberland without a grave marker or monument ( except for the creek that bears his name ) . 
 Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795 . When Plunketts Creek Township was formed in Lycoming County in 1838 , the original name proposed was " Plunkett Township " , but Plunkett 's lack of active support for the American Revolution some years earlier had led some to believe his loyalty lay with the British Empire . The lingering suspicion of his loyalist sympathies led to the proposed name being rejected . Naming the township for the creek rather than its namesake was seen as an acceptable compromise . 
 = = = Villages and road = = = 
 In 1832 , John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek . This developed into the village of Barbours Mills , today known as Barbours . In the 19th century , Barbours had several blacksmiths , a temperance hotel , post office , many sawmills , a school , store and wagon maker . In 1840 , a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek , crossing it several times . This is the earliest possible date for construction of the bridge , but the surviving county road docket on the construction mentions neither bridges nor fords for crossing the creek . 
 The bridge is at the mouth of Coal Mine Hollow , and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal industries that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861 , and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills , a shingle mill , a woolen factory , and a tannery . By the latter half of the 19th century , these industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township . 
 In 1868 the village of Proctorville was founded as a company town for Thomas E. Proctor 's tannery , which was completed in 1873 . Proctor , as it is now known , is 1 @.@ 66 miles ( 2 @.@ 67 km ) north of Barbours along Plunketts Creek , and the main road to it crossed the bridge . The bark from eastern hemlock trees was used in the tanning process , and the village originally sat in the midst of vast forests of hemlock . The tannery employed " several hundred " workers at wages between 50 cents and $ 1 @.@ 75 a day . These employees lived in 120 company houses , which each cost $ 2 a month to rent . In 1892 , Proctor had a barber shop , two blacksmiths , cigar stand , Independent Order of Odd Fellows hall , leather shop , news stand , a post office ( established in 1885 ) , a two @-@ room school , two stores , and a wagon shop . 
 The road between Barbours and Proctor crosses Plunketts Creek four times and the four bridges are numbered in order , starting from the southernmost in Barbours near the mouth and going upstream . While evidence such as maps indicates that the third bridge was constructed close to 1840 , the first definitive proof of its existence is a survey to relocate the road between the second and third bridges in 1875 . The first bridge over Plunketts Creek was replaced with a covered bridge in 1880 , and the second bridge was replaced in 1886 . That same year , the road between the second and third bridges was moved again , returning to its original position on the west side of the creek . 
 Finished sole leather was hauled over the bridge by horse @-@ drawn wagon south about 8 miles ( 13 km ) to Little Bear Creek , where it was exchanged for " green " hides and other supplies brought north from Montoursville . These were then hauled north across the bridge into Proctor . The hides , which were tanned to make leather , came from the United States , and as far away as Mexico , Argentina , and China . Hemlock bark , used in the tanning process , was hauled to the tannery from up to 8 miles ( 13 km ) away in both summer and winter , using wagons and sleds . The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out . By 1898 , the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery , then owned by the Elk Tanning Company , was closed and dismantled . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Small @-@ scale lumbering continued in the watershed in the 20th century , but the last logs were floated under the bridge down Plunketts Creek to Loyalsock Creek in 1905 . In 1918 , a flood on the creek damaged the road for 100 feet ( 30 m ) on both sides of the bridge , and caused " settling and cracking of the bridge itself " . The bridge had needed repairs and reconstruction . In 1931 , the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed legislation that gave the state responsibility for the costs of road and bridge maintenance for many highways belonging to local municipalities . This took effect in 1932 , relieving Plunketts Creek Township and Lycoming County of the responsibility . 
 Without timber and the tannery , the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined , as did traffic on the road and bridges between them . The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1 , 1953 . Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses . Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968 , and a 1970 newspaper article on its 39th annual " Proctor Homecoming " reunion called it a " near @-@ deserted old tannery town " . In the 1980s , the last store in Barbours closed , and the former hotel ( which had become a hunting club ) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek . 
 Plunketts Creek has been a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded , and as industry declined , nature recovered . Second growth forests have since covered most of the clear @-@ cut land . Pennsylvania 's state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned and clear @-@ cut land for Pennsylvania State Game Lands in 1919 , and the Pennsylvania Game Commission ( PGC ) acquired property along Plunketts Creek for State Game Lands Number 134 between 1937 and 1945 . The main entrance to State Game Lands 134 is just north of the bridge site , on the east side of the creek . 
 The PGC established the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 on part of State Game Lands 134 to raise wild turkey . The farm was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981 , and , as of 2007 , it was one of four Pennsylvania state game farms that produced about 200 @,@ 000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting . The Northcentral State Game Farm is chiefly in the Plunketts Creek valley , just south of Proctor and north of the bridge . The opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village of Barbours at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year . 
 On June 22 , 1988 , the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) , as part of the Multiple Property Submission ( MPS ) of Highway Bridges Owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , Department of Transportation , TR . The MPS included 135 bridges owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ( PennDOT ) , 58 of which were of the stone arch type . While the individual NRHP form for the bridge cites a 1932 inspection report ( the year that the state took over its maintenance ) , the MPS form mistakenly gives the bridge 's date of construction as 1932 . 
 = = = Flood and destruction = = = 
 In January 1996 , there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania . The 1995 – 1996 early winter was unusually cold , and considerable ice buildup formed in local streams . A major blizzard on January 6 – 8 produced up to 40 inches ( 100 cm ) of snow , which was followed on January 19 – 21 by more than 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of rain with temperatures as high as 62 ° F ( 17 ° C ) and winds up to 38 miles per hour ( 61 km / h ) . The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania and ice jams made this worse on many streams . Elsewhere in Lycoming County , flooding on Lycoming Creek in and near Williamsport killed six people and caused millions of dollars in damage . 
 On Plunketts Creek , ice jams led to record flooding , which caused irreparable major damage to the mid @-@ 19th century stone arch bridge . Downstream in Barbours , the waters were 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep in what was then called the village 's " worst flood in history " . Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was one of two destroyed in Lycoming County , and on January 31 a photograph of the damaged bridge was featured on the front page of the Williamsport Sun @-@ Gazette with the caption " This old stone arch bridge over Plunketts Creek must be replaced . " In neighboring Sullivan County , the Sonestown Covered Bridge , also on the NRHP , was so damaged by the flood that it remained closed for repairs until late December 1996 . Throughout Pennsylvania , these floods led to 20 deaths and 69 <unk> or state @-@ owned bridges being either " destroyed or closed until inspections could verify their safety " . 
 When it became clear that the bridge could not be repaired , PennDOT awarded an emergency contract for a temporary bridge before the end of January , citing " emergency vehicles that can no longer travel directly from Barbours " to Proctor and beyond . The temporary bridge cost $ 87 @,@ 000 and was 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide . The photographs for the bridge 's inclusion in the Historic American Engineering Record ( <unk> ) were taken in January , and the <unk> " documentation package was prepared as mitigation for the emergency demolition " of the bridge , which was collapsed in March . The permanent replacement bridge was completed in 1996 , and the old bridge was removed from the NRHP on July 22 , 2002 .

 Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a rubble masonry stone arch bridge , oriented roughly east – west over Plunketts Creek . Its overall length was 75 feet ( 23 m ) and its single semi @-@ circular arch spanned 44 feet ( 13 m ) . The bridge deck width was 18 feet 8 inches ( 5 @.@ 69 m ) , and its roadway was 15 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 65 m ) wide , which could accommodate only a single lane of traffic . Just before the flood that led to the bridge 's destruction , about 450 vehicles crossed the bridge daily . The outside corners of the wing walls were 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) apart , which combined with the overall length of 75 feet ( 23 m ) led to a total area of 1 @,@ 875 square feet ( 174 @.@ 2 m2 ) being listed on the NRHP . 
 The bridge rested on abutments which had been jacketed with concrete after its original construction . The arch was supported by voussoirs made of " irregular rubble stone " , without a keystone . There was also no stone giving the date or other construction information . The approaches were flanked by wing walls constructed of riprap stones , and the spandrel walls were topped by parapets made of " rough , crenellated stones " . The bridge 's road deck rested directly on the top of its arch . This led to a " narrow wall at the arch crown " and a " protruding rock parapet " atop this spandrel wall on either side . Most stone arch bridges have solid parapets without decoration ; this bridge 's parapet crenellation was an ornamental feature . The parapet construction and appearance made the bridge unique among the 58 Pennsylvania stone arch bridges with which it was nominated for the NRHP . 
 Pennsylvania has a long history of stone arch bridges , including the oldest such bridge in use in the United States , the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia . Such bridges typically used local stone , with three types of finishing possible . Rubble or third @-@ class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry ; squared @-@ stone or second @-@ class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared ; and ashlar or first @-@ class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared . Rubble masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction , and had the largest tolerances . Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble masonry techniques . 
 Stone bridge construction started with the excavation of foundations for the abutments . Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron . This structure supported the stone arch during construction . Once the stone arch was built , the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added . Then the road bed was built , with fill ( loose stones or dirt ) added to support it as needed . Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit , then set in mortar . Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened , the center was gradually lowered and then removed . In March 1996 , after standing for between 156 and 121 years , the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed .

 Thirty Seconds to Mars recorded their performance on May 13 , 2011 at Sony Music Studios in New York City . The show featured a number of musicians from the Vitamin String Quartet and back @-@ up vocalists from The Late Show 's Gospel Choir . It marked the first live performance by the former . The show was produced by Lee <unk> , Jay Peterson and Leah Culton @-@ Gonzales through the production company Original Media . 
 Thirty Seconds to Mars dedicated several days to rehearsals , in which they reworked and experimented with their musical repertoire . The band invited their fans to attend the rehearsal sessions to work on songs that needed background vocals . Jared Leto expressed his gratitude to the band 's fans , termed as the Echelon , emphasizing their strong collaboration . During rehearsals , musicians from the Vitamin String Quartet were also involved , with Leto stating that they were " really open and collaborative , [ ... ] fluid and in the moment and improvisational . " Thirty Seconds to Mars explained the scrupulous process of deciding which songs to cover , considering tracks by artists as varied as Cyndi Lauper , Gheorghe Zamfir , Eminem , and Fleetwood Mac . The band stated that they also considered a song by Dolly Parton , before they decided on " Where the Streets Have No Name " by U2 , which is reputed a special song for Jared and Shannon Leto . 
 The show began with " Hurricane " , followed by " Alibi " , " Kings and Queens " , " Closer to the Edge " , " Night of the Hunter " , " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and " Message in a Bottle " , originally by The Police . Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure , Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević , Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher . The Vitamin String Quartet musicians which took part al the recording included three violinists , a cellist and a conductor . The performance of " Where the Streets Have No Name " featured The Late Show 's Gospel Choir , consisting of five men and five women dressed in red . After filming , Jared Leto described the band 's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating , " I think our generation , it was kind of a rite of passage , and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged , it certainly was a pretty big deal . So many of our favorite bands did ' Unplugged ' and still do it , so we were really thrilled to be asked . "

 = The Fire ( The Office ) = 
 " The Fire " is the fourth episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's tenth episode overall . Written by B. J. Novak and directed by Ken Kwapis , the episode first aired in the United States on October 11 , 2005 on NBC . The episode features Amy Adams as Jim 's girlfriend , Katy . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) takes it upon himself to teach Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) about business , but soon everyone is forced to evacuate the office due to a fire . While outside , Michael continues to show an interest in Ryan , causing Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) to be jealous . Meanwhile , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) organizes games to play outside . 
 According to B. J. Novak , the episode was " a fun one to film " . Although the cast and crew appear to be cold in the finished episode , " The Fire " was filmed in 100 @-@ degree weather ; thus , the actors " couldn 't look hot " and had to pretend to shiver . The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen , and their costumes were designed in order to look like authentic Scranton firefighters . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) learns that Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Katy ( Amy Adams ) have started dating . Michael ( Steve Carell ) gives Ryan ( B.J. Novak ) a glowing checkpoint review . When Ryan expresses his interest in starting his own business someday , Michael takes it upon himself to teach Ryan the " ten rules of business " . The fire alarm sounds , and while Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) and Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) both attempt to take charge of the evacuation , Michael pushes others out of the way in his escape out of the building . 
 The employees play games to pass the time , including " Desert Island Picks " and " Who Would You Do ? " When Ryan reveals that he is attending business school at night , Michael becomes enamored of his newfound protégé . Dwight becomes noticeably jealous of Ryan 's favor with Michael , and he is seen sulking in his car to the tune " Everybody Hurts " by R.E.M. When Michael mentions that he left his cell phone in the office , Dwight rushes back into the building to fetch it . 
 Michael asks Ryan to call his cell phone to help Dwight find it . The phone rings , which happens to be in Michael 's pocket . Dwight emerges , coughing , from the building and reveals that the fire was started by Ryan , who left a cheese pita in the toaster @-@ oven set to " oven " instead of " toaster " . Dwight and Michael mock Ryan and dub him " The Fire Guy " by doing a song parody of the Billy Joel song " We Didn 't Start the Fire " .

 " The Fire " was the fourth episode of the series directed by Ken Kwapis . Kwapis had previously directed " Pilot " , " Diversity Day " , and " Sexual Harassment " . " The Fire " was written by B. J. Novak , who also acts on the show as Ryan Howard . Novak had previously penned the episodes " Diversity Day " and " Sexual Harassment " . " The Fire " featured the second appearance of Katy , portrayed by Amy Adams . Adams thoroughly enjoyed her work on the show . In an interview with Advocate.com , she said , " [ The Office ] was the best work experience . I loved that show and that cast so much . I don ’ t know if they believe me , but every time I see them I ’ m like , ' Oh my gosh , I ’ ll do anything to come back . ' " 
 Novak described the episode as " a fun one to film " . The episode was filmed in 100 @-@ degree weather , but according to cast member B. J. Novak , they " couldn 't look hot " . The area outside the building was shot in Van Nuys , California in what Novak called a " bad area " : he later noted that they " had to pretend we weren 't scared , even though every car that is left next to our set overnight is stripped to the bone for parts . " Greg Daniels noted that during the filming of " The Fire " , the cast and crew kept being interrupted by the sound of helicopters . The firemen in the scene were played by actual firemen . The crew of The Office had someone in Scranton take photographs of local firefighters ' uniforms , so the costumes would be accurate . However , in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette , Scranton firefighter Art Franklin pointed out that the uniform is actually tan , instead of the black ones seen on the show .

 When lecturing Ryan , Michael compares himself to Yoda and Mr. Miyagi . When he later attempts to do a Yoda voice , Ryan misinterprets it as an impression of Fozzie Bear . When Dwight is dejectedly listening to music in his car , he is playing " Everybody Hurts " by R.E.M. Dwight and Michael 's " Ryan Started the Fire " is an thinly veiled song parody of the Billy Joel song " We Didn 't Start the Fire " . 
 During the game of desert island , many of the employees reference specific films and books . Angela says she would take The Bible , A Purpose Driven Life , and The Da Vinci Code , but only to burn the latter . Dwight notes that he would take the Physicians ' Desk Reference , but hollow it out and fill it with supplies ; he also states we would bring Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in case he got bored . Meredith later reveals that she would bring Legends Of The Fall , My Big Fat Greek Wedding , Legally Blonde , The Bridges of Madison County , and " just the pottery scene " from Ghost to watch . Pam picks Fargo , Edward Scissorhands , Dazed And Confused , The Breakfast Club , and The Princess Bride . After asking what Dwight would bring , he says The Crow .

 = Lycoperdon perlatum = 
 Lycoperdon perlatum , popularly known as the common puffball , warted puffball , gem @-@ studded puffball , or the devil 's snuff @-@ box , is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae . A widespread species with a cosmopolitan distribution , it is a medium @-@ sized puffball with a round fruit body tapering to a wide stalk , and dimensions of 1 @.@ 5 to 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide by 3 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall . It is off @-@ white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or " jewels " , which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface . When mature it becomes brown , and a hole in the top opens to release spores in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops . 
 The puffball grows in fields , gardens , and along roadsides , as well as in grassy clearings in woods . It is edible when young and the internal flesh is completely white , although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of poisonous Amanita species . L. perlatum can usually be distinguished from other similar puffballs by differences in surface texture . Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of L. perlatum , including sterol derivatives , volatile compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor , and the unusual amino acid <unk> acid . Laboratory tests indicate that extracts of the puffball have antimicrobial and antifungal activities . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik <unk> synonyms include Lycoperdon gemmatum ( as described by August Batsch in 1783 ) ; the variety Lycoperdon gemmatum var. perlatum ( published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1829 ) ; Lycoperdon <unk> ( George Edward Massee , 1887 ) ; and Lycoperdon perlatum var. <unk> ( A.C. <unk> , 1950 ) . 
 L. perlatum is the type species of the genus Lycoperdon . Molecular analyses suggest a close phylogenetic relationship with L. marginatum . 
 The specific epithet perlatum is Latin for " widespread " . It is commonly known as the common puffball , the gem @-@ studded puffball ( or gemmed puffball ) , the warted puffball , or the devil 's snuff @-@ box ; Samuel Frederick Gray called it the pearly puff @-@ ball in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants . Because some indigenous peoples believed that the spores caused blindness , the puffball has some local names such as " <unk> 's bellows " and " no @-@ eyes " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body ranges in shape from pear @-@ like with a flattened top , to nearly spherical , and reaches dimensions of 1 @.@ 5 to 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide by 3 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall . It has a stem @-@ like base . The outer surface of the fruit body ( the exoperidium ) is covered in short cone @-@ shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts . The spines , which are whitish , gray , or brown , can be easily rubbed off , and leave reticulate pock marks or scars after they are removed . The base of the puffball is thick , and has internal chambers . It is initially white , but turns yellow , olive , or brownish in age . The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed @-@ off spines is less evident on the base . 
 In maturity , the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away , revealing a pre @-@ formed hole ( ostiole ) in the endoperidium , through which the spores can escape . In young puffballs , the internal contents , the gleba , is white and firm , but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature . The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium ( the fertile , spore @-@ bearing tissue ) ; the chambers collapse when the spores mature . Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops . A study of the spore release mechanism in L. pyriforme using high @-@ speed <unk> photography determined that raindrops of 1 mm diameter or greater , including rain drips from nearby trees , were sufficient to cause spore discharge . The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100 cm / second to form a centimeter @-@ tall cloud one @-@ hundredth of a second after impact . A single puff like this can release over a million spores . 
 The spores are spherical , thick @-@ walled , covered with minute spines , and measure 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 μm in diameter . The capillitia ( threadlike filaments in the gleba in which spores are embedded ) are yellow @-@ brown to brownish in color , lack septae , and measure 3 – 7 @.@ 5 μm in diameter . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 7 – 9 by 4 – 5 μm . The basidia bear four slender sterigmata of unequal length ranging from 5 – 10 μm long . The surface spines are made of chains of pseudoparenchymatous hyphae ( resembling the parenchyma of higher plants ) , in which the individual hyphal cells are spherical to elliptical in shape , thick @-@ walled ( up to 1 μm ) , and measure 13 – 40 by 9 – 35 μm . These hyphae do not have clamp connections . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Lycoperdon perlatum is considered to be a good edible mushroom when young , when the gleba is still homogeneous and white . They have been referred to as " poor man 's sweetbread " due to their texture and flavor . The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs , or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings . As early as 1861 , Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt , pepper , and oil . The puffballs become inedible as they mature : the gleba becomes yellow @-@ tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive @-@ green spores . L. perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala . The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well : the northern flying squirrel ( <unk> <unk> ) includes the puffball in their diet of non @-@ truffle fungi , while the " puffball beetle " <unk> <unk> uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding . Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein , carbohydrates , fats , and several micronutrients . The predominant fatty acids in the puffball are linoleic acid ( 37 % of the total fatty acids ) , oleic acid ( 24 % ) , palmitic acid ( 14 @.@ 5 % ) , and stearic acid ( 6 @.@ 4 % ) . 
 The immature ' buttons ' or ' eggs ' of deadly Amanita species can be confused with puffballs . This can be avoided by slicing fruit bodies vertically and inspecting them for the internal developing structures of a mushroom . Additionally , Amanitas will generally not have " jewels " or a bumpy external surface . 
 The spores are ornamented with many sharp microscopic spines and can cause severe irritation of the lung ( <unk> ) when inhaled . This condition has been reported to afflict dogs that play or run where puffballs are present . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 There are several other puffball species with which L. perlatum might be confused . L. <unk> , found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States , is covered in granular patches , but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of L. perlatum . L. pyriforme lacks prominent spines on the surface , and grows on rotting wood — although if growing on buried wood , it may appear to be terrestrial . The widely distributed and common L. <unk> has spines that do not leave scars when rubbed off , a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple @-@ brown at maturity , and a purple @-@ tinged base . The small and rare species L. muscorum grows in deep moss . L. peckii can be distinguished from L. pyriforme by the lavender @-@ tinged spines it has when young . L. <unk> has purplish spores , and an almost completely smooth exoperidium . L. <unk> is larger and grayer , and , in mature individuals , the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores . In the field , L. marginatum is distinguished from L. perlatum by the way in which the spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets . 
 = = Ecology and distribution = = 
 A saprobic species , Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily , scattered , or in groups or clusters on the ground . It can also grow in fairy rings . Typical habitats include woods , grassy areas , and along roads . It has been reported from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu , India . The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance . 
 A widespread species with an almost cosmopolitan distribution , it has been reported from Africa ( Kenya , Rwanda , Tanzania ) , Asia ( China , Himalayas , Japan , southern India ) , Australia , Europe , New Zealand , and South America ( Brazil ) . It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland , and subalpine regions in Iceland . In North America , where it is considered the most common puffball species , it ranges from Alaska to Mexico , although it is less common in Central America . The species is popular on postage stamps , and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea , Paraguay , Romania , Sierra Leone , and Sweden . 
 The puffball bioaccumulates heavy metals present in the soil , and can be used as a bioindicator of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium . In one 1977 study , samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead . L. perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions , and is being investigated for potential use as a low @-@ cost , renewable , <unk> material in the treatment of water and wastewater containing mercury .

The compounds 3 @-@ <unk> , 1 @-@ octen @-@ 3 @-@ ol , and ( Z ) -3 @-@ octen @-@ 1 @-@ ol are the predominant components of the volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor . Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , with an efficiency comparable to that of the antibiotic ampicillin . These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica <unk> Typhimurium , Streptococcus pyogenes , and Mycobacterium smegmatis . Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans , C. tropicalis , Aspergillus fumigatus , Alternaria solani , Botrytis cinerea , and Verticillium <unk> . A 2009 study found L. perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14 milligrams per kilogram of mushroom . The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin . 
 The amino acid <unk> acid ( chemical name 3- ( 5 ( S ) <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> @-@ 5 ( S ) <unk> ) -2 ( S ) <unk> ) was isolated from the puffball , and reported in a 1978 publication . Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with ( S ) <unk> acid , ( S ) - ( + ) <unk> acid is expected to have antagonistic or agonistic activity for the glutamate receptor in the mammalian central nervous system . Methods to synthesize the compounds were reported in 1992 , 1995 , and 2002 .

 Roberto Luongo ( / <unk> / ; born April 4 , 1979 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Born in Montreal , Quebec , he is of Italian and Irish ancestry . He employs the butterfly style of goaltending and has previously played in the NHL for the New York Islanders and the Vancouver Canucks . Luongo is a two @-@ time NHL Second All @-@ Star ( 2004 and 2007 ) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals @-@ against average in the league ( 2011 ; with backup Cory Schneider ) . He has additionally been a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league 's best goaltender ( 2004 , 2007 and 2011 ) , the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers ( 2004 and 2007 ) and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player ( 2007 ) . 
 Prior to his NHL career , Luongo played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) for the Val @-@ d 'Or Foreurs and the Acadie @-@ Bathurst Titan , winning back @-@ to @-@ back President 's Cups and establishing the league 's all @-@ time playoff records in games played and wins . Following his second QMJHL season , Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft . After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999 – 2000 , he was traded to the Panthers . In five seasons with Florida , Luongo established team records for most all @-@ time games played , wins and shutouts . During the 2006 off @-@ season , he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers . Following his second year with the Canucks , he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a team captain since Bill Durnan in the 1947 – 48 season . Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010 . In the subsequent 2010 – 11 season , he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals and lost to the Boston Bruins . During his tenure with Vancouver , Luongo has become the team 's all @-@ time wins and shutouts leader . 
 Internationally , Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments . As a junior , he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships , while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance . Luongo has won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships . He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur in both instances . He succeeded Brodeur as Canada 's starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , winning a gold medal . On January 7 , 2014 , he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team , where he won his 2nd Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Luongo was born to Pasqualina and Antonio Luongo in Montreal , Quebec . His father is an Italian immigrant , born in Santa <unk> , Avellino . He worked in the construction and delivery of furniture , while Luongo 's mother , an Irish @-@ Canadian worked in marketing with Air Canada . Antonio and Pasqualina married in Montreal after Antonio emigrated there in 1976 . 
 Luongo has two younger brothers , Leo and Fabio , who were also aspiring goaltenders . Fabio made it the further out of the two , playing Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League ( BCHL ) with the Williams Lake Timberwolves in 2004 – 05 before succumbing to injuries . He has since become a Junior AAA coach , while Leo is a goaltending coach with HC Lugano . Luongo and his family lived in St. Leonard , Quebec , a borough north of Montreal with a strong Italian community , just four blocks away from Martin Brodeur , who became the goaltender for the New Jersey Devils six years before Luongo entered the NHL . Luongo is fluent in English , French and Italian . His father spoke Italian and his mother spoke English with a little French at home . 
 Luongo graduated from Antoine de St @-@ Exupéry in Montreal , a Francophone high school , in 1996 . He began playing organized hockey at the age of eight as a forward . His father taught all his sons soccer and Luongo played until he was 14 , at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey . Although he initially had the desire to play in net , his parents wanted him to develop his skating first . Several years later , after Luongo was cut from a peewee team , he made the switch to goaltender . At 11 years old , his team 's usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother , still hesitant about Luongo playing the position , he went in net and posted a shutout . In August 2009 , the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena . It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goalie after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000 . 
 By 15 , Luongo was playing midget with Montreal @-@ Bourassa , the same team that produced NHL Quebecer goalies Brodeur and Félix Potvin . Luongo has credited Hall of Fame goaltender Grant Fuhr as his inspiration growing up , citing an admiration for his " spectacular glove saves " . He had the opportunity to first meet Fuhr before a game against the Calgary Flames during his rookie season with the Islanders .

 The Val @-@ d 'Or Foreurs made Luongo the highest drafted goaltender in QMJHL history at second overall in 1995 . He began his junior career in the 1995 – 96 season with Val @-@ d 'Or and posted six wins in 23 games played . As the team 's starting goaltender the following season in 1996 – 97 , he improved to a team @-@ record 32 wins and was awarded the Mike Bossy Trophy as the league 's best professional prospect . After his performance at the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game , opposing coach Don Cherry likened Luongo to Montreal Canadiens ' Hockey Hall of Famer Ken Dryden , while NHL Central Scouting Bureau director Frank Bonello heralded him as a " franchise goalie " . 
 At the 1997 NHL Entry Draft , Luongo was selected in the first round , fourth overall , by the New York Islanders . The pick originally belonged to the Toronto Maple Leafs but was traded to the Islanders in exchange for Wendel Clark , Mathieu Schneider and D. J. Smith . At the time of the draft , Luongo was the highest picked goaltender in NHL history , surpassing Tom Barrasso and John Davidson 's fifth overall selections in 1983 and 1973 ( Luongo 's selection was later surpassed by Rick DiPietro 's first overall selection by the Islanders in 2000 ) . 
 Upon his draft , Luongo continued to play junior with the Foreurs in 1997 – 98 . He recorded 27 wins and a 3 @.@ 09 goals against average ( GAA ) . His seven shutouts tied Nick <unk> 's QMJHL record , set in 1974 – 75 ( Adam Russo later tied it as well in 2002 – 03 ) . Luongo went on to win 14 of 17 playoff appearances in the QMJHL playoffs to lead Val @-@ d 'Or to a President 's Cup championship and a Memorial Cup appearance . The Foreurs failed to win a game in the 1998 Memorial Cup tournament , however , and finished in last place . 
 Although the Islanders planned to have Luongo play in the NHL for the 1998 – 99 season , an inconsistent performance at training camp led to Luongo 's return to the QMJHL that season . Due to having failed to come to terms on a contract before October 1 , 1998 , Luongo was not allowed to be called up to the Islanders from junior over the course of the subsequent season . He started the season with Val @-@ d 'Or but was traded to the Acadie @-@ Bathurst Titan during the 1999 World Junior Championships for the remainder of the 1998 – 99 season . He went on to lead the Titan to his second consecutive President 's Cup championship with a 2 @.@ 74 GAA in 23 games . He finished his QMJHL playoff career with the all @-@ time league record in games played ( 56 ) , minutes played ( 3 @,@ 264 : 22 ) , wins ( 38 ) and shots faced ( 1 @,@ 808 ) . His and Memorial Cup appearance in 1999 . The Titan finished in last place , failing to win a game during the tournament . 
 = = = New York Islanders ( 1999 – 2000 ) = = = 
 After his performance at the 1999 World Junior Championships , Luongo was signed by the Islanders to a three @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 775 million contract on January 8 , 1999 . The following season , he made his professional debut with the Lowell Lock Monsters , the Islanders ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate . Early in the season , Luongo was called up to the Islanders on November 22 , 1999 , after a shoulder injury to backup Wade Flaherty . He made his NHL debut six days later on November 28 , stopping 43 shots in a 2 – 1 win against the Boston Bruins . Luongo 's early performances solidified him as the Islanders ' starting goalie over veteran Félix Potvin . Nearly a month after Luongo 's debut in New York , Potvin was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on December 19 in exchange for backup goaltender Kevin Weekes . The next month , he recorded his first career NHL shutout in his eighth game , stopping 34 shots in a 3 – 0 victory over the Bruins on December 27 . 
 In January 2000 , Luongo was publicly criticized by Islanders general manager Mike Milbury for having gone looking for an apartment in New York on a game day before letting in seven goals to the Boston Bruins . Milbury told the media , " You can 't do that in the NHL . You have to prepare yourself . " Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment . Luongo finished the season with the Islanders , posting a 3 @.@ 25 GAA and .904 save percentage in 24 games . 
 In the off @-@ season , the Islanders selected goaltender Rick DiPietro with the first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft . DiPietro 's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest @-@ drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders ' goaltender of the future . Consequently , Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24 , 2000 . The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers , as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players , in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha . Luongo expressed surprise at the trade , saying , " I didn 't expect it at all . One day they 're telling me I 'm the goalie of the future , and the next day I 'm gone . I didn 't really appreciate that . The good side is that [ the Panthers ] wanted me . " 
 = = = First stint with the Florida Panthers ( 2000 – 06 ) = = = 
 The Panthers organization expressed high praise for Luongo following the trade . General manager Bryan Murray characterized him as " a franchise guy " , while head coach Terry Murray added " He 's the guy teams have to have to win the Stanley Cup . " He entered his first training camp with the Panthers competing for the starting role with veteran goaltender Trevor Kidd ; coach Terry Murray opted to begin the season with Kidd due to his experience . Luongo made his first start with the Panthers on October 9 , 2000 , making 18 saves in a 4 – 2 loss to the Boston Bruins . Splitting the goaltending duties , Luongo went on to appear in 43 games , in comparison to Kidd 's 42 . He finished his 2000 – 01 rookie season ( Luongo qualified as a rookie because he had not played in at least 26 games the previous season with New York ) by notching a franchise record fifth shutout of the season in a 3 – 0 win against the New York Rangers on April 7 , 2001 . The total surpassed John Vanbiesbrouck 's four @-@ shutout mark , set in both the 1994 – 95 and 1997 – 98 seasons . He posted a 12 – 24 – 7 record with the struggling Panthers , who finished 12th in the Eastern Conference , while recording a 2 @.@ 44 GAA . His <unk> save percentage was sixth in the league and second all @-@ time among rookie goaltenders , behind Manny Fernandez 's mark set the previous season . 
 Approaching his third NHL season , Luongo agreed on a four @-@ year contract extension with the Panthers on September 13 , 2001 . He was chosen to play in the inaugural NHL YoungStars Game in 2002 for Team Melrose , winning 13 – 7 over Team Fox . After appearing in 58 games in 2001 – 02 , Luongo suffered a torn ligament in his right ankle in a game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 20 , 2002 . Sidelined for the remainder of the season , he finished with a 16 – 33 – 4 record , a 2 @.@ 77 GAA and <unk> save percentage . Luongo returned in 2002 – 03 to a heavier workload , playing a 65 @-@ game season . He had a franchise record @-@ setting shutout streak that lasted 144 : 51 minutes ; it was snapped on January 20 , 2003 , against the Montreal Canadiens . He also recorded his first 20 @-@ win season with a 20 – 34 – 7 record , 2 @.@ 71 GAA and <unk> save percentage . The Panthers continued to struggle , however , finishing 13th in the East . 
 In his fourth season with the Panthers ( 2003 – 04 ) , Luongo emerged with his first Vezina Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award nominations as the top goaltender and top player as selected by the players , respectively . Playing in 72 games , he set NHL marks for most saves and shots faced in a single season with 2 @,@ 303 and 2 @,@ 475 , respectively . Both marks were previously set by former Islanders teammate Félix Potvin in 1996 – 97 as a Toronto Maple Leaf . His resulting <unk> save percentage was first among goalies with at least 50 starts and set a Panthers franchise record , breaking Vanbiesbrouck 's .924 mark , set in 1993 – 94 . His seven shutouts furthered his franchise record and was good for fifth in the league . At mid @-@ season , he was named to his first NHL All @-@ Star Game , held in February 2004 . Competing for the Eastern Conference , he won the Goaltenders Competition segment of the <unk> , allowing the fewest goals on goaltender @-@ related events . The following day , he played in the third period of the All @-@ Star Game and helped the East to a 6 – 4 win against the West . At the end of the season , he was named to the Second NHL All @-@ Star Team , but lost the Vezina Trophy to fellow Montreal @-@ native Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils , while Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Pearson Award . Despite Luongo 's success , however , the Panthers failed to qualify for the playoffs once more . 
 Due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , Luongo was inactive , with the exception of two international tournaments , the 2004 World Cup and the 2005 World Championships . With the NHL set to resume in 2005 – 06 , Luongo was without a contract . After negotiations failed , the Panthers filed for arbitration on August 11 , 2005 . The process awarded Luongo a one @-@ year , $ 3 @.@ 2 million contract on August 25 . 
 On April 13 , 2006 , Luongo became the winningest Panthers goaltender of all @-@ time , passing Vanbiesbrouck , with his 107th win with the team – a 5 – 4 overtime victory against the Ottawa Senators . He went on to post 35 wins , breaking Vanbiesbrouck 's 27 @-@ win single @-@ season Panthers mark , set in 1996 – 97 . Set to become a free agent for the second consecutive off @-@ season , he could not come to an agreement with the Panthers , having formally turned down a five @-@ year , $ 30 million contract offer in January 2006 . It was also reported that among Luongo 's demands were that backup goaltender Jamie McLennan be re @-@ signed , his long @-@ time goaltending coach François Allaire be hired and that a public statement be released that he would not be traded until the no @-@ trade clause of his contract took effect .

 Prior to the start of the 2006 – 07 season , Panthers general manager Mike Keenan traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23 , 2006 . He was packaged with defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth round draft pick ( Sergei Shirokov ) in exchange for forward Todd Bertuzzi , defenceman Bryan Allen and goaltender Alex Auld . Immediately following the deal , Vancouver signed Luongo to a four @-@ year , $ 27 million deal . He expressed surprise , claiming that he and the Panthers were very close to a deal the day before the trade . 
 Luongo 's arrival in Vancouver ended a seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year period of instability for Canucks <unk> , with a total of 18 goaltenders having played for the club since Kirk McLean 's departure in 1998 . General manager Brian Burke had coined the term " goalie graveyard " during his tenure in Vancouver to describe the club 's goaltending fortunes . 
 Luongo recorded a 3 – 1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5 , 2006 . Later in the month , he notched his first shutout with the Canucks , stopping 32 shots in a 5 – 0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25 . On January 9 , 2007 , Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender for the first time in his career for the Western Conference All @-@ Stars . Six days after the announcement , he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice . He spent the night in the intensive care unit for fears his windpipe would swell shut . Discharged from the hospital on game day , Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16 , 2007 . During the 2007 NHL All @-@ Star Game in Dallas , Luongo was named the Skills Competition 's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12 – 9 win over the East . Late in the season , Luongo recorded his franchise record @-@ setting 39th win in a 2 – 1 overtime victory on March 9 . He surpassed Kirk McLean 's 38 @-@ win mark set in 1991 – 92 . He went on to finish with a career @-@ high 47 wins , one shy of league @-@ leader Martin Brodeur , who broke Bernie Parent 's thirty @-@ three @-@ year @-@ old NHL record of wins in a season . Luongo and Brodeur are considered , however , to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL , allowing more games to be decided with wins , as opposed to ties . 
 In addition to his 47 wins , Luongo recorded a 2 @.@ 29 GAA ( which was at that time , a personal best ) and a team @-@ record .921 save percentage ( surpassing Dan Cloutier 's .914 save percentage in 2003 – 04 ; later broken by Cory Schneider 's .929 save percentage in 2010 – 11 ) . He won three team awards – the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as MVP , the Molson Cup as the player with the most three @-@ star selections , and the Most Exciting Player Award . Leading the Canucks to a Northwest Division title and what was then a franchise record of 105 points , the team was seeded third in the Western Conference . The 2007 playoffs marked Luongo 's first NHL post @-@ season appearance . Facing the Dallas Stars in the opening round , he almost set an NHL record for most saves in a playoff game in his post @-@ season debut . He stopped 72 shots , en route to a 5 – 4 quadruple overtime victory , one save shy of Kelly Hrudey 's 73 @-@ save mark set in 1987 . Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games . They were , however , defeated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champions , the Anaheim Ducks . Luongo put forth a losing 56 @-@ save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks . After the game ended in regulation at a 1 – 1 tie , he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an equipment malfunction . However , after the series ended , it was revealed that Luongo , instead , had an untimely case of diarrhea . The Canucks lost the game 2 – 1 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee , believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer . With Luongo not paying attention , Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the series @-@ winning goal . 
 At the end of the season , Luongo was nominated for three major NHL awards : the Vezina Trophy , Lester B. Pearson Award and Hart Memorial Trophy as the league MVP . However , Luongo finished second in voting for all three awards , behind Brodeur for the Vezina and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Hart and Pearson . 
 Luongo kept pace statistically in 2007 – 08 with his previous season 's work and continued to set significant marks , including a three @-@ game shutout streak spanning 210 : 34 in late @-@ November ( breaking the Canucks ' previous franchise record of 184 : 20 set by Ken Lockett in 1975 ) . He was voted in as the 2008 NHL All @-@ Star Game 's Western Conference starting goalie for the second consecutive season , although he did not attend in order to be with his pregnant wife in Florida . 
 With the Canucks battling for the Northwest Division title all season long , a losing streak that saw Luongo win only one of his final eight starts caused the Canucks to miss the playoffs altogether . Nevertheless , he received his second consecutive team MVP and Molson Cup awards . He also finished seventh in Vezina Trophy balloting . At the Canucks ' end @-@ of @-@ season media address , Vigneault speculated whether Luongo 's heavy regular season workload , having started the team 's final 31 games , was a factor in the late @-@ season collapse . He finished the season with a 35 – 29 – 9 record , 2 @.@ 38 GAA and .917 save percentage . 
 On September 30 , 2008 , prior to the start of the 2008 – 09 season , Vancouver Canucks general manager Mike Gillis and head coach Alain Vigneault named Luongo the 12th captain in team history , replacing the departed Markus Näslund . The decision was unconventional , as league rules forbid goaltenders from being captains . As such , Luongo became only the seventh goaltender in NHL history to be named a captain , and the first since Bill Durnan captained the Montreal Canadiens in 1947 – 48 ( after whom the league implemented the rule ) . In order to account for the league rule , Luongo did not perform any of the on @-@ ice duties reserved for captains and did not wear the captain 's " C " on his jersey . Instead he incorporated it into the artwork on the front of one of his masks which he occasionally wore for the early months of the 2008 – 09 season . Canucks defenceman Willie Mitchell was designated to handle communications with on @-@ ice officials , while defenceman Mattias Öhlund was responsible for ceremonial faceoffs and other such formalities associated with captaincy . Centre Ryan Kesler was chosen along with Mitchell and Öhlund as the third alternate captain . 
 A month into the 2008 – 09 season , Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three games against the Nashville Predators , Phoenix Coyotes , and the Minnesota Wild , akin to the feat he accomplished in the same month of November the previous year . His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242 : 36 minutes , in a 2 – 1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche , surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season . Later that month , on November 22 , Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin . Initially listed as week @-@ to @-@ week , he attempted what was considered an early comeback within two weeks of the injury , but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10 , leaving early in discomfort . After missing 24 games , Luongo made his return on January 15 , 2009 , in a 4 – 1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes . While injured , Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All @-@ Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative . Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All @-@ Star Game , Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12 – 11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference . He finished the season with back @-@ to @-@ back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career @-@ high of nine shutouts on the season , breaking Dan Cloutier 's previous franchise single @-@ season shutout record of seven , set in 2001 – 02 . 
 Winning their second Northwest Division title in three years , Luongo and the Canucks returned to the playoffs after a one @-@ year absence . During the 2009 playoffs , he led the Canucks to a first round sweep of the St. Louis Blues . The Canucks then faced the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round , which Chicago ultimately won in six games . Luongo was heavily criticized following his performance in the sixth and deciding game , allowing seven goals in the 7 – 5 loss . In a post @-@ game interview , Luongo told reporters that he " let [ his ] teammates down " . Many in the Vancouver media were quick to suggest trading Luongo , arguing that his large salary could be better spent , while pointing to several successful teams with relatively low @-@ salary goalies . Nevertheless , Luongo was presented at the year @-@ end awards ceremony with the Scotiabank Fan Fav Award , a fan @-@ voted award in its inaugural year for the league 's favourite player . Also finishing fourth in Vezina Trophy voting , he missed out on his second nomination in three years by one vote , behind Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild , Steve Mason of the Columbus Blue Jackets and trophy @-@ winner Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins . 
 = = = = 2009 – 11 = = = = 
 With one season left on his original four @-@ year deal with the Canucks , Luongo and agent Gilles Lupien began contract negotiations with general manager Mike Gillis in the 2009 off @-@ season . At the time of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , ESPN reported that Luongo and the Canucks had agreed on a long @-@ term extension to be announced on July 1 . The report was , however , denied by both Lupien and Gillis . A little over a month later in early @-@ August , Gillis told Vancouver sports radio station TEAM 1040 in an interview that he was " philosophically " close to a deal with Luongo to be signed before the upcoming 2009 – 10 season . That same month , while at Team Canada 's summer camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics , Luongo set a September 13 deadline to sign a contract before the Canucks ' training camp began , explaining that he " will not be negotiating during the season ... [ not wanting ] that distraction " . 
 Several days later , on September 2 , the Canucks announced that they had signed Luongo to a 12 @-@ year contract extension worth $ 64 million for a $ 5 @.@ 33 million annual salary cap hit . The front @-@ loaded deal , which will expire by the time Luongo is 43 and includes a no @-@ trade clause , sees him make $ 10 million in 2010 – 11 , then approximately $ 6 @.@ 7 million annually through to 2017 – 18 , $ 3 @.@ 3 million and $ 1 @.@ 6 million the subsequent two seasons , before tailing off to $ 1 million for the final two years . The contract contains two additional clauses to circumvent the no @-@ trade clause that allow Luongo to facilitate a trade after the fifth year and for the Canucks to also facilitate a trade after the seventh year . 
 Nearly a month into the 2009 – 10 season , on October 25 , 2009 , Luongo recorded his 21st shutout as a Canuck ( 48th career ) in a 2 – 0 win against the Edmonton Oilers , surpassing Kirk McLean as the franchise shutouts leader . The following game against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27 , he suffered a rib injury that was revealed the following day to be a hairline fracture . Luongo originally injured his rib two games prior against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24 after taking a shot from Leafs forward Niklas Hagman in the chest . The injury was re @-@ aggravated during the Detroit game during a collision with Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi . He returned to the lineup on November 10 after missing six games . On January 7 , 2010 , Luongo recorded his 50th career shutout in a 4 – 0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes . Despite recording the second 40 @-@ win season of his career , Luongo finished with his worst statistical season as a Canuck , heavily affected by a poor second @-@ half . Pulled seven times in 68 appearances , he recorded a 2 @.@ 57 GAA and a <unk> save percentage . In the subsequent 2010 playoffs , the Canucks defeated the Los Angeles Kings in six games only to be defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second year in a row . In similar fashion to the previous year , Luongo struggled in the second round series against Chicago , allowing 21 goals in six games , including 5 in the deciding sixth game . He finished the playoffs with a 3 @.@ 22 GAA and .895 save percentage . 
 In the off @-@ season , it was speculated by many in the media whether Luongo should remain Vancouver 's captain , citing the added pressure of the goaltending position . After the Canucks ' 3 – 1 series deficit in the second round , Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre @-@ game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders , but not for captains . When asked after the Canucks ' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain , he told reporters he did not think it was an issue . However , Gillis , who appointed him captain two seasons prior , asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off @-@ season . On September 13 , 2010 , Luongo confirmed he was stepping down , stating that " Serv [ ing ] as captain ... in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in . I will continue to be a leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal . " Centre Henrik Sedin , who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009 – 10 season , was named Luongo 's successor in a pre @-@ game ceremony to the Canucks ' season @-@ opener . 
 Also in the off @-@ season , Gillis fired Luongo 's goaltending coach Ian Clark and hired Roland Melanson in his place . Luongo had been a personal friend of Clark 's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch . The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full @-@ time basis – something Clark was unable to do . Despite the coaching change at the club level , Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training . He began working with Melanson leading up to the 2010 – 11 season and employed several changes in his playing style , which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters . 
 During the 2010 pre @-@ season , Luongo sustained a groin injury , but recovered in time for the regular season . Midway through the campaign , Luongo was named the NHL 's Second Star of the Month for December 2010 . He posted an 11 – 1 – 2 record with a 2 @.@ 07 GAA , a .922 save percentage and one shutout . During the month , he started a 21 @-@ game regulation unbeaten streak that lasted until a loss against the St. Louis Blues on February 14 , 2011 . Luongo 's record in that span was 16 wins and 5 overtime or shootout losses . Later in the campaign , he recorded his 300th career win against the Los Angeles Kings on March 5 , 2011 . He became the 6th @-@ youngest goaltender to reach the milestone and the 25th overall . The 2010 – 11 season constituted a decreased workload for Luongo , as he appeared in 60 games . Team management had asserted at the beginning of the campaign that rookie backup Cory Schneider would be given the opportunity to play in 20 to 25 games . Luongo finished the season with a league @-@ leading 38 wins , along with 22 losses ( 15 in regulation and 7 in overtime or a shootout ) . His career @-@ high 2 @.@ 11 GAA ranked second in the league , behind Tim Thomas ' 2 @.@ 00 , and set a Canucks record , surpassing Dan Cloutier 's 2 @.@ 27 GAA , set in 2003 – 04 . While his .928 save percentage improved upon his team @-@ record setting .921 in 2006 – 07 , it was bettered by one @-@ hundredth of a point by Schneider . Together , Luongo and Schneider won the William M. Jennings Trophy for leading the Canucks to the lowest GAA in the league ; their combined 2 @.@ 20 GAA was one @-@ tenth better than the Boston Bruins 's second @-@ place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask . Luongo helped the Canucks to their first Presidents ' Trophy in team history with an NHL @-@ best and franchise @-@ record 54 wins and 117 points . His efforts in the regular season earned him his third career Vezina Trophy nomination , alongside the Boston Bruins ' Tim Thomas and the Nashville Predators ' Pekka Rinne . 
 = = = = 2011 playoffs = = = = 
 Entering the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West , the Canucks were matched against the Blackhawks for the third straight year . After opening the series with three straight wins , the Canucks lost the next three , forcing a seventh game . After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 and 5 – having allowed six and four goals , respectively – Luongo started Game 6 on the bench . During the third period , Schneider suffered an injury , forcing Luongo to finish the game . He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward Ben Smith scored in overtime . Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7 , Vigneault chose to start Luongo . He made 31 saves in the deciding game , helping the Canucks to a 2 – 1 overtime win . His efforts included a cross @-@ ice save on a one @-@ timer from forward Patrick Sharp during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period .
