McMurray qualified third , Bill Elliott took fourth , and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth . Johnson , David Reutimann , Mark Martin , David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten . Hamlin only managed 37th , having getting close to the wall . The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier , and Michael McDowell . Once the qualifying session completed , Kahne commented , " That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull . I look forward to Sunday ’ s race . It ’ s going to be exciting being up front now , being in the mix with Denny [ Hamlin ] , Kevin [ Harvick ] and Jimmie [ Johnson ] . They ’ re all going to be fast throughout the race . I ’ m just glad we are so far . Hopefully we can stick with it tomorrow , have a good practice and be competitive in the mix on Sunday . "

Following the third practice session , Harvick stated , " We didn 't put up a fast lap but it never slows down . I 'm really excited . " Afterward , Johnson commented " We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice . But I found a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end . I feel really good about our car . It 's very comfortable . I can run the top , run the bottom . I think we 're in good shape . " " I think we 've got the balance real close , " Johnson continued . " My motor 's running great . Maybe some overall grip but I think there I 'm one of 43 guys that are saying that . This hot sun out here [ is making ] the track awful slick . "

 Race winner Carl Edwards appeared in victory lane after his victory lap . He celebrated his second consecutive win , in front of a crowd of 67 @,@ 000 people . After winning the race , he said " Why didn 't you set the cars up like this before , Bob [ Osbourne ] ? That was the best performance down the straightaway I 've had in a long time . " 
 Afterward , Johnson began celebrating his fifth consecutive Sprint Cup Series championship . During the celebration , Johnson 's crew chief , Chad Knaus commented , " I think finally , finally after pulling this off Jimmie will get the respect that he deserves . Knowing what we had to do — come down here and beat them — and we beat them . " Hamlin , the points leader before the race , described his disappointment by saying , " I ’ m disappointed . Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck . When we hit the 16 ( Biffle ) that knocked the toe @-@ in out . It wasn ’ t as fast after that . It ’ s just circumstances but we had a great year . We won the most races ( 8 ) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one . I don ’ t think the 48 ( Johnson ) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us . " Harvick , who finished third in points , stated : 
 " We went down swinging and that is what we came here to do . Those guys outran us on that last restart there . All in all I ’ m proud of all my guys . We did everything we wanted to do today but win the race . This is a great spot to start building for consistent championship runs next year . We had a top three car but they got by us on the restarts . All in all , it was a good day . What can you do ? " 
 During the post @-@ race press conference , Harvick and Busch commented on their accident during the race . " Harvick pulled a slide job on my earlier in the day , I crossed over and passed him clean . My guys worked way too hard to be in this position to have a wrecked race car at the end of the year . It means so much to me to finish the year strong . I talked to him in the driver ’ s meeting but Kevin is such a two @-@ faced guy it doesn ’ t really matter , " Busch said .

 = Garden warbler = 
 The garden warbler ( Sylvia borin ) is a common and widespread small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia . It is a plain , long @-@ winged and long @-@ tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts ; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults . Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap . Due to its lack of distinguishing features , this species can be confused with a number of other unstreaked warblers . The garden warbler 's rich melodic song is similar to that of the blackcap , its closest relative , which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland . 
 The preferred breeding habitat in Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting ; despite its name , gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird . The clutch of four or five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup @-@ shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation . The eggs are incubated for 11 – 12 days . The chicks are altricial , hatching naked and with closed eyes , and are fed by both parents . They fledge about 10 days after hatching . Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year . The garden warbler is strongly migratory , wintering in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . A wide range of habitats are used in Africa , but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned . Insects are the main food in the breeding season , although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration , figs being a particular favourite where available . These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds . 
 The garden warbler is hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats , and its eggs and nestlings are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators . It may be host to various fleas , mites and internal parasites , and it is a host of the common cuckoo , a brood parasite . The large and fairly stable numbers and huge range of the garden warbler mean that it is classed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Despite a small population decline in much of its European range , the bird 's breeding distribution is expanding northwards in Scandinavia . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Sylvia , the typical warblers , forms part of a large family of Old World warblers , the Sylviidae . Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20 million years . The garden warbler and its nearest relative , the blackcap , are an ancient species pair which diverged very early from the rest of the genus , between 12 and 16 million years ago . In the course of time , these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera , with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in <unk> . These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat . 
 The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn 's thrush @-@ babbler , both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera , <unk> and <unk> respectively . 
 The garden warbler was first described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783 . The current genus name is from Modern Latin <unk> , a woodland nymph , related to <unk> , a wood . The specific borin is derived from a local name for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy ; it derives from the Latin bos , ox , because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen . 
 There are two recognised subspecies . 
 Sylvia borin borin ( Boddaert , 1783 ) , the nominate subspecies , breeds in western , northern and central Europe to Finland , central Poland , western Hungary and Bosnia . 
 S. b. woodwardi ( Sharpe , 1877 ) , named for Sharpe 's collaborator Bernard Barham Woodward , breeds in eastern Europe and temperate Asia east to western Siberia . 
 Intermediate birds occur where the recognised forms meet and interbreed , and have sometimes been given subspecies status , including S. b. <unk> in Poland and S. b. <unk> in Bulgaria , but these are not generally accepted as valid taxa . 
 = = Description = = 
 The garden warbler is 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long with a 7 @.@ 6 – 8 @.@ 4 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) wing length . The weight is typically 16 – 22 g ( 0 @.@ 56 – 0 @.@ 78 oz ) , but can be up to 35 @.@ 5 g ( 1 @.@ 25 oz ) for birds preparing to migrate . It is a plain , long @-@ winged and long @-@ tailed bird with unstreaked olive @-@ brown upperparts and dull white underparts . It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale supercilium , and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks . The eye is black , the legs are bluish @-@ grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower mandible . The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size . Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult , with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts . The eastern subspecies S. b. woodwardi is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts . The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa , but a wing length greater than 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) confirms S. b. woodwardi when birds are trapped . 
 The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species . The melodious and <unk> warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage . The booted warbler is similar in colour , although it is smaller , more delicately built and has a flesh @-@ coloured bill . Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small , and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill . Juvenile barred warblers , which lack the obvious barring of adults , are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar . 
 Juvenile garden warblers have a partial moult mainly involving the body plumage between June and September prior to migration . Adults also have a similar , but sometimes more extensive , partial moult in late summer , and a complete moult in their African wintering areas before the return migration . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The male 's song , usually delivered by birds in dense cover , is a rich musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration , but sometimes for longer periods . The song is confusable with that of the blackcap , although compared to that species it is slightly lower @-@ pitched , less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow . Both species have a quiet subsong , a muted version of the full song , which is much more difficult to separate . The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp kek @-@ kek , which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed . A quiet rasping <unk> @-@ r @-@ r @-@ r resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard . The juvenile has a <unk> alarm vocalisation . The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds , and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap . Both Sylvia warblers will also sing against common nightingales , which have a similar song despite being unrelated . <unk> may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa , developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The garden warbler breeds in most of Europe between the 12 – 28 ° C ( 54 – 82 ° F ) isotherms and east across temperate Asia to the Yenisei River in Siberia . Its range extends further north than any other Sylvia warbler . All populations are migratory , wintering in sub @-@ Saharan Africa as far south as South Africa . Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest , <unk> to the south or southeast once in Africa , although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the Alps and across the Mediterranean Sea . S. b. woodwardi reaches Africa by a more easterly route , many birds passing through the Arabian Peninsula . When garden warblers cross the Sahara , they fly at night , resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day . During their journey , they can metabolise not only body fat but also up to 19 % of their breast and leg muscles and 39 % of their digestive tract . Many birds pause for a few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south . 
 The nominate subspecies occurs in the western and central parts of the winter range , although some birds occur as far east as Kenya . S. b. woodwardi winters in eastern and southern Africa . Movements in Africa are poorly known , although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years . There are only a handful of records of birds recorded in Europe in winter , from Corsica , the UK and Ireland . Spring migration routes are poorly known , but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean . This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan , Djibouti , Iceland , São Tomé and Príncipe , Somalia , Yemen , Svalbard , Jan Mayen and Madeira . 
 The breeding habitat of the garden warbler is open areas with dense bushes , including thickets and woodland edges . Shady areas and a bushy or herbaceous undergrowth are preferred , as are woods adjacent to rivers or reed beds . A tolerance of willow , alder and birch allows it to breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European Sylvia warbler . Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided , although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting . Despite its name , it is not a bird of gardens . In Africa , a wide range of habitats with trees are used , although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided . This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to 2 @,@ 600 m ( 8 @,@ 500 ft ) in suitable mountain woodland , although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap , and in moister areas than the common whitethroat . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Garden warblers first breed when they are one year old , and are mainly monogamous , although the male at least may sometimes deviate from this . When males return to their breeding areas , they establish a territory . Sylvia warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as conspecifics . Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods , yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap . Similar songs are a feature of the Sylvia warblers as a group , and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species . However , it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species , other than the blackcap and garden warbler , is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression . There are typically 3 – 9 territories per hectare ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 6 per acre ) , but in prime habitat , such as moist willow or birch woodland or young deciduous regrowth , there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare ( 4 per acre ) . Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 76 ha ( 0 @.@ 49 – 1 @.@ 88 acres ) . 
 A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched . He will also build a number of simple nests ( cock 's nests ) to show to his mate , although only rarely will she complete the structure , usually starting afresh . The nest is concealed in vegetation , the nature of which depends on local availability . Rubus species are commonly used in temperate regions , with willow predominating in alpine valleys . Sometimes , particularly in stinging nettles , the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems , in the manner of a reed warbler . The nest is normally between 0 @.@ 3 and 1 @.@ 2 m ( 0 @.@ 98 and 3 @.@ 94 ft ) above the ground , and very rarely higher than 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The nest is a cup of dry grass , moss and twigs , with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair . It is larger and heavier than a blackcap 's nest , averaging 8 @.@ 3 cm ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) high and 11 @.@ 2 cm ( 4 @.@ 4 in ) wide with a cup 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) deep and 6 @.@ 3 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) wide . 
 The first eggs are laid in late April in southern Germany , early May in northwest Europe , and late May in Finland . The season is prolonged with some birds nesting as late as July . The clutch is typically four or five eggs ( range two to six ) , which are usually whitish or buff with grey , purple and brown blotches . The average size of the egg is 20 mm × 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in × 0 @.@ 59 in ) , and it weighs 2 @.@ 2 g ( 0 @.@ 078 oz ) , of which 6 % is shell . The eggs are incubated for 11 – 12 days by both adults , although only the female stays on the nest at night . The chicks are altricial , hatching naked and with closed eyes , and are fed by both parents . They fledge about 10 days after hatching ( range 9 – 12 ) , leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly . They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks , and the family may stay together for a few days after that . The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure , the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible , even while still flightless . This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood , but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves . One brood per year is normal , although a few second broods are known . 
 The southward migration starts in mid @-@ July , with larger numbers departing in August and peaking in early September . Most adults have gone by mid @-@ September , although juveniles may linger for another month . 
 On average , just over 50 % of breeding pairs are successful in producing at least one fledged young from a nest , with early breeding and low population density being factors increasing success . In the UK , more than 50 % of the failures are due to predation and about 30 % result from food shortages in bad weather . The annual survival rate is about 50 % for adults and 26 % for juveniles in their first year . The typical lifespan is two years , but a bird in Sweden lived to ten years and two months Much greater ages , up to 24 years , have been recorded in captive garden warblers . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The garden warbler feeds mainly on insects in the breeding season , although other small invertebrates such as spiders are also eaten . It picks its prey off leaves and twigs , sometimes hovering to do so . It normally forages at less than 6 m ( 20 ft ) above the ground . After nesting , there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet , although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration ; birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone . Berries and other soft fruit are preferred , and figs are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate . This predilection gives rise to the Italian beccafico ( fig pecker ) and Portuguese <unk> @-@ das @-@ <unk> ( fig @-@ tree warbler ) as names for this species . On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue . 
 In Africa , the warbler eats insects as well as berries , and the fruits of the introduced Spanish flag is a favourite where present . An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration , birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey . Most internal organs ( including the liver , spleen , intestines , kidneys and heart ) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara , although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season . Unlike drier @-@ habitat species like the common whitethroat , they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north . 
 Fruit is normally picked by a perched bird , although there is a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight . Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit @-@ eating passerines . Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe , with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 The main predators of the garden warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats . Some falcons will also take adults , and the Eleonora 's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean . Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers , as do mammals such as stoats , weasels and squirrels . The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo , a brood parasite . The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo 's eggs are often rejected . 
 External parasites of the garden warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite <unk> <unk> , named after its host . Two species of protozoan parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers , I. <unk> and I. <unk> . Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74 % and 28 % respectively for the two species . The extent of infection does not impact on the bird 's body mass or the amount of body fat . Three strains of another protozoan , Haemoproteus <unk> are found only in the garden warbler , and form a monophyletic group . Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap , and another three occur in the African hill babbler , supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species .

 The garden warbler has a very large range of 9 @,@ 650 @,@ 000 km2 ( 3 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 mi2 ) , and its population in Europe is estimated at 17 – 31 million breeding pairs . Allowing for birds breeding in Asia , the total population is between 54 – 124 million individuals . There is no evidence of any serious decline in numbers , so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern . 
 There has been a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980 , although the Scandinavian population is growing . Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap . Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously , and blackcaps and juvenile ( but not adult ) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s . Birds of both species are longer @-@ winged and lighter than in the past , suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards . 
 = = In culture = = 
 In his History of Animals , Aristotle considered that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap . The composer Olivier Messiaen used the song of the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins , the title being the French name of the species . His Turangalîla @-@ Symphonie , a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult , has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement . This features the song of the warbler , along with the those of the nightingale and blackbird . 
 The garden warbler is prized as a gastronomic delicacy in Mediterranean countries . French <unk> Jean <unk> Brillat @-@ Savarin said of the warbler when cooked like <unk> bunting " if it were the size of a pheasant , it would be worth an acre of land " . An Italian stuffed sardine dish <unk> a beccafico derives its name from its supposed resemblance to the cooked birds , known in that country as beccafico , fig @-@ pecker . 
 Old names for the garden warbler , such as <unk> , small straw and <unk> , are often derived from its choice of nesting material , although the commonest of the English folk names was " <unk> " . These names were often shared with other warblers including the blackcap , common whitethroat and common chiffchaff . 
 = Whopper = 
 The Whopper is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast @-@ food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack 's . Introduced in 1957 , it has undergone several reformulations including resizing and bread changes . The burger is one of the best known products in the fast food industry ; it is so well known that Burger King bills itself as the Home of the Whopper in its advertising and signage . Additionally , the company uses the name in its high @-@ end concept , the BK Whopper Bar . Due to its place in the marketplace , the Whopper has prompted Burger King 's competitors , mainly McDonald 's and Wendy 's , to try to develop similar products designed to compete with it . 
 The company markets several variants of the burger as well as other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business . To promote continuing interest in the product , Burger King occasionally releases limited @-@ time variants on the Whopper . As the signature product of the company , it is often at the center of advertising promotions , product tie @-@ ins , and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes . Some of the early twenty @-@ first century advertising programs , particularly in Europe , have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny . Additionally , as the signature product in the company 's portfolio , Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product . 
 = = History = = 
 The Whopper was created in 1957 by Burger King co @-@ founder James McLamore and originally sold for 37 ¢ ( US $ 3 @.@ 27 in 2014 ) . McLamore created the burger after he noticed that a rival restaurant was having success selling a larger burger . Believing that the success of the rival product was its size , he devised the Whopper . The name was chosen because he felt that it conveyed " imagery of something big " . Major fast food chains did not release a similar product until the McDonald 's Big Mac was introduced in 1967 , followed by the Burger Chef Big <unk> in the early 1970s . 
 Initially the sandwich was made with a plain bun , however , that changed when the company switched to a sesame @-@ seeded bun around 1970 . In 1985 , the weight of the Whopper was increased to 4 @.@ 2 oz ( 120 g ) , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll . This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US $ 30 million ( approx US $ 66 million in 2014 ) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit . The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors . The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985 . The Whopper sandwich 's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994 , eliminating the last trace of the sandwich 's 1985 reconfiguration . 
 The packaging has undergone many changes since its inception . Unlike McDonald 's , the company never used the clamshell style box made of Styrofoam , so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam came to a head in the late 1980s , the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches . To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used , the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper . For a short time in 2002 , the company used a gold @-@ toned , aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich . The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box . 
 The Whopper Jr was created , by accident , in 1963 by Luis Arenas @-@ Pérez ( aka Luis Arenas ) , the only Latino in the Burger King Hall of Fame and president and CEO of Burger King in Puerto Rico . Upon the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in Carolina , Puerto Rico , the molds for the ( standard ) Whopper buns had not yet arrived to Puerto Rico from the United States mainland and thus there were no buns to make and sell the company 's flagship Whopper offering . Arenas opted for honoring the advertised opening date but using the much smaller regular hamburger buns locally available . The result was such a success that Burger King adopted it worldwide and called it the Whopper Jr .

 Because of the wide popularity of the Whopper in the public marketplace , competitors such as McDonald 's and Wendy 's have attempted to create a corresponding Whopper @-@ style burger , often nicknamed a Whopper Stopper during the development phase . Wendy 's created the Big Classic with similar toppings but served on a <unk> roll , while McDonald 's has created at least six different versions , including the <unk> , the Arch Deluxe , and the Big N ' Tasty .

 The Whopper is a hamburger , consisting of a flame grilled quarter @-@ pound ( 113 @.@ 4 g ) beef patty , sesame seed bun , mayonnaise , lettuce , tomato , pickles , ketchup , and sliced onion . Optional ingredients such as American cheese , bacon , mustard , guacamole or jalapeño peppers may be added upon request . Regional and international condiments include BBQ sauce and salsa . Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request based on its long standing slogan " Have It Your Way " . It is available with one , two or three beef patties and in a smaller version called the Whopper Jr , or without meat in a version called the Veggie Whopper . The Australian franchise of Burger King , Hungry Jack 's , sells its veggie burger sandwich as the Veggie Whopper . Additionally , Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited time offerings ( LTO ) . With the addition of hot dogs to the company 's menu in February 2016 , Burger King began testing its first major variant called the Whopper Dog in May of the same year across various regions within the United States . The new dog featured a grilled Oscar Mayer hot dog with all of the ingredients featured on the Whopper sandwich . 
 There are localized versions of the Whopper in several of its international operations , such as the <unk> Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper . With the company 's expansion into India , the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich . To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism , who make up the majority of the Indian population , the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu . In their place , the chain is using a combination of chicken , vegetarian patties and mutton in place of beef . While the new Mutton , Chicken , and Vegetarian Whopper sandwiches are designed to appeal to that market , there is a segment of younger consumers that were disappointed that there will be no beef @-@ based products on the menu .

 The Windows 7 Whopper was sold in Japan for the promotion of Microsoft 's Windows 7 operating system . The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured 5 in ( 13 cm ) high , weighed almost 2 @.@ 2 lb ( 1 @.@ 00 kg ) , and had more than 1 @,@ 000 kcal ( 4 @,@ 200 kJ ) . It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009 . Due to its success in selling 6 @,@ 000 sandwiches within the first four days , Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days , ending on 6 November . 
 The campaign was met with unexpected popularity in Japan , sparking multiple YouTube videos and blog posts about the burger . However , the promotional effort received strong criticism from business and tech journalists . Computerworld blogger Preston Gralla claimed that it " could be one of Microsoft 's worst promotional ideas ever . " 
 The Pizza Burger is a burger sold exclusively at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square , New York City that was introduced in September 2010 . It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9 @.@ 5 inch sesame bun , sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni , mozzarella , Tuscan pesto and marinara sauce . The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories for men at 2 @,@ 520 calories , with 144 grams of fat , <unk> of which is saturated , and 3 @,@ 780 mg of sodium , more than double the recommended daily allowance for adults . However , according to Burger King 's Vice President of global marketing , John <unk> , the burger is not intended to feed just one person . Each slice has 420 calories , 24 g fat ( 10 g saturated ) , and 630 mg sodium . 
 The Angry Whopper has jalapeños , " Angry Sauce " and " Angry Onions " , pepper jack cheese and bacon . The sandwich , originally released in Europe , made its way to the United States in 2008 . A variation called the Angriest Whopper debuted in 2016 . The new variant added a red bun with hot pepper sauce baked into the roll . The Angriest Whopper followed a similar sandwich , the A1 Halloween Whopper released for Halloween 2015 , which was prepared with black @-@ colored , smoke @-@ flavored buns . The Angry Whopper was released with a viral marketing push created by Burger King 's advertising agency at the time , Crispin Porter + Bogusky . The two tiered program , designed to create a word @-@ of @-@ mouth marketing push , featured a webpage that allowed consumers to create an " Angry @-@ gram " that could be emailed to other individuals . The form letter format page would send an insulting email to a recipient of choice from the sender . The second part consisted of a Facebook @-@ oriented program where the company would issue a coupon for a free sandwich if the consumer would de @-@ friend 10 people on their Facebook page . The Angriest Whopper was pitched using advertising similar to trailers for movie sequels , with a movie trailer @-@ style opening screen , shots of lava , a helicopter and flames . The tag line for the ad was " The only way to handle the heat is to embrace it . " 
 The BK 1 / 4 lb Burger was a direct competitor to the Quarter Pounder sandwich from McDonald 's . It consisted of a Whopper with only ketchup , mustard , pickle and onions .

 As part of the 45th anniversary of the Whopper sandwich in 2002 , Burger King introduced a grilled chicken version of the sandwich called the Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich along with a new Caesar salad sandwich topped with a Chicken Whopper patty . The introduction of the Chicken Whopper represented the company 's first move to extend the Whopper brand name beyond beef based sandwiches since the original Whopper 's introduction in the 1950s . The sandwiches featured a whole chicken breast filet , weighing either 4 @.@ 7 oz ( 130 g ) for the larger sandwich or a 3 @.@ 1 oz ( 88 g ) for the Jr . , mayonnaise , lettuce , and tomato on a sesame seed roll . A newly reformulated low fat mayonnaise was introduced in conjunction with the new sandwiches . Along with the company 's new BK Veggie sandwich , The Chicken Whopper Jr. version of the sandwich was lauded by the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) as being one of the best nutritionally sound products sold by a fast food chain . Conversely , the CSPI decried the rest of the Burger King menu as being vastly unhealthy . 
 Development of the sandwich began in 2001 in response to several major factors . After an overall sales decline of 17 % coupled with a profit decline of 29 % , Burger King held a series of consumer tests that showed the company 's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases . Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain . Furthermore , the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales . By July 2002 , the chain had sold nearly fifty million of the sandwiches , eventually displacing the BK Broiler 's initial launch figures as the company 's best selling product introduction . The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper was one of the few noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital ; Chicago @-@ based consulting firm Technomic Inc . President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper , but he said it was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful . Despite the Chicken Whopper 's initial success , just over a year after the its introduction , enthusiasm for the product was waning ; Burger King 's largest franchisee , Carrols Corporation , was complaining that the product line was a failure , describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name .

 One of the original slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper ; the claim is based on an exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not , represented by a binary number of 0 or 1 , raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time , ten , thus 210 = 1 @,@ 024 . This claim was later expanded to There are 221 @,@ 184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich . Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle the Whopper and Burger King : Home of the Whopper . [ Notes 3 ] 
 Where 's Herb ? was an advertising campaign for the sandwich from 1985 – 1986 designed by J. Walter Thompson . The television commercials featured a fictional character named Herb , who was described as a nerd who had never eaten a Burger King burger in his life . They called on fans to visit their local Burger King in the hope of finding Herb and winning a prize . The campaign also included an " I 'm not Herb " promotion , in which customers could get a discounted Whopper by including the phrase in their order . At first , people were confused because they did not know what Herb looked like . The promotion was poorly received by both franchises and the public , and its failure prompted Burger King to drop JWT in 1987 . 
 The Whopper has been at the center of several hoaxes and pranks from the company . In a 1998 April Fool 's Day prank , Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications such as USA Today advertising a new version of the sandwich called the " Left @-@ Handed Whopper " . The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180 ° to accommodate southpaws . Another prank from 2013 claimed that the company was introducing a " hands @-@ free Whopper holder " to allow people to eat the sandwich while doing other activities . The unit , similar to a harmonica holder , was supposed to be introduced in Puerto Rico to celebrate the company 's 50th anniversary . It was later revealed to be a joke . A 2007 advertising campaign celebrating the golden anniversary of the Whopper showed real customers in Las Vegas reacting to the false news the Whopper has been discontinued . While it was not permanently discontinued , the ad claims it was discontinued for one day . Later versions of the ads had customers receiving a Big Mac or Wendy 's Single and their reactions to the sandwich . In @-@ store ads , such as posters and tray @-@ liners , attack the size and quality of the Big Mac . The campaign won the 2009 Effie Award as one of the best restaurant advertising promotions for 2007 – 2008 . 
 Crispin , Porter + Bogusky , Burger King 's advertising company of record from 2003 @-@ 2011 , produced several notable ads for the Whopper . In December 2008 , Burger King purchased the rights to an advertising campaign that centered on a taste @-@ test marketing campaign , dubbed " Whopper Virgins " . The test claimed to target participants who were unaware of the existence of Burger King or McDonald 's , and had never eaten a hamburger . Three remote areas of the world — Baan Khun Chang <unk> , Thailand ; Kulusuk , Greenland ; and <unk> , Romania — were targeted . In the test , the " virgins " were asked to try both the McDonald 's Big Mac and the Burger King Whopper , and give their preference , if any . According to the advertisements and accompanying mini @-@ documentary , the Whopper was the most popular sandwich among the test subjects . A social media based promotion from Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2009 gave a free Whopper coupon for every 10 friends on Facebook a user would drop . The advertising program dubbed " Whopper Sacrifice " , was stopped after a week when Facebook canceled the Whopper Sacrifice account as a violation of its user privacy policy . This was despite the fact that the Burger King application was downloaded 60 @,@ 000 times and 200 @,@ 000 people were <unk> . The company 's final advertising campaign for the company was its " Whopper Lust " commercial which was a cross promotion with <unk> . The promotion had an image of a Whopper on channel 111 , and for every 5 minutes the image remained on the TV a free Whopper coupon would be sent to the subscriber . By the end of the promotion , over 50 @,@ 000 coupons were distributed . 
 After parting ways with Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2011 , the company hired the firm of McGarryBowen to handle its advertising . McGarry Bowen changed the direction of the advertisements so that they centered on the ingredients of the products instead of humor . One of the new advertisements produced by them featured the new California Whopper , made with guacamole , Swiss cheese and bacon . The new television spot had no words , only images of the ingredients for the sandwich being prepared and used to assemble the new sandwich accompanied by a pulsating soundtrack . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 Several of CP + B 's advertising programs for Burger King , including ones for the Whopper , drew criticism from groups for perceived cultural insensitivity or misogynistic themes within them . In May 2006 , in an American promotion of the Texas Double Whopper , Burger King released a campaign called the " <unk> " which parodies Helen Reddy 's " I Am Woman " . It depicts a man and his girlfriend at a fancy restaurant . Disappointed by the meager portions he is served , the man bursts into song , expressing his desire for a Texas Double Whopper , in place of what he deems " chick food . " As he walks out of the restaurant , he is joined by a chorus of men who rebel by not only eating Texas Double <unk> , but also go commando , lift a minivan over the side of an overpass , and unfurl a banner which says " Eat This Meat . " This has been the source of some controversy , as the commercial has been described as demeaning to male vegetarians / vegans , as well as misogynistic . 
 Another problematic CP + B advertising program was for the 2009 <unk> Whopper that featured commercial known as " The Little Mexican " . The <unk> Whopper was an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler . The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans . Additionally , the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag , a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner . Burger King eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology to the Mexican government . Conversely , the Mexican newspaper Excelsior issued a parody of the ad featuring American president Barack Obama as the cowboy and Mexican President Felipe Calderon as the wrestler as a commentary on the relationship between the two countries . 
 A 2013 Russian advertising campaign that possibly insinuated that the Whopper was better than heroin was pulled after the Russian television networks TNT , CTC , Rossia 2 and NTV objected to its content . The ad stated " This is a poppy . It was popular once , but now its time has passed " and featured a field of red poppies , the source of heroin . The Russian word for poppy is " mak " ( <unk> ) , a homophone for Mac — a major nickname for McDonald 's in Russia . The company refused to comment of the veracity of the networks ' claims , and instead posted the advertisement on its YouTube channel , eventually pulling it from that service as well .

 The BK Whopper Bar is limited service concept created by Burger King in 2009 . Whopper Bars are smaller footprint , specialized stores with a menu limited to the company 's Whopper , TenderCrisp and TenderGrill sandwiches ; drinks ; and desserts . The menu features higher @-@ end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations . The concept is similar to the McCafe concept from rival McDonald 's , and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into airports , casinos , and other areas with limited amounts of space . 
 The menu at the Whopper features as many as 10 variants on the Whopper , including the Western Whopper , the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper . Additionally , a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers , steak sauce or blue cheese . The open station differs from the company 's usual kitchen model in that it is in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back @-@ end of the store . The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept . 
 Additionally , the company sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations , including Budweiser , Bud Light , and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature . The move , designed to target the important 30 @-@ and @-@ under demographic , has been called risky by industry analysts because the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller . Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment , believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base .

 The 392nd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division ( German : 392 . ( Kroatische ) Infanterie @-@ Division , Croatian : 392 . ( hrvatska ) <unk> divizija ) was a so @-@ called " legionnaire " division of the German Army during World War II . It was formed in August 1943 using Croatian Home Guard soldiers with a German cadre . The division was commanded by Germans down to battalion and even company level in nearly all cases . Originally formed with the intention of service on the Eastern Front , this did not eventuate , and the division was used in anti @-@ Partisan operations in the territory of the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) until the end of the war . It was commonly known as the Blue Division . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Ante Pavelić , the leader of the newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) , offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front . This offer soon resulted in the formation and deployment of army , air force and naval detachments which , after being trained and equipped by Germany , were committed to fighting the Red Army . The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment , which was part of the 100th Jäger Division , but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943 . The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern Front , and the Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there . Due to the lack of trained leaders and staff , these divisions were raised using a German cadre . 
 Commencing on 17 August 1943 , the 392nd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division was assembled and trained in Austria as the third and last Croatian division raised for service in the Wehrmacht , following its sister divisions the 369th ( Croatian ) Infantry Division and 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division . One infantry regiment and the divisional artillery regiment were formed in Döllersheim , the other infantry regiment in Zwettl , the signals battalion in Stockerau and the pioneer battalion in Krems . It was built around 3 @,@ 500 German cadre troops , and 8 @,@ 500 soldiers of the Croatian Home Guard , the regular army of the NDH . It was formed under the command of Generalmajor Johann Mickl who remained its commander until the last weeks of the war . Mickl was an Austrian who had served under Erwin Rommel in France and North Africa , where he had been awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . He had also commanded the 11th Panzer Division on the Eastern Front , where he had received the Oak Leaves to his Knight 's Cross . The division wore Wehrmacht uniform with the coat @-@ of @-@ arms of the NDH on the right sleeve . Although originally intended for use on the Eastern Front , not long after its formation the Germans decided that the division would not be utilised outside the NDH . The division was deployed to the NDH in January 1944 to combat the Partisans in the territory of the puppet state . It was known as the " Blue Division " ( German : Blaue Division , Croatian : Plava divizija ) .

 = = = = Initial deployment = = = = 
 The first task of the division after its arrival in the western part of the NDH was to secure the Adriatic coastline along the Croatian Littoral between Rijeka and Karlobag ( including all islands except Krk ) and about 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) inland , and was a critical task due to German fears of an Anglo @-@ American landing on the Adriatic coast . This operation included securing the crucial supply route between Karlovac and Senj . These areas had been largely dominated by the Partisans since the Italian capitulation in autumn 1943 , in particular the port of Senj . The division was placed under the command of the XV Mountain Corps as part of the 2nd Panzer Army , and was initially headquartered in Karlovac . The division also took over responsibility for the security of the Zagreb @-@ Karlovac railway line from the 1st Cossack Division . The division was engaged by the Partisans from the first night in their garrison areas . Before the division had completed its initial deployment , it was called upon to relieve the NDH garrison of Ogulin . This involved a drive southwest from Karlovac between 13 and 16 January 1944 initially led by the 847th Infantry Regiment . In the first engagements with Partisan units , the Croatian soldiers panicked and their German leaders were quickly wounded or killed . When the bodies of those that had been killed were recovered , they were often found stripped of equipment and some were even found naked . On 16 January , Ogulin was relieved , but the advance was continued south to <unk> , and villages in that area were also secured .

This was followed by a series of engagements along the road to the coast , and after some close quarter fighting with the Partisan 13th Assault Division , they captured and destroyed most of that division 's supply dump northwest of Lokve and secured Senj . The 847th Infantry Regiment was then allocated the task of securing the coastline and the 846th Infantry Regiment was directed to secure the divisional main supply route from Senj to Generalski Stol . They started improved bases along the road , including Italian forts that had been established in the Kapela and Vratnik passes . The 847th Infantry Regiment spread out along the coastline between Karlobag and Crikvenica , and supported by elements of the divisional artillery and pioneers they began building fortifications against a feared Allied invasion . The troops in Karlobag linked up with the 264th Infantry Division who were responsible for the coast further to the southeast . The supply situation quickly became difficult due to Partisan interdiction of the route from Karlovac and Allied bombing of coastal shipping and Senj harbour . In late February or early March the 847th Regiment , supported by an Ustaše battalion , advanced on Plaški ( south of Ogulin ) when they were stopped by deep snow . Partisans then attacked their supply lines , killing 30 soldiers . Some of the bodies of the dead soldiers were looted or mutilated . After Plaški was captured , the Ustaše battalion independently pursued the Partisans and returned to Plaški with many of the looted items . 
 In March , the 847th Regiment occupied the Adriatic islands of Rab and Pag without encountering any Partisan resistance . In the same month , the 846th Regiment conducted an operation in the Gacka river valley around Otočac , and assisted the Croatian Home Guard in enforcing conscription orders on their own population in the divisional area . Through the spring of 1944 , the 846th Regiment used jadgkommandos , lightly armed and mobile " hunter teams " of company or battalion strength , to conduct follow @-@ up of sightings of Partisans , and transport moving through the Kapela Pass had to travel in convoy for security . The division was able to restore a land connection with the NDH garrison of Gospić which had been reliant on supply from the sea since the Italian surrender , and drove three Partisan battalions out of the outskirts of Otočac . One of the difficulties faced by the division in fighting in the mountains was the lack of mountain artillery which could accompany the battalions in the field . The divisional artillery was equipped with field howitzers with a range of 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) which seriously limited the artillery cover that could be provided during mobile operations . 
 In April 1944 , Mickl was promoted to Generalleutnant . The Germans identified that the Partisan 13th Assault Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury , hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages , basements , and even in fake graves in cemeteries . This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated . In mid @-@ April , Mickl ordered Operation <unk> ( Mace Blow ) to clear the area , using the 846th Infantry Regiment and parts of the 847th Infantry Regiment , supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion . Over the next two weeks , the division pushed the 13th Assault Division north to the area of <unk> and Delnice , and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions , including 30 tonnes ( 30 long tons ; 33 short tons ) of small arms ammunition and 15 tonnes ( 15 long tons ; 17 short tons ) of artillery ammunition . 
 On 5 May , the Partisan 35th Lika Division attacked from the Plitvice Lakes area and captured the village of <unk> . Partisans also interdicted the Otočac @-@ Gospić road . In response , Mickl planned Operation Morgenstern ( Morning Star ) to clear Partisan forces from the Krbavsko Polje region around Udbina . From 7 to 16 May 1944 , along with elements of the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division , the 92nd Motorised Regiment , a battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division , and Ustaše units , were involved in Operation Morgenstern . According to German sources , Operation Morgenstern resulted in significant Partisan losses , including 438 killed , 56 captured , and 18 defectors , as well as capturing weapons , ammunition , vehicles , animals and large amounts of equipment . Also in May , the division received 500 German reinforcements , and formed a field replacement battalion . The division saw action against the Partisans until the end of the war , often fighting alongside a grouping of Ustaše units that numbered up to 12 @,@ 000 troops . 
 = = = = Final months = = = = 
 During the last few months of the war , the division was engaged in the defence of the northern Adriatic coast and Lika . Mickl was shot in the head by Partisans near Senj on 9 April 1945 , and died in hospital in Rijeka the following day . The task of the division was to fight the 4th Partisan Army advancing from the south @-@ east , and to support the XCVII Corps , consisting of the 188th Mountain Division and 237th Infantry Divisions , which were in danger of being enveloped near Rijeka . The division arrived in the area of Rijeka in mid @-@ April 1945 . However , by April 1945 the Croatian manpower of the division had been significantly reduced due to desertions or release . Around this time , about 3 @,@ 000 Croats were released , leaving a small number of Croats remaining with the division . 
 Some of the released Croats apparently succeeded in travelling to the Slovene Littoral in the closing days of the war . They were then organised as a separate unit of the largely illusory remnant of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia under the command of General Matija <unk> , which was formally part of General Draža Mihailović 's Chetniks . The unit was under the direct command of General Miodrag Damjanović . Later the unit retreated to British @-@ occupied northern Italy . 
 The division , including its few remaining Croats were ordered to move north towards Klagenfurt in Austria . Some of the remaining Croat members of the division were killed while the XCVII Army Corps attempted to push through , but the formation lacked the strength to achieve its objective . As a result , on 5 May 1945 , Generaloberst Alexander Löhr , Commander @-@ in @-@ chief Southeast Europe , authorised the XCVII Army Corps , including the 392nd Division , to surrender . The Partisans accepted the German surrender on 7 May in the area between Rijeka and Ilirska Bistrica , at which time all the remaining Croats and some Italian fascist troops still fighting alongside the Germans within the Corps were released . For several days the disarmed German troops of the Corps were allowed to travel towards Germany , but on 12 May the Partisans decided to make them prisoners of war .

 = Shadowrun ( 1993 video game ) = 
 Shadowrun is a cyberpunk @-@ fantasy action role @-@ playing video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) , adapted from the tabletop role @-@ playing game Shadowrun by FASA . The video game was developed by Australian company Beam Software and first released in 1993 by Data East . 
 The game is loosely based on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co @-@ creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050 . The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage , a man suffering from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins . The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead , and eventually complete his mission . Harebrained Schemes ' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis . 
 A project to adapt Shadowrun for the SNES had a turbulent history between 1989 and 1993 , including having been halted in mid @-@ development before being resumed in late 1992 under a tight deadline . Its eventual lead designer was Paul Kidd , creator of Beam Software 's 1992 Nightshade , elements and a feel of which he then carried on to Shadowrun . The game was a critical success , winning a number of industry awards , but was a commercial failure nevertheless . It was retrospectively acclaimed by several publications as an " ahead of its time " milestone in the history of the role @-@ playing genre for the consoles and credited for having pioneered film noir style in video games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Shadowrun is an action role @-@ playing game ( RPG ) that combines the statistical factor of the original tabletop game ( with minor changes ) with real @-@ time gameplay . The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game 's isometrically displayed world . A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways , examining and picking up objects , engaging in conversation with non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) , and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat . 
 In interacting with other characters , Shadowrun allows the player to gain information using a bank of terms . Whenever Jake hears a new and unusual term , this word is highlighted and is then added to the bank that he can use ; from that point on , when speaking with NPCs , Jake is able to ask them about this new word ; only in this manner can a player progress with the game . As the title of the game implies , Jake is described as a " <unk> " , a mercenary type of character common within the Shadowrun world . The player is given the option to hire other <unk> as henchmen with " nuyen " , the game 's currency that can also be used to purchase guns and certain key items scattered throughout various locations . 
 Combat within Shadowrun often require sharp reflexes , as practically every screen contains hidden assassins who , from random locations , open fire on Jake ; the player may retreat or must otherwise immediately find the source of the attack and respond . Enemies typically drop nuyen , while at the same time , Jake builds up " karma " . If the player retires to a bed to restore health and save one 's progress , karma can be allocated into different attributes , skills , and magical powers . 
 At certain points in the game , Shadowrun allows the player to enter cyberspace . Using an item called a " <unk> " , Jake is able to hack into computers to retrieve information , as well as gain more nuyen . During such scenes , the gameplay switches to a top @-@ down perspective while an icon of Jake moves through cyberspace , fights intrusion programs , and retrieves data . If Jake dies in cyberspace , he dies in the outside world as well . 
 While the setting and a lot of gameplay elements are taken from the original pen and paper variant , certain gameplay elements have been modified . One example is that the " Condition Monitor " has been replaced with a more traditional hit points system , and the removal of the " Essence " mechanic , which decreases when <unk> is installed . This would reduce a character 's ability to use magic as the installation of <unk> is making one less alive , thus less in tune with magic . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Shadowrun is an adaptation of the FASA tabletop role @-@ playing game of the same name . The storyline of the video game is loosely based on the first Shadowrun novel , Never Deal with a Dragon , written by Robert N. Charrette . The narrative opens in Seattle , Washington in the year 2050 , where the protagonist Jake Armitage is shown being gunned down in the street . A shapeshifting lupine figure rushes to his side and is seen casting a spell over Jake before leaving hastily as the medics arrive on the scene . Jake awakens in a morgue with a complete memory loss . Soon , he is approached by the " Dog " , a shamanistic totem who gives him a warning before vanishing . 
 The rest of the story is spent investigating the events leading to Jake 's shooting , learning the identity of the shapeshifter who saved him , as well the person who ordered his assassination , a mysterious crime lord named " Drake " . Most of the information is found by piecing together snippets of data found by hacking various protected computer systems . Along the way , he has encounters with gangs , criminals , and magically awakened creatures while under constant threat of attack from contract killers . Jake also discovers and develops his own latent magical abilities . Apart from his totem spirit , his only allies are the hired services of <unk> . It is eventually revealed that Jake is a data courier who was carrying a program in a computer built inside his brain . The program was designed to destroy a malevolent artificial intelligence , which the <unk> Corporation is trying to protect . The company is being aided by Drake , who turns out to be a dragon and the mastermind behind the plot . 
 = = Development = = 
 The work to develop an adaptation of Shadowrun for the SNES by the Australian developer Beam Software began when Adam <unk> , part of the company 's management team , acquired the license for FASA 's 1989 tabletop RPG . The project was initially headed by Gregg Barnett until he abruptly left Beam midway through the game 's development to start Perfect Entertainment in the United Kingdom . The game 's production was halted by Beam , but eventually resumed before its set deadline . 
 Having been hired by Beam 's parent company Melbourne House , fantasy and sci @-@ fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett 's place as lead designer . According to Kidd , the given timeframe for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short , forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous five and a half to six months . An avid role @-@ player , Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license , but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved . Aspects of Beam 's earlier action @-@ adventure game Nightshade , of which Kidd was the writer , director and lead designer , were used as a basis for Shadowrun ; specific film noir components such as " dark cityscapes , dialogue @-@ heavy exchanges , and touches of humor " were adapted directly from the former to the latter . To coincide with the last of these qualities , Kidd and programmer Jeff <unk> altered the original " serious " tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements . According to Kidd , " we made improvements and changes , but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [ as in Nightshade ] . " 
 The ROM image of the first version of Shadowrun contains a much more crude script , with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases . For example , one line is changed from " morgue guys " to " chop shop guys " . The game 's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release , sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam 's staff . Kidd recalled : " Beam Software was a madhouse , a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes . The war was reaching shooting level ; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull . It was no longer a ' creative partnership ' in any way ; it was ' us ' and ' them ' . People were feeling creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects . " Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline . Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops , and continually keeping management away from the designers . 
 Shadowrun was released in North America and Japan by Data East . In PAL regions , it was self @-@ published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment . The 1994 Japanese version has a significantly longer introduction sequence than the English version of the game and also has a vertically uncompressed Shadowrun logo on the title screen . Other than that , it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions , just with Japanese subtitles . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game was met with a positive critical reception and good reviews . Shadowrun was given a number of awards from various publications , including the title of the Best RPG of the Year by VideoGames , Electronic Games , and Game Informer , and was a runner @-@ up for it in GamePro ( behind Secret of Mana ) . The game was given the second place Nintendo Power Award in the category " Most Innovative ( Super NES ) " ( it was also nominated in the category " For Challenge " ) , Nintendo Power describing it as " one of the best sci @-@ fi games ever " . However , the game sold poorly , partly because of low shipping numbers . 
 Shadowrun has been positively recounted in many <unk> lists and articles . It was listed it as the 34th best SNES game by Super Play in 1996 , as well as the 48th best game on any Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power in 1997 . Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011 , IGN commented that while Shadowrun " didn 't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes " it was still " a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry , though , so we can forgive the game for only being 90 % groundbreaking . " The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer , according to which " Shadowrun 's moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG 's prying conversations and self @-@ reflective narrative . " Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009 . IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010 , writing it was " without question , one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era " because it presented players with " a mature narrative , strong characters and a dystopian backdrop " blended with traditional RPG elements in an " irresistible " way . That same year , 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games " ahead of their time " for its use of a keyword dialogue system , common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time . 
 In 2002 , GameSpot included it on the list of video games that should be remade and compared this " groundbreaking RPG " that was " truly ahead of its time " to the more recent Planescape : Torment . A remake of the game was also requested by Sam <unk> of X360 , who called it a " rather excellent " , " little @-@ known classic " and " a cyberpunk RPG classic begging to return " , and stated : " Shadowrun would be a perfect game to remake as a Mass Effect @-@ style RPG – perhaps with the conversation system of the sadly much @-@ maligned Alpha Protocol . " In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked this " one incredibly unique , noir @-@ style story " as the third top " cult @-@ classic franchise " that should be rebooted similar to how X @-@ COM was .

 Two co @-@ licensed role @-@ playing video games of the same name were released around the same time by different developers and publishers : the 1994 North America @-@ exclusive Sega Genesis title by BlueSky Software and Sega , and the 1995 Japan @-@ exclusive Sega Mega @-@ CD title by Group <unk> and Compile . The storyline and gameplay of the SNES Shadowrun are completely different from these two games . In 2007 , FASA Studio and Microsoft Studios released a multiplayer first @-@ person shooter adaptation of the franchise for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows . 
 In 2012 , Harebrained Schemes announced that it would be producing a new Shadowrun role @-@ playing video game , Shadowrun Returns , to be funded through Kickstarter . As a result of the Kickstarter appeal reaching a 1 @.@ 5 million dollar target , Shadowrun 's original creator and FASA Corporation 's founder Jordan Weisman announced that the game would now feature an additional storyline tying in the new game with both the SNES game and the Sega Genesis game . This extra content was initially made available only to backers , becoming generally available some time after release . The protagonist of the SNES game , Jake Armitage , is featured in Shadowrun Returns as both part of the game 's main plotline and as an NPC that the player can hire to accompany them on various missions .

 Kevin Apaza , writing for Direct Lyrics , called the single very " catchy " , saying that it was different from the material she had released before ; he said that he " just [ doesn 't ] see [ the track ] as a European monster hit " and confessed that its lyrics and the video concept didn 't " make much sense " . To close his review , Apaza praised Maniacs 's vocal contribution to the song , calling his voice " cool " . Frederica de Martino , a writer for the Italian music website Canzoni Web , noted the commercial success of the recording , commenting that " it will be for sure as successful as her previous hits " . MTV Romania expected the track to become a " hit " .

 To promote the song , Stan embarked on a European tour , where she performed in Italy , United Kingdom , Turkey and Russia . Upon its release , Italian radio stations began playing the track on heavy rotation , thus making the song entering the top five of the iTunes Charts there after four days . An official music video for the song was first previewed with a teaser on 2 May 2016 , following which it was released onto YouTube on 3 May 2016 . Shot in Sofia , Bulgaria , at a heating power plant by Bulgarian director <unk> Borisov , Stan confessed about their collaboration that " [ she ] knew [ him ] for a long time and [ they ] wanted to collaborate already from [ her ] first music video . " Furthermore , she described the filming process as being " difficult " , as " the crew didn 't speak English or Romanian " . 
 The clip commences with a police car arriving at the heating power plant , followed by Stan lying on a bed surrounded by surveillance cameras , sporting black lingerie . She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie , while a crowd of male and female dancers perform a synchronized choreography . Following this , Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress , and a police car is shown arriving . Subsequently , two policemen get out of the car in order to search for Stan . However , they do not find her in the bed and the video ends with Stan leaving the building and the men watching material recorded by the surveillance cameras . 
 Alexandra Necula , writing for Romanian music website Info Music , said that the clip " exploited the sexuality and sensuality of the artist " , with her explaining that Stan 's appearance in the video portrayed a woman with pornographic tents . She said that Stan 's moves were " <unk> " , and compared one of her outfits throughout the video to Madonna . Urban.ro compared the choreography of the clip to Michael Jackson 's 1980s works . Los 40 Principales cited the video for " All My People " as one of Stan 's best clips ever .

 = Zdenko Blažeković = 
 Zdenko Blažeković ( 23 September 1915 – 12 January 1947 ) was a Croatian fascist official who held several posts in the World War II Ustaše regime in the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) . He was the student commissar at the Ustaše University Centre ( USS ) , leader of the male Ustaše Youth organisation and a sports commissioner in the NDH . 
 Born in the town of Bihać , he graduated from high school in Osijek before applying to join a polytechnic college in Zagreb with the intention of becoming a builder . He was a member of various Croatian cultural and athletic organizations during his youth , and even played as goalkeeper for Hajduk Osijek and <unk> football clubs . 
 Briefly a member of the conservative Croatian Peasant Party ( HSS ) , Blažeković was imprisoned several times by the Yugoslav authorities because of his involvement with various Croatian youth organizations which saw him often involved in clashes with left @-@ wing students . He joined the far @-@ right Ustaše in 1939 , and following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Ustaše @-@ led NDH in April 1941 , went on to be appointed to the newly formed Ustaše supervisory committee by Slavko Kvaternik . That same month he also became the leader of the Ustaše University Headquarters and the Ustaše Youth , charged with organizing student bodies at the University of Zagreb and promoting Ustaše 's policy of preventing all non @-@ Croats from attending universities in the country . 
 In 1942 he was involved in the formation of the 13th Ustaše Assault Company and by 1943 had attained a seat in the Croatian Parliament . Between 1942 and 1943 he was involved in recruiting students to join Ante Pavelić 's personal bodyguard and was promoted to the rank of major . He held the position of head of the Ustaše University Headquarters and Ustaše Youth until January 1945 , when he was appointed Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport . Blažeković fled Zagreb from the advancing Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945 and ended up in a refugee camp in Salzburg , Austria . In August , he was arrested by American forces who extradited him to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946 . He was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947 , sentenced to death , and executed the same day . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Zdenko Blažeković was born on 23 September 1915 in the town of Bihać , the son of local politician <unk> " Milan " Blažeković . Ethnically Croat , the Blažeković family was descended from 15th century tribesmen in the town of Livno . 
 Blažeković finished high school in Osijek and later applied to join a polytechnic college in Zagreb with the intention of becoming a builder . In 1935 , he became a member of the " Croatian Academic Society August Šenoa " ( Croatian : Hrvatsko <unk> <unk> August Šenoa , <unk> ) and by 1936 he became its vice @-@ president . A versatile athlete , he played as goalkeeper for the football clubs Hajduk in Osijek and <unk> in Zagreb . He also played tennis and was one of the founders of the Drava rowing club in Osijek . For a short period of time , Blažeković was a member of the Croatian Peasant Party ( Croatian : Hrvatska seljačka stranka , HSS ) . After leaving the party , he became involved in various Croatian youth organizations and was imprisoned several times in Zagreb and Osijek as a result . During this time , he was also involved in numerous violent confrontations with Communist students . 
 After attending a public celebration of HSS leader Vladko Maček 's birthday on 20 June 1935 , Blažeković was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve days in a prison on the island of Korčula . He was subsequently taken to Dubrovnik and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state , but was not convicted . In 1939 , he joined the Ustaše , a Croatian fascist organization which advocated armed struggle in achieving Croatia 's independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . During this period , he came into contact with the fascist leader Slavko Kvaternik . From late 1940 to early 1941 , Blažeković was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Ustaše and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture .

 = = = Invasion of Yugoslavia = = = 
 On 6 April 1941 Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia . Poorly equipped and poorly trained , the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated . The country was then dismembered by the occupying forces and the extreme nationalist and fascist Croat leader of the Ustaše Ante Pavelić – who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini 's Italy – was appointed Poglavnik ( leader ) of a newly established Ustaše @-@ led Croatian state , the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska or NDH ) . The NDH combined almost all of present @-@ day countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as parts of Serbia , into what was described as an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate " . Under the Ustaše regime , genocidal policies were implemented and directed against the Serb , Jewish and Romani populations living within the country . 
 = = = Command of the Ustaše University Centre and Ustaše Youth = = = 
 On 11 April , Kvaternik named Blažeković to the newly formed Ustaše supervisory committee . On 23 April , Blažeković led a crowd of more than 1 @,@ 100 Croatian students as they gathered in the courtyard of the University of Zagreb before going to St. Mark 's Square in central Zagreb to watch Pavelić give a speech . Here , Blažeković and the students swore loyalty to the Poglavnik and the NDH . In a speech of his own , Blažeković told Pavelić that he and the students were ready to follow him " in life and death " . When the Ustaše supervisory committee was disbanded on 9 May , Blažeković was named a commissioner in the main headquarters of the NDH . That same month , he was named the commander of the Ustaše University Headquarters ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , USS ) . Although this organization technically required all students in the NDH to become members , most kept away from membership . Increasingly , the USS became a wing of the NDH 's student elite with strict rules of membership and privileges , with members attending rallies at which Pavelić spoke and wearing Ustaše uniform . 
 In an interview with Novi list , Blažeković stated that all work at the University of Zagreb would be " in harmony with the new Ustaša spirit ... with which youth had been imbued for years in the decades when the university was the " battleground " of the Croatian struggle for liberation . " He went on to say that the first priority of the USS was to be the social welfare of students and the expansion of student dining rooms and residential halls . He declared that the structure of the university would change to conform with Ustaše principles – each faculty would have its own camp , consisting of a camp leader and seven adjutants responsible for military training , socio @-@ economic welfare , contacts , sports , professional training , education and journals . Blažeković explained that for the first year of academic study , the university would employ " veteran warriors " as teachers who were to be replaced by fully trained " younger forces " who had spent the previous year preparing for their new roles . Furthermore , he stated that student volunteers would collaborate in the creation and popularization of the USS and other Ustaše organizations , which , once they had established themselves in university life , were to establish a professional , non @-@ ideological student organization meant to incorporate all Croatian students . When asked if Serbs and Jews were to be permitted to attend universities in the NDH , Blažeković replied : " In the coming academic year , the university will be swept clean of foreigners hostile to Croatians and the Ustaše movement , and in this way our endeavours at the university will be made easier . " Later , while dining with the wife of a Swedish diplomat , Blažeković boasted of the large number of Serbs he had killed , claiming that he placed the ears of murdered Serbs on a necklace worn over his smoking jacket . 
 At the same time that he was appointed leader of the USS , Blažeković was also named commander of the male Ustaše Youth organisation . In its first months , many young Croats joined the movement , with recruitment being fuelled mostly by extreme Croatian nationalism . In addition , many were motivated to join because the Youth provided athletic , intellectual and artistic training for " the next generation of Ustaše leaders . " For others , membership gave " a sense of meaning to their lives " and was appealing because it represented " a youthful rebellion against the Yugoslav state . " By May , some Ustaše Youth camps publicly announced their refusal to accept new members as they lacked the capacity to do so . Although it is unclear how many young Croats joined the movement , Blažeković claimed a figure of half a million members . He defined the Ustaše Youth as a " secular movement " meant to promote " brotherly cooperation and mutual life " of peasant , working @-@ class and intellectual youths in the NDH . 
 In late 1941 Blažeković 's father was appointed mayor of Osijek , holding this position until 1942 . That year , the younger Blažeković became involved in the formation of the 13th Ustaše Assault Company , using his position as commander of the Ustaše Youth to convince many young Croats to join . In February 1942 , he became a member of the Croatian Parliament . Between 1942 and 1943 he participated in recruiting many students for Ante Pavelić 's personal bodyguards ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) He was later promoted to the rank of army major . In 1944 , he wrote a book titled The Youth and the State ( Croatian : <unk> i <unk> ) .

 Blažeković held the post of commander of the USS and commander of the Ustaše Youth until January 1945 , when he was named Commissioner at the State Directorate for Physical Education and Sports ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> za <unk> <unk> i <unk> , <unk> ) in the NDH . Upon taking this position , he introduced strict new sports laws that emphasized discipline during football matches and criminalised monetary and material rewards for athletes . Blažeković justified the new laws by saying : " Croatian sport is an amateur sport , and as such it will remain " . Attempting to tackle the problem of unruly crowds , he introduced new laws banning disorderly spectators from ever entering football stadiums . Warnings by Blažeković and the <unk> were regularly printed in daily party newspapers , calling for citizens and athletes to abide by the new laws .

 As Allied forces descended on Zagreb , Blažeković left the city on 6 May 1945 and fled from Slovenia into Austria . He was subsequently placed in a refugee camp in Salzburg . On 28 August , American forces arrested him and sent him to a detainment camp before having him extradited to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946 . Blažeković was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947 , sentenced to death , and executed the same day .

 Maryland Route 355 ( MD 355 ) is a 36 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 59 @.@ 14 km ) north – south road in western central Maryland in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is at the Washington , D.C. border in Friendship Heights , Montgomery County , where it continues south as Wisconsin Avenue into Washington . The northern terminus is just north of an overpass with Interstate 70 ( I @-@ 70 ) and U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) in the city of Frederick in Frederick County , where the road continues north through Frederick towards MD 26 . MD 355 serves as a major thoroughfare through Frederick and Montgomery counties , passing through Bethesda , Rockville , Gaithersburg , Germantown , Clarksburg , Hyattstown , Urbana , and Frederick , roughly parallel to I @-@ 270 . The southern portion of the route from the D.C. border to Germantown is a suburban four- to six @-@ lane divided highway lined with many businesses . North of Germantown , the route is predominantly a two lane rural road until it reaches Frederick , where it passes through commercial areas in the southern part of the city . 
 MD 355 is the original route of US 240 , which was planned in 1926 to run from Washington , D.C. north to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ; however , the route was designated a part of US 15 north of Frederick . This route served as the primary connector linking Frederick and points west to Washington , D.C. During the 1950s , US 240 was relocated in stages to the Washington National Pike , a freeway between Bethesda and Frederick shared with I @-@ 70S ( now I @-@ 270 ) . MD 355 was designated onto the former alignment of US 240 between Bethesda and Frederick as each stage of freeway was built . MD 355 was also designated through Frederick along Market Street , which was the former alignment of US 15 through the city before it was moved to a bypass in 1959 . US 240 was decommissioned in 1972 , and MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 to the Washington , D.C. border . In 2006 , the interchange with US 15 at the route ’ s northern terminus was removed , resulting in MD 355 ending just short of US 15 at a dead end . By 2009 , a four lane divided bypass of Urbana for MD 355 , funded by private developers , was completed . The former alignment of MD 355 through Urbana was designated as MD 355 Business ( MD 355 Bus . ) The same year , the portion of MD 355 north of I @-@ 70 was transferred to the city of Frederick and is no longer considered part of the route .

 = = History = = 
 The Rockville Pike portion of MD 355 dates back to colonial times and was used as an escape route from Washington during the War of 1812 as well as a route for settlers to travel from Montgomery County to developing areas north and west . In 1911 , a small portion of state highway leading northwest out of Rockville was completed , with the remainder between Rockville and Gaithersburg under contract . A state highway was proposed between Gaithersburg and Germantown . The state road between Gaithersburg and Germantown was finished by 1915 . By 1921 , the portions of state highway between the Washington , D.C. border and Rockville , to the northwest of Germantown , and between northwest of Urbana and Frederick were completed . At this time , a state highway was proposed between northwest of Germantown and northwest of Urbana . The state road was completed between Germantown and Clarksburg and through Urbana to a point southeast of the community by 1923 . The entire length of the state road connecting Washington , D.C. and Frederick was completed by 1927 . In the approved plan for the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , US 240 was planned to run from Washington , D.C. to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania via Frederick . In 1927 , US 240 was designated along the proposed 1926 route south of US 15 / US 40 in Frederick with the US 15 designation given to the road north of Frederick . In 1950 , US 240 was widened into a divided highway between the Washington , D.C. border and Bethesda . 
 In 1947 , plans were made to construct a freeway , the Washington National Pike ( now I @-@ 270 ) , parallel to US 240 . In 1953 , the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 ( now MD 85 ) in Frederick . The former alignment of US 240 between Clarksburg and Frederick was designated as US 240 Alt . A year later , the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in Germantown . At this time , the original alignment between Germantown and Frederick was designated MD 355 , replacing what was US 240 between Germantown and Clarksburg and the entire length of US 240 Alt. between Clarksburg and Frederick . The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956 , and MD 355 was subsequently extended south along the former alignment to the MD 28 intersection in Rockville . Also , the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40 . In 1957 , US 240 was upgraded to a divided highway between Bethesda and Rockville . The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958 , resulting in MD 355 being extended south along the former alignment to Montrose Road . I @-@ 70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959 . In addition , MD 355 was extended north to US 15 north of Frederick , passing through the city on Market Street , the one @-@ way pair of Market Street northbound and Bentz Street southbound in the downtown , and Market Street to the north of downtown . The route replaced US 15 / US 240 south of downtown Fredrick and US 15 north of downtown Frederick , with US 15 shifted to a bypass west of the city . In 1960 , I @-@ 70S / US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway , and MD 355 was extended south along former US 240 between Montrose Road and the Capital Beltway . 
 In 1972 , the American Association of State Highway Officials approved for the US 240 designation to be removed . As a result , MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 alignment to the Washington , D.C. border . MD 355 was widened into a divided highway between Rockville and Gaithersburg in 1977 . The divided highway was extended north from Gaithersburg to Germantown by 1997 . In 2006 , the northern terminus of MD 355 at the interchange with US 15 in Frederick was truncated to a dead end a short distance south of that route . In 2009 , the portion of MD 355 north of the I @-@ 70 overpass was transferred to the city of Frederick , with the MD 355 designation officially being removed from this stretch . In 2010 , an interchange was completed at Montrose Parkway . 
 A four @-@ lane divided bypass of Urbana was constructed for MD 355 in the 2000s . The primary reason for constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community brought on by the construction of numerous shopping centers in the area , and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center . The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic . The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway . On October 30 , 2008 , construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80 . The bypass was completed by January 2009 , at which point MD 355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD 355 Bus . In 2013 , maintenance of the bypass of MD 355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19 , 1910 . It states : " Ella Brown is the only child of a poor widower . Their home is in a small town in the Middle West , and Ella has never seen New York ( City ) , although she has always wanted to go there . Her father , finding times hard , decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska , and when the play opens , is about to start there . He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt , a sour old person who runs a boarding house , who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl . As she has no other relatives , there is nothing for her to do except submit . Sitting in her room one evening , tired after a day 's hard work , she looks at her two treasured magazines , one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion . The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes , and falls asleep . In her dream she is transported to New York , where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires . Ella greatly enjoys her visit , and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up . But she finds that her dream will become reality before long , for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory , and Alfred H. Moses , Jr. though none are specifically credited . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . 
 The plot of the film focuses on the father who leaves during the Alaska gold rush , possibly referring to the Klondike Gold Rush or the Nome Gold Rush , both of which had concluded by the time the film was produced . The dreams of Ella were shot in New York City . Bowers states , " It is evident that Edwin Thanhouser loved New York City , for over the years he used it as a background for numerous films in scenarios which often played upon its faults , but which on balance depicted the city as the ultimate destination for those seeking culture and entertainment . Indeed , Edwin himself was to spend the final years of his life there - in an apartment on Fifth Avenue . By using a scenic background such as New York City - or Coney Island , or Niagara Falls - Thanhouser created films which had two appeals , that of a travelogue in addition to whatever merits the plot might have had . "

 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on November 18 , 1910 . The film had a wide national release , with advertising theaters known in Kansas , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Nebraska , Arizona , Missouri , Texas , and Pennsylvania . The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World and it is a positive one . The reviewer states , " A clear presentation of the visions of a child who wanted to go to the city . The vision is , perhaps , a bit more beatific than the actual city , but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it . The awakening was rude , but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed . The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality . " Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production .

Hartley Mauditt and West Worldham are nearby , which , along with East Worldham , form the Parish of Worldham . The village is just east of the A31 road and contains St Mary 's Church and the Three Horse Shoes pub , amongst other buildings . Worldham Golf Course located just to west and Dean Farm Golf Course just to the east . For centuries the village and surrounding parish were owned by Winchester College . 
 = = History = = 
 Archaeological findings in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the area has been visited and inhabited since at least the Palaeolithic era . An Iron Age <unk> , dated to around 100 BC , lay on the summit of King John 's Hill , to the east of East Worldham . The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and <unk> Lane . 
 The village is believed to have been part of " Werildeham " , mentioned in the Domesday Book . There have been multiple spellings of the name , including Werildeham ; <unk> , 11th century ; <unk> , 12th century ; <unk> , 13th century ; <unk> and <unk> <unk> , 14th century ; and <unk> , 16th century . 
 For several centuries , the manor of East Worldham was held by the Venuz ( or <unk> ) family , associated with marshall service , a <unk> connected with the custody of the forests of Woolmer and Alice Holt . According to Samuel <unk> , " Robert de Venuz held the manors of East Worldham , in Hants , and <unk> , in Wilts , by the <unk> of performing the office of Marshal . These manors , by the Domesday Survey , are said to be held by Geoffrey le Marshal . From the proximity of the period there appears little doubt but that this <unk> left two daughters and <unk> , married to Robert de Venuz and Gilbert le Marshal , which latter seems to have acquired the office indicated by his name , not however without a dispute from his co @-@ inheritor , whose lands being held by virtue of serving the office , would entitle their holder to fill it . " A dispute arose concerning the inheritance of the manor in the early part of the 14th century . The Patent Rolls noted that , as the result of a trial in 1329 , it passed , on the death of Margery , widow of John <unk> , to the Burghersh family . There is also a recorded release by Thomas , son and heir of John de Venuz , to Sir John de Burghersh , knight , of all his right in East Worldham manor . Thomas Chaucer married Matilda , daughter and <unk> of Sir John Burghersh , nephew of Henry Burghersh , Bishop of Lincoln , becoming the owner of the manor . 
 Documents indicate the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village from at least the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property . In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years . The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating the existence of the Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329 , witnessed by a John de <unk> . For centuries , village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor ; the Shelleys , Freres , Sandals and Gurdons ( now merged into Old House Farm ) , and the Heathers , Clays , Porters , Park , Smiths and some descendants of these families continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist . The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region , including East Worldham , in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne ( 1789 ) . 
 By at least the mid @-@ 19th century , East Worldham and most of the parish of Worldham was owned by both Winchester College and the Dutton Estate . From the early 1860s when Dr. Fell became vicar in the village , East Worldham underwent dramatic change , which the renovation of the church and additions of hop kilns to the local farms and the building of new cottages , most of which form the urban landscape of the village today . In 1892 Mr Hall of Alton , financed the " lowering of the gradients of Worldham Hill by smoothing out four sections " , a steep hill which had caused many problems to the local inhabitants as it lay along the main road to the village . The first Parish Council meeting took place in 1894 in the schoolroom . 
 In May 1944 , a Junkers <unk> was shot down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was scattered across the nearby village of West Worldham , including the church wall . Later , the inhabitants had to be evacuated when a bomb fell into the field opposite Manor Farm , and had to be defused and removed by the Royal Engineers . In 1962 , the Dutton Estate holdings were sold to seven tenant farmers who retained the land they farmed but sold the remaining woodlands and properties .

The interior of the house contains Regency features , with a staircase , panelled doors in architraves , and several fireplaces . The coach house , 5 metres to the north of the house is also a listed building , dated to the early 19th century . It is made of <unk> ashlar , with the upper wall of the centre boarded with a hay loft door and has a hipped slate roof . Today this building functions as a garage and workshop . 
 The Old House Farmhouse on Shelleys Lane is believed by the parish authorities to have originally been the oldest building in the village , but the current building dates to only the 17th and early and late 19th century . The walls are made of coursed <unk> with brick dressings , rendered with a plinth . The roof is apparently unusual with the " northern half being of steeper pitch , both sections half @-@ hipped , with a slate roof above the wing . " It became a Grade II listed building on 1 May 1983 . The Manor Farmhouse building , also a Grade II listed building , dates to the early 17th century , with alterations in the mid @-@ 19th century , containing Victorian window sashes .

 = To the Last Man ( Torchwood ) = 
 " To the Last Man " is the third episode of the second series of the British science fiction television series Torchwood , which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 30 January 2008 . The episode was written by returning series guest writer Helen Raynor , directed by Andy Goddard and produced by Richard Stokes . As with every episode of Torchwood 's first two series , " To the Last Man " featured the five initial series regulars John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Burn Gorman , Naoko Mori and Gareth David Lloyd , with Mori 's character Toshiko Sato given the main focus . 
 The narrative centres on the intersection of Toshiko 's romance with Tommy Brockless ( Anthony Lewis ) , a ' cryogenically ' frozen soldier from World War I , and a number of hazardous time slips from 1918 . As the impending crisis becomes more severe , Toshiko must choose between the man she has fallen in love with and the world at stake . Tommy eventually elects to sacrifice himself and returns to 1918 , where Toshiko knows he will be executed because of his shellshock , in order to save the world . 
 " To the Last Man " was filmed as part of the first production block of Torchwood 's second series . Helen Raynor was inspired to write the episode to explore the issue of soldiers executed for cowardice during the First World War . The episode was watched by an aggregated total of 4 @.@ 97 million viewers across its first three showings . Critics were divided on the nature of the episode . The characterisation was largely praised , in addition to the romance between Tosh and Tommy , the atmosphere and the criticism of war . However , the storylining of the episode and the reliance on plot devices to advance the narrative was heavily criticised by some reviewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Tommy Brockless ( Anthony Lewis ) is a young World War I soldier , shell @-@ shocked from his experiences in the trenches . In 1918 , Torchwood agents Gerald Carter and Harriet Derbyshire ( Roderic Culver and Siobhan Hewlett ) take Tommy from the St Teilo 's military hospital in Cardiff to be kept in cryonic storage . They leave instructions for future Torchwood members that Tommy will one day be key to saving the world . In the present day it is revealed that Torchwood have kept Tommy in storage for almost a century , releasing him one day a year for a medical check @-@ up . 
 Whilst Tommy is under day @-@ release , Toshiko ( Naoko Mori ) elects to keep him company . Whilst Toshiko spends time with Tommy , Jack ( John Barrowman ) and Gwen ( Eve Myles ) discover that the abandoned Cardiff hospital is showing signs of time distortion , with elements of the 1918 hospital appearing in the present . Meanwhile , Toshiko and Tommy grow closer ; after an afternoon in the pub , he kisses her romantically . Later , Toshiko 's colleague Owen ( Burn Gorman ) realises that Toshiko has developed feelings for Tommy and warns her to be careful as he does not want her to get hurt . Upon their return , Jack realizes that the present year is when Tommy will be needed : he will have to travel back to 1918 and activate a Rift Key to close the connection between 1918 and the present and prevent disaster . As Tommy is due to be executed for cowardice three weeks after his return to 1918 , Tosh initially refuses to let him go back . Jack persuades her of the necessity of Tommy 's return . 
 After spending the night together , Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify , accompanied by Jack . During one disruption , the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team ; Jack relays instructions through Tommy for them to take the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives . Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye , and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption . However , when back in the past , Tommy becomes shell @-@ shocked , and is led back to his bed by nurses ; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state . At Torchwood 's headquarters , Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy 's mind . Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her . Despite this , Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key , and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate . Recovering from events , Tosh brushes off Owen 's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with Tommy .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 Helen Raynor , the writer of the episode , expressed an interest in writing a Toshiko @-@ centric episode at the first script meeting for the second series of Torchwood . She wanted to write a story centred on Toshiko because she " absolutely [ loves ] Tosh as a character " and wanted " to take her on another step " . Inspiration for the story came from a short fictional document written by James Goss for the in @-@ universe Torchwood Institute website created by BBC Online for the first series . The document detailed a man whom Torchwood would defrost " once a year , give him a day out , and then pop him back in the freezer " . Series creator Russell T Davies described the episode as a " love story " but felt it inevitable that the story would end in tears . In creating the character of Tommy Brockless , Raynor felt that he was " the perfect boyfriend " for Toshiko . However , she stated that their brief relationship was not a " mature relationship " but " a pretend relationship " as Toshiko only " gets him out of the box once a year " . She added that what Tosh has to learn is that Tommy can 't be " treated like a toy " . In regards to the conclusion of the episode , she stated that " it 's a hugely painful goodbye for both of them " . 
 Raynor was also inspired by the issue of World War I soldiers who were executed for cowardice when they were suffering from shellshock . One of the episode 's working titles was " Soldier 's Heart " , an American Civil War term for shellshock . The final title recalls an infamous order from Field Marshal Douglas Haig on 11 April 1918 , in response to the German Spring Offensive , which included the phrase : " Every position must be held to the last man : there must be no retirement " . This policy led shell @-@ shocked soldiers , like the fictional Tommy , to be sent back to war after a very short recuperation period . Director Andy Goddard felt that a scene in which Tommy watches footage of the Iraq War was key to the episode ; this experience tells Tommy that that the human condition has not changed since 1918 and that humanity still makes the same mistakes . During the episode , Jack suggests that the British army executed " more than 300 " shell @-@ shocked soldiers for cowardice during the First World War . Executions for all offences numbered 346 , of which 40 were for murder or mutiny . The remaining 306 were for desertion ( 266 ) , cowardice ( 18 ) , and other offences ( 22 ) . While some of these can now be attributed to shell shock , most cannot , although all 306 were posthumously pardoned in 2006 . Early drafts of the episode included Tommy asking for Suzie Costello , a member of the Torchwood Institute who had committed suicide in the series ' 2006 premiere episode . In regards to the sensitive material in the episode , actress Naoko Mori stated that whilst reading the script she " kind of forgot it was Torchwood and [ that ] it was science @-@ fiction " . She found the climax of the episode " heartbreaking " . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 " To The Last Man " was filmed alongside " Adam " as part of Block 1 of production . It was originally intended to be the fourth episode transmitted . The scenes featuring Toshiko and Tommy on the Penarth Pier were recorded , in between heavy rainfall , on 9 May 2007 and marked the first significant location shoot for the second series . Scenes set in Toshiko 's flat were also filmed this day at a house in Palace Road , Cardiff . The episode 's final scene , showing Toshiko and Owen looking out over Cardiff Bay was recorded 10 May . Cardiff Royal Infirmary provided the interior locations for scenes set in the fictional St Teilo 's military hospital which were filmed between 12 and 18 May . The pub where Toshiko and Tommy play pool was the Eli Jenkins on Bute Street , Cardiff . The Red Cross emblem is used throughout the episode ; the closing credits include the attribution : " Thanks to the British Red Cross for permission to use the Red Cross emblem . " 
 An important sequence within the episode was the time @-@ shift which ends in Tommy returning to 1918 . Goddard noted that the time @-@ shift " essentially happened off @-@ screen " and that what the audience sees is " great big wind machines and camera lights " . Anthony Lewis described the wind machine used as " the biggest wind machine I 've ever seen in my life " . He comments that the intensity of the wind machine and the lighting enabled an " instant @-@ made reaction " from himself and Mori . Goddard added that his first assistant director was " instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy " . The episode 's soundtrack included the song " One of These Mornings " by Moby , which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle , from his 2002 album , 18 . The track heard in the pub scene is " She 's Got You High " from Mumm @-@ Ra 's 2007 debut album These Things Move in Threes .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Ben Rawson @-@ Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode a four star review , stating that it provided " another example of a resoundingly triumphant ending that conveys so much via [ a ] simple image " . He praised the characterisation of Toshiko — stating that both Mori and Raynor " deserve a great deal of credit for reaching such dramatic heights " — and also the " refreshingly non @-@ mawkish glimpse at the brutality of war and humanity " . Ian Berriman of SFX was more mixed , giving the episode three stars and comparing it to a re @-@ written version of the series one episode " Captain Jack Harkness " . He felt that though the episode provided a " <unk> girlish side of Torchwood ’ s <unk> character " the characterisation did not add enough depth . Berriman acknowledged the " sweet , surprisingly subdued , almost coy " tone as an indicator of the programme 's flexibility , but added that he " [ prefers ] the show when it ’ s full @-@ blooded and outrageous . " Charlie Jane Anders of io9 gave a critical review , feeling that Toshiko and Tommy had " no chemistry " and that the episode seemed to convey that " men die for women 's wiles " . She felt that despite the flaws of the romance plot , the episode provided some " powerful stuff " and that Tommy 's plight was a strong concept if poorly resolved . 
 Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode 7 @.@ 9 out of ten , enjoying the time overlaps , the relationship between Toshiko and Tommy and the appearance of previous Torchwood employees . However , he felt that some of the episode 's plot elements strained the " credibility of the mythology " . Joan O 'Connell Herdman of Slant Magazine enjoyed the characterisation and British historical perspective the episode afforded , though stated that " characters make this episode , plot devices nearly destroy it . " She felt the main strength of the episode was the use of a science fiction crisis " to frame a story about love and sacrifice , the horrors of war and the burdens of command " . Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha felt that the episode succeeded in the atmosphere it created , opining that " 1918 is a fantastic setting for a ghost story " and that like " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " and " Sleeper " , the episode showed that " all the [ wrinkles ] from the first season have been completely ironed out " . 
 Den of Geek 's Andrew Mickel also enjoyed the episode , contrary to his expectations , having not been impressed by either Torchwood 's earlier stories nor Helen Raynor 's Doctor Who scripts . He appreciated that the episode centred on Toshiko , rather than Gwen whom he felt to be " a personal figure of hate " , and felt that Tommy was " endearing in a <unk> kind of way " . Mickel felt that Raynor " pulled off the characterisation that was so sorely missing from [ " Sleeper " ] " whilst also treating Tommy 's wartime origin with subtlety . Jason Hughes of AOL TV singled out the juxtaposition of Toshiko and Tommy 's romance and the military hospital ghost hauntings for praise . He compared the episode to a " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " episode of The X @-@ Files in that it " doesn 't do much to push the overall mythology of the series forward but still manages to capture what day @-@ to @-@ day life in Torchwood would be like " . 
 = Ko Olina Station and Center = 
 Ko Olina Station and Ko Olina Center make up a lifestyle center in the resort town of Ko Olina , a neighborhood in <unk> , Hawaii . The shopping mall opened in 2009 and consists of two centers located across a street from each other . Ko Olina Station debuted in 2009 , while the more recent Ko Olina Center finished construction in 2010 . The centers contain a total of approximately 31 retail tenants , with the majority of them being native Hawaiian businesses , such as ABC Stores and Peter Merriman 's <unk> Kitchen . 
 The center was modeled after a " rural " Hawaiian community , with its grocery store modeled after a " country store " . It is located directly north along the old Oahu Railway and Land Company tracks , and includes a mix of dining and retail options . 
 = = History = = 
 Ko Olina Station and Ko Olina Center were built to cater to those staying at any of the four Ko Olina resorts : <unk> , Four Seasons ' <unk> Resort , Ko Olina Beach Villas , and Marriott 's Ko Olina Beach Club . The shopping mall was built in the center of the Ko Olina Golf Club , which hosts the Lotte Championship for golf every spring since 2012 . The lifestyle center was developed by <unk> Group , with its first phase , Ko Olina Station , opening in 2009 . Ko Olina Center opened in 2010 , and unlike Station , featured a second floor for office space . Located directly across from <unk> , the center 's purpose is to " offer office space , speciality stores , restaurants , amenities and other services " to Ko Olina . Together , they consist of 56 @,@ 000 square feet ( 5 @,@ 200 m2 ) of retail and office space , with Station consisting of sixteen tenants and Center consisting of fourteen . 
 In 2014 , the center added several new retailers to their lineup , including <unk> Galleries , Island Sole , and <unk> Surf Co .. After this announcement followed the expansion of Pineapple Boutique , a luxury apparel retailer , that stated the opening of a second location within the mall . However , when the JW Marriott <unk> , a former resort in Ko Olina , announced its closure , the center 's tenants became worried about their businesses ; Frank <unk> , the owner of Pizza Corner , a local pizzeria , joked that his pizza parlor would " lose a slice of its sales " . As of June 2016 , the lifestyle center is approaching full capacity , with only 3 vacant retail tenants and 5 vacant office tenants .

 Many of the stores and tenants that are located in Ko Olina Station and Center were designed to resemble rural Hawaii .

Jessica Goolsby of <unk> described the store as a " fresh @-@ market concept " with " high @-@ quality foods " that contributes to a " one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind shopping experience " . The mall is located next to the old Oahu Railway and Land Company tracks , which originally hauled freight and passengers to the North Shore of Oahu ; this location influenced the overall design of the center , incorporating the " historic " feel of the railroads . 
 = The Bread @-@ Winners = 
 The Bread @-@ Winners : A Social Study is an 1883 novel by John Hay , former secretary to Abraham Lincoln who in 1898 became Secretary of State . The book takes an anti @-@ organized labor stance , and when published anonymously sold well and provoked considerable public interest in determining who the author was . 
 The plot of the book revolves around former army captain Arthur Farnham , a wealthy resident of Buffland ( an analog of Cleveland ) . He organizes Civil War veterans to keep the peace when the Bread @-@ winners , a group of lazy and <unk> workers , call a violent general strike . He is sought in marriage by the ambitious Maud Matchin , daughter of a carpenter , but instead takes a woman of his own class . 
 Hay wrote his only novel as a reaction to several strikes that affected him and his business interests in the 1870s and early 1880s . Originally published in installments in The Century Magazine , the book attracted wide interest . Hay had left hints as to his identity in the novel , and some guessed right , but he never acknowledged the book as his , and it did not appear with his name on it until after his death in 1905 . Hay 's hostile view of organized labor was soon seen as outdated , and the book is best remembered for its onetime popularity and controversial nature . 
 = = Plot = = 
 One of the wealthiest and most cultured residents of the famed Algonquin Avenue in Buffland ( a city intended to be Cleveland ) , Captain Arthur Farnham is a Civil War veteran and widower — his wife died of illness while accompanying him at a remote frontier post . Since he left the army , he has sought to involve himself in municipal affairs , but fails though political naiveté . The victorious party has allowed him the position of chairman of the library board . In that capacity , he is approached by Maud Matchin , daughter of carpenter Saul Matchin , a man content with his lot . His daughter is not , and seeks employment at the library as a means of bettering herself . Farnham agrees to put her case , but is defeated by a majority on the board , who have their own candidate . She finds herself attracted to Farnham , who is more interested in Alice Belding , daughter of his wealthy widow neighbor . 
 Saul Matchin had hoped that his daughter would become a house servant , but having attended high school , she feels herself too good for that . She is admired by Saul 's assistant Sam Sleeny , who lives with the <unk> , a match favored by her father . Sleeny is busy repairing Farnham 's outbuildings , and is made jealous by interactions between the captain and Maud . Seeing Sleeny 's discontent , Andrew Jackson Offitt ( true name Ananias ) , a locksmith and " professional reformer " , tries to get him to join the Bread @-@ winners , a labor organization . Sleeny is happy with his employment , " Old Saul Matchin and me come to an agreement about time and pay , and both of us was suited . Ef he 's got his heel into me , I don 't feel it , " but due to his unhappiness over Maud , is easy game for Offitt , who gets him to join , and to pay the dues that are Offitt 's visible means of support . 
 Maud has become convinced that she is in love with Farnham , and declares it to him . It is not reciprocated , and the scene is witnessed both by Mrs. Belding and by Sleeny . The widow believes Farnham when he states he had given Maud no encouragement , but her daughter , when her mother incautiously tells her of the incident , does not . When Farnham seeks to marry Alice , she turns him down and asks him never to renew the subject . 
 Offitt 's membership has tired of endless talk , and plans a general strike , a fact of which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple , a salty @-@ talking vice president of a rolling mill . An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue , including Farnham 's . The strike begins , paralyzing Buffland 's commerce , though it is initially nonviolent . Neither the mayor nor the chief of police , when approached by Farnham , are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue . Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans , and purchases weapons to arm them . After Farnham 's force rescues the mayor from being attacked , he <unk> them as special police — on condition there is no expense to the city . 
 Meanwhile , Maud tells her father she will never marry Sleeny . She is wooed by Bott , who is a spiritualist and a Bread @-@ winner , and also by Offitt . Neither meets success , though Offitt dexterously prevents her from actually saying no , and through flattery and stories of his alleged past piques her interest . 
 By the end of the second day of the strike , which has spread to Buffland 's rival city of Clearfield [ in the serialization , " <unk> " ] , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly . Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent , and aids Farnham 's force in turning back assaults on the captain 's house and on the Belding residence . Bott and Sleeny are captured by the force ; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman , and the carpenter serves only a few days . The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action , and soon most are back at work , though some agitators are dismissed . 
 Offitt , despite being one of the leaders of the assault on the Belding house , has escaped blame and befriends the sullen Sleeny on his release . Upon learning that some workers pay their landlord , Farnham , in the evening of the rent day at his home , Offitt comes up with a scheme — rob and murder Farnham and let Sleeny take the blame as Offitt elopes with Maud . Accordingly , Offitt sneaks into Farnham 's house with Sleeny 's hammer , but just as he is striking the fatal blow , Alice Belding , who can see what is going on from her house through an opera glass , screams , distracting Offitt enough so that Farnham is hurt by the blow , but not killed . Offitt hurries away with the money , and proceeds to frame Sleeny . After realizing Offitt 's treachery , Sleeny escapes jail and kills him . The stolen money is found on Offitt 's body , clearing Sleeny in the assault on Farnham , but the carpenter must still stand trial for the killing of Offitt , in which he is aided by partisan testimony from Maud . A sympathetic jury ignores the law to find him not guilty . Sleeny wins Maud 's hand in marriage , and Farnham and Alice Belding are to be wed .

 John Hay was born in Indiana in 1838 , and grew up in frontier Illinois . During his apprenticeship to become a lawyer in his uncle 's office in Springfield , he came to know Abraham Lincoln , and worked for his presidential campaign in 1860 . He was made Lincoln 's assistant personal secretary , and spent the years of the American Civil War working for him ; the two men forged a close relationship . 
 After the war , Hay worked for several years in diplomatic posts abroad , then in 1870 became a writer for Horace Greeley 's New @-@ York Tribune , continuing there under Whitelaw Reid after Greeley 's death in 1872 . Hay was a gifted writer for the Tribune , but also achieved success with literary works . In 1871 , he published Pike County Ballads , a group of poems written in the dialect of frontier Pike County , Illinois , where Hay had attended school . The same year , he published Castilian Days , a collection of essays on Spain , some of which had been written while Hay was posted as a diplomat in Madrid . 
 In 1873 , Hay began to woo Clara Stone , daughter of wealthy Cleveland industrialist Amasa Stone , and wed her in 1874 . The marriage made Hay wealthy . Hay and his wife moved to Cleveland , where Hay managed Amasa Stone 's investments . In December 1876 , a train of Stone 's Lake Shore Railway was crossing a bridge when the structure collapsed . The Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster , including the subsequent fire , killed 92 people , the worst rail disaster in American history to that point . Stone held the patent for the design of the bridge and was widely blamed ; he left Hay in charge of his businesses in mid @-@ 1877 as he went to travel in Europe . 
 Hay biographer Robert Gale recorded that between the publication of the last of Hay 's short fiction in 1871 and that of his only novel in 1883 , " Hay married money , entered into a lucrative business arrangement in Cleveland with his conservative father @-@ in @-@ law [ and ] joined the right wing of the Ohio Republican Party ... The Bread @-@ Winners was written by a person made essentially different as a result of these experiences . " 
 = = = Postwar labor troubles and literary reaction = = = 
 Although the American Civil War did not itself transform the United States from a largely agrarian to an urban society , it gave great impetus to a change already under way , especially in the North . The challenges of feeding , clothing , and equipping the Union Army caused the building or expansion of many factories and other establishments . This made many wealthy , and led to an industrialized America . 
 This transformation did not stop when the war ended ; industrial production in the United States increased by 75 % from 1865 to 1873 , making the U.S. second only to Britain in manufacturing output . Railroad construction made practical the exploitation of the trans @-@ Mississippi West . Although the railroads helped fuel an economic boom , they proved a two @-@ edged sword in the 1870s . The 1872 Crédit Mobilier scandal , over graft in the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad , shook the Grant administration to its highest levels . Railroad bankruptcies in the Panic of 1873 led to loss of jobs , wage cuts , and business failures . These disturbances culminated in the Railroad Strikes of 1877 , when workers struck over cut wages and loss of jobs . The action originally started on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad , but spread to other lines , including the Lake Shore , much to Hay 's outrage . Federal troops were sent by President Rutherford B. Hayes to quash the strikes , at the cost of over 100 civilian lives . The Lake Shore dispute , unlike those elsewhere , was settled without violence . Hay remained angry , and blamed foreign agitators for the dispute . He condemned the " unarmed rebellion of foreign workingmen , mostly Irish " and informed Stone by letter , " the very devil seems to have entered into the lower classes of working men and there are plenty of scoundrels to encourage them to all lengths . " 
 Public opinion was generally against the strikes in the 1877 disputes and called for them to be ended by force to preserve property and stability . The strike and its suppression featured in many books of the period , such as Thomas Stewart Denison 's An Iron Crown : A Tale of the Great Republic ( 1885 ) , with novelists often sympathizing with the demands of the strikers , though decrying their violence . Another labor dispute that likely affected Hay 's writing of The Bread @-@ Winners was the Cleveland Rolling Mills strike of June 1882 , which occurred just before Hay first submitted his manuscript . During the dispute , union members violently attempted to prevent strikebreakers from entering the mills . A third strike that may have affected the final form of The Bread @-@ Winners was that against Western Union in 1883 — Hay was then a director of that corporation . 
 Gale noted that The Bread @-@ Winners has sometimes been characterized as the first anti @-@ labor novel , but it was preceded by Thomas Bailey Aldrich 's The Stillwater Tragedy ( 1880 ) . Aldrich had little knowledge of workers , and his book was not successful . Nevertheless , The Stillwater Tragedy was one of a very few novels to deal with labor unions at all , prior to Hay 's book . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Scott Dalrymple , in his journal article on The Bread @-@ Winners , argues , " the brunt of Hay 's ire seems aimed less toward these working men themselves than toward troublesome union organizers . Left to their own devices , Hay believes , most laborers are reasonable creatures " . Hay biographers Howard L. Kushner and Anne H. Sherrill agree , writing that the author was attempting " to expose the way in which this class , due to its ignorance , fell prey to the <unk> of false social reformers " . To Hay , unions were dangerous as they manipulate the uneducated worker ; it was better for laborers to work out their pay and conditions individually with their employer , as Sleeny does with Matchin . In his journal article , Frederic Jaher notes that Offitt , a self @-@ described reformer , " is arrogant , tyrannical and self @-@ righteous . Hay 's message is clear : the established system needs no basic change ; eliminate the agitator and harmony returns . " 
 Offitt , at birth , was given the forenames Andrew Jackson , which according to Hay shows that the bearer " is the son of illiterate parents , with no family pride or affections , but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history " . Hay despised President Jackson and Jacksonian democracy , which he deemed corrupt and responsible for the continuation of the slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War . He feared a return to values he deemed <unk> , and made the Bread @-@ winners " the laziest and most incapable workmen in town " , whose ideals are pre @-@ industrialist and foreign in origin . Hay saw no excuse for violence ; as the will of the people could be expressed through the ballot , the remedy for any grievances was the next election . According to Gale , Hay " never loses an opportunity to demean the Irish " — they are depicted as talkative and easily led ( Offitt writes for the Irish Harp ) , and the reader is told that " there was not an Irish laborer in the city but knew his way to his ward club as well as to mass " . 
 Jaher noted that Hay 's view of what a worker should be is summed up in the character of Saul Matchin . Although a successful craftsman , he remains within the working class , not seeking to rise above his station , and is content with his lot . His children are not willing to remain within that class , however : the sons run away and the daughters seek to marry well , symbolizing the change being wrought by industrialization . Robert Dunne points out that the working classes are not depicted favorably in Hay 's novel , but as " stupid and ill @-@ bred , at the best loyal servants to the gentry and at the worst overly ambitious and a threat to the welfare of Buffland " . Sloane considers unfavorable depictions of the working classes inevitable given the plot , and less noticeable than skewed portrayals of the wealthy in other books of the time . 
 Farnham and Alice Belding are the two characters in the novel who were never part of the working class , but who are scions of wealth , and they are presented favorably . Other , self @-@ made members of the elite are depicted as more vulgar : Mrs. Belding 's indulgence in gossip endangers the budding romance between her daughter and Farnham , while Mr. Temple , though brave and steadfast , can only discuss a few topics , such as horse racing , and his speech is described as peppered with profanities . The rest of Buffland 's society , as displayed at a party at Temple 's house , is composed of " a group of gossipy matrons , vacuous town belles , and silly <unk> " . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Hay wrote The Bread @-@ Winners sometime during the winter or spring of 1881 – 82 . At the time , he was busy with his part of the massive Lincoln biography he was compiling with John Nicolay , Abraham Lincoln : A History . His work on the Lincoln project had been delayed by diphtheria and attendant medical treatment , and was further delayed by The Bread @-@ Winners , as once Hay began work on his only novel , he found himself unable to put it aside . The manuscript was completed by June 1882 , when he sent it to Richard Watson Gilder , editor of The Century Magazine , though whether he was submitting it for publication or advice is unclear . Gilder called it " a powerful book " , but did not immediately offer to publish it in his magazine . 
 Aside from his family and Gilder , likely the only person who knew that Hay was writing a novel was his friend Henry Adams . In 1880 , Adams had published Democracy : An American Novel , anonymously , and when Hay arrived in Britain in July 1882 , he found speculation as to its authorship to be a popular pursuit . He sent Adams a copy of a cheap British edition , writing " I think of writing a novel in a hurry and printing it as by the author of Democracy . " 
 During the summer of 1882 , Hay showed the manuscript to his friend , author William Dean Howells . Howells urged Aldrich , editor of the Atlantic Monthly , to publish it . Aldrich agreed , sight unseen , on condition that Hay allow his name to be used as author . Hay was not willing to permit this , and resubmitted the manuscript to Gilder , who agreed to Hay 's condition that it be published anonymously . In an anonymous letter to The Century Magazine after the book was published , Hay alleged that he chose not to reveal his name because he was engaged in business where his stature would be diminished if it were known he had written a novel . According to Dalrymple , the likely real reason was that if it were published under Hay 's name , it would harm his ambitions for office , for " to attack labor overtly , in print , would not have been politically prudent . " Tyler Dennett , in his Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning biography , speculated that Hay , in his later career , would not have been confirmed either as ambassador to Great Britain ( 1897 ) or as Secretary of State ( 1898 ) had senators associated him with The Bread @-@ Winners . 
 Although The Bread @-@ Winners was published anonymously , Hay left clues to his identity throughout the novel . Farnham leads the library board , as did Hay 's father . Hay 's brother Leonard served on the frontier , like Farnham ; another brother grew exotic flowers , as does Farnham . Algonquin Avenue , analog of Cleveland 's Euclid Avenue ( where Hay lived ) , is home to the novel 's protagonist . In the opening chapter , Farnham 's study is described in detail and closely resembles Hay 's . 
 = = Serialization = = 
 In March 1883 , the Century Company circulated a postcard , with copies likely going to newspapers and potential subscribers . Under the heading " Literary Note from The Century Co . " , and giving some information about the plot , it announced that an anonymous novel , " unusual in scene and subject , and powerful in treatment " would soon be serialized in the pages of the Century . The serial was originally supposed to begin in April or May , but was postponed because Frances Hodgson Burnett 's novel Through One Administration ran long . On July 20 , the date of release of the August number , the company placed newspaper advertisements for The Bread @-@ Winners , and stated that " the story ... abounds in local description and social studies , which heighten the interest and continually pique curiosity as to its authorship " . The Bread @-@ Winners appeared in the Century from August 1883 to January 1884 , when it was issued as a book by Harper and Brothers . 
 By July 25 , 1883 , Cleveland newspapers were taking note of the literary mystery , with initial guesses that the author was some former Clevelander who had moved east . In early August , the New @-@ York Tribune reported that the author was the late Leonard Case , a Cleveland industrialist and philanthropist — the manuscript had supposedly been found among his papers . Few believed the chronically ill and introverted bachelor could have created the vivid portrait of the shapely Maud Matchin . With Case dismissed , speculation turned to other Ohioans , including Cleveland Superintendent of Schools Burke Aaron Hinsdale , former congressman Albert Gallatin Riddle ( author of twelve books ) , and John Hay . The Boston Evening Transcript on August 18 stated , " we have an idea that none of these guesses are correct " . Others suggested that the anonymous author of Democracy ( Henry Adams 's authorship was not yet known ) had penned a second controversial work . 
 The furor fueled sales , with the Century later reporting that it gained 20 @,@ 000 new subscribers because of the serial . The August issue of the Century , in which the first four chapters were serialized , sold out . The September issue also sold out , but went to a second printing . The Century loudly proclaimed these facts in promotional advertisements , and that it was coining money as a result . As the second installment was read , and the character of Alice Belding became prominent , there was speculation in the press that a female hand had written the novel , with suspicion falling on Constance Fenimore Cooper ( great @-@ niece of James Fenimore Cooper ) , whose novels were set in eastern Ohio . On September 18 , the Washington correspondent for the Evening Transcript noted the resemblance of Farnham 's study to Hay 's . Other candidates for the authorship were Howells ( though he quickly denied it ) and Hay 's friend Clarence King , a writer and explorer . 
 On October 23 , 1883 , an interview with Hay , who had just returned from a trip to Colorado , appeared in the pages of the Cleveland Leader . Hay stated that such a novel would be beyond his powers , and that inaccuracies in the depiction of the local scene suggested to him that it was not written by a Clevelander . He offered no candidates who might have written it . Nevertheless , in November , the Leader ran a column speculating that Hay was the author , based on phrases used both in The Bread @-@ Winners and in Hay 's earlier book , Castilian Days , and by the fact that one character in the novel was from Salem , Indiana , Hay 's birthplace . Further textual analyses led a number of newspapers in early 1884 ( when the novel appeared in book form ) to state it had been written by Hay . 
 Tiring of the guessing game , some newspapers descended to satire . The New Orleans Daily Picayune surveyed the lengthy list of candidates and announced that " the authors of The Bread Winners [ sic ] will all meet at Chautauqua next summer " . Another columnist suggested that a statistic be put in the next census for the number of people named as the author . The appearance of President Arthur 's annual message to Congress in December 1883 caused the Rochester Herald to opine that he had written The Bread @-@ Winners " because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both " . Another Upstate New York paper , the Troy Times , evoked Parson Weems 's tales of George Washington : " We cannot tell a lie . We wrote The Bread winners [ sic ] with our own little hatchet . If any one doubts it , we can show him the hatchet . " This admission , the Buffalo Express felt , should put an end to the discussion .

 The Bread @-@ Winners received some favorable reviews , such as that by GP Lathrop in Atlantic Monthly in May 1884 . Lathrop applauded the author 's portrayal of the characters , and suggested that Maud Matchin was a notable addition to the " gallery of national types " in American literature . The Century reviewed the book the same month , in an article written by Howells , though he signed it only " W " . He saw Maud as " the great discovery of the book " and applauded it as a treatment of an area of American life not previously written about . Similarly , a reviewer for Harper 's Magazine liked the parts of the novel set among the lower classes . 
 According to David E. E. Sloane , " most American critics found it harder to overlook the coarseness of the book and its treatment of the labor problem . " A reviewer for Literary World in January 1884 called The Bread @-@ Winners a " greasy , slangy , malodorous book ... repulsive from the very first step " . The Dial , the following month , praised the author 's use of language but deemed the book " a preposterous tissue of incidents " populated by two sets of " exaggerated types " , one vicious , the other absurd . Continent , also in February 1884 , suggested that " the criticisms as a whole are severe , and justly so , the book being , with all its brilliancy , faithless and hopeless . " The Springfield Republic suggested that the author had " no sympathies beyond the circles of wealth and refinement " , from which " the workingman is either a murderous ruffian , or a senseless dupe , or a stolid , well @-@ meaning drudge , while the man of wealth is , necessarily , a refined , cultivated hero , handsome , stylish , fascinating " . A letter in The Century Magazine deemed the novel " a piece of snobbishness imported from England ... It is simply untruthful ... to continue the assertion that trade unions are mainly controlled and strikes originated by agitators , interested only for what they make out of them " . 
 British critics were generally more favorable toward the book than Americans . In a column in the Pall Mall Gazette , The Bread @-@ Winners was seen as " eminently clever and readable , a worthy contribution to that American novel @-@ literature which is at the present day , on the whole , ahead of our own , " a statement which Harper 's used in advertisements . A reviewer for London 's Saturday Review described the book as " one of the strongest and most striking stories of the last ten years " . 
 = = = Responses = = = 
 Hay 's novel provoked several works in response . Ohio Congressman Martin Foran announced in March 1884 that he would write a book rebutting the author 's view of labor , and published it in 1886 under the title The Other Side . Harriet Boomer Barber ( writing under the pen name Faith Templeton ) kept a number of Hay 's characters , while " turning the American industrial world into a sort of Christian utopia " in her Drafted In ( 1888 ) . Stephen Crane 's 1895 short story , " A Christmas Dinner Won in Battle " satirizes The Bread @-@ Winners . 
 The most successful response was The Money @-@ Makers ( 1885 ) , published anonymously by Henry Francis Keenan , a former colleague of Hay 's at the New @-@ York Tribune . Keenan 's work left little doubt that he had fixed on Hay as author of The Bread @-@ Winners , as it contains characters clearly evoking Hay , his family , and associates . Aaron Grimestone parallels Amasa Stone , Hay 's father @-@ in @-@ law . When the Academy Opera House collapses , taking hundreds of lives , Grimestone is deemed responsible for its faulty construction — as Stone was for the deaths in the Ashtabula railway disaster . Grimestone eventually commits suicide by shooting himself in his bathroom , as did Stone in 1883 . His daughter Eleanor parallels Clara Stone Hay , and Keenan 's descriptions of Eleanor make it clear she is , like Clara , heavyset . The character Archibald Hilliard is modeled after Hay , and the description of his appearance is that of Hay even to the mustache . Hilliard was a secretary to a high official in Washington , and later a diplomat and editor , entering journalism in the same year as Hay . Hilliard becomes a brilliant writer at the Atlas , a reforming New York paper like the Tribune , under the editorship of Horatio <unk> , that is , Tribune editor Whitelaw Reid . Although she is not physically attractive to him , Hilliard woos Eleanor , convincing himself he is not merely a fortune seeker . 
 When Hay received a copy of The Money @-@ Makers , according to later accounts , he is said to have hurried to New York to buy up as many copies as he could . He wrote the publisher , William Henry Appleton , complaining about the " savage libel " against Amasa Stone . Appleton agreed to several changes , including the manner of suicide , and undertook not to advertise the book further . Later in 1885 , a laudatory biographical sketch of Stone , written by " J.H. " , appeared in the Magazine of Western History , attributing Stone 's suicide to insomnia . According to Clifford A. Bender in his journal article on the Keenan book , " the principal reason The Money @-@ Makers has remained in obscurity seems to be that John Hay suppressed it , " and though he deemed it superior to The Bread @-@ Winners , Dalrymple suggests that Keenan 's book " seems more the product of a personal vendetta than an ideological disagreement " . 
 = = Publication and aftermath = = 
 By the standards of the day , The Bread @-@ Winners was a modest bestseller , with 25 @,@ 000 copies sold in the United States by mid @-@ 1885 . Two editions were published in Britain and a pirated edition in Canada , along with a reported sale of 3 @,@ 000 in the Australian colonies . Translations were published in French , German , and Swedish . By comparison , Adams 's Democracy sold only 14 @,@ 000 copies in the U.S. , and took four years to do so . Nevertheless , The Bread @-@ Winners did not compare with the leading bestsellers of the 1880s , such as Lew Wallace 's Ben Hur : A Tale of the Christ ( 1880 ) , which sold 290 @,@ 000 copies by 1888 , and Edward Bellamy 's story of the future , Looking Backward ( 1887 ) , which sold nearly 1 million copies in its first decade . 
 John Hay never acknowledged the book , nor was it attributed to him in his lifetime ; as Gilder put it , " guessing right isn 't finding out " . Hay and Adams amused themselves by suggesting that the other might have written it , with Hay writing to his friend , " if you have been guilty of this ... libel upon Cleveland , there is no <unk> possible in this or any subsequent worlds " . At Hay 's death in 1905 , obituarists were uncertain whether to assign the novel to him , an exception being The New York Times , which used handwriting analysis to link the book to him , and published it in its entirety over six Sundays later that year . In 1907 , with the permission of Clara Hay , the book was officially acknowledged as his , and in 1916 it was republished in John Hay 's name , with an introduction by his son , Clarence . 
 = = Historical view = = 
 Jaher opined that the book became antiquated as America evolved an understanding of industrial problems , and found Hay 's view of labor superficial . Accordingly , the book had little lasting influence , and is remembered only for its onetime popularity and controversy . According to Dalrymple , " the anti @-@ labor novels fail to hold up particularly well . None is a masterpiece of language , plotting , or characterization . Ideologically all seem quite heavy @-@ handed , choosing to make their points with a nearly complete lack of subtlety . " 
 Because of his prominence as a statesman , Hay has had a number of biographers in the century since his death . Sloane suggested that early biographers , aware of the nature of the novel 's themes , were defensive in their treatment of it . Lorenzo Sears , for example , who wrote of Hay in 1915 , called The Bread @-@ Winners one of several " waifs and strays " of Hay 's literary career . Dennett , writing in 1933 , deemed the book Hay 's honest effort to set forth a problem he could not solve . Other historians were more hostile : Vernon L. Parrington in 1930 called it a " dishonest book " and " a grotesque fabric smeared with unctuous morality " . More recently , Gale ( writing in 1978 ) described it as " a timely , popular and controversial novel that still rewards the sympathetic reader " , while Hay 's most recent biographer , John Taliaferro ( 2013 ) deemed it " certainly no love letter to [ Cleveland ] " . 
 = Mantis = 
 Mantises are an order ( Mantodea ) of insects that contains over 2 @,@ 400 species and about 430 genera in 15 families . The largest family is the Mantidae ( " mantids " ) . Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats . They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks . Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings , but all Mantodea have fore legs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey ; their upright posture , while remaining stationary with fore arms folded , has led to the common name praying mantis . 
 They are mostly ambush predators , but a few ground @-@ dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey . They normally live for about a year . In cooler climates , the adults lay eggs in autumn then die . The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring . Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism , eating their mates after copulation . Occasionally , the females decapitate the males just before or during mating . 
 The closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches ( Blattodea ) , which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera . Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects ( Phasmatodea ) , other elongated insects such as grasshoppers ( Orthoptera ) , or other insects with raptorial fore legs such as <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 Mantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations , including Ancient Greece , Ancient Egypt , and Assyria . A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale . Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Over 2 @,@ 400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized . They are predominantly found in tropical regions , but some live in temperate areas . The systematics of mantises have long been disputed . Mantises , along with stick insects ( Phasmatodea ) , were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches ( now Blattodea ) and rock crawlers ( now <unk> ) . Kristensen ( 1991 ) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera , suborder Mantodea . The name <unk> is formed from the Ancient Greek words <unk> ( mantis ) meaning " prophet " , and εἶδος ( eidos ) meaning " form " or " type " . It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister . The order is occasionally called the <unk> , using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis . The name <unk> properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae , which was , historically , the only family in the order . The other common name , praying mantis , applied to any species in the order , but in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa , comes from the typical " prayer @-@ like " posture with folded fore limbs . 
 The classification most commonly adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968 . He divided the order into eight families . Klass , in 1997 , studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families <unk> and <unk> diverged from the other families at an early date . However , the Mantidae and <unk> are both polyphyletic , so the Mantodea will have to be revised . 
 The earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old , from Siberia . Fossils of the group are rare : by 2007 , only about 25 fossil species were known . Fossil mantises , including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises , have been found in Cretaceous amber . Most fossils in amber are nymphs ; compression fossils ( in rock ) include adults . Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the 10 @-@ mm @-@ long <unk> <unk> , described in 2003 ; as in modern mantises , the front legs were adapted for catching prey . Well @-@ preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 μm through X @-@ ray computed tomography . 
 Because of the similar raptorial fore legs , <unk> may be confused with mantises . This similarity is an example of convergent evolution ; <unk> do not have the leathery forewings of mantises . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Anatomy = = = 
 Mantises have large , triangular heads with a beak @-@ like snout and mandibles . They have two bulbous compound eyes , three small simple eyes , and a pair of antennae . The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible ; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180 ° . The mantis thorax consists of a prothorax , a mesothorax , and a metathorax . In all species apart from the genus <unk> , the prothorax , which bears the head and fore legs , is much longer than the other two thoracic segments . The prothorax is also flexibly articulated , allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile . 
 Mantises have two spiked , grasping fore legs ( " raptorial legs " ) in which prey items are caught and held securely . In most insect legs , including the posterior four legs of a mantis , the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg ; in the raptorial legs , however , the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur , which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus ( see illustration ) . Located at the base of the femur is a set of <unk> spines , usually four in number , but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species . These spines are preceded by a number of tooth @-@ like tubercles , which , along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip , give the fore leg of the mantis its grasp on its prey . The fore leg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage , made of four or five segments and ending in a two @-@ toed claw with no <unk> . 
 Mantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous ( long @-@ winged ) , brachypterous ( short @-@ winged ) , <unk> ( vestigial @-@ winged ) , or <unk> ( wingless ) . If not wingless , a mantis has two sets of wings : the outer wings , or tegmina , are usually narrow and leathery . They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings , which are clearer and more delicate . The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites , with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females . The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females , but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes . 
 = = = Vision = = = 
 Mantises have stereo vision . They locate their prey by sight ; their compound eyes contain up to 10 @,@ 000 ommatidia . A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye , and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey . The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion ; when a moving object is noticed , the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea . Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis 's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea . The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated , affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range . The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a <unk> . This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed " head @-@ on " absorb the incident light , while those to the side reflect it . 
 As their hunting relies heavily on vision , mantises are primarily diurnal . Many species , however , fly at night , and then may be attracted to artificial lights . Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less @-@ mobile females by detecting their pheromones . Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would . Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding <unk> . 
 = = = Diet and predation = = = 
 Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods . The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach . They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary , waiting for prey to approach , or stalk their prey with slow , stealthy movements . Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species , as well as small vertebrates such as lizards and frogs . 
 Most mantises chase tempting prey if it strays close enough , and will go further when they are especially hungry . Once within reach , mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial fore legs . Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way . For example , members of a few genera such as the ground mantises , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> run over dry ground seeking prey , much as tiger beetles do . 
 The fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later . This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently . Chinese mantises live longer , grow faster , and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen . 
 = = = Antipredator adaptations = = = 
 Mantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs , lizards , and birds , and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants . Generally , mantises protect themselves by camouflage , most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds , both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey . Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence . The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics : They resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar . Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season ; at this time of year , bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire @-@ ravaged landscape ( fire melanism ) . 
 When directly threatened , many mantis species stand tall and spread their fore legs , with their wings fanning out wide . The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening , with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs . If harassment persists , a mantis may strike with its fore legs and attempt to pinch or bite . As part of the bluffing ( deimatic ) threat display , some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles . Mantises lack chemical protection , so their displays are largely bluff . When flying at night , at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats ; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly , indicating an approaching bat , they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground , often preceded by an aerial loop or spin . If caught , they may slash captors with their raptorial legs . 
 Mantises , like stick insects , show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic , repetitive side @-@ to @-@ side movements . Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of crypsis by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind . However , the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement , a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems . Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field . As ants may be predators of mantises , genera such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , like many other arthropods , avoid attacking them . Exploiting this behavior , a variety of arthropods , including some early @-@ instar mantises , mimic ants to evade their predators . 
 = = = Reproduction and life history = = = 
 The mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn , while in tropical areas , mating can occur at any time of the year . To mate following courtship , the male usually leaps onto the female 's back , clasping her thorax and wing bases with his fore legs . He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female 's abdomen . The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs , depending on the species . Eggs are typically deposited in a frothy mass @-@ produced by glands in the abdomen . This froth hardens , creating a protective capsule , which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca . Depending on the species , the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface , wrapped around a plant , or even deposited in the ground . Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs , they are often preyed on , especially by several species of parasitoid wasps . In a few species , mostly ground and bark mantises in the family <unk> , the mother guards the eggs . The cryptic <unk> maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule , ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch . A unique reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner 's stick mantis from the southern United States . No males have ever been found in this species , and the females breed parthenogenetically . In temperate climates , adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause , hatching in the spring . 
 As in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera , mantises go through three life stages : egg , nymph , and adult ( mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects ) . For smaller species , the eggs may hatch in 3 – 4 weeks as opposed to 4 – 6 weeks for larger species . The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult , and the early stages are often mimics of ants . A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton . Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached , depending on the species . After the final molt , most species have wings , though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ( " short @-@ winged " ) , particularly in the female sex . The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species ; smaller ones may live 4 – 8 weeks , while larger species may live 4 – 6 months . 
 = = = Sexual cannibalism = = = 
 Sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity . It has sometimes been observed in natural populations , where about a quarter of male @-@ female encounters results in the males being eaten by the female . Around 90 % of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism . Adult males typically outnumber females at first , but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage , possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males . In <unk> sinensis , 83 % of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female , but since multiple matings occur , the probability of a male 's being eaten increases cumulatively . 
 The female may begin feeding by biting off the male 's head ( as they do with regular prey ) , and if mating has begun , the male 's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm . Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen , not the head , removal of the male 's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance . Later , this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation . Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial . Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field , such as bright lights or moving scientists . Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum ( so that they were not hungry ) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed . The male engages the female in a courtship dance , to change her interest from feeding to mating . Under such circumstances , the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs . 
 The reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated ; experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets . Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring . This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized , in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization . This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution , and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time , indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females . The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed . The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males , for at this time , females most frequently cannibalize their mates . An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female , who would be likely to cannibalize her mate .

 One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya , which gives its attributes in poetry , where it represents courage and fearlessness , and a brief description . A later text , the <unk> <unk> <unk> Bencao ( " Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types , Based upon the Classics and Historical Works " ) from 1108 , gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages , the development cycle , anatomy , and the function of the antennae . Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources , a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth @-@ century BC silver coins , including <unk> , from Metapontum in Sicily . In the 10th century AD , Byzantine era <unk> , Suidas describes an insect resembling a slow @-@ moving green locust with long front legs . He translates <unk> 2 @.@ 94 with the words <unk> ( maybe a mantis ) and <unk> , an old woman , implying a thin , dried @-@ up stick of a body . 
 Western descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century . <unk> von <unk> illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( Insect Entertainments ) . 
 Aldous Huxley made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel Island ( the species was <unk> <unk> ) . The naturalist Gerald Durrell 's humorously autobiographical 1956 book My Family and Other Animals includes a four @-@ page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a gecko . Shortly before the fatal dénouement , Durrell narrates : 
 he [ Geronimo the gecko ] crashed into the mantis and made her reel , and grabbed the underside of her thorax in his jaws . Cicely [ the mantis ] retaliated by snapping both her front legs shut on Geronimo 's hind legs . They rustled and staggered across the ceiling and down the wall , each seeking to gain some advantage . 
 M. C. Escher 's woodcut Dream depicts a human @-@ sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop . The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster . 
 A cultural trope imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale . The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable , Guy and Rodd , <unk> , T. McCracken , and Mark Parisi , among others . It ends Isabella Rossellini 's short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel . 
 = = = Martial arts = = = 
 Two martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis . As one of these arts was developed in northern China , and the other in southern parts of the country , the arts are nowadays referred to ( both in English and Chinese ) as ' Northern Praying Mantis ' and ' Southern Praying Mantis ' . Both are very popular in China , and have also been exported to the West in recent decades .

 The mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture ; the word for the mantis in Afrikaans is <unk> ( " god of the Khoi " ) . Several ancient civilizations considered the insect to have supernatural powers ; for the Greeks , it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home ; in the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead the " bird @-@ fly " is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld ; in a list of 9th @-@ century BC Nineveh grasshoppers ( buru ) , the mantis is named necromancer ( buru @-@ <unk> ) and soothsayer ( buru @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . 
 = = = As pets = = = 
 Mantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets . Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year , people who want to keep mantises often breed them . At least 31 species are kept and bred in the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . The Independent described the " giant Asian praying mantis " as " part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk " , and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30 cm ( 12 in ) on each side . The Daily Mail recorded that a pet " <unk> mantis " in Arizona " lifted a dead goldfish " out of its bowl and ate it . The Daily South argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret , and that while a pet mantis was unusual , it would not " bark , shed , [ or ] need shots or a litter box " . 
 = = = For pest control = = = 
 Gardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests . However , mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents ; they do not specialize in a single pest insect , and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species , but are general predators . They eat whatever they can catch , including both harmful and beneficial insects . They therefore have " negligible value " in biological control . 
 Two species , the Chinese mantis and the European mantis , were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture ; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada .

 A prototype robot inspired by the fore legs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk , climb steps , and grasp objects . The multi @-@ jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint . Future models may include a more spiked fore leg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight . 
 = Speakers ' Corner , Singapore = 
 In Singapore , Speakers ' Corner is an area located within Hong Lim Park where citizens and permanent residents of Singapore may demonstrate , hold exhibitions and performances , and speak freely on most topics after prior registration on a government website . Such activities are heavily restricted in other parts of Singapore . 
 It was launched on 1 September 2000 as a " free speech area " where speaking events could be held without the need to apply for a licence under the Public Entertainments Act ( Cap . 257 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) , now the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ( Cap . 257 , 2001 Rev. Ed . ) ( " PEMA " ) . However , it was necessary for people to register their intention to speak at the venue with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post any time within 30 days before the event , though there was no requirement for the police to be informed of the topic of the proposed speech . Other conditions imposed were that speeches had to take place between 7 : 00 a.m. and 7 : 00 p.m. , and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited . In 2002 , exhibitions and performances were permitted to be held at Speakers ' Corner . Conditions for the use of Speakers ' Corner were further liberalized in 2008 . Responsibility for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance was taken over by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation , and online registration was introduced . It became possible to hold demonstrations provided they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents . Events can now be held around the clock , and self @-@ powered amplification devices like loudhailers may be used between 9 : 00 a.m. and 10 : 30 p.m. 
 At present , Speakers ' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations ( Cap . 216 , Rg . 1 , 2006 Rev. Ed . ) , the Public Entertainments and Meetings ( Speakers ' Corner ) ( Exemption ) ( No. 2 ) Order 2011 ( S 493 / 2011 ) ( issued under the PEMA ) and the Public Order ( Unrestricted Area ) ( No. 2 ) Order 2011 ( S 494 / 2011 ) ( issued under the Public Order Act 2009 ( No. 15 of 2009 ) ( " POA " ) ) . The applicable conditions have remained essentially unchanged . Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens , while participants at demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents . Banners , films , flags , photographs , placards , posters , signs , writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent , lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited . Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore ( English , Malay , Mandarin and Tamil ) or related dialects , and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event . Events must not deal with any matter that relates directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally , or which may cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill @-@ will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore . Events adhering to the regulations are not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition . 
 Articles 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) and ( b ) of the Constitution of Singapore respectively guarantee freedom of speech and expression and freedom of assembly to Singapore citizens . However , the PEMA and POA , which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held , were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights . Article 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect , among other things , Singapore 's security and public order , and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence . Under Article 14 ( 2 ) ( b ) , the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons . As Speakers ' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech , the pieces of subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with . Speakers ' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture , though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore . 
 = = Background and establishment = = 
 Singapore 's political model has been described as a representative democracy , and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) and ( b ) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore . The constitutional rights to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens . Hence , the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non @-@ citizens enjoy only common law free speech . Articles 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) and ( b ) are then subject to Articles 14 ( 2 ) ( a ) and ( b ) which allow Parliament to impose , by law , restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly . The grounds for restrictions are , for freedom of speech , Singapore 's security , friendly relations with other states , public order , public morality , protecting parliamentary privilege , defamation , contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence ; and for freedom of assembly , public order only . These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering . 
 In response to these free speech concerns , Speakers ' Corner was created as local adaptation of the Speakers ' Corner in Hyde Park , London , in 2000 . In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist William Safire , the Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the idea had first been suggested by the Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew , but Goh felt that it was not yet the right time to set it up . The following year , the Government decided to go ahead despite its fear of potential public disorder , as the idea enjoyed widespread support from the public and civil society groups . During a Parliamentary debate on the issue on 25 April 2000 , opposition Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng whether this was a " mere show " or whether the Government was serious about promoting free speech in Singapore . If the latter , he asked if the Minister would agree to an open debate with the Workers ' Party of Singapore outside Parliament . In response , Wong said there was nothing to prevent Jeyaretnam from making a speech at Speakers ' Corner , but that the public forum for a proper policy debate was in Parliament : 
 It is not just a question of symbolism . Of course , we have a place to show . It is symbolism in the sense that , yes , if you want a place , there is a place . But for free speech , I think we must not delude ourselves . He [ Jeyaretnam ] can do so on the Internet . He can do so with the press . He can do so in any place he wants , subject to the rules of the land . And he can do so right here . So , what is the worry about having free speech ? There is free speech all the time . It is a question of whether he is prepared to have it or not . Do not run away from it . When we give him an answer , stay here to listen . 
 Speakers ' Corner was launched on 1 September 2000 at Hong Lim Park , a historical venue for political speeches and rallies . The park 's proximity to the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post ( NPP ) also made it convenient for people to register to speak at the venue . In the first nine months , more than a thousand speeches were made . 
 = = Regulations governing usage = = 
 = = = Previous regulations = = = 
 Speakers ' Corner was established by the issuance of the Public Entertainments ( Speakers ' Corner ) ( Exemption ) Order 2000 , which exempted people wishing to speak in Hong Lim Park from the need to apply for a licence under the Public Entertainments Act . Speakers had to be Singapore citizens , as the Government was concerned that the venue should not be used by foreigners " to pursue their own agenda whether in respect of their own domestic issues , or those of other countries , including Singapore 's " . They also had to register their intention to speak with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer NPP any time within 30 days before the public speaking , although there was no need to inform the police of the topic of the proposed speech . However , speakers were not permitted to deal with any matter which related either directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally , or which might cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill @-@ will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore . 
 On 15 February 2002 , while at Speakers ' Corner , Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan attacked the Government 's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the <unk> ( Islamic headscarf ) to public schools . Contrary to police advice , he chose not to apply for a public entertainment licence , arguing he did not need one . Chee 's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans . In July , Chee was convicted and fined S $ 3 @,@ 000 for speaking without the required licence . In his judgment , District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi @-@ racial and multi @-@ religious Singapore , finding that Chee 's speech had bred social unrest . Under the Constitution of Singapore , a person who has been fined at least $ 2 @,@ 000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years . As a result of the incident , Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections . 
 Other conditions imposed on a speech at Speakers ' Corner were that it had to take place only between 7 : 00 a.m. and 7 : 00 p.m. on the date notified by the person to the police , had to be in any of Singapore 's four official languages ( English , Malay , Mandarin or Tamil ) or any related dialects , and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited . The latter restriction was justified on the grounds that it would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one , and that it also applied to Speakers ' Corner in London . 
 In 2002 , exhibitions and performances were also permitted to be held at Speakers ' Corner . The conditions that organizers and participants had to adhere to were broadly similar to those applying to speeches . In addition , the organizer or an authorized agent had to be present at all times during the exhibition or performance , the event could not contain violent , lewd or obscene messages , no banners or placards could be carried by participants , and the event could not be an assembly or procession for which a permit was required under the Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) ( Assemblies and Processions ) Rules . 
 = = = Current regulations = = = 
 With effect from 1 September 2008 , under the Public Entertainments and Meetings ( Speakers ' Corner ) ( Exemption ) Order 2008 ( " 2008 PEMA Order " ) , responsibility for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers ' Corner was taken over from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of an amendment to the Parks and Trees Regulations . To provide greater convenience , the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website . In addition , it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents . As the time period restriction was lifted , events can now be held around the clock . In addition , rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self @-@ powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 30 p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers ' messages to be heard by larger audiences . A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers ' Corner – no banner , film , photograph , placard or poster containing any violent , lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before , during or after the event . 
 In the first month after public demonstrations were permitted at Speakers ' Corner , 11 out of the 31 applications received were indicated as being public protests . <unk> of Cries , a group concerned with the plight of abused maids , became the first group to hold a public outdoor demonstration at Speakers ' Corner . 
 The Public Order Act , intended to regulate public assemblies and processions and to introduce new powers for the preservation of public order , came into force on 9 October 2009 . On the same day , the Public Order ( Unrestricted Area ) Order 2009 ( " 2009 POA Order " ) made pursuant to the Act declared that Speakers ' Corner was an unrestricted area in which assemblies and processions could be held without the need for a police permit . Thus , at present , Speakers ' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations , and by exemption orders issued under the PEMA and POA . The conditions under which addresses , debates , demonstrations , discussions , lectures and talks ( whether or not together with any exhibition , performance , play @-@ reading or recital ) , must be held have remained essentially unchanged . Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens , while participants in demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents . Banners , films , flags , photographs , placards , posters , signs , writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent , lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited . Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore or related dialects , and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event . In January 2008 , the Complaints Choir , a vocal group participating in the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2008 , was denied the chance to perform at Speakers ' Corner and other outdoor venues unless the six foreigners in the group of 50 did not participate in the performance . As the choir did not wish to be split up in any way , it decided not to go ahead with the performance . <unk> on the matter in Parliament , the Minister for Communication , Information and the Arts Dr. Lee Boon Yang stated that the Government did not think it " desirable or good precedent " for " foreigners [ to come ] here to organise and to lead Singaporeans to complain about our domestic issues " . 
 Crucially , events held at Speakers ' Corner must not deal with any matter that relates directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally , or which may cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill @-@ will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore . On 19 September 2008 , <unk> <unk> , an Indian real estate agent who wished to speak at Speakers ' Corner about the use of Tamil on public signs , had to change his plans after being informed by the police that he required a permit as the topic of his speech was racially sensitive . A subsequent application for a permit was turned down . 
 A contravention of the regulations renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations liable to fines of up to $ 10 @,@ 000 , or incarceration of up to six months . The penalty for displaying anything violent , lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $ 3 @,@ 000 or , on a subsequent conviction , $ 5 @,@ 000 . Events which adhere to the regulations are also not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition . 
 In 2011 , the regulations creating Speakers ' Corner were suspended and then restored twice : first for the purpose of the campaigning period during the general election , and subsequently for the presidential election . 
 = = Relation to the rights to free speech and assembly = = 
 In his 2008 National Day Rally speech , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated that the purpose behind various government policies , including the creation of Speakers ' Corner , was to " liberalise our society , to widen the space for expression and participation " . Its reception was mixed , however , and there have been a wide range of views and perspectives on the impact of Speakers ' Corner in increasing the space for free speech and the freedom to assemble . It has been called an " exercise in tokenism " for the purpose of preserving a literal " space " for engaging in free speech while also " cornering " it in that space . This is reflected in the relative lack of progress towards liberalization in other areas such as awards of high damages in libel lawsuits brought by politicians which has been said to have a chilling effect on political speech in Singapore . Former Workers ' Party member James Gomez has also expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Speakers ' Corner as a site of vibrant political debate , citing the lack of a " culture of speaking " amongst Singaporeans . The ban on racially or religiously sensitive speech has been criticized as possibly curtailing free speech on genuine political matters and limiting the scope of constitutionally entrenched fundamental liberties . 
 Despite such criticisms , some social activist groups remain optimistic that Speakers ' Corner represents a step towards political liberalization and the promise of a wider political space . Although Dr. Kenneth Paul Tan , Assistant Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy , has noted that initial cynicism was inevitable as Speakers ' Corner was a top @-@ down initiative , he recognizes that civil society activists have since actively occupied and made use of Speakers ' Corner to generate public interest in various social and political issues . This view is shared by Professor <unk> Singh , a political science analyst at the National University of Singapore , who has pointed to large turnouts at events organized at Speakers ' Corner as evidence that Singaporeans are " not fearful and not politically apathetic . " 
 The government has also shown itself to be sensitive to calls for greater liberalisation on the ground , with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledging incremental changes to the rules and regulations at Speakers ' Corner to be necessary for " more citizens to engage in debate " and to " progressively open up our system even more " .

 In 2008 , Speakers ' Corner was the scene for meetings held over several weeks by Tan Kin Lian , former chief executive of insurance company NTUC Income , to advise people of their legal recourse after structured products they had purchased became virtually valueless upon the collapse of Lehman Brothers . On 23 January 2009 during an event at Speakers ' Corner , the National Solidarity Party gave its views on the national budget one day after it was announced , criticizing the Government for not doing enough to assist unemployed breadwinners during the recession . The Party 's secretary @-@ general , Ken Sunn , said the event was to let Singaporeans " participate , speak and hear various views and opinions on the Singapore Government 's 2009 Budget statement , and discuss ways to improve our Singapore Economy " . The first public rally by the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community in Singapore , called Pink Dot SG , was held on 16 May 2009 . Estimates of the number of people who attended ranged from 1 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 500 people . Held every year since , the event was attended by 28 @,@ 000 people in 2015 . On 31 May 2009 , more than a hundred people attended a demonstration at Speakers ' Corner organized by human rights advocacy group <unk> to call for Myanmar 's military junta to release Aung San Suu Kyi . Participants from Myanmar were requested to remain outside a cordoned @-@ off area since only Singaporeans and permanent residents may attend demonstrations at Speakers ' Corner . 
 In July 2009 , the police installed closed circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras for " safety and security " . The police said that the cameras complemented the presence of their officers on the ground and did not record audio inputs . The move drew some negative reactions from the public . Former Nominated Member of Parliament Siew Kum Hong felt that the installation of CCTV cameras was " pretty ridiculous " , and wondered if the move might feed the perception in some quarters that Singapore is a police state , since Speakers ' Corner is " the one place in Singapore " where people can demonstrate . Nevertheless , the cameras have not affected various events from being held . With effect from 1 December 2009 , the size of Speakers ' Corner was reduced so that it only occupies the half of Hong Lim Park nearer New Bridge Road . From 1 March 2012 , Speakers ' Corner was expanded to include an area behind Kreta Ayer NPP , near the junction of North Canal Road and South Bridge Road . 
 A commemorative birthday memorial was organized for J.B. Jeyaretnam , the late leader of the opposition Reform Party , at Speakers ' Corner on 5 January 2010 . At the event , several opposition politicians shared with the public their experiences with Jeyaretnam . 
 In September 2010 , Today newspaper reported that statistics from the National Parks Board indicated that the number of groups registering to stage events at Speakers ' Corner had fallen from 39 between September 2008 and August 2009 , to nine between September 2009 and August 2010 . The number of individuals registering dropped from 102 to 57 during the same periods . Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong , who was Prime Minister when Speakers ' Corner was set up , expressed the view that its use had declined because there were now other avenues for people to express themselves such as the Internet ( including the Government 's online feedback portal Reach ) , newspapers , and radio and television channels . Also , people might feel that the venue is not always the best place " to meaningfully and constructively press their views on issues " . He saw Speakers ' Corner as " playing the same role as envisaged – mostly dormant but good to have " .

 York City Football Club was founded in 1908 as an amateur club , and joined the Northern League and acquired a ground in Holgate Road . They left the Northern League after two seasons when joining the Yorkshire Combination to reduce travelling . The club turned professional in 1912 and purchased a new ground at Field View . York joined the Midland League , where they played for three seasons , rising as high as 10th @-@ place in 1912 – 13 . They played their final season in 1914 – 15 , after which the competition was suspended due to the First World War . The club into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed for payment for the ground 's stand . 
 The club was re @-@ founded as York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited on 6 May 1922 and gained admission into the Midland League , after an unsuccessful application to join the Football League . York ranked in 19th @-@ place in 1922 – 23 and 1923 – 24 , and entered the FA Cup for the first time in the latter . York played in the Midland League for seven seasons , achieving a highest finish of sixth , in 1924 – 25 and 1926 – 27 . They surpassed the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup for the first time in 1926 – 27 , when they were beaten 2 – 1 by Second Division club Grimsby Town in the second round . The club made its first serious attempt for election into the Football League in May 1937 , but this was unsuccessful as Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re @-@ elected . However , the club was successful two years later , being elected into the Football League in June 1929 to replace Ashington in the Third Division North . 
 York won 2 – 0 against Wigan Borough in their first match in the Football League , and finished 1929 – 30 sixth in the Third Division North . Three years later , York only avoided having to seek re @-@ election after winning the last match of 1932 – 33 . In the 1937 – 38 FA Cup , they eliminated First Division sides West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough , and drew 0 – 0 at home to Huddersfield Town in the sixth round , before losing the replay 2 – 1 at Leeds Road . York had been challenging for promotion in 1937 – 38 before faltering in the closing weeks , and in the following season only avoided having to apply for re @-@ election with victory in the penultimate match . They participated in the regional competitions organised by the Football League upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 . York played in wartime competitions for seven seasons , and in 1942 won the Combined Counties Cup .

 = = Club identity = = 
 York are nicknamed " the Minstermen " , in reference to York Minster . It is believed to have been coined by a journalist who came to watch the team during a successful cup run , and was only first used officially in literature in 1972 . Before this , York were known as " the Robins " , because of the team 's red shirts . They were billed " the Happy Wanderers " , after a popular song , at the time of their run in the 1954 – 55 FA Cup . 
 For most of the club 's history , York have worn red shirts . However , in the club 's first season , 1922 – 23 , the kit comprised maroon shirts , white shorts and black socks were worn . Maroon and white striped shirts were worn for three years in the mid 1920s , before the maroon shirts returned . In 1933 , York changed their maroon jerseys to chocolate and cream stripes , a reference to the city 's association with the confectionery industry . After four years they changed their colours to what were described as " distinctive red shirts " , with the official explanation that the striped jerseys clashed with opponents too often . York continued to don red shirts before a two @-@ year spell of wearing all @-@ white kits from 1967 to 1969 . 
 York resumed wearing maroon shirts with white shorts in 1970 . To mark their promotion into the Second Division in 1974 , a bold white " Y " was added to the shirts , which became known as the " Y @-@ fronts " . Red shirts returned in 1978 , along with the introduction of navy blue shorts . In 2004 , the club dropped navy from the kits and instead used plain red and white , until 2008 when a kit mostly of navy was introduced . For 2007 – 08 , the club brought in a third kit , which comprised light blue shirts and socks , with maroon shorts . A kit with purple shirts was introduced for a one @-@ off appearance in the 2009 FA Trophy Final . Red shirts returned in 2010 , and have been worn with red , navy blue , light blue and white shorts . 
 York adopted the city 's coat of arms as their crest upon the club 's formation , although it only featured on the shirts from 1950 to 1951 . In 1959 , a second crest was introduced , in the form of a shield that contained the York Minster , the White Rose of York and a robin . This crest never appeared on the shirts , but from 1970 to 1973 they bore the letters " <unk> " running upwards from left to right , and from 1974 to 1978 the " Y @-@ fronts " shirts included a stylised badge in which the " Y " and " C " were combined . The shirts bore a new crest in 1978 , which depicted Bootham Bar , two heraldic lions and the club name in all @-@ white , and in 1983 this was updated into a coloured version . 
 When Batchelor took over the club in 2002 , the crest was replaced by one signifying the club 's new name of " York City Soccer Club " and held a chequered flag motif . After Batchelor 's one @-@ year period at the club , the name reverted to " York City Football Club " and a new logo was introduced . It was selected following a supporters ' vote held by the club , and the successful design was made by Michael Elgie . The badge features five lions , four of which are navy blue and are placed on a white " Y " shaped background . The rest of the background is red with the fifth lion in white , placed between the top part of the " Y " .

 = = Grounds = = 
 = = = Fulfordgate = = = 
 York 's first ground was Fulfordgate , which was located on Heslington Lane , Fulford in the south @-@ east of York . With the ground not ready , York played their first two home matches at Mille Crux , <unk> Road , before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4 – 1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922 . Fulfordgate was gradually improved ; terracing was replaced banking behind one of the goals , the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1 @,@ 000 supporters , and a small seated stand was erected . By the time of York 's election into the Football League in 1929 , the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17 @,@ 000 . However , attendances declined in York 's second and third Football League seasons , and the directors blamed this on the ground 's location . In April 1932 , York 's shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent , which had been vacated by York Cricket Club , on a 21 @-@ year lease . This site was located near the city centre , and had a significantly higher population living nearby than Fulfordgate . 
 = = = Bootham Crescent = = = 
 Bootham Crescent was renovated over the summer of 1932 ; the Main and Popular Stands were built and terraces were banked up behind the goals . The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932 , for York 's 2 – 2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North . It was played before 8 @,@ 106 supporters , and York 's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground . There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent 's early years : attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons , and there were questions over the quality of the pitch . In March 1938 the ground 's record attendance was set when 28 @,@ 123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup . The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War , when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End . Improvements were made shortly after the war ended , including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed . 
 With the club 's finances in a strong position , York purchased Bootham Crescent for £ 4 @,@ 075 in September 1948 . Over the late 1940s and early 1950s , concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End . The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955 , and a year later a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End , as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing . The ground was fitted with floodlights in 1959 , which were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United . The floodlights were updated and improved in 1980 , and were officially switched on for a friendly with Grimsby Town . A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981 , and two years later new offices for the manager , secretary , matchday and lottery manager were built , along with a vice @-@ presidents ' lounge . 
 During the early 1980s , the rear of the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had appeared in the rear wall , and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters . Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s , including new turnstiles , refurbished dressing rooms , new referees ' changing room and physiotherapist 's treatment room being readied , hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened . The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991 , and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier . It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End , and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United . In June 1995 , new floodlights were installed , which were twice as powerful as the original floodlights . 
 In July 1999 , York ceased ownership of Bootham Crescent when their real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings . Craig announced the ground would close by 30 June 2002 , and under Batchelor York 's lease was replaced with one expiring in June 2003 . In March 2003 , York extended the lease to May 2004 , and proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium under the ownership of the Supporters ' Trust . The club instead bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004 , using a £ 2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund ( FSIF ) . 
 The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent in January 2005 , as part of a sponsorship deal in which Nestlé made a donation to the club , although the ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent . In January 2010 the deal expired , when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club . There has not been any major investment in the ground since the 1990s , and it has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof , crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End , drainage problems and toilet conditions . Bootham Crescent holds a capacity of 8 @,@ 256 , with seating for 3 @,@ 409 . 
 = = = York Community Stadium = = = 
 Per the terms of the FSIF loan , the club was required to have identified a site for a new stadium by 2007 , and have detailed planning permission by 2009 , to avoid financial penalties . York failed to formally identify a site by the end of 2007 , and by March 2008 plans had ground to a halt . In May 2008 , City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium , for use by York and the city 's rugby league club , York City Knights . In July 2010 , the option of building a 6 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington , on the site of Huntington Stadium , was chosen by the council . In August 2014 , the council named Greenwich Leisure Ltd as the preferred bidder to deliver an 8 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater stadium , a leisure complex and a community hub . Construction is to start in the summer of 2016 , for completion in early 2018 .

John <unk> , the Archbishop of York , became the club patron for 2007 – 08 , having become a regular spectator at home matches as a season ticket holder . 
 The 2003 Football Fans Census revealed that no other team 's supporters considered York to be among their club 's main rivals . Traditionally , York 's two main rivalries have been with Hull City and Scarborough . While York fans saw Hull as their main rival , this was not reciprocated by the East Yorkshire club , who saw Leeds United as their main rival . York also had a rivalry with Halifax Town and they were the team most local to York when the two played in the Conference . A rivalry with Luton Town developed during the club 's final years in the Conference as both clubs met regularly in crucial matches , accompanied by a series of contentious incidents involving crowd trouble , contentious transfers and complaints about the behaviour of directors .

 = Tabula Rasa ( Lost ) = 
 " Tabula Rasa " ( Latin for blank slate ) is the third episode of the first season of Lost . It was directed by Jack Bender and written by Damon Lindelof . It first aired on October 6 , 2004 , on ABC . 
 The character of Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) is featured in the episode 's flashbacks , showing how she got captured in Australia by the US Marshal Edward Mars ( Fredric Lane ) . In the present day events , Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) and Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) learn that Kate is a convict and fugitive while Jack is trying to save the marshal from the injuries he sustained during the Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash . 
 The episode was watched by 16 @.@ 54 million Americans and received mixed reviews from critics . It is the first episode to feature a ' Previously on Lost ' segment , a clip shown at the beginning of each episode summarizing the recent events of the show . The episode receives its name from the philosophical idea of tabula rasa , meaning blank slate , a concept which is brought in one of the episode 's final lines , when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors should be allowed to restart with a new life .

 Kate ( Evangeline Lilly ) is awakened by an Australian farmer , Ray Mullen ( Nick Tate ) , as she sleeps in his barn . She introduces herself as Annie , a backpacking graduate , and Mullen offers her a job on the farm . When she later leaves the farm , Ray offers to give her a ride to the train station . On the way Kate notices a black car following them , and Ray reveals he learned Kate was a fugitive , and decided to deliver her to the authorities for the reward money . As soon as they are approached by the tailgating car , driven by US Marshal Edward Mars ( Fredric Lane ) , Kate jerks the wheel and causes Ray 's vehicle to crash off the road . As Kate is pulling Ray from the burning vehicle , Marshall Mars captures her at gunpoint . 
 = = = On the Island = = = 
 Kate , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) , James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) , Boone Carlyle ( Ian Somerhalder ) and Shannon Rutherford ( Maggie Grace ) are returning from the mountains and make camp as soon as it gets dark . They decide not to tell the other survivors about the French transmission received on the transceiver , fearing that the message will cause panic among the other survivors . When a fight breaks out over who should keep the gun brought by Sawyer , the group agrees to give it to Kate . Meanwhile , at the beach , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) sees Kate 's mugshot which Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) retrieved from the wounded marshall . 
 The next day , the hiking party returns , Kate secretly tells Jack about the distress signal , and the marshall 's condition worsens . As Jack searches the fuselage for antibiotics , Kate visits the marshall on the makeshift medical tent . He awakens and grabs her by the throat , being stopped by a returning Jack before going into shock . Kate later asks Jack to euthanize the marshal , but Jack refuses , saying that he saw her mug shot and that he " is not a murderer . " Elsewhere , Michael Dawson ( Harold Perrineau ) gets bothered by his son Walt Lloyd ( Malcolm David Kelley ) talking with the mysterious John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) , and instructs his son to stay away from Locke . 
 The marshall 's moans of pain get worse , disturbing the other survivors . Eventually he asks to see Kate alone , and when she enters the tent , the marshal asks what Kate wanted to ask him before he was knocked unconscious during the crash . Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward . The marshal laughs , telling Kate that she is one of a kind , and then asks if he is going to die . Kate nods , and he asks if she is going to do it . As Kate leaves , Sawyer enters with the gun , and a gunshot is heard . Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed . <unk> coughs are then heard , and it is revealed that Sawyer 's shot missed the marshal 's heart and pierced his lung , causing him more pain . Jack then euthanizes the marshal , presumably by suffocating him . 
 The next day , Locke finds Walt 's lost dog Vincent ( Madison ) using a makeshift dog whistle , and gives him to Michael , saying that he thinks Walt 's father should be the one to return the dog . Kate offers to tell Jack what her crime was . However , he declines , stating that their past lives are not important right now and all of the survivors should be allowed to start , again .

 During production of the pilot episode of Lost , creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof got along with a team of four writers - Javier Grillo @-@ Marxuach , Paul Dini , Jennifer M. Johnson and Christian Taylor - to elaborate ideas on how the show could continue . The resulting " Writer 's Guide " plus a positive reaction to the pilot made ABC pick up the show . The season one writing begun on May 2004 , with the first episode being centered on Kate and following the guidelines of a self @-@ contained script grounded in reality . The script , credited to Lindelof , was finished by June . It was the first episode directed by Jack Bender , who came to the show following an invitation by Abrams . The episode is named " Tabula Rasa " after the Latin term meaning " blank slate " , a concept attributed to the philosopher John Locke regarding how he believed humans are born without built @-@ in mental content , then filled through their life experiences . Said concept is echoed by the final line of the episode , where Jack suggests the crash made the survivors into blank slates that could restart . 
 Both Joe Purdy 's " Wash Away ( Reprise ) " and Patsy Cline 's " Leavin ' on Your Mind " are featured in this episode . Josh Holloway , who portrays Sawyer , asked showrunner Carlton Cuse how Sawyer could have possibly missed in his attempt to euthanize the Marshal . Cuse notes that the writers thought this to be unlikely as well and discussed the concept of making Sawyer <unk> , leading to him receiving a pair of glasses in " Deus Ex Machina " . This is the first episode of Lost to feature a ' Previously on Lost ' introduction , which is a short recap of the most recent episodes to refresh the viewer 's memory . The voice of the introduction was provided by Lloyd Braun , the ABC president who created the Lost pitch and had been fired during the pilot 's production .

" Josh Wolk rated " Tabula Rasa " a B + , saying that " Kate 's story is intriguing , though she 's still not quite believable as a fugitive badass . " 
 Robert Dougherty , author of Lost Episode Guide for Others : An Unofficial Anthology , said that the episode is " important in establishing Kate 's past life " , but that " it isn 't that important in the grand scheme of the Lost design . " Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it called the episode a " slight letdown in comparison to the pilot episode " , but arguing that " most episodes fall short of the pilot 's brilliance " and that the use of flashbacks " demonstrated [ Lost ] would be a character @-@ based drama , a move that solidified its audience and let [ its viewers ] gradually know the many people that crash landed on the Island .

 There had been heavy rain in Liverpool in the week before the first leg , nevertheless , Austrian referee Erich <unk> decided that the first leg on 9 May would still go ahead . Minutes into the match it was apparent that the conditions were unplayable , the rain had intensified following the kick @-@ off and the players were unable to pass the ball to each other . The referee took the decision to abandon the game after 27 minutes with the match to be played the next day . 
 = = = Summary = = = 
 The 27 minutes that had been played the previous day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into how to beat Borussia . He noted that defender Günter Netzer was suspect in the air , to exploit this he decided to omit Brian Hall in place of John Toshack , whom Shankly believed would exploit this weakness . The inclusion of Toshack had the desired effect . In the 21st minute his header across the penalty area from a Chris Lawler pass , set up the first goal for Kevin Keegan , who dived forward to head the ball into the far corner of the goal . 
 Keegan nearly extended Liverpool 's lead four minutes later when they were awarded a penalty for handball . Alec Lindsay put a high pass into the penalty area ; Borussia defender Rainer Bonhof , under pressure from Toshack , handled the ball and Liverpool were awarded a penalty . However , Keegan 's penalty was saved by Borussia goalkeeper Wolfgang Kleff who pushed the effort round the post . Borussia nearly made Keegan pay for his penalty miss a few minutes later , but Dietmar Danner 's shot hit the post . Keegan made amends in the 33rd minute when he scored again . Emlyn Hughes headed the ball into the Borussia penalty area , Toshack who was facing away from the Borussia goal headed the ball back to Keegan , who volleyed the ball into the goal from ten yards to give Liverpool a 2 – 0 lead . 
 Liverpool extended their lead in the 60th minute when defender Larry Lloyd scored . Toshack won Liverpool a corner and with Borussia defender Netzer focusing on the striker , Lloyd was left unmarked to head in Keegan 's corner and extend the English club 's lead to 3 – 0 . Despite Liverpool 's goals Borussia were presented with an opportunity to get back into the tie when they were awarded a penalty in the 65th minute . Steve Heighway 's tackle on Henning Jensen was judged to be a foul by Austrian referee <unk> . Jupp Heynckes took the penalty for the West German team hitting it to Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence 's right , but Clemence dived the right way and saved the penalty , preventing Borussia from scoring an away goal . No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full @-@ time with the final score 3 – 0 to Liverpool . 
 Shankly was equivocal in his praise of the players after the match stating : " It was an international @-@ class game . Really tremendous . I am not making predictions about the second @-@ leg , but we have a distinct advantage because we did not give away a goal . " Shankly had Clemence to thank for Liverpool not conceding an away goal and the goalkeeper revealed that he had done his homework on the penalty taker Heynckes : " I watched Heynckes take a penalty in the semi @-@ final on television and decided to dive the same way . The save was a reward for my homework . "

 Liverpool 's 3 – 0 victory in the first leg meant that Borussia needed to score three goals to force the tie into extra @-@ time . Liverpool employed a " holding action " against the " attacking Germans " in order to protect their three @-@ goal lead . Another bout of torrential rain affected the second leg , as a result the pitch was slippery , and with the onus on Borussia to attack this caused problems for the Liverpool defence . 
 Knowing the task in hand Borussia bombarded Liverpool in the first half , the architect was midfielder Günter Netzer whose passing was instrumental to Borussia 's play . Borussia 's attacking brought their first goal in the 30th minute . Jupp Heynckes who had missed the penalty for Borussia in the first leg , scored from six yards after Bernd Rupp passed to him from the right hand side of the pitch . Heynckes extended the West German side 's lead in the 39th minute when he curled the ball into the Liverpool goal from left of the Liverpool penalty area . 
 Borussia needed one more goal to level the tie and take it into extra @-@ time . However , despite an initial spell of dominance following the start of the second half they were unable to match the intensity that they had shown in the first half , Liverpool gained confidence from this and saw out the second half , losing the match 2 – 0 , but they won their first European trophy as a result of a 3 – 2 aggregate victory . Liverpool 's victory meant that they became the first English team to win a European trophy and league championship in the same season .

 Ranch Road 1 begins at US 290 on the west side of Stonewall , as a two @-@ lane , paved road . The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town 's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town 's east side . The route continues along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Park , before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site . The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49 , which crosses the river accessing the national historic site . After crossing into Blanco County , the route turns away from the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye . Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country , the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River .

 = Italian cruiser Pisa = 
 The Italian cruiser Pisa was the name ship of her class of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the first decade of the 20th century . The ship participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , during which she supported the occupations of Tobruk , Libya and several islands in the Dodecanese and bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the Dardanelles . During World War I , Pisa 's activities were limited by the threat of Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines , although the ship did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo , Albania in late 1918 . After the war she became a training ship and was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 before being scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Pisa had a length between perpendiculars of 130 meters ( 426 ft 6 in ) and an overall length of 140 @.@ 5 meters ( 460 ft 11 in ) . She had a beam of 21 meters ( 68 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 1 meters ( 23 ft 4 in ) . The ship displaced 9 @,@ 832 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 677 long tons ) at normal load , and 10 @,@ 600 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 400 long tons ) at deep load . The Pisa @-@ class ships had a complement of 32 officers and 652 to 655 enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft using steam supplied by 22 Belleville boilers . Designed for a maximum output of 20 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 15 @,@ 000 kW ) and a speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) , Pisa handily exceeded this , reaching a speed of 23 @.@ 47 knots ( 43 @.@ 47 km / h ; 27 @.@ 01 mph ) during her sea trials from 20 @,@ 808 ihp ( 15 @,@ 517 kW ) . She had a cruising range of about 2 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 600 km ; 2 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Pisa @-@ class ships consisted of four Cannone da 254 / 45 V Modello 1906 guns in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The ships mounted eight Cannone da 190 / 45 V Modello 1906 in four twin @-@ gun turrets , two in each side amidships , as their secondary armament . For defense against torpedo boats , the ships carried 16 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) Cannone da 76 / 40 V Modello 1908 guns and eight QF Cannone da 47 / 40 V Modello 1908 guns . They were also equipped with three submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . During World War I , her 76 and 47 mm guns were replaced by twenty 76 / 40 guns ; six of these were anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 Pisa was protected by an armored belt that was 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) at the bow and stern . The armored deck was 51 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The conning tower armor was 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The 254 mm gun turrets were protected by 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of armour while the 190 mm turrets had 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) .

 Pisa , named after the eponymous city , was laid down on 20 February 1905 at the Orlando shipyard in Livorno . The ship was launched on 15 September 1907 and completed on 1 September 1909 . 
 When the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 began on 29 September 1911 , Pisa was the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Ernesto <unk> , commander of the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . Pisa and her sister ship , Amalfi , were among the ships selected for the initial blockade of Tripoli . On 2 October , the Training Division relieved the 1st Squadron in blockade duty , allowing them to join the main Italian fleet . 
 After a fruitless search for the main Ottoman fleet and the peaceful occupation of Tobruk , Pisa , Amalfi , and the battleship Napoli were joined by the recently commissioned armored cruiser San Marco , three destroyers , and two torpedo boats . The group escorted several Italian transports that arrived off Derna on 15 October . After negotiations for a surrender of the town fell apart , Pisa shelled the barracks and a fort . There was no return fire from Derna , so a boat with offers of a truce was sent in . When it was greeted by a volley of rifle fire , Pisa and the other armored cruisers opened fire on the town with their 190 mm guns and , according to a contemporary account , " completely destroyed " the town in 30 minutes time . A landing party was unable to reach the shore because of rough seas and gunfire from the shore . Pisa and her consorts then shelled the beach for two hours . Weather conditions prevented a landing until the 18th , when 1 @,@ 500 men took possession of Derna . 
 Pisa remained in North African waters until mid @-@ December when most of the 1st Squadron returned to Italy . Pisa later escorted several troop transports from Augusta , Sicily in an attempt to seize the port of Zuara shortly before Christmas that was foiled by bad weather . In mid @-@ April 1912 the Italian fleet sortied into the eastern Aegean Sea with Pisa and Amalfi leading in an attempt to lure out the Ottoman fleet . When that failed , the Italians bombarded the fortifications defending the Dardanelles to little effect before the main body departed for Italy on the 19th . Pisa , Amalfi , and an assortment of smaller craft were left behind , however , to continue destroying telegraph and radio stations and cutting underwater cables . Sailors from the two cruisers captured the island of <unk> on 28 April to allow Italian forces to use it as supply base . A week later , the ship supported the occupation of Rhodes on 4 May . Pisa returned to Italy in September , but after the war ended she spent the first half of 1913 in Constantinople and the Aegean before returning to Taranto on 24 June . 
 The ship was based at Brindisi when Italy declared war on the Central Powers on 23 May 1915 . That night , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy bombarded the Italian coast in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization . Of the many targets , Ancona was hardest hit , with disruptions to the town 's gas , electric , and telephone service ; the city 's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames . All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port , putting pressure on the Regia Marina to stop the attacks . When the Austrians resumed bombardments on the Italian coast in mid @-@ June , Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending Pisa and the other armored cruisers at Brindisi — the navy 's newest — to Venice to supplement the older ships already there . Shortly after their arrival at Venice , Amalfi was sunk by a submarine on 7 July and her loss severely restricted the activities of the other ships based at Venice . Pisa was transferred to Vlore , Albania in April 1916 and participated in the bombardment of Durazzo on 2 October 1918 which sank one merchantman and damaged two others . 
 On 1 July 1921 , Pisa was reclassified from a second @-@ class battleship to a coastal battleship and became a training ship . In 1925 she was modified to operate a Macchi M.7 flying boat . From 1925 to 1930 , the ship was used to train naval cadets and lieutenants . Pisa was stricken on 28 April 1937 and subsequently broken up .
