 In late 1974 , the CFA decided to schedule a special championship . Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play ( due to the refugee problem ) , they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive . Since there was no permanent stadium , the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974 – 75 , the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975 – 76 , the GSZ Stadium again in 1976 – 77 , Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977 – 78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980 . 
 By 1979 , Nea Salamina was established in the first division . Despite a good start to the 1978 – 79 season , the team was demoted in the decisive last game to the second division after a quarter @-@ century in the first division . The team 's hopes rested both on defeating Enosis Neon Paralimni FC and Evagoras Paphos not to beat AC Omonia or Olympiakos Nicosia FC to lose by Alki Larnaca F.C .. Nea Salamina won over Enosis Neon Paralimni FC ( 3 @-@ 2 ) , but none of the others happened as Evagoras won and Olympiakos tied with Alki . 
 In the summer of 1974 , before the Turkish occupation , Nea Salamina signed Bulgarian coach <unk> <unk> , who went on to win titles with Omonia decades later . The agreement was canceled when financial problems caused by the team 's refugee status made it impossible to pay for a foreign coach .

 During the 1979 – 80 season , Nea Salamina played in the second division . Many times fans at its matches outnumbered those of teams competing in the first division . The team easily won the league and returned to the first division for the 1980 – 81 season . At the first game they beat the later champion Omonia , 2 – 1 , in an away game at Makario Stadium in Nicosia . This defeat was the first Omonia suffered at the stadium since they began competing in it . Nea Salamina finished seventh for the season . 
 For the 1981 – 82 season , Nea Salamina acquired foreign footballers for the first time , Bulgarians Nazca <unk> and Stefan Pavlov . An unprecedented incident occurred during the 1982 – 83 season when , in a game against Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in GSZ Stadium , three Nea Salamina 's players were expelled and the remaining players surrounded the linesman to protest . The linesman , claiming to have received blows , was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players . After the linesman made a formal complaint , a court imposed a sentence of 45 days . This was unprecedented for Cypriot football . The players remained in jail for five days and were released after public outcry , but then CFA authorities imposed crippling sanctions on them , ordering them to stay off the court for several months . 
 The next football seasons was not accompanied by discrimination . Until 1985 , the team played at GSZ Stadium . In the 1985 – 86 season , they played seven games at Municipal Stadium in Deryneia and six in GSZ Stadium . They used GSZ Stadium exclusively for the 1986 – 87 season . From 1987 to 1988 , the team used Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca for home games . The team finished fourth in the 1988 – 89 season , denied participation in the final by the subsequent winners AEL Limassol . During this period , Nea Salamina 's player Nigel Maknil was named the league 's top scorer , with 19 goals .

 Cup winner 
 The 1989 – 90 season was the most successful in the history of the team when Nea Salamina won its first football title , the Cypriot Cup . The week before the final , many fans traveled to Cyprus from abroad to attend the game . Nea Salamina was the second refugee team to win a title since the 1974 occupation . In the final , on 8 June 1990 , Nea Salamina defeated Omonia 3 – 2 at Tsirion Stadium in Limassol . Players competing in the final included Christakis <unk> , Artemis Andreou , Kipros Tsigkelis , Elissaios Psaras , Floros <unk> ( captain ) , Kenny Dyer , Vangelis Adamou , Takis David , Christakis Mavros , Elias Elia , <unk> Andreou ( Pambis Andreou ) and S. <unk> . Elias Elia , Christakis Mavros and Pambis Andreou scored the goals , and the coach was former Nea Salamina 's player Andreas <unk> . 
 Shield winner 
 Salamina went on to take its second title in only a few months , the LTV Super Cup Shield , against rival APOEL , 1 – 0 , at Makario Stadium , the opponents ' home ground . Nigel Maknil scored the lone goal . That year , the shield was dedicated to 30 years of Cypriot independence . 
 European participation 
 As cup winner , Nea Salamina played for the first time in a European cup ( 1990 – 91 European Cup Winners ' Cup ) and was eliminated in the first round by Aberdeen F.C. Aberdeen , who had won the 1982 – 83 European Cup Winners ' Cup by defeating Real Madrid in the final , was a strong team . The first game was at Tsirion Stadium on 19 September 1990 before 8 @,@ 000 fans . Nea Salamina was defeated , 2 – 0 , after a scoreless tie at halftime . A rematch , played at Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen on 3 October , resulted in a 3 – 0 loss . Lineups for the two games were Christakis <unk> , Artemis Andreou , Kipros Tsigkelis , Elissaios Psaras , Floros Nikolaou , Kenny Dyer , Pambis Andreou , Takis David ( replaced by Stavros <unk> in the 68th minute ) , Nigel Maknil ( replaced by Christakis Mavros in the 85th minute ) , Elias Elias and Vangelis Adamou ( home ) , and <unk> <unk> , Andreas Artemis , Kipros Tsigkelis , Elissaios Psaras , Floros <unk> , Kenny Dyer , Vangelis Adamou , Mavros Christakis , Nigel Maknil ( replaced by Pambis Andreou in the 47th minute ) , Elias Elias and <unk> Mavros ( away ) . 
 The 1990s were the most successful decade for Nea Salamina . Apart from winning the cup , shield , and the right to play in the Cup Winners Cup , the team claimed the championship . In addition , the team acquired Ammochostos Stadium in Larnaca , built by volunteer supporters . 
 Nea Salamina claimed the 1992 – 93 Cypriot First Division championship . At the end of the first round they were in first place , ultimately finishing third . During the 1994 – 95 season , they were the first Cypriot team to participate in the Intertoto Cup . Pambis Andreou was the league 's top scorer , with 25 goals . The team also played in the 1997 UEFA Intertoto Cup .

 During the first decade of the 21st century , Nea Salamina was relegated four times . The 1999 – 2000 season saw the team finish in fourth place , winning a spot in the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup . During the 2000 – 01 season , Nea Salamina finished twelfth and was relegated to the second division for the second time in its history . By the season 's last game , the team 's hopes rested both on defeating Digenis Akritas <unk> and Doxa <unk> F.C. not to beat Apollo Limassol or Enosis Neon Paralimni FC to beat Ethnikos Achna FC . Nea Salamina easily won over Digenis , but Doxa also defeated Apollo and Ethnikos Achna 's match with Enosis Neon Paralimni FC resulted in a draw . After defeating APOEL in the semifinals , the team lost the 2000 – 01 Cypriot Cup final on 12 May 2012 to Apollo , 1 – 0 , at GSP Stadium , becoming the first Cypriot football team to play in a cup final despite being relegated . 
 Nea Salamina became 2001 @-@ 02 second @-@ division champions , winning promotion to first division . The team eliminated future champion APOEL away in the 2001 – 02 Cypriot Cup , its second defeat of APOEL in several months , and made the quarterfinals . 
 In the 2002 – 03 season , the team was relegated again to second division , winning the championship of that division the following year and promoted again to first division . The 2004 – 05 season saw the squad finish sixth . With its stadium closed for repairs , the team played at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium ( except for two games at Makario Stadium ) . Nea Salamina returned to Ammochostos Stadium for the 2005 – 06 season , again finishing sixth . It finished 10th in the 2006 – 07 season and 13th in 2007 – 08 , again relegated to the second division . After a difficult season in 2008 – 09 , the team returned to first division , winning in the final game and leaving opponents Olympiacos , who only needed a draw to win the promotion , in the second division .

 Nea Salamina was again relegated to the second division during the 2009 – 10 season but was promoted to first division the following year .

 = Arnold Bax = 
 Sir Arnold Edward Trevor Bax , KCVO ( 8 November 1883 – 3 October 1953 ) was an English composer , poet , and author . His prolific output includes songs , choral music , chamber pieces , and solo piano works , but he is best known for his orchestral music . In addition to a series of symphonic poems he wrote seven symphonies and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist . 
 Bax was born in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family . He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music , and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy . Consequently , he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure . While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture , which became a strong influence on his early development . In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles , writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O 'Byrne . Later , he developed an affinity with Nordic culture , which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War . 
 Between 1910 and 1920 Bax wrote a large amount of music , including the symphonic poem Tintagel , his best @-@ known work . During this period he formed a lifelong association with the pianist Harriet Cohen – at first an affair , then a friendship , and always a close professional relationship . In the 1920s he began the series of seven symphonies which form the heart of his orchestral output . In 1942 Bax was appointed Master of the King 's Music , but composed little in that capacity . In his last years he found his music regarded as old @-@ fashioned , and after his death it was generally neglected . From the 1960s onwards , mainly through a growing number of commercial recordings , his music was gradually rediscovered , although little of it is regularly heard in the concert hall . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Bax was born in the London suburb of Streatham , Surrey , to a prosperous Victorian family . He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax ( 1844 – 1918 ) and his wife , Charlotte Ellen , née Lea ( 1860 – 1940 ) . The couple 's youngest son , Clifford Lea Bax , became a playwright and essayist . Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple , but having a private income he did not practise . In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead . Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country , the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing . He was a musical child : " I cannot remember the long @-@ lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately " . 
 After a preparatory school in Balham , Bax attended the Hampstead Conservatoire during the 1890s . The establishment was run – " with considerable personal pomp " , according to Bax – by Cecil Sharp , whose passion for English folk @-@ song and folk @-@ dance excited no response in his pupil . An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including Parry , Stanford , Vaughan Williams and Holst ; Sullivan and Elgar stood aloof , as did Bax , who later put into general circulation the saying , " You should make a point of trying every experience once , excepting incest and folk @-@ dancing . " 
 In 1900 Bax moved on to the Royal Academy of Music , where he remained until 1905 , studying composition with Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay . Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner , whose music was Bax 's principal inspiration in his early years . He later observed , " For a dozen years of my youth I wallowed in Wagner 's music to the almost total exclusion – until I became aware of Richard Strauss – of any other " . Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy , whose music , like that of Strauss , was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy . 
 Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for composition and other important prizes , and was known for his exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight , he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen . His keyboard technique was formidable , but he had no desire for a career as a soloist . Unlike most of his contemporaries , he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose , without the necessity of earning an income . The Times considered that Bax 's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art , because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect . 
 After leaving the Academy Bax visited Dresden , where he saw the original production of Strauss 's Salome , and first heard the music of Mahler , which he found " eccentric , long @-@ winded , muddle @-@ headed , and yet always interesting " . Among the influences on the young Bax was the Irish poet W. B. Yeats ; Bax 's brother Clifford introduced him to Yeats 's poetry and to Ireland . Influenced by Yeats 's The Wanderings of Oisin , Bax visited the west coast of Ireland in 1902 , and found that " in a moment the Celt within me stood revealed " . His first composition to be performed – at an Academy concert in 1902 – was an Irish dialect song called " The Grand Match " . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Musically , Bax veered away from the influence of Wagner and Strauss , and deliberately adopted what he conceived of as a Celtic idiom . In 1908 he began a cycle of tone poems called Eire , described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer 's truly mature style . The first of these pieces , Into the Twilight , was premiered by Thomas Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909 , and the following year , at Elgar 's instigation , Henry Wood , commissioned the second in the cycle , In the <unk> Hills . The work received mixed notices . The Manchester Guardian 's reviewer wrote , " Mr Bax has happily suggested the appropriate atmosphere of mystery " ; The Observer found the piece " very <unk> and unsatisfying , but not difficult to follow " . The Times commented on the " rather second @-@ hand language " at some points , derivative of Wagner and Debussy , although " there is still a great deal which is wholly individual " . The Musical Times praised " a mystic glamour that could not fail to be felt by the listener " although the coherence of the piece " was not instantly discernible " . A third work in the cycle , <unk> , was not performed in the composer 's lifetime . 
 Bax 's private means enabled him to travel to the Russian Empire in 1910 . He was in pursuit of Natalia Skarginska , a young Ukrainian whom he had met in London – one of several women with whom he fell in love over the years . The visit eventually proved a failure from the romantic point of view but musically enriched him . In Saint Petersburg he discovered and immediately loved ballet ; he absorbed Russian musical influences that inspired material for the First Piano Sonata , the piano pieces , " May Night in the Ukraine " and " <unk> " , and the First Violin Sonata , dedicated to Skarginska . Foreman describes him in this period as " a musical magpie , celebrating his latest discoveries in new compositions " ; Foreman adds that Bax 's own musical personality was strong enough for him to assimilate his influences and make them into his own . Russian music continued to influence him until the First World War . An unfinished ballet Tamara , " a little @-@ Russian fairy tale in action and dance " , provided material the composer reused in post @-@ war works . 
 Having given up his pursuit of Skarginska , Bax returned to England ; in January 1911 he married the pianist <unk> Luisa <unk> ( b . 1885 or 1886 ) , daughter of the teacher and pianist , Carlos <unk> , and his wife , Luise , née Schmitz , a singer . Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace , Regent 's Park , London , and then moved to Ireland , taking a house in Rathgar , a well @-@ to @-@ do suburb of Dublin . They had two children , Dermot ( 1912 – 1976 ) and Maeve Astrid ( 1913 – 1987 ) . Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym " Dermot O 'Byrne " ; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates , and published stories , verses and a play . Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980 , Stephen Banfield found most of Bax 's earlier poems " like his early music , over @-@ written , cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats , though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity . " Banfield had better things to say of the later poems , where Bax " focuses matters , whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising ... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love . " Some of Bax 's writings as O 'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause , and the government censor prohibited their publication . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 At the beginning of the war Bax returned to England . A heart complaint , from which he suffered intermittently throughout his life , made him unfit for military service ; he acted as a special constable for a period . At a time when fellow composers including Vaughan Williams , Arthur Bliss , George Butterworth and Ivor Gurney were serving overseas , Bax was able to produce a large body of music , finding , in Foreman 's phrase , " his technical and artistic maturity " in his early thirties . Among his better @-@ known works from the period are the orchestral tone poems November Woods ( 1916 ) and Tintagel ( 1917 – 19 ) . 
 During his time in Dublin Bax had made many republican friends . The Easter rising in April 1916 and the subsequent execution of the ringleaders shocked him deeply . He expressed his feelings in some of his music such as the orchestral In Memoriam and the " Elegiac Trio " for flute , viola , and harp ( 1916 ) , as well as in his poetry . 
 In addition to his Irish influences , Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition , being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas . Bax 's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra ( 1917 ) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning @-@ point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax 's oeuvre ; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that Winter Legends , composed thirteen years later , has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting . 
 During the war Bax began an affair with the pianist Harriet Cohen , for whom he left his wife and children . Musically , she was his muse for the rest of his life ; he wrote numerous pieces for her , and she was the dedicatee of eighteen of his works . He took a flat in Swiss Cottage , London , where he lived until the start of the Second World War . He sketched many of his mature works there , often taking them in short score to his favoured rural retreats , <unk> in Ireland and then from 1928 onwards Morar in Scotland , to work on the full score at leisure . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war years = = = 
 In a study of Bax in 1919 his friend and confidante , the critic Edwin Evans , commented on the waning of the Celtic influence in the composer 's music and the emergence of " a more austere , abstract art " . From the 1920s onwards Bax seldom turned to poetic legend for inspiration . In Foreman 's view , in the post @-@ war years Bax was recognised for the first time as an important , though isolated , figure in British music . The many substantial works he wrote during the war years were heard in public , and he started writing symphonies . Few English composers had so far written symphonies that occupied a secure place in the repertoire , the best known being Elgar ( A ♭ and E ♭ symphonies ) and Vaughan Williams ( Sea , London and Pastoral symphonies ) . During the 1920s and into the 1930s Bax was seen by many as the leading British symphonist . 
 Bax 's First Symphony was written in 1921 – 22 , and when first given it was a great success , despite its ferocity of tone . The critics found the work dark and severe . The Daily News commented , " It is full of arrogant , almost blatant , virility . Its prevailing tone colour is dark , very dark – thick clouds with only here and there a ray of sunlight . " The Daily Telegraph suggested that if there was any humour in the piece , it was sardonic . The Manchester Guardian noted the severity of the work , but declared it " a truly great English symphony " . The work was a box @-@ office attraction at the Proms for several years after the premiere . In Foreman 's view , Bax was at his musical peak for a fairly short time , and his reputation was overtaken by those of Vaughan Williams and William Walton . The Third Symphony was completed in 1929 and , championed by Wood , remained for some time among the composer 's most popular works . 
 In the mid @-@ 1920s , while his affair with Cohen continued , Bax met the twenty @-@ three @-@ year @-@ old Mary Gleaves , and for more than two decades he maintained relationships with both women . His affair with Cohen ripened into warm friendship and continuing musical partnership . Gleaves became his companion from the later 1920s until his death . 
 In the 1930s , Bax composed the last four of his seven symphonies . Other works from the decade include the popular Overture to a Picaresque Comedy ( 1930 ) , several works for chamber groups , including a nonet ( 1930 ) , a string quintet ( 1933 ) , an octet for horn , piano , and strings ( 1934 ) and his third and last string quartet ( 1936 ) . The Cello Concerto ( 1932 ) was commissioned by and dedicated to Gaspar <unk> , who quickly dropped the work from his repertoire . Although Beatrice Harrison championed the concerto in the 1930s and 1940s , Bax said , " The fact that nobody has ever taken up this work has been one of the major disappointments of my musical life " . 
 Bax was knighted in 1937 ; he had neither expected nor sought the honour , and was more surprised than delighted to receive it . As the decade progressed , he became less prolific ; he commented that he wanted to " retire , like a grocer " . Among his compositions from the period was the Violin Concerto ( 1938 ) . Although not written to commission , he had composed it with the violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz in mind . Heifetz never played it , and it was premiered in 1942 by Eda Kersey with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Wood .

 After the death of the Master of the King 's Music , Sir Walford Davies , in 1941 , Bax was appointed to succeed him . The choice surprised many . Bax , despite his knighthood , was not an Establishment figure ; he himself had expressed a disinclination to " shuffle around in knee @-@ breeches " . In the opinion of The Times the appointment was not a good one : " Bax was not cut out for official duties and found their performance irksome " . Nonetheless , Bax wrote a handful of occasional pieces for royal events , including a march for the Coronation in 1953 . 
 After the Second World War began , Bax moved to Sussex , taking up residence at the White Horse Hotel , Storrington , where he lived for the rest of his life . He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years , Farewell , My Youth . The Times found it at times <unk> , at times reticent , surprising in parts , and regrettably short . Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film , Malta G. C. ; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean 's Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) and a second short film , Journey into History ( 1952 ) . His other works from the period include the short Morning Song for piano and orchestra , and the Left @-@ Hand Concertante ( 1949 ) , both written for Cohen . Bax and the Poet Laureate , John Masefield , worked on a pageant , The Play of Saint George in 1947 , but the project was not completed . 
 In his last years , Bax maintained a contented retirement for much of the time . Walton commented , " an important cricket match at Lord 's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works " . In 1950 , after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth , he said , " I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth " , but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily , which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large @-@ scale composition . He wrote in 1952 , " I doubt whether I shall write anything else … I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself . " Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax 's seventieth birthday in November 1953 . The celebrations became memorials : while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure . He was interred in St. <unk> 's Cemetery , Cork . 
 = = Music = = 
 Bax 's fellow composer Arthur Benjamin wrote that Bax was " a fount of music " , whose " spontaneous and inexhaustible outpourings " , unique among his contemporaries , were comparable to those of Schubert and Dvořák . Evans has suggested that Bax 's music paradoxically combines robustness and wistfulness , a view that later commentators including Herbage have endorsed . The early music is often instrumentally difficult or orchestrally and harmonically complex ; from about 1913 onwards he moved towards a simpler , sparer style . The composer and musicologist Anthony Payne considers that Bax 's best works date from the period between 1910 and 1925 : he instances The Garden of Fand , Tintagel , November Woods , the Second Piano Sonata , Viola Sonata , and first two symphonies . By the 1930s Bax 's music ceased to be regarded as new and difficult , and towards the end of that decade it was attracting less attention than before . 
 The conductor Vernon Handley , long associated with Bax 's music , commented that the composer 's influences include Rachmaninoff and Sibelius as well as Richard Strauss and Wagner : " He was aware of jazz and many more composers on the European scene than we are now . That finds its way into a person 's psyche and personality and into his technique as a musician . " 
 The critic Neville Cardus wrote of Bax 's music : 
 The paradox is that Bax 's methods , his idiom and tonal atmosphere are impersonal : that is to say , there is no direct unfolding of an individual state of mind or soul as we find in Elgar or Gustav Mahler . Yet there is no mistaking the Bax physiognomy or psychology : always through the gloom and thickets of the symphonies the warm rays of an approachable , lovable man and nature may be felt . 
 York Bowen thought it regrettable that Bax 's orchestral works frequently call for exceptionally large forces : " When the score demands such luxuries as triple or quadruple woodwind , six horns , three or four trumpets , extra percussion and perhaps organ , it is undoubtedly throwing extra difficulties in the way of performance . " The composer Eric Coates commented that Bax 's music appealed greatly to orchestral players : " whichever instrument he wrote for , it was as if he played that instrument himself , so well did he seem to write for it " . 
 = = = Symphonies = = = 
 While in Dresden in 1907 Bax began work on what he later called " a colossal symphony which would have occupied quite an hour in performance , were such a cloud @-@ cuckoo dream to become an actuality " . He added " Happily , it never has ! " , but he left a complete piano sketch , which was orchestrated in 2012 – 13 by Martin Yates , and recorded for the Dutton Vocalion label ; it lasts for 77 minutes . The four @-@ movement work , more conventional in structure than his completed symphonies , shows a strong Russian influence in its material . 
 Bax wrote his seven completed symphonies between 1921 and 1939 . In a study of the seven , David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were " often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic <unk> and ' atmosphere ' . In fact they have considerable strength and frequent <unk> ; and formally the thematic material is presented with consistency and purpose . " In Herbage 's view , the cycle can be seen to fall into two groups – the first three and the last three – with the Fourth Symphony as " an extrovert interlude between these largely introspective works " . Handley agreed that the first three could be grouped together ; Foreman sees a Celtic influence in all three , with Bax 's emotions about the Easter rising and its aftermath discernible . The Fourth is generally regarded as a more optimistic work than its predecessors and successors . Handley calls it " festive " , but comments that its ideas developed into darker mood in the Fifth and Sixth . The Fifth is , for Herbage , " the greatest tour @-@ de @-@ force " ; the Sixth stands out for its " magnificent final movement " , which the critic Peter Pirie said " tears the earth up by its roots " ; and the Seventh , in the view of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , has an elegiac tone , its simplicity far removed from the discursive and complex music of Bax 's earlier years . 
 = = = Concertante works = = = 
 Bax 's first work for solo instrument and orchestra was the 50 @-@ minute Symphonic Variations in E ♭ ( 1919 ) , written for Harriet Cohen . The Times considered it " like one of those deeds of recklessness which in the Army may be followed either by a Court @-@ martial or a V.C. We incline to favour the Court @-@ martial , and to award the V.C. to Miss Harriet Cohen for her part in the enterprise . " 
 The Cello Concerto ( 1932 ) was Bax 's first attempt at a full @-@ scale conventional concerto . It calls for a smaller orchestra than he customarily employed , with no trombones or tuba , and no percussion apart from timpani . Foreman points to many subtleties of scoring , but notes that it has never ranked high among the composer 's mature works . The Violin Concerto ( 1937 – 38 ) is , like the last symphony , in a more relaxed vein than most of Bax 's earlier music . Cardus singled it out as " unusually fine " , although Heifetz may have felt it not virtuosic enough . The composer described it as in the romantic tradition of Joachim Raff . 
 Among the minor concertante works is Variations on the Name Gabriel Fauré ( 1949 ) for harp and strings , in a style more neoclassical than most of Bax 's music . Bax 's last concertante piece was a short work for piano and orchestra ( 1947 ) written in his capacity as Master of the King 's Music , marking Princess Elizabeth 's twenty @-@ first birthday . 
 = = = Other orchestral works = = = 
 Bax 's tone poems are in a variety of styles and have varied sharply in their popularity . His impressionistic tone poems In the <unk> Hills and the Debussy ' La Mer ' like <unk> are described by Grove as " a succinct and attractive pieces " . The former was modestly successful , but Spring Fire and <unk> ( 1913 ) instanced by Foreman as difficult works ; were not performed in Bax 's lifetime . During the First World War Bax wrote three tone poems , two of which – The Garden of Fand ( 1913 – 16 ) and November Woods ( 1917 ) – have remained on the fringes of the modern repertoire , and a third – Tintagel ( 1917 – 19 ) – which in the decade after his death was the only work by which Bax was known to the public . Grove characterises all three as musical evocations of nature , with little expression of subjective personal response . The orchestral piece that was neglected longest was In memoriam ( 1917 ) , a lament for Patrick Pearse , who was shot for his part in the Easter rising ; the work was not played until 1998 . Bax reused the main melody for his incidental music to Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) . 
 Oliver Twist was the second of Bax 's film scores . The first was for a short wartime propaganda film , Malta , G. C .. A four @-@ movement suite was published after the release of the latter , containing what The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music calls " a notable March with a genuine <unk> theme in the best Elgarian tradition " . Bax 's third and last cinema score was for a ten @-@ minute short film Journey into History in 1952 . 
 Other orchestral works include Overture , Elegy and Rondo ( 1927 ) – a lightweight piece , according to Grove . The Overture to a Picaresque Comedy ( 1930 ) , was for a time one of his most popular works . It was described by the composer as " Straussian pastiche " and by The Times as " gay and impudent , and with that tendency to vulgarity which so easily <unk> the instinctively refined composer determined to let himself go " , Cardus thought the work so appealing that to live up to the overture the putative comedy would have to be " written by <unk> and Shaw in collaboration . Not often is English music so free and audacious as this , so gay and winning . " 
 = = = Vocal music = = = 
 The critic Peter Latham remarked that he was surprised that Bax had never set any of Yeats 's poems to music . Bax replied , " What , I ? I should never dare ! " . Latham added that Bax 's sensitiveness to poetic values made him " painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem " . Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song @-@ writing completely . 
 At the start of his composing career , songs , together with piano music , formed the core of Bax 's work . Some of the songs , mainly the early ones , are conspicuous for the virtuosity of their piano parts , which tend to overwhelm the voice . Grove contrasts the virtuoso accompaniment of " The Fairies " ( 1905 ) with the simpler " The White Peace " ( 1907 ) , one of his most popular songs . The musical analyst Trevor Hold writes that the piano " goes berserk " in " Glamour " ( 1920 ) . Among the poets whose verses Bax set were his brother Clifford , Burns , Chaucer , Hardy , Housman , Joyce , Synge and Tennyson . The composer himself singled out for mention in his Who 's Who article " A Celtic Song @-@ Cycle " ( 1904 ) to words by " Fiona Macleod " ( a pen name of the poet William Sharp ) . Among the post @-@ war songs , Hold considers Bax 's " In the Morning " ( 1926 ) to be one of the best of all settings of Housman 's works , " and it makes you wish that Bax had made further explorations into the Shropshire landscape . " Hold classes that song , together with " Across the Door " ( 1921 ) , " Rann of Exile " ( 1922 ) and " Watching the <unk> " ( 1932 ) , as " truly modern , 20th @-@ century masterpieces of song " . 
 Bax wrote a substantial number of choral works , mostly secular but some religious . He was a nominal member of the Church of England , but in the view of the critic Paul Spicer , " None of Bax 's choral music can be described as devotional or even suitable for church use … Here is a secular composer writing voluptuous music . " The choral works with religious texts include his largest @-@ scale unaccompanied vocal piece , Mater ora Filium ( 1921 ) , inspired by William Byrd 's Five Part Mass ; it is a setting of a medieval carol from a manuscript held by Balliol College , Oxford . The composer Patrick Hadley considered it " an unsurpassed example of modern unaccompanied vocal writing " . Bax 's other choral works include settings of words by Shelley ( Enchanted Summer , 1910 ) , Henry Vaughan ( The Morning Watch , 1935 ) , Masefield ( To Russia , 1944 ) , and Spenser ( Epithalamium , 1947 ) . 
 = = = Chamber and solo piano music = = = 
 In his overview of Bax 's earlier chamber works , Evans identifies as among the most successful the Phantasy for viola , the Trio for piano , violin , and viola and " a String Quintet of such difficulty that an adequate performance has seldom if ever been possible " . He rates the Second Violin Sonata ( 1915 ) as the composer 's most individual work to that date . For Evans , the culminating point of Bax 's early chamber music was the Piano Quintet , a work " of such richness of invention that it would be an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period " . Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet ( 1918 – " a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration " , and the " grittier " Second Quartet ( 1925 ) , the Viola Sonata ( 1922 ) , the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp ( 1927 ) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp ( 1928 ) . 
 The composer and musical scholar Christopher Palmer writes that Bax was unusual among British composers in composing a substantial oeuvre for solo piano . Bax published four piano sonatas ( 1910 – 32 ) , which are , in Palmer 's view , as central to the composer 's piano music as the symphonies are to the orchestral output . The first two sonatas are each in a single movement , of about twenty minutes ; the third and fourth are in conventional three @-@ movement form . The First Symphony was originally planned as a large @-@ scale piano sonata in E ♭ ( 1921 ) ; the manuscript score of the latter came to light in the early 1980s and was performed for the first time in 1983 . Bax 's own virtuosity as a pianist is reflected in the demands of many of his piano pieces . Palmer cites Chopin and Liszt as major influences on Bax 's piano style as well as Balakirev and the other Russians whose influence is seen throughout the composer 's work . For piano duo Bax composed two tone poems , Moy Mell ( 1917 ) and Red Autumn ( 1931 ) . His shorter piano pieces include picturesque miniatures such as In a Vodka Shop ( 1915 ) , A Hill Tune ( 1920 ) and Water Music ( 1929 ) . 
 = = Neglect and revival = = 
 In his later years Bax 's music fell into neglect . Sir John Barbirolli wrote , " I think he felt keenly that his richly wrought and masterly scores were no longer ' fashionable ' to @-@ day , but nothing could deter him from the path of complete honesty and sincerity in his musical thought . " The neglect became more complete after the composer 's death . He had always sustained a Romantic outlook , distancing himself from musical modernism and especially Arnold Schoenberg 's serialism , of which Bax wrote in 1951 : 
 I believe that there is little probability that the twelve @-@ note scale will ever produce anything more than morbid or entirely cerebral growths . It might deal successfully with neuroses of various kinds , but I cannot imagine it associated with any healthy and happy concept such as young love or the coming of spring . 
 Neither Bax 's views nor his works were fashionable in the two decades after his death . The critic Michael Kennedy writes that the mid @-@ 1950s were a time of " immense change and transition in influential musical circles . " The music favoured by the cultural establishment until then was regarded as having made Britain musically parochial and indifferent to the developments of the past half @-@ century . In Kennedy 's words , " Rubbra , Bax and Ireland found themselves out in the cold " . 
 Foreman comments that in the years after Bax 's death his reputation was kept alive by a single work – Tintagel . Kennedy estimates that it took " twenty painful years " before the music of the British romantics including Bax made headway against the dominance of modernism . Foreman dates the revival of Bax 's music to Handley 's performances of the Fourth Symphony and other works with the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1960s , and the pioneering recordings by Lyrita Recorded Edition of five of the symphonies . Scholarly consideration of Bax 's life and music came with studies by Colin Scott @-@ Sutherland ( 1973 ) and Foreman ( 1983 ) . Bax 's centenary in 1983 was marked by twenty programmes on BBC Radio 3 , covering a wide range of the composer 's music . In 1985 the Sir Arnold Bax Trust was established to promote the composer 's work including the sponsoring of live performances and recording and publication of his music and writings . Since then a large number of Bax 's works , major and minor , have been recorded ( see below ) . The proliferation of Bax recordings has not been matched by a revival in his fortunes in the concert hall ; the critic Stephen Moss observed in The Guardian in 2007 , " Bax is considered the promotional kiss of death . " In 1999 the Oxford University Press published a complete catalogue of Bax 's works compiled and annotated by Graham <unk> ; Music & Letters called it " a benchmark for any future researchers seeking to compile a catalogue of a composer 's works " . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Two recordings of Bax as a pianist were made in 1929 . With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia , and with May Harrison he recorded Delius 's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label . Of the symphonies , only the Third was recorded in the composer 's lifetime ; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944 . The Viola Sonata , <unk> and Mater ora Filium were recorded under the auspices of the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938 . The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp , the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs . Of the tone poems , Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel , in 1928 ; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV . By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel , the Coronation March , the unaccompanied choral work What is it Like to be Young and Fair ? and the solo piano piece <unk> . 
 <unk> included an extensive discography in his 1999 A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax , later expanded and updated in a website . At 2015 the latter lists more than 250 works by Bax that have been recorded and published . The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax 's symphonies released on CD , two by Chandos Records , the first conducted by Bryden Thomson ( recorded 1983 – 88 ) and the second by Handley ( 2003 ) ; between them was a cycle issued by Naxos Records conducted by David Lloyd @-@ Jones ( recorded 1997 – 2001 ) . The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded , many of them in several different versions . , however <unk> arguably Bax greatest tone poem , was never performed during Bax life and was first recorded by Bryden Thomson in 1984 . Bax 's chamber music is well represented on disc , with recordings of most of the works , and multiple versions of many , including the Elegiac Trio , the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata . Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including Iris Loveridge , John McCabe , Ashley Wass and Michael Endres , though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded . Of the vocal works , by far the most often recorded is Mater ora Filium , but other choral works , and a representative selection of the songs are on disc . 
 = = Honours and legacy = = 
 Bax received the gold medals of the Royal Philharmonic Society ( 1931 ) and the Worshipful Company of Musicians ( 1931 ) , and the Cobbett medal for chamber music ( 1931 ) . He was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Oxford ( 1934 ) and Durham ( 1935 ) and the National University of Ireland ( 1947 ) . A Bax Memorial Room at University College , Cork , was opened by Vaughan Williams in 1955 . After Bax 's knighthood in the 1937 Coronation Honours he was advanced to KCVO in 1953 . An English Heritage blue plaque , unveiled in 1993 , commemorates Bax at his birthplace , 13 Pendennis Road in Streatham . 
 In 1992 Ken Russell made a television film dramatising Bax 's later years , The Secret Life of Arnold Bax . Russell himself portrayed Bax and Glenda Jackson , in her final acting role , appeared as Harriet Cohen .

 The house originally stood on Broadway Street in the center of Norwich , Connecticut . It was originally Colonial at its time of construction , but has been modified to Greek Revival style . The renovation itself may date to around 1825 . The house is a white two @-@ story clapboarded structure with its gable end facing the street . The three @-@ bay facade faces south and the front entrance is located on the left bay . The eaves cornice is decorated with <unk> that span the length of the gable ends and combines with the roof cornice to make a pediment that encloses an elliptical window in the center .

 Portrayed by Rob Lowe , Chris Traeger begins the show as an auditor working for the Indiana state government in Indianapolis , but eventually becomes the acting city manager of Pawnee , the fictional Indiana city where Parks and Recreation is set . Originally from Wisconsin , he is an excessively positive and optimistic person , who is constantly upbeat and extremely energetic . As a baby , Chris was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and was not expected to live longer than three weeks , but miraculously survived . As a result , he sees every day he is alive as a gift , which results in his intensely cheerful and enthusiastic personality . In " Lucky " , Chris mentions that he has a stepbrother who lives in London . 
 Chris is extremely health @-@ conscious and exercises constantly ; he runs 10 miles during his lunch break alone , and considers a 15 km run to be " light " exercise . He avoids eating red meat and fatty foods in favor of dishes like lean turkey burgers and vegetable loaf sweetened with fruit reduction , and takes a huge assortment of unusual vitamins . Chris always stays extremely well @-@ hydrated , and as a result of his extreme exercise regimen has only 2 @.@ 8 % body fat , which makes him very susceptible to illness due to a weakened immune system . His ambition is to become the first human being to live 150 years . Chris always greets people with a firm handshake and direct eye contact , and to remember their names often points directly at people and repeats their names upon first meeting them . His constant desire to make everyone around him happy means Chris hates having to deliver bad news , a task he often assigns to his subordinates , usually Ben Wyatt . He often declares things to be " literally " the best thing he 's ever seen or done , strongly emphasizing the word and pronouncing it " <unk> " . He is very specific about his needs , giving long , drawn out requests , often making only one point per sentence , as can be seen in the episode " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " , his beer order is as follows : " I would like a local beer ... I 'd like it in a bottle ... And I 'd like that bottle to be cold . "

 Starting in the penultimate second season episode " The Master Plan " , Chris Traeger and fellow state auditor Ben Wyatt ( Adam Scott ) are sent to Pawnee to help solve the city 's crippling budget deficit . Despite the seriousness of the problems , Chris presents the situation in an extremely positive light and tries to make all the city hall employees around him happy , leaving the hard decisions and delivery of bad news up to Ben . Due to the poorly managed Pawnee government , Chris and Ben need to slash every city budget by up to 50 percent , much to the disappointment of deputy parks and recreation director Leslie Knope ( Amy Poehler ) . 
 During an outing at a bar , Chris meets Leslie 's best friend Ann Perkins ( Rashida Jones ) , who is drunk and experiencing conflicting emotions following her recent breakup with Mark Brendanawicz ( Paul Schneider ) . Ann makes out with Chris and , although she was too drunk to even remember the incident the next day , he develops romantic feelings for her . Ann rebuffs his requests for dates , and finds him too intense , but the ever @-@ optimistic Chris does not become discouraged and insists he will continue courting her . Meanwhile , in " Freddy Spaghetti " , Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee 's budget problems are worse than anticipated , which would require the government to be temporarily shut down , much to the horror of Leslie , but the delight of parks and recreation director Ron Swanson ( Nick Offerman ) , an anti @-@ government libertarian . Chris and Ben even consider firing Leslie to save money , but Ron persuades them otherwise . 
 = = = Season three = = = 
 In " Go Big or Go Home " , after three months of closure , the Pawnee government reopens in a limited capacity , but Chris and Ben insist the parks and recreation department 's budget can only sustain existing park maintenance . Leslie , however , wants to offer better programs and services for the Pawnee citizens . She asks Ann to go on a date with Chris , then try to convince him to increase the budget . Ann reluctantly agrees to the plan , but as the date progresses , she finds she actually enjoys herself and develops feelings for Chris . When Leslie accidentally gives away her secret plan , Chris is hurt and disparaged by Ann 's ulterior motive . The next day , however , Ann apologizes and asks to continue dating Chris , who happily accepts . 
 Ann finds she likes Chris very much , but is intimidated because she cannot find a single flaw with him , which causes her to act socially awkwardly around him . However , when a flu outbreak strikes Pawnee in " Flu Season " , Chris becomes severely ill , as due to his extreme workout regimen , he has a poor immune system and low body fat . He suffers a complete physical breakdown and becomes delirious from fever , which causes Ann ( who works as a local nurse and treats his illness ) to feel less intimidated by him . Later , when he recovers , Chris and Ben are called back to Indianapolis for another assignment , but Chris requests an extension to stay in Pawnee , seemingly due to his feelings for Ann . 
 In " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " , Ann begins to question why Chris has not asked her to move with him to Indianapolis when he eventually returns there , especially after he offers for Ron 's assistant April Ludgate ( Aubrey Plaza ) to come there to work for him . After Ann insists they need to decide what their future holds , Chris breaks up with Ann . However , he does so in such a positive and upbeat way that she does not actually realize they have broken up . When Chris returns to Indianapolis , Ann becomes confused about why they have had such little contact and suspects he is cheating on her .

 Shortly following his departure from the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters , Rob Lowe accepted the role of Chris Traeger on Parks and Recreation . He made his first appearance on the show in " The Master Plan " , the penultimate episode of the second season . The character debuted the same episode that Adam Scott began his role as Ben Wyatt . Originally , Chris Traeger was only meant to be a guest role , with Lowe portraying him in the final two episodes of the second season and the first six episodes of the third season before departing the series . However , Lowe instead became a regular cast member starting with the third season , and signed a multi @-@ year contract to remain on the show . The idea of Chris as a state auditor visiting Pawnee , and the subsequent government shutdown , was inspired by news reports at the time of a number of states that were considering a shut down of schools , parks and other services due to the global financial crisis . 
 Parks and Recreation co @-@ creator Michael Schur said Chris ' habit of pointing directly into the faces of people he meets and repeating their names was one of the first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived . Chris ' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur 's wife , J. J. Philbin , who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born , and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character . Lowe 's first day of filming on the series was his birthday ( March 17 , 2010 ) , which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in " The Master Plan " was shot . Lowe said he loved his character 's " unrelenting enthusiasm " and the fact that he is not a romantic lead , but rather a " big , fat nerd " . Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger : " It 's a really fun character to play against because what you ’ ll see start to happen is Chris doesn ’ t want to deliver any bad news , but he ’ s actually like the Bad News Bear . " Like much of the rest of the cast , Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script . The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins ' breakup with Chris , and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward , as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past . Schur said : " Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman , and it 's hard to knock someone like that off balance . And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you . " 
 Once Lowe joined the permanent cast , Chris ' role changed into more of an authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency , although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality . Schur said of this second role : " He doesn ’ t like frayed ends or controversies – he wants the body politic to be as clean @-@ running and organic as his own human body . Part of the design of the character was to give the other characters a true boss – an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines , even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it hard to argue with him . " As a result , Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character . In his earlier episodes , Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people . As city manager in later episodes as a regular , however , Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them . For example , Chris began to enforce his strict no @-@ dating policy around city hall . Additionally , in the episode " Jerry 's Painting " , Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial , and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders .

 The Chris Traeger character has received critical acclaim . Rick Porter of Zap2it described him as " one of the great comedic creations of the past couple years " , and Hitfix writer Alan Sepinwall called it " one of the funniest performances of [ Rob Lowe 's ] career " . David Hinckley of the New York Daily News said both Lowe and Adam Scott were excellent additions to the cast , and Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said Chris was " exactly what the show needed to push itself to another level of silliness " . Some reviewers believed Chris ' over @-@ the @-@ top personality would be funny in the short run , but that the character would not prove three @-@ dimensional enough to have long @-@ term sustainability . New York magazine writer Steve Kandell initially described him as " funny , but sorta one @-@ note " , and Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic first found Chris funny , but likewise said he was " not sure how great he 'll be long term " . Matt Fowler of IGN expressed the same sentiments after earlier episodes , but by the third season said Chris proved to be a great addition to the show . 
 The relationship between Chris and Ann was described by Sundermann as " one of the most interesting parts of the show and the reason , specifically , is Chris " . Likewise , Porter said Lowe and Rashida Jones had developed a " fantastic dynamic " . Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris " a little two @-@ dimensional " , and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive . Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in " Flu Season " , in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu . Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe 's character seemed well @-@ integrated into the cast by the episode " Flu Season " , and added " If you 've never believed Lowe can make you laugh out loud , pay attention to that episode . " Steve Kandell said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt , and called one scene , when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to himself in the mirror " Stop ... pooping ! " , the " single greatest self @-@ effacingly comic moment of his long , handsome career " . 
 Parks and Recreation has traditionally experienced poor Nielsen ratings , and NBC officials hoped the addition of Lowe to the cast would help increase viewership . His premiere on the second season episode " The Master Plan " was heavily publicized in commercials with the hopes of drawing new viewers . However , ratings continued to be low after he joined the show , and his appearances only resulted in what HitFix writer Daniel Fienberg called " a statistically irrelevant bump " in the ratings . 
 Following actor Charlie Sheen 's departure from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011 , rumors began to circulate that Rob Lowe might leave Parks and Recreation to take Sheen 's place on that show . People magazine reported that Two and a Half Men creator Chuck Lorre was " seriously discussing the possibility " of signing Lowe , and Sheen himself said he would be a " fabulous " successor . Those rumors proved unfounded , however , and were flatly denied by Michael Schur , who called it " complete gibberish " . Although widely considered a supporting role , Lowe 's performance as Chris Traeger was submitted for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category .

 Eyeshield 21 ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> <unk> ) is a Japanese manga series written by Riichiro Inagaki and illustrated by Yusuke Murata . The series tells the story of Sena Kobayakawa , an introverted boy who joins an American football club as a secretary , but after being coerced by Yoichi Hiruma , turns out to play wearing an eyeshield and the number 21 , under the pseudonym of " Eyeshield 21 " . Inagaki chose American football as a central subject of Eyeshield 21 after realizing that it fit perfectly with his idea for the series . 
 The manga was originally serialized in Shueisha 's Weekly Shōnen Jump from July 2002 to June 2009 . The series consists of 333 chapters collected in 37 tankōbon volumes . An anime adaptation consisting of 145 television episodes was co @-@ produced by TV Tokyo , NAS , and Gallop . The television series first aired on Japan 's TV Tokyo network from April 6 , 2005 to March 19 , 2008 . The Eyeshield 21 franchise has spawned two original video animations ( OVAs ) , audio albums , video games , and other merchandise . 
 In North America , the manga was released by Viz Media from April 2005 to October 2011 . The anime series was later licensed in North America by Toonami Jetstream as a joint effort with Viz Media , and aired on December 17 , 2007 on its site , but before its completion , the streaming service was shut down . The whole series was streamed in English by Crunchyroll , while Sentai Filmworks licensed the series , with distribution from Section23 Films on DVDs . 
 In Japan , the Eyeshield 21 manga has sold over 20 million volumes . The manga and anime have been featured at various times in weekly top ten lists of best @-@ selling in their respective media . The anime has been watched by a large number of television viewers in Japan , helping to raise American football 's popularity in the country . Publications for manga , anime and others have commented on Eyeshield 21 , which received positive comments for its artwork and characters , and negative responses to its non @-@ football scenes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Tokyo , a weak , unassertive boy named Sena Kobayakawa enters the high school of his choice — Deimon Private Senior High School . Sena 's only remarkable physical abilities are his running speed and agility , which are noted by the school 's American football team captain Yoichi Hiruma . Hiruma forces Sena to join the Deimon Devil Bats football team as its running back . To protect his identity from other teams who want to recruit him , Sena is forced to publicly assume the role of team secretary and enter the field under the pseudonym of " Eyeshield 21 " wearing a helmet with an eyeshield to hide his features . The makeshift team initially takes part in the spring football tournament hoping to win through the strength of their new " secret weapon " . However , the extremely weak team is eliminated early by the Ojo White Knights , one of the best football teams in Japan . 
 After Deimon 's defeat , the spring tournament is revealed as secondary in importance to the fall tournament , where the teams compete for the chance to play in the Christmas Bowl — the high school football league championship . Hiruma , <unk> Kurita , and Sena regroup and slowly build a real team from misfits and students looking to define themselves , such as Tarō " Monta " Raimon — a baseball player who can only catch — and the Ha @-@ Ha Brothers . Other characters slowly join the team , and the series follows the building and growth of the Deimon Devil Bats and its members , and rival teams as they all strive to achieve their goal of playing in the Christmas Bowl . 
 Following the Christmas Bowl , Japan begins to gather the best football players to form a team to represent it at the American Football Youth World Championship , where a Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) will be awarded an NFL contract and $ 3 million . Team Japan reaches the final against Team America , in which the game ends as a tie , and both teams are declared winners . Both teams are unsatisfied with this and return to the field for their own , improvised " overtime " , causing chaos with officials . It is unclear which team wins the unofficial extra period , but Panther of Team America holds the MVP trophy aloft , winning the professional contract with the San Antonio Armadillos . The series concludes with Sena becoming the captain of the Devil Bats after Hiruma and Kurita leave school to attend college . In his final year of high school , Clifford invites Sena to Notre Dame High School . In the final chapter , the main characters are in college or playing amateur @-@ league football while employed .

 Before the series was published regularly , Inagaki and Murata published two one @-@ shots called Eyeshield Part 1 ( 前編 , Zenpen ) and Part 2 ( 後編 , Kōhen ) on March 5 and 12 , 2002 in Weekly Shōnen Jump . During Eyeshield 21 's original run in the magazine , Inagaki went several times to the United States to see college football matches , and visit a space center to collect reference materials to use as a basis for creating the NASA Aliens . He also visited a military base as he needed to draw one when Hiruma 's background is revealed , and watched an NFL game where he noted that the " players transmitted an intimidating and powerful feeling " , saying that they " were facing dinosaurs " . With this in mind he created Rikiya <unk> , an American player of monstrous size . 
 Despite having never played American football , Inagaki chose this theme after deciding that he wanted to create " a protagonist that was wimpy at the beginning , yet could perform outstandingly in a sports game " , and with this premise in mind he decided that American football would be " a very suitable material . " When originally creating Eyeshield 21 Inagaki said he was wary because he did not want his manga becoming " a simulator of football " . The fact that football is not a popular sport in Japan also worried Inagaki . As last resort , he thought to turn the series into a " Kamen Rider @-@ style masked hero story " if it could not met the popularity required for the magazine . 
 Before being asked to work on Eyeshield 21 , Yusuke Murata had read some of Inagaki 's manga and noted that they " had many cool design concepts of uniforms and equipment " . He said , " it could be turned into a great manga story " and he would " be happy to take the challenge " ; eventually he was chosen . While illustrating chapters , Murata made many mistakes , and his pollen allergy hurt him because whenever he made a mistake he inhaled dust from his eraser . To draw the characters ' sketches , he used a mechanical pencil that he considered special because it was given to him by Masanori Morita .

She also said that its art is " superb ... with every inch filled with details and no gag left unseen " . Zac Bertschy from Anime News Network ( ANN ) declared Eyeshield 21 " defies convention " by turning what most might consider " a really ridiculously bad idea " into " something most everyone would be able to enjoy " . Carlo Santos from ANN called it a " typical sports story " , writing that what make it an above average series are its characters and artwork . He also wrote that people who think American football is boring " may change their minds after seeing the action sequences in Eyeshield 21 . " Later , however , Santos said , " [ a ] lot of familiar clichés show themselves " in Eyeshield 21 , and that " [ t ] he storyline also does a sloppy job of keeping track of the game ... making it even less believable than it already is " .

It 's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game . Football is hard to understand , but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules ... in an entertaining way . We 're never left waiting for the ref 's decision for long minutes like in real life . A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays . " Finnegan also criticized the artwork , saying , " any episode [ of the show ] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio " . Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 " has a good solid story idea , showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential , but it is so sidelined so often that it 's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does .

Similarly , PopMatters critic John Bergstrom also described " Silvia " as the album 's centerpiece , referring it to as " stunning " . Naming it a " lost Duran Duran classic " , Bergstrom wrote , " It 's so thrilling , you 'll forgive the overzealous Auto @-@ Tune . " The single achieved minor commercial success on charts in the United Kingdom . It entered the UK Dance Chart at number 39 in the issue dated 23 January 2010 . The following week , it rose to number 32 , before acquiring its peak position of number 16 in its third week . " Silvia " spent four weeks on the chart ; its last appearance was in the issue dated 13 February 2010 at number 23 . The single missed the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart , peaking at number 154 in the issue dated 6 February 2010 .

 Marcus <unk> directed the accompanying music video for " Silvia " . It premiered exclusively on NME 's website in December 2009 . A writer for Complex commented , " The vid is kind of dramatic and hard to make sense of , but what do you expect from a band like this ? " The video plays out in a post @-@ apocalyptic world . It begins with the band 's three members waking up from sleeping in the middle of a street , appearing to be homeless . The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed . Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band . They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames .

 = Upsilon Andromedae d = 
 Upsilon Andromedae d ( abbreviated υ Andromedae d , υ And d ) , also named Majriti , is an extrasolar planet orbiting the Sun @-@ like star Upsilon Andromedae A every 1276 @.@ 46 days . Its discovery in April 1999 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler made this the first multiple @-@ planet system to be discovered around a main @-@ sequence star , and the first multiple @-@ planet system known in a multiple star system . Upsilon Andromedae d is the third known planet in order of distance from its star . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was Majriti for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 10th and early 11th Century astronomer Maslama al @-@ Majriti of Muslim Spain . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , Upsilon Andromedae d was detected by measuring variations in its star 's radial velocity as a result of the planet 's gravity . This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery , Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet , the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b ; however , by 1999 , it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve . 
 In 1999 , astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard @-@ Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three @-@ planet model best fit the data . The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 Upsilon Andromedae d orbits its star in an eccentric orbit , more eccentric than that of any of the major planets in the Solar System ( including Pluto ) . The orbit 's semimajor axis puts the planet in the habitable zone of Upsilon Andromedae A. 
 To explain the planet 's orbital eccentricity , some have proposed a close encounter with a ( now lost ) outer planet of Upsilon Andromedae A. The encounter would have moved Upsilon Andromedae d into an eccentric orbit closer to the star and ejected the outer planet from the system . Subsequently , gravitational perturbations from Upsilon Andromedae d moved the inner planet Upsilon Andromedae c into its present eccentric orbit . If so , the rogue planet would have had to be ejected immediately ; it is unclear how likely this situation might be . Other models are possible . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae d is that the orbital inclination is unknown , and only a lower limit on the planet 's mass can be obtained . However , by combining radial velocity measurements from ground @-@ based telescopes with astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope , astronomers have determined the orbital inclination as well as the actual mass of Upsilon Andromedae d , which is about 10 @.@ 25 times the mass of Jupiter . 
 Preliminary astrometric measurements suggest the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae d may be inclined at 155 @.@ 5 ° to the plane of the sky . However , these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits ; worthless for HD <unk> b and probably 55 Cancri c , and contradict even the inner planet u And b 's inclination of > 30 ° . The mutual inclination between c and d meanwhile is 29 @.@ 9 degrees . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that it is a gas giant with no solid surface and surface gravity of over 25 times that of Earth . Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of its star , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . 
 Upsilon Andromedae d lies in the habitable zone of Upsilon Andromedae A as defined both by the ability for an Earthlike world to retain liquid water at its surface and based on the amount of ultraviolet radiation received from the star . 
 = Bomber Mafia = 
 The Bomber Mafia were a close @-@ knit group of American military men who believed that long @-@ range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war . The derogatory term ' Bomber Mafia ' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief , and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding . 
 After World War II , the 20 years of foundational work by the bomber mafia resulted in the separation of the United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm . The bomber mafia 's strategic doctrine , changed by war and experience , helped shape the mission of the new Air Force and its Strategic Air Command . 
 Many years later a related term " Fighter Mafia " described those within the Air Force that favoured light weight fighters good at dog @-@ fighting instead of heavy missile @-@ firing fighters . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Developed over the years 1926 – 1929 at Air Corps Tactical School ( ACTS ) at Langley Field in Virginia , a forward @-@ looking doctrine of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by four instructors who argued that an enemy 's army and navy could be defeated intact due to the destruction of industrial and military targets deep within enemy @-@ held territory . This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet , though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed . In contrast , American theorists devised a strategy of pin @-@ point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons . Though unproven , the major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly , with minimal casualties , and that grinding , static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided . In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said " the bomber will always get through " , he was talking about the terror bombing of cities . The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission . They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets , not populations . 
 To effect this doctrine , the United States Army Air Corps would be required to expend the majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self @-@ defending heavy bombers , and in the training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions . The ACTS officers who believed in the heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other Air Corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft would take away from the proposed large fleet of heavy bombers . Moreover , the men realized that the United States government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet . To implement these changes , the ACTS instructors began to instill a sense in their students that a separate and independent air arm of the type described earlier by Brigadier General William " Billy " Mitchell , to be called the United States Air Force , was the way forward . As a compromise first step , the General Headquarters ( GHQ ) Air Force was established within the Army Air Corps in 1935 , commanded by General Frank M. Andrews , a strategic bombing advocate . Andrews staffed the command with like @-@ minded officers such as Henry H. " Hap " Arnold . 
 Although flawed and tested only under optimal conditions , the doctrine ( originally known as the " industrial web theory " ) became the primary airpower strategy of the United States in the planning for World War II . Four former instructors of the school , the core of the " Bomber Mafia " , produced the two airpower war plans ( AWPD @-@ 1 and AWPD @-@ 42 ) that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces . 
 = = Opposition = = 
 The term ' bomber mafia ' came from the sometimes bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed , and argued with , the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war , and that a separate air arm was required to command them . For the first few years , the strongest voice at ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain ( later General ) George C. Kenney who called for the use of air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground . He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces , with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers . Kenney left ACTS in 1929 , and heavy bomber <unk> filled the vacancy . The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself , who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations . 
 As an expert in the use of air units to aid artillery and infantry , Gordon P. Saville held to the concept of tactical air power through his time as ACTS instructor from 1934 to 1936 . Later , Saville successfully implemented his ideas in the Mediterranean Theater . 
 Captain Claire Lee Chennault , senior instructor in fighter tactics at ACTS , was a vocal Air Corps officer who challenged the bomber mafia for more than a decade ; he was forced into early retirement in 1937 , leaving the precision bombing advocates unopposed . The teaching of fighter ( " pursuit " ) tactics declined , though Earle E. Partridge and Hoyt S. Vandenberg continued to discuss the role of the fighter . 
 Other opposition was more subtle . USAAC Fighter Projects officer Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey appreciated that a large bomber fleet would be able to perform many military tasks , not just strategic bombing , and felt that the force 's doctrine should remain flexible to meet any demand . Because of his lower rank , he was in no position to challenge the bomber mafia , and instead strove to work around their restrictions on pursuit aircraft . Kelsey formulated a new " interceptor " class of aircraft in order to sustain his idea that a well @-@ armed fighter aircraft could successfully attack enemy bombers , and that , given drop tanks for long range , it could defend friendly bombers all the way to the target and back . 
 The bomber mafia , through a " failure of imagination " in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success , would not accept either of these concepts — they believed the heavy bomber fleet could protect itself , and thus they contributed to the delay in the development of a long @-@ range escort fighter until two years into the war . However , the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army , and the basis for modern airpower theory . ACTS graduate , instructor , and " Bomber Mafia " member Haywood S. Hansell concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the AWPD @-@ 1 war plan ( of which he was both ) made a serious mistake in neglecting long @-@ range fighter escort in their ideas . Hansell wrote : 
 It was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable , but no one could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability . Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School 's major shortcomings .

 In World War II , the bomber mafia 's theory of the primacy of unescorted daylight strategic bombing was proved wrong . Fleets of heavy bombers were not able to achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy , and required the protection of long @-@ range fighters for deep penetration missions . Overall casualties in the war were not minimal , and victory did not come significantly quicker . Precision in bombing was not achieved until long @-@ range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved , as opponents had warned . The strategic bombing concept , however , was a major factor in the eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force . Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age , forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare . The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare . 
 = M @-@ 71 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 71 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . It serves as a connector between M @-@ 21 in Owosso to Interstate 69 ( I @-@ 69 ) southwest of Flint . The highway runs along a rail line in a northwest @-@ to @-@ southeast direction in rural Shiawassee County connecting a few small towns along its path . 
 The highway dates back to the start of the state highway system in 1919 . There were some changes made to the routing in the 1930s which increased its length . Two adjacent highways have been rerouted which affected the locations of M @-@ 71 's termini . The last such change was made in the 1960s when the M @-@ 78 freeway ( now I @-@ 69 ) was completed near Durand . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 71 starts in downtown Owosso at the corner of Main Street ( M @-@ 21 ) and Water Street . It follows Water Street southeasterly until it reaches Washington Street . The highway follows Washington Street south and over the Shiawassee River and turns southeasterly on Corunna Avenue . M @-@ 71 runs parallel to , and in between , the river and a branch line of the Canadian National Railway . Corunna Avenue continues this way through the community of Middletown and into Corunna . M @-@ 71 turns south through downtown Corunna on Shiawassee Street to McNeil Street . It is along this stretch of the highway that the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) measured the highest traffic volumes for M @-@ 71 . In their 2009 survey , MDOT calculated that 10 @,@ 577 vehicles used this section of roadway in a measurement called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This value is a count for the average traffic in a day for any average day of the year . 
 From that junction , M @-@ 71 turns easterly and then southeasterly out of town . The highway continues to run alongside the rail line through farmland to the outskirts of Vernon . M @-@ 71 crosses the Shiawassee River for a second time . The rail line and the highway diverge and run on opposite sides of town ; the highway rounds the northeast side and the rail line runs along the southwest side . This section of trunkline through Vernon had the lowest AADT value in 2009 with 4 @,@ 371 vehicles . M @-@ 71 continues to the interchange with I @-@ 69 at exit 118 northwest of Durand , where the highway designation terminates . No part of M @-@ 71 has been listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) . The NHS is a system of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility .

 M @-@ 71 was formed by July 1 , 1919 as a spur route from M @-@ 21 , which ran along Lytle Road , southerly to Durand . Around 1925 , a realignment of M @-@ 21 produced changes in M @-@ 71 . M @-@ 21 was rerouted to its current alignment between Owosso and Lennon , and M @-@ 71 took over the roadway between Owosso and Corunna . At the same time , M @-@ 71 was shifted to run through Vernon . The section of M @-@ 71 between Durand and M @-@ 78 was transferred to M @-@ 78 and M @-@ 71 was shortened by 1934 . This transfer was reversed in 1935 when M @-@ 78 construction was completed . A new section of M @-@ 71 was built parallel to the Ann Arbor Railroad between Durand and Corunna in 1938 . This construction paved the last remaining unpaved segment of M @-@ 71 . The section of M @-@ 71 south of M @-@ 78 into Durand was turned back to local control in early 1939 , and M @-@ 71 was shortened one final time with the completion of the M @-@ 78 freeway ( now I @-@ 69 ) in the area in late 1960 or early 1961 . At that time , the eastern terminus was shifted to the freeway interchange instead of the old route of M @-@ 78 along Lansing Road .

 = Typhoon Forrest ( 1983 ) = 
 Super Typhoon Forrest was a powerful typhoon that affected Japan in September 1983 . Typhoon Forrest formed from a tropical disturbance far from land in the western Pacific Ocean . On September 20 , the system was classified as a tropical storm , and thereafter began to intensify . The next day , Forrest reached typhoon status , and the intensification process accelerated . The storm prudently strengthened on September 22 , and the following morning , attained peak intensity following a pressure drop of 100 mbar ( 3 @.@ 0 inHg ) in slightly less than 24 hours . Thereafter , Forrest began to weaken slowly as it moved northwest . Approaching Japan , Super Typhoon Forrest first hit Okinawa on September 27 . Nearby , a tornado hit Inza Island , destroying 26 homes and injuring 26 people . Forrest then moved north , impaling the elongated Japanese archipelago before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 28 . The torrential rainfall caused by the typhoon triggered deadly landslides and flooding across Japan . In all , the cyclone killed at least 21 people , left 17 listed as missing , and injured 86 . Forrest flooded 46 @,@ 000 homes in muddy water , over 100 dwellings were destroyed , and 2 @,@ 560 people were rendered as homeless . Seven flights were called off and 27 @,@ 000 people were stranded . In addition , 67 bridges and 818 roads were damaged . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Forrest originated from an area of disturbed weather that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) around 555 km ( 345 mi ) west of Pohnpei in mid @-@ September . Initially , the system was not well @-@ organized ; however , it had a sufficient amount of convection . Hurricane Hunters investigated the system four times from September 17 – 20 , though none of them were able to identify a closed atmospheric circulation . Despite this , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was issued on September 18 . This alert was issued again on September 19 ; meanwhile , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) started to monitor the system . By early on September 20 , the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm as it moved west @-@ northwest . During the evening hours of September 20 , the JTWC started issuing warnings on the system after the low developed a central dense overcast . At this time , the storm was located about 330 km ( 205 mi ) south of Guam . Initially , only gradually strengthening was expected by the JTWC , but this did not occur and by the morning hours of September 21 , Hurricane Hunters measured winds of 95 to 115 km / h ( 60 to 70 mph ) . Based on this , the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and named it Forrest . Around this time , JMA upgraded Forrest into a severe tropical storm . 
 By 1800 UTC that day , both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Forrest to typhoon status as the storm developed an eye . After moving away from Guam , Forrest continued deepening , by the evening hours of September 21 , Hurricane Hunters estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 976 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . Eleven hours later , however , the aircraft reported a pressure of 883 mbar ( 26 @.@ 1 inHg ) , according to the JTWC , this marked a pressure drop of 92 mbar ( 2 @.@ 7 inHg ) in a little under a day . Midday on September 22 , the JTWC assessed the intensity of the storm at 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale , and placed the storm 's barometric pressure at 876 mbar ( 25 @.@ 9 inHg ) , which marked the fastest pressure drop ever recorded by a tropical cyclone — 100 mb ( 3 @.@ 0 inHg ) in just under 24 hours . By this time , the temperature within the eye had reached 27 ° C ( 80 ° F ) . Despite this , the JMA estimated that Forrest had winds of only 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . Several hours later , the agency still estimated winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . After a brief turn towards the west @-@ northwest , the JMA reported that Forest attained peak intensity at 0000 UTC on September 23 , with winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 885 mbar ( 26 @.@ 1 inHg ) . 
 After attaining peak intensity , the storm weakened slightly on September 24 according to the JMA , though the storm briefly restrengthened to its peak wind speed at noon on September 25 . By this time , Forrest was moving northwest , and the JTWC expected the storm to recurve due to a weak spot in the subtropical ridge . However , the re @-@ curvature took longer than expected . The JMA suggested that the storm maintained its intensity of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) for several days . On September 27 , however , the JMA estimated that Forrest finally began to weaken . The storm quickly weakened thereafter , and by midday , the JMA downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm . During September 28 , the system completed its extratropical transition with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system early the next day . After becoming an extratropical cyclone the system recurved and started to accelerate towards the east @-@ northeast , before the JMA stopped monitoring the system during September 30 , as it moved into the East Pacific basin . Thereafter , several ships reported storm and gale force winds while the system moved towards the east @-@ northeast and along south @-@ west Alaska . The system was subsequently last noted on October 4 , as it stalled and gradually dissipated within the Gulf of Alaska , about 1 @,@ 415 km ( 880 mi ) to the northwest of Vancouver , Canada . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 During its formative stages , the storm passed near Guam , resulting in winds of 32 km / h ( 20 mph ) . Rainfall was light , totaling 51 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) , but was enough to result in slight flooding . 
 While weakening and passing 200 km ( 125 mi ) southwest of Okinawa , gusty winds and heavy rains were recorded . At the Kadena Air Base , winds of 95 km / h ( 59 mph ) and gusts of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) were measured . Rainfall of 296 mm ( 11 @.@ 7 in ) was recorded , resulting in minor flooding . A few people were hurt due to high winds , but according to the JTWC , the residents of <unk> weathered the storm " well " . Numerous funnel clouds were spotted , but no tornadoes were recorded . Northwest of <unk> , on <unk> Island , a tornado was reported , which cleared a 91 m ( 299 ft ) wide swath . Throughout the island of Okinawa , 30 sustained minor injuries and 20 homes would either damaged , including seven homes that were destroyed . About 160 @,@ 000 customers lost power . 
 When the storm posed a threat to Kyushu , five ships were evacuated to an air force base that was considered " safe typhoon haven " by the JTWC . In <unk> , 540 mm ( 21 in ) of rain fell , including 415 mm ( 16 @.@ 3 in ) in 24 hours and 102 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) in one hour . In Nagoya , five children were washed away by rising floodwaters while they were walking home from school . Four of the children were confirmed dead , and one 5 @-@ year @-@ old child was reported missing . In Nishinomiya , near the western city of Kyoto , twelve construction workers were swept away by a downpour @-@ triggered mudslide . Four of the construction workers were rescued , but the remaining eight of the construction workers were missing . Elsewhere in the city , a landslide destroyed two homes , resulting in the deaths of a 71 @-@ year @-@ old and a 77 @-@ year @-@ old farmer . Around 60 mi ( 95 km ) south of Tokyo , in Shizuoka , three construction workers were swept along the Nishi River . In Hyogo , on Honshu , 12 people were buried alive when a hut collapsed due to a mudslide . 
 In all , Forest killed at least 21 people , left 17 missing , and injured 86 . Due to overflowing rivers and dikes , 46 @,@ 000 homes were flooded , including 141 " seriously " . Around 7 @,@ 700 homes were under water , and over 100 were destroyed . In addition , 67 bridges and 818 roads were damaged . A total of 2 @,@ 560 people were homeless .

 = Ico = 
 Ico ( <unk> , Iko , / <unk> / ) is a puzzle @-@ platformer and action @-@ adventure video game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment , released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions . It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda , who wanted to create a minimalist game around a " boy meets girl " concept . Originally planned for the PlayStation , Ico took approximately four years to develop . The team employed a " subtracting design " approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game 's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion . 
 The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns , which his village considers a bad omen . Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress . During his explorations of the fortress , Ico encounters Yorda , the daughter of the castle 's Queen . The Queen plans to use Yorda 's body to extend her own lifespan . Learning this , Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda , keeping her safe from the shadow @-@ like creatures that attempt to draw her back . Throughout the game , the player controls Ico as he explores the castle , solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles . 
 Ico introduced several design and technical elements , including a story told with minimal dialogue , bloom lighting , and key frame animation , that have influenced subsequent games . Although not a commercial success , it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards , including " Game of the Year " nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards . Ico is listed on several overall top game lists , and is often considered a work of art . It was re @-@ released in Europe in 2006 , in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus , the spiritual successor to Ico . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ico is primarily a three @-@ dimensional platform game . The player controls Ico from a third @-@ person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda . The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move ; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings . The game includes many elements of platform games ; for example , the player must have Ico jump , climb , push and pull objects , and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle . These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions ; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers . The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles , such as by lifting her to a higher ledge , or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself . The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico , or to wait at a spot . The player can also have Ico take Yorda 's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment . Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open . 
 Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen . These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time , or if she is in certain areas of the castle . Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex . While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico , the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex ; the player restarts from a save point . The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height . Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game . In European and Japanese releases of the game , upon completion of the game , the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co @-@ operative two @-@ player mode , where the second player plays as Yorda , still under the same limitations as the computer @-@ controlled version of the character . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Ico ( <unk> , pronounced " Ee @-@ ko " ) , a horned boy , is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed . A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes . As he searches the castle , he comes across Yorda ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a captive girl who speaks a different language . Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow @-@ like creatures . The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land . As they cross , the Queen , ruler of the castle , appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle . The Queen destroys part of the bridge ; although Yorda tries to save him , Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness . 
 Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels , finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures . After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen , he confronts the Queen in her throne room , who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda 's body . Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword , but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him ; he is hit by falling debris , breaking his horns , and he falls unconscious . The Queen 's spell on Yorda is broken , and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat , sending him to drift to the shore alone . Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins , and Yorda , in her human form , washed up nearby . She stirs . 
 = = Development = = 
 Lead designer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for Ico in 1997 , envisioning a " boy meets girl " story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure , forming a bond between them without communication . Ueda 's main inspiration for Ico was Eric Chahi 's game Another World ( Outer World in Japan ) , which used cinematic cutscenes and lacked any head @-@ up display elements as to play like a movie . It also featured an emotional connection between two characters , despite the use of minimal dialog . Ueda also cited Lemmings , Flashback and the original Prince of Persia games as influences , specifically regarding animation and gameplay style . With the help of an assistant , Ueda created an animation in Lightwave to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision . In the three @-@ minute demonstration reel , Yorda had the horns instead of Ico , and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle . Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process , and he reused this technique for the development of Shadow of the Colossus , the team 's next effort . 
 Ueda began working with producer Kenji Kaido in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the PlayStation . Ico 's design aesthetics were guided by three key notions : to make a game that would be different from others in the genre , feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic , and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting . This was achieved through the use of " subtracting design " ; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game 's reality . This included removing any form of interface elements , keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle , and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe . An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle . The game originally focused on Ico 's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors . Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed , and as part of the " subtracting design " , replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures . Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development . These consisted of two programmers , four artists , and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido , forming the base of what is now known as Team Ico . On reflection , Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game , and did not go to as great an extreme with Shadow of the Colossus . 
 After two years of development , the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice : either terminate the project altogether , alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware , or continue to explore more options . The team decided to remain true to Ueda 's vision , and began to use the Emotion Engine of the PlayStation 2 , taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform . Character animation was accomplished through key frame animation instead of the more common motion capture technique . Ico is recognized as one of the first games to incorporate bloom lighting into video games , a feature that is common in later seventh generation console video games . The game took about four years to create . Ueda purposely left the ending vague , not stating whether Yorda was alive , whether she would travel with Ico , or if it was simply the protagonist 's dream . 
 The cover used for releases in Japan and PAL regions was drawn by Ueda himself , and was inspired by the surrealist artist Giorgio de Chirico and his work , The Nostalgia of the Infinite . Ueda believed that " the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico " . The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once . The development team was unable to provide Ueda 's cover or the additional features such as the two @-@ player mode in time for Sony 's planned North American release date , but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions . On reflection , <unk> Kobayashi , vice @-@ president of Sony 's Japan Studio , believed the North American box art and lack of an identifiable English title led to the game 's poor sales in the United States , and stated plans to correct that for the release of The Last Guardian . For its original release , a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box . The game was re @-@ released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of Shadow of the Colossus , Ico 's spiritual sequel , to allow players to " fill the gap in their collection " . 
 Ico uses minimal dialog in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game . Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shindō as Ico , Rieko Takahashi as Yorda , and Misa Watanabe as the Queen . Ico and the Queen 's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region , but Yorda 's speech is presented in a symbolic language . Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda 's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda , and detracted from the " holding hands " concept of the game . In the non @-@ North American releases , playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles .

 Ico received strong reviews , becoming a cult hit among gamers . The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at Metacritic . In Japan , Famitsu magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40 . The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time ; Edge ranked Ico as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing , while IGN ranked the game at number 18 in 2005 , and at number 57 in 2007 . Ico has been used as an example of a game that is a work of art . Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance Ico from conventional video games due to the negative image that video games were receiving at that time , in order to draw more people to the title . 
 Some reviewers have likened Ico to older , simpler adventure games such as Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider , that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player ; IGN 's David Smith commented that while simple , as an experience the game was " near indescribable . " The game 's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics ; Smith continues that " The visuals , sound , and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost , if not quite , completely unlike anything else on the market , and feels wonderful because of it . " Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments , the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count , as well as the use of lighting effects . Ico 's ambiance , created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters , were also called out as strong points for the game . Charles Herold of The New York Times summed up his review stating that " Ico is not a perfect game , but it is a game of perfect moments . " Herold later commented that Ico breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions . In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non @-@ playable characters ' fate , but Ico creates the sense of " trust and childish fragility " around Yorda , and that these leads to the character being " the game 's entire focus " . 
 The game is noted for its simple combat system that would " disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth " , as stated by GameSpot 's Miguel Lopez . The game 's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own ; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer , for example , said that " you quietly , logically , willingly proceed , and the illusion is perfect : the game never tells you what to do , even though the game is always telling you what to do " . Ico is also considered a short game , taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through , which Game Revolution calls " painfully short " with " no replay outside of self @-@ imposed challenges " . G4TV 's Matthew Keil , however , felt that " the game is so strong , many will finish ' Ico ' in one or two sittings " . The lack of features in the North American release , which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game , was said to reduce the replay value of the title . Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that " Yorda would probably be the worst companion <unk> 's scatterbrained and helpless ; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her , making the game 's ending all the more heartrending . " 
 Despite the positive praise , the original title did not sell well . By 2009 , only 700 @,@ 000 copies were sold worldwide , with 270 @,@ 000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions , Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game , as at the time of the game 's release , promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots , and as Ico lacked any heads @-@ up display , it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 Ico received several gaming acclamations from the video gaming press , and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications , despite competing with releases such as Halo , Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty , and Grand Theft Auto III . The game received three Game Developers Choice Awards in 2002 , including " Excellence in Level Design " , " Excellence in Visual Arts " , and " Game Innovation Spotlight " . The game won two Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 2002 for " Art Direction " and " Character or Story Development " , and was nominated for awards of " Game of the Year " , " Game Design " , " Level Design " and " Sound Design " .

 Ico is stated by Chris Kohler of Wired to have influenced numerous other video games , borrowing from its simple and visual design ideals . Several game designers , such as Eiji Aonuma , Hideo Kojima , and Jordan Mechner , have cited Ico as having influenced the visual appearance of their games , including The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess , Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater , and Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time , respectively . Marc Laidlaw , scriptwriter for the Half @-@ Life series , commented that , among several other more memorable moments in the game , the point where Yorda attempts to save Ico from falling off the damaged bridge was " a significant event not only for that game , but for the art of game design " . The Naughty Dog team used Ico as part of the inspiration for developing Uncharted 3 . Vander Caballero credits Ico for inspiring the gameplay of Papo & Yo . Phil Fish used the design by subtraction approach in developing the title Fez . The developers of both Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons and Rime have Ico as a core influence on their design . <unk> Miyazaki , creator and director of the Souls series and <unk> , cited Ico as a key influence to him becoming involved in developing video games , stating that Ico " awoke me to the possibilities of the medium " . 
 Film director Guillermo del Toro cited both Ico and Shadow of the Colossus as " masterpieces " and part of his directorial influence . Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead considers , of his top ten video games , " Ico might be the best one " .

 Shadow of the Colossus ( ワンダと巨像 , Wanda to Kyozō , Wander and the Colossus ) , released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2005 in Japan and North America , was developed by the same team that developed Ico . The game features similar graphics , gameplay , and storytelling elements as Ico . The game was referred by its working title " Nico " ( " Ni " being Japanese for the number 2 " ) until the final title was revealed . Ueda , when asked about the connection between the two games , stated that Shadow of the Colossus is a prequel to Ico , specifically citing the ending of Shadow where a child is born with two horns . 
 Team Ico 's third game , The Last Guardian was originally announced as a PlayStation 3 title at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 ; the game centers on the connection between a young boy and a large <unk> @-@ like creature that he befriends , requiring the player to get the creature to cooperate as to help complete the game 's puzzles . The game fell into several complications from both hardware limitations and the departure of Ueda and other Team Ico members from Sony around 2012 , though Ueda and other members continued to work on the game via consulting contracts . The game was subsequently switched to the PlayStation 4 in 2012 , and was formally reintroduced in 2015 , with plans for release in 2016 . Ueda has stated that " the essence of the game is rather close to Ico " .

 = The Livestock Conservancy = 
 The Livestock Conservancy , formerly known as the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ( ALBC ) and prior to that , the American Minor Breeds Conservancy , is a nonprofit organization focused on preserving and promoting rare breeds , also known as " heritage breeds " of livestock . Founded in 1977 , through the efforts of livestock breed enthusiasts concerned about the disappearance of many of the US 's heritage livestock breeds , the Conservancy was the pioneer livestock preservation organization in the United States , and remains a leading organization in that field . It has initiated programs that have saved multiple breeds from extinction , and works closely with similar organizations in other countries , including Rare Breeds Canada . With 3 @,@ 000 members , a staff of nine and a 19 @-@ member board of directors , the organization has an operating budget of almost half a million dollars . 
 The Livestock Conservancy maintains a conservation priority list that divides endangered breeds of horses , asses , sheep , goats , cattle , rabbits , pigs and poultry into five categories based on population numbers and historical interest . The organization has published several books , and works with breed registries and other groups on several aspects of breed preservation , including genetic testing , historical documentation , animal rescue and marketing . Preservation of genetic material is of special interest to the Conservancy , and for a period of time it maintained a gene bank that was later transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture . It has also developed and published several heritage definitions , including parameters for heritage breeds of cattle and poultry . 
 In large part due to the efforts of the organization , heritage turkey populations have increased more than tenfold in little over a decade , and several breeds that once stood on the brink of extinction now maintain healthy populations . The organization also sustains programs that deal with preserving and promoting endangered cattle and pig breeds , as well as breed @-@ specific programs relating to many of its livestock categories . Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh Tacky horse , Randall cattle , Red Wattle hogs and the American rabbit . 
 = = History and organization = = 
 In the 1960s and 1970s , American livestock breed enthusiasts , including scientists , farmers , and historians , became increasingly aware of the disappearance of many traditional livestock breeds in the US . This awareness was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites . This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old <unk> Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino , as they had gone extinct . As a result , these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction . On March 16 , 1977 , the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont . It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds , and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States . A similar organization in Great Britain , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , had been formed in 1973 . The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985 . Since then , the survey has been repeated every five years , with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between . The initial survey was called " the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States " . In 1986 , a fellow organization , Rare Breeds Canada , was formed , and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada . In 1993 , the organization changed its name to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ( ALBC ) . In 2013 , the organization again shortened its name to " The Livestock Conservancy " . 
 The Livestock Conservancy is headquartered in Pittsboro , North Carolina . Its mission is to protect " genetic diversity in livestock and poultry species through the conservation and promotion of endangered breeds . " It organizes and participates in programs to rescue threatened populations , educate the public about rare breeds and genetic diversity , support breeders and breed associations , perform research on endangered breeds and assist gene banks in preserving genetic material . The Conservancy includes among its partners and members the Oklahoma City Zoo , which maintains the Children 's Zoo , a petting zoo and children 's museum that holds members of eight rare livestock breeds ; and Colonial Williamsburg , a living @-@ history museum that maintains populations of ten rare breeds . 
 According to its literature , the Livestock Conservancy is funded by grants , sales of publications and promotional materials , membership dues and public donations . Publications sold include books on conservation and genetics , livestock husbandry , farming operations and breed guides . In the 1998 fiscal year , the organization claimed slightly over US $ 308 @,@ 000 in income , coming mainly from public donations and membership dues , but also including service revenue , investment income and sales of goods . By 2009 , this amount had jumped to slightly more than US $ 440 @,@ 000 , mainly from donations , grants and service revenue , but also including investment income . In 1998 , the organization claimed slightly over US $ 288 @,@ 000 in expenses , allocated mainly to program services , but with just under US $ 30 @,@ 000 stemming from management , fundraising and general expenses . By 2009 , expenses stood at almost US $ 490 @,@ 000 , spent mostly on employee salaries , benefits and other compensation ( which includes program service expenses ) , but with almost US $ 150 @,@ 000 stemming from management , fundraising and general expenses . The organization claims around 3 @,@ 000 members as of 2009 , a number up from 2 @,@ 300 in 1989 . It operates with a staff of nine , headed by an executive director , and a nineteen @-@ member board of directors .

 The preservation of various pure breeds and strains , including some that are rare today , was once undertaken in North America in large part by large agriculture @-@ focused colleges and universities . However , many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains , with many herds being sent to slaughter . The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases , leading to the survival and preservation of some gene stocks . The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology @-@ based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm ( genetic material ) storage . However , although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds , it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed , and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can . The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation , and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times , they were never focused on individual breeds . The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US . 
 In the 1980s , the Conservancy began a gene bank designed to preserve the genetic material of rare breeds . After collecting genetic material from over a dozen rare breeds , the bank was transferred to the USDA National Animal Germplasm Program ( NAGP ) . It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP , including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds . The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the <unk> Foundation , an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve germplasm from rare breeds . In the early 1990s , the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History , designed to raise public awareness of the declining populations of rare livestock breeds . 
 In 2004 , the Livestock Conservancy entered a partnership with Slow Food USA , Chefs Collaborative , and four other organizations to found the Renewing America 's Food Traditions collaboration . The effort resulted in a book , Renewing America 's Food Traditions , describing more than 1000 varieties and species of food that are disappearing from the United States . The organization has written or published over a dozen books on heritage livestock breeds , including several on heritage poultry and waterfowl and more on general livestock conservation . Its conservation criteria and literature on livestock biodiversity are also widely used in independent publications on breeds . The Conservancy organizes an annual conference that focuses on the preservation and promotion of rare livestock breeds . For this conference , it partners with other organizations to teach members and other attendees about various aspects of rare breed livestock . For instance , in 2005 , the organization partnered with the NAGP and the American <unk> Association for a discussion on the cryogenic preservation of rare breed genetic material , which included a tour of the USDA Livestock and Poultry Gene Bank . In 2009 , the Conservancy set up an online classified advertisement system to help users find and purchase rare breeds . 
 = = = Heritage breeds = = = 
 The Livestock Conservancy has released three definitions of heritage breeds , pertaining to turkeys , chickens and cattle . Heritage turkeys are defined by the organization as breeds that live longer , grow slower and can mate naturally , with the latter requirement being one of the most important as it is not met by many industrially grown , mass @-@ produced breeds . In 2009 , a definition for heritage chickens was released that is similar to the one for turkeys – breeds are required to be considered " standard " by the American Poultry Association , be long @-@ lived and slow @-@ growing , and able to mate naturally . The latter is less of a concern in chickens than in turkeys , as artificial insemination has not progressed as far in the development of industrial chicken farming . In late 2010 , the Conservancy released a definition of " heritage cattle " , to follow their earlier heritage turkey description . Requirements for heritage cattle breeds include having a long history in the US , being purebred , and being a true genetic breed . Specifications for heritage milk and beef , as well as products made from them , were also released with the definition . 
 As of 2010 , the Conservancy was undertaking several programs to help breeders and the public understand the need for and the way to preserve heritage breeds . As the number of expert livestock breeders continues to dwindle , the Master Breeders ' Apprentice Program aims to supplement their number by educating competent and interested members of the public . Through the Breed Rescue and Conservation Acquisition Program , the organization works with breeders and breed registries to begin and sustain conservation programs for rare livestock breeds . The Southeastern Livestock Breed Initiative aims to expand and reintroduce rare breeds from the American southeast , combining traditional breeds with low @-@ impact farming ( agriculture that has a lesser impact on the environment than high @-@ intensity commercial farming ) to assist in restarting the small , niche market farming that once existed in the area . In 2014 , the Conservancy published the book An Introduction to Heritage Breeds describing conserving and care of animals under the purview of the organization , detailing each breed 's specific needs and characteristics . 
 = = Conservation Priority List = = 
 The Conservation Priority List ( CPL ) is the Conservancy 's list of breeds for which conservation is a priority . Published annually , the list is used as the foundation for all conservation work done by the organization . Each year , it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock , including registration data and , for poultry , census numbers gathered from members , hatcheries and breeders . This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories : critical , threatened , watch , recovering and study . Breeds are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations . Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor . Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest . Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds , or proof that they are a true breed , instead of a type or non @-@ true @-@ breeding cross . 
 As of 2011 , there are 33 horse breeds on the equine CPL , comprising seventeen in the critical category , seven in the threatened , five in the watch , three in the recovering and one in study . There are also three breeds of asses , one in each of the critical , threatened and recovering categories . On the CPL for all other livestock species there are 10 pig breeds : seven in the critical category , one threatened , one watched , and one in the study . The 19 cattle breeds listed include eight in the critical category , two in the threatened , three in the watch , five recovering and one in the study . The list contains 23 sheep breeds : five in the critical category , six in the threatened , three in the watch , eight in the recovering and one in the study . Of seven goat breeds listed , two are in the critical category , two in the watch , two recovering and one in the study . Finally , there are 11 rabbit breeds listed on the CPL : three in the critical category , three threatened , and five in the watch . 
 The organization 's poultry conservation list includes chickens , ducks , geese and turkeys . As of 2011 there are 54 chicken breeds on the CPL : 12 in the critical category , 12 in the threatened , 18 in the watch , 7 in the recovering and 5 in the study . For ducks there were fourteen breeds , of which six were considered critical , two threatened , four watch and two study . There were 12 breeds of geese : six in the critical category , one in threatened , three in watch and two study . For turkeys there were 13 breeds , including five considered critical , two threatened , five watch and one study . Any naturally mating , non @-@ standard turkey breed is also of interest to the organization .

 Equine breeds , such as the American Cream Draft , were among the reasons that the organization was formed , and were on the earliest conservation priority lists . The Conservancy has assisted in extensive genetic studies of rare horse breeds , focusing particularly on strains of the Colonial Spanish Horse . Rabbits , having only been added to the CPL in 2005 , have been among the least studied , although in 2010 , the organization named the American Rabbit as the most endangered breed of rabbit in the US . Work with cattle has also been limited , although in one case , a member rescued the last of the Randall Cattle herd from slaughter ; the breed has since been built up to more than 300 members . One major initiative with cattle is the Heritage Dairy Cattle Breed Recovery program , which assists heritage cattle breeders and breed organizations with funding , marketing and communications , with a focus on selling their product to other small operations , including cheese and dairy operations . 
 = = = Horses = = = 
 In 2006 , the Livestock Conservancy began investigating the Carolina Marsh Tacky to see if it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock , and during the organization 's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses . In 2007 , the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling , the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed . The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed . After the rescue , a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties . It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California . This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry . 
 = = = Sheep and goats = = = 
 In December 1987 , the Conservancy performed one of its first breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island . The sheep were in danger of being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy , which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food . The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988 , with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991 . The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage , which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions . 
 Beginning in the early 1990s , the Conservancy worked to preserve the San Clemente Island goat , a rare Spanish @-@ descended breed from California . In 1991 , it added genetic material from the San Clemente to their genetic database , later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program . As of June 2010 , the organization was working on the rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina . There are less than 2 @,@ 500 members of the breed in the United States , and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US . Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats , then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction . A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of <unk> Inlet , South Carolina , and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established . 
 = = = Pigs = = = 
 In the course of its breed surveys and monitoring , the Conservancy has found significant changes in the populations of several swine breeds . The Berkshire breed has increased significantly in number , partially due to international demand for its meat , while other breeds have shown significant decreases , most likely due to increasing consolidation of the pork industry to large producers who use only a few specialized pork strains . Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003 , while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent in the same time . 
 The Conservancy has been involved with the Red Wattle hog since the 1980s . At that time , the breed had a thriving population , stock was registered by three different breed registries , and breeders resisted suggestions from the organization to create a unified breed registry . However , between 1990 and 1999 , purebred stock diminished from 272 animals to just 42 pigs held by six breeders , and in 2000 , it was asked to create a unified breed registry for the Red Wattle Hog . Three hogs were registered in the first year , but the next year 90 hogs and three breeders were represented and a breed association was created . By 2008 , 111 breeding stock hogs had been registered and 56 breeders were part of the Red Wattle Hog Association . 
 In November 2008 , the Conservancy started the Rare Breed Swine Initiative , which , in cooperation with other organizations , assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market . The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products , conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations . As of 2010 , proposals were in place for the funding of a study of porcine genetics , including variability and relationships among breeds , with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork .

 A breeding program for Buckeye chickens was developed in 2005 by staff members , focusing on using selective breeding to improve the breed and expand its numbers . In 2011 , the Buckeye was able to be moved from " critical " status to " threatened " , based on a 2010 census that found almost 2 @,@ 500 birds . The program has since become the template for similar programs focusing on the preservation of other rare chicken breeds . 
 Heritage turkey breeds have been a focus for the organization since 1997 , when a survey showed only 1 @,@ 335 breeding stock birds of all breeds . A study conducted by the Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers , and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics . This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4 @,@ 275 turkeys of all breeds . By 2007 this had grown to more than 10 @,@ 000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct . As of 2010 , the number is estimated to be close to 15 @,@ 000 . 
 In 2008 the Conservancy partnered with Slow Food USA and other organizations to conduct a blind taste test of nine breeds of turkeys – eight heritage breeds and one standard industrially grown breed . When the final scores were read , first place went to the Midget White Turkey , second to the Bourbon Red and last place to the Butterball – the single non @-@ heritage breed . This was the largest taste test among turkey breeds to date , and several of the heritage breeds were later added to the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste .

 SR 28 begins at U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) in Douglas County , Nevada . It heads north from there , forming part of the boundary of Lake Tahoe – Nevada State Park until crossing into Carson City . The highway then enters Washoe County , where the highway enters Humboldt @-@ Toiyabe National Forest . It then turns northwest , running through Incline Village . In western Incline Village , SR 28 junctions with SR 431 , which is a direct link to Reno to the northeast . Just short of the California state line , it turns south to run parallel to the line and finally crosses into California at Crystal Bay . The road continues west of the California border as California State Route 28 . 
 The route has been designated as the north piece of the Lake Tahoe – <unk> Drive Scenic Byway , as part of the National Scenic Byway program . SR 28 was also designated as a state scenic byway .

 = Tower of London = 
 The Tower of London , officially Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London , is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London . It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 , and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under Kings Richard the Lionheart , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site . 
 The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history . It was besieged several times , and controlling it has been important to controlling the country . The Tower has served variously as an armoury , a treasury , a menagerie , the home of the Royal Mint , a public records office , and the home of the Crown Jewels of England . From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II , a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch . In the absence of the monarch , the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle . This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period . In the late 15th century the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower . Under the Tudors , the Tower became used less as a royal residence , and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery . 
 The peak period of the castle 's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries , when many figures who had fallen into disgrace , such as Elizabeth I before she became queen , Sir Walter Raleigh , and Elizabeth Throckmorton were held within its walls . This use has led to the phrase " sent to the Tower " . Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death , popularised by 16th @-@ century religious propagandists and 19th @-@ century writers , only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th century . Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle , with 112 occurring there over a 400 @-@ year period . In the latter half of the 19th century , institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations , leaving many buildings empty . Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance , clearing out many of the vacant post @-@ medieval structures . In the First and Second World Wars , the Tower was again used as a prison , and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage . After the Second World War , damage caused during the Blitz was repaired , and the castle reopened to the public . Today the Tower of London is one of the country 's most popular tourist attractions . Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower , it is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 The Tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking Saxon London , which archaeologist Alan Vince suggests was deliberate . It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames . The castle is made up of three " wards " , or enclosures . The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle . <unk> it to the north , east , and west is the inner ward , built during the reign of Richard the Lionheart ( 1189 – 1199 ) . Finally , there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London , the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285 . The castle encloses an area of almost 12 acres ( 4 @.@ 9 hectares ) with a further 6 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 ha ) around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties – land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons . The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th century when Henry III ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear . Despite popular fiction , the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber , although the basement of the White Tower housed a rack in later periods . Tower Wharf was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of Richard II ( 1377 – 1399 ) . 
 = = = White Tower = = = 
 The White Tower is a keep ( also known as a donjon ) , which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle , and contained lodgings suitable for the lord – in this case the king or his representative . According to military historian Allen Brown , " The great tower [ White Tower ] was also , by virtue of its strength , majesty and lordly accommodation , the donjon par excellence " . As one of the largest keeps in the Christian world , the White Tower has been described as " the most complete eleventh @-@ century palace in Europe " . 
 The White Tower , not including its projecting corner towers , measures 36 by 32 metres ( 118 by 105 ft ) at the base , and is 27 m ( 90 ft ) high at the southern battlements . The structure was originally three storeys high , comprising a basement floor , an entrance level , and an upper floor . The entrance , as is usual in Norman keeps , was above ground , in this case on the south face , and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack . It was probably during Henry II 's reign ( 1154 – 1189 ) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance , but it has not survived . Each floor was divided into three chambers , the largest in the west , a smaller room in the north @-@ east , and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south @-@ east . At the western corners of the building are square towers , while to the north @-@ east a round tower houses a spiral staircase . At the south @-@ east corner there is a larger semi @-@ circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel . As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold , latrines were built into the walls , and four fireplaces provided warmth . 
 The main building material is Kentish rag @-@ stone , although some local mudstone was also used . Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower 's facing , although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17th and 18th centuries . As most of the Tower 's windows were enlarged in the 18th century , only two original – albeit restored – examples remain , in the south wall at the gallery level . 
 The tower was terraced into the side of a mound , so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level . As was typical of most keeps , the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage . One of the rooms contained a well . Although the layout has remained the same since the tower 's construction , the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre @-@ existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts . The basement is lit through small slits . 
 The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower , Lieutenant of the Tower of London and other important officials . The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century , and not reopened until 1973 . Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east , also connected to the entrance floor . The crypt of St John 's Chapel occupied the south @-@ east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber . There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt ; according to Geoffrey Parnell , Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries , " the windowless form and restricted access , suggest that it was designed as a strong @-@ room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents " . 
 The upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east – both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall – and St John 's Chapel in the south @-@ east . The top floor was added in the 15th century , along with the present roof . St John 's Chapel was not part of the White Tower 's original design , as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls . Due to changes in function and design since the tower 's construction , except for the chapel little is left of the original interior . The chapel 's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period . In the 13th century , during Henry III 's reign , the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold @-@ painted cross , and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity . 
 = = = Innermost ward = = = 
 The innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower , stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames . As was the case at other castles , such as the 11th @-@ century Hen Domen , the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower 's foundation . Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain , although it had happened by the 1170s . The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s , becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle . Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers – located at the corners of the innermost ward 's wall along the river – began around 1220 . They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively . The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III 's reign : the queen 's chamber was whitewashed , and painted with flowers and imitation stonework . A great hall existed in the south of the ward , between the two towers . It was similar to , although slightly smaller than , that also built by Henry III at Winchester Castle . Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king 's apartments . The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch , which had been filled in by the 1220s . Around this time , a kitchen was built in the ward . Between 1666 and 1676 , the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed . The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground . The Jewel House was demolished , and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower . 
 = = = Inner ward = = = 
 The inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart 's reign , when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward , effectively doubling the castle 's size . Henry III created the ward 's east and north walls , and the ward 's dimensions remain to this day . Most of Henry 's work survives , and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt . Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers , the innermost ward 's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward . The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse , most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower . The inner ward 's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I. The 13th @-@ century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large @-@ scale use of brick as a building material in Britain , since the 5th @-@ century departure of the Romans . The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall . Anti @-@ clockwise from the south @-@ west corner they are : Bell , Beauchamp , Devereux , Flint , Bowyer , Brick , Martin , Constable , Broad Arrow , Salt , Lanthorn , Wakefield , and the Bloody Tower . While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy , they also contained accommodation . As its name suggests , Bell Tower housed a belfry , its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack . The royal bow @-@ maker , responsible for making longbows , crossbows , catapults , and other siege and hand weapons , had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower . A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night . 
 As a result of Henry 's expansion , St Peter ad Vincula , a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower , was incorporated into the castle . Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows , and stalls for himself and his queen . It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £ 300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519 ; the current building dates from this period , although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century . Immediately west of Wakefield Tower , the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward 's curtain wall , and as a water @-@ gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames . It was a simple structure , protected by a portcullis and gate . The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century , as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower . Between 1339 and 1341 , a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers . During the Tudor period , a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward . The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period , mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance . In 1663 just over £ 4 @,@ 000 was spent building a new storehouse ( now known as the New Armouries ) in the inner ward . Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688 , on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses ; it was destroyed by fire in 1841 . The Waterloo Block , a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details , was built on the site and remains to this day , housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor . 
 = = = Outer ward = = = 
 A third ward was created during Edward I 's extension to the Tower , as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle . At the same time a bastion known as Legge 's Mount was built at the castle 's north @-@ west corner . Brass Mount , the bastion in the north @-@ east corner , was a later addition . The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres ( 49 ft ) apart were dismantled in 1843 . Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period , there is no evidence to support this ; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge 's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements ( also known as crenellations ) in the south side of Legge 's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London ( the rest are Victorian replacements ) . A new 50 @-@ metre ( 160 ft ) moat was dug beyond the castle 's new limits ; it was originally 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) deeper in the middle than it is today . With the addition of a new curtain wall , the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant ; a new entrance was created in the south @-@ west corner of the external wall circuit . The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican , which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s . The Lion Tower itself no longer survives . Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames . In this wall , he built St Thomas 's Tower between 1275 and 1279 ; later known as Traitors ' Gate , it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle 's water @-@ gate . The building is unique in England , and the closest parallel is the now demolished water @-@ gate at the Louvre in Paris . The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River ; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered . There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor . Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower ; its exact location early on is unknown , although it was probably in either the outer ward or the Lion Tower . By 1560 , the Mint was located in a building in the outer ward near Salt Tower . Between 1348 and 1355 , a second water @-@ gate , Cradle Tower , was added east of St Thomas 's Tower for the king 's private use . 
 = = Foundation and early history = = 
 Victorious at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066 , the invading Duke of Normandy , William the Conqueror , spent the rest of the year securing his holdings , by fortifying key positions . He founded several castles along the way , but took a circuitous route toward London ; only when he reached Canterbury did he turn towards England 's largest city . As the fortified bridge into London was held by Saxon troops , he decided instead to ravage Southwark before continuing his journey around southern England . A series of Norman victories along the route cut the city 's supply lines and in December 1066 , isolated and intimidated , its leaders yielded London without a fight . Between 1066 and 1087 , William established 36 castles , although references in the Domesday Book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates . The new ruling elite undertook what has been described as " the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle @-@ building in the whole history of feudal Europe " . They were multi @-@ purpose buildings , serving as fortifications ( used as a base of operations in enemy territory ) , centres of administration , and residences . 
 William sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance , to celebrate his victory and found a castle ; in the words of William 's biographer , William of Poitiers , " certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace . For he [ William ] realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners " . At the time , London was the largest town in England ; the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance , and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement . The other two castles in London – Baynard 's Castle and Montfichet 's Castle – were established at the same time . The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south @-@ east corner of the Roman town walls , using them as prefabricated defences , with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south . This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade , and probably had accommodation suitable for William . 
 Most of the early Norman castles were built from timber , but by the end of the 11th century a few , including the Tower of London , had been renovated or replaced with stone . Work on the White Tower – which gives the whole castle its name – is usually considered to have begun in 1078 , however the exact date is uncertain . William made Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , responsible for its construction , although it may not have been completed until after William 's death in 1087 . The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England , and was the strongest point of the early castle . It also contained grand accommodation for the king . At the latest , it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there . Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes . Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower , he was also the first person to escape from it , using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine . He was held in luxury and permitted servants , but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors . After plying them with drink , when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber , and out of the Tower . The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft . 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle records that in 1097 King William II ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London ; it was probably built from stone and likely replaced the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle , between the Roman wall and the Thames . The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class , but in the way the city was structured . Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans , who also brought over hundreds of Jews , for financial reasons . The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown , as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles . The Jews used the Tower as a retreat , when threatened by anti @-@ Jewish violence . 
 The death in 1135 of Henry I left England with a disputed succession ; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda , just a few days after Henry 's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne . The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London . The castle , which had not been used as a royal residence for some time , was usually left in the charge of a Constable , a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville . As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position , possession was highly valued . Mandeville exploited this , selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln . Once her support waned , the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen . Through his role as Constable of the Tower , Mandeville became " the richest and most powerful man in England " . When he tried the same ploy again , this time holding secret talks with Matilda , Stephen had him arrested , forced him to cede control of his castles , and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters . Until then the position had been hereditary , originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville ( a friend of William the Conqueror 's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with ) , but the position 's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch . The position was usually given to someone of great importance , who might not always be at the castle due to other duties . Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison , from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty : the Lieutenant of the Tower . Constables also had civic duties relating to the city . Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes , enforcing the law and maintaining order . The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable 's civic powers , and at times led to friction between the two . 
 = = Expansion = = 
 The castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard the Lionheart ( 1189 – 1199 ) . The castle was extended under William Longchamp , Richard 's Lord Chancellor and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade . The Pipe Rolls record £ 2 @,@ 881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190 , from an estimated £ 7 @,@ 000 spent by Richard on castle building in England . According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden , Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames . Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower , and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with Richard 's younger brother , Prince John , who in Richard 's absence arrived in England to try to seize power . As Longchamp 's main fortress , he made the Tower as strong as possible . The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191 , when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history . Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days , deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege . 
 John succeeded Richard as king in 1199 , but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons , who in response moved against him . In 1214 , while the king was at Windsor Castle , Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower . Although under @-@ garrisoned , the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the Magna Carta . The king reneged on his promises of reform , leading to the outbreak of the First Barons ' War . Even after the Magna Carta was signed , Fitzwalter maintained his control of London . During the war , the Tower 's garrison joined forces with the barons . John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis , the eldest son of the French king . However , after John 's death in October 1216 , many began to support the claim of his eldest son , Prince Henry . War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry , with Fitzwalter supporting Louis . Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower , both of which held out until it was clear that Henry 's supporters would prevail . 
 In the 13th century , Kings Henry III ( 1216 – 1272 ) and Edward I ( 1272 – 1307 ) extended the castle , essentially creating it as it stands today . Henry was disconnected from his barons , and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule . As a result , he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification ; at the same time Henry was an aesthete and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live . From 1216 to 1227 nearly £ 10 @,@ 000 was spent on the Tower of London ; in this period , only the work at Windsor Castle cost more ( £ 15 @,@ 000 ) . Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward . The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower ( from which it derives its name ) began in 1240 . 
 Beginning around 1238 , the castle was expanded to the east , north , and north @-@ west . The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I , interrupted occasionally by civil unrest . New creations included a new defensive perimeter , studded with towers , while on the west , north , and east sides , where the wall was not defended by the river , a defensive ditch was dug . The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement , marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle 's defences . The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression , despised by Londoners , and Henry 's building programme was unpopular . So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240 , the locals celebrated the setback . The expansion caused disruption locally and £ 166 was paid to St Katherine 's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation . 
 Henry III often held court at the Tower of London , and held parliament there on at least two occasions ( 1236 and 1261 ) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly . In 1258 , the discontented barons , led by Simon de Montfort , forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments . Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions . Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath . With the backing of mercenaries , Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261 . While negotiations continued with the barons , the King ensconced himself in the castle , although no army moved to take it . A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again . Henry won a significant victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 , allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London . Cardinal <unk> came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious ; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower . Gilbert de Clare , 6th Earl of Hertford , marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle , declaring that custody of the Tower was " not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner , much less of an ecclesiastic " . Despite a large army and siege engines , Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle . The Earl retreated , allowing the King control of the capital , and the Tower experienced peace for the rest of Henry 's reign . 
 Although he was rarely in London , Edward I undertook an expensive remodelling of the Tower , costing £ 21 @,@ 000 between 1275 and 1285 , over double that spent on the castle during the whole of Henry III 's reign . Edward I was a seasoned castle builder , and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building . His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe , drawing on Eastern influences . At the Tower of London , Edward filled in the moat dug by Henry III and built a new curtain wall along its line , creating a new enclosure . A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall . The western part of Henry III 's curtain wall was rebuilt , with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle 's old gatehouse . A new entrance was created , with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican . In an effort to make the castle self @-@ sufficient , Edward I also added two watermills . Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278 , charged with coin clipping . Persecution of the country 's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion , forcing the Jews out of the country .

 During Edward II 's reign ( 1307 – 1327 ) there was relatively little activity at the Tower of London . However , it was during this period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded . The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state 's arms . In 1321 , Margaret de Clare , Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella , killing six of the royal escort . Generally reserved for high @-@ ranking inmates , the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country . However it was not necessarily very secure , and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape . In 1322 Roger Mortimer , 1st Earl of March , was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub @-@ Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer 's men inside . They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat . He fled to France where he encountered Edward 's Queen . They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King . One of Mortimer 's first acts on entering England was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there . For three years he ruled while Edward III was too young to do so himself ; in 1330 , Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower . Under Edward III 's rule ( 1312 – 1377 ) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father 's reign had put the realm on the <unk> against the Scots and French . Amongst Edward 's successes were the battles of Crécy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner , and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville 's Cross . During this period , the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war . Edward II had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair , and by the reign of Edward III the castle was an uncomfortable place . The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons , for instance Windsor . Edward III ordered that the castle should be renovated . 
 When Richard II was crowned in 1377 , he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey . This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660 . During the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside . When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler , the rebel leader , a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House . The Archbishop of Canterbury , Simon Sudbury , took refuge in St John 's Chapel , hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary . However , he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill . Six years later there was again civil unrest , and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual . When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399 , Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower . He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke , who became King Henry IV . In the 15th century , there was little building work at the Tower of London , yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge . When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup , Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London . During this period , the castle also held many distinguished prisoners . The heir to the Scottish throne , later King James I of Scotland , was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower . The reign of Henry V ( 1413 – 1422 ) renewed England 's fortune in the Hundred Years ' War against France . As a result of Henry 's victories , such as the Battle of Agincourt , many high @-@ status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed . 
 Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne , the houses of Lancaster and York . The castle was once again besieged in 1460 , this time by a Yorkist force . The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton . With the help of Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick ( nicknamed " the Kingmaker " ) Henry recaptured the throne for a short time in 1470 . However , Edward IV soon regained control and Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London , where he was probably murdered . During the wars , the Tower was fortified to withstand gunfire , and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns : an enclosure was created for this purpose to the south of Tower Hill , although it no longer survives . 
 Shortly after the death of Edward IV in 1483 , the notorious murder of the Princes in the Tower is traditionally believed to have taken place . The incident is one of the most infamous events associated with the Tower of London . Edward V 's uncle Richard Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule . Traditional accounts have held that the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother Richard . The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King Richard III in July . The princes were last seen in public in June 1483 ; it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483 . Bones thought to belong to them were discovered in 1674 when the 12th @-@ century forebuilding at the entrance to the White Tower was demolished ; however , the reputed level at which the bones were found ( 10 ft or 3 m ) would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the recently discovered Roman graveyard found 12 ft ( 4 m ) underneath the <unk> a few hundred yards to the north . Opposition to Richard escalated until he was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor , who ascended to the throne as Henry VII . 
 = = Changing use = = 
 The beginning of the Tudor period marked the start of the decline of the Tower of London 's use as a royal residence . As 16th @-@ century chronicler Raphael Holinshed said the Tower became used more as " an armouries and house of munition , and thereunto a place for the safekeeping of offenders than a palace <unk> for a king or queen to <unk> in " . The Yeoman Warders have been the Royal Bodyguard since at least 1509 . During the reign of Henry VIII , the Tower was assessed as needing considerable work on its defences . In 1532 , Thomas Cromwell spent £ 3 @,@ 593 on repairs and imported nearly 3 @,@ 000 tons of Caen stone for the work . Even so , this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery . Although the defences were repaired , the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after Henry 's death . Their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable . From 1547 onwards , the Tower of London was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful , for instance each of Edward VI , Mary I , and Elizabeth I briefly stayed at the Tower before their coronations . 
 In the 16th century , the Tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim , forbidding prison . This had not always been the case . As a royal castle , it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons , however these were usually high @-@ status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people . Contrary to the popular image of the Tower , prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower . As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower – as would have been the case for any castle – there was no purpose @-@ built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed , a " Prison for Soldiers " , was built to the north @-@ west of the White Tower . The Tower 's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th @-@ century religious propagandists and 19th @-@ century romanticists . Although much of the Tower 's reputation is exaggerated , the 16th and 17th centuries marked the castle 's zenith as a prison , with many religious and political undesirables locked away . The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture , so it was not often used ; between 1540 and 1640 , the peak of imprisonment at the Tower , there were 48 recorded cases of the use of torture . The three most common forms used were the infamous rack , the Scavenger 's daughter , and manacles . The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter , the Constable of the Tower ; consequentially it was also known as the Duke of Exeter 's daughter . One of those tortured at the Tower was Guy Fawkes , who was brought there on 6 November 1605 ; after torture he signed a full confession to the Gunpowder Plot . 
 Among those held and executed at the Tower was Anne Boleyn . Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard , by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners . The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet , where disease was rife . High @-@ status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside ; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family , including his son who was born there in 1605 . Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself , and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years . Before the 20th century , there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green ; as was the case with Lady Jane Grey , this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous . After Lady Jane Grey 's execution on 12 February 1554 , Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth , later Queen Elizabeth I , in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth 's name . 
 The Office of Ordnance and Armoury Office were founded in the 15th century , taking over the Privy Wardrobe 's duties of looking after the monarch 's arsenal and valuables . As there was no standing army before 1661 , the importance of the royal armoury at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war . The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454 , and by 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward . Political tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents , including money and munitions . London 's Trained Bands , a militia force , were moved into the castle in 1640 . Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built , readying the Tower for war . The preparations were never put to the test . In 1642 , Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament . When this failed he fled the city , and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron , the Lieutenant of the Tower . The Trained Bands had switched sides , and now supported Parliament ; together with the London citizenry , they blockaded the Tower . With permission from the King , Byron relinquished control of the Tower . Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing , Sir John Conyers . By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642 , the Tower of London was already in Parliament 's control . 
 The last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1660 . At the time , the castle 's accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation . Under the Stuart kings the Tower 's buildings were remodelled , mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance . Just over £ 4 @,@ 000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse , now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward . In the 17th century there were plans to enhance the Tower 's defences in the style of the trace italienne , however they were never acted on . Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose @-@ built quarters for soldiers ( the " Irish Barracks " ) in 1670 , the general accommodations were still in poor condition . 
 When the Hanoverian dynasty ascended the throne , their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind , the Tower of London was repaired . Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed . The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45 , and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle " would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege " . For the most part , the 18th @-@ century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal , although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774 . The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it . It was still an integral part of the castle 's defences , so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower , the Duke of Wellington , ordered a large @-@ scale clearance of several feet of silt . However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply , resulting in several deaths . To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems , it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth . The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later . The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845 , when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone . The building could accommodate 1 @,@ 000 men ; at the same time , separate quarters for the officers were built to the north @-@ east of the White Tower . The building is now the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers . The popularity of the Chartist movement between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest . It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle . Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period . 
 During the First World War , eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage . During the Second World War , the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war . One such person was Rudolf Hess , Adolf Hitler 's deputy , albeit just for four days in 1941 . He was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle . The last person to be executed at the Tower was German spy Josef Jakobs who was shot on 15 August 1941 . The executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated miniature rifle range which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in 1969 . The Second World War also saw the last use of the Tower as a fortification . In the event of a German invasion , the Tower , together with the Royal Mint and nearby warehouses , was to have formed one of three " keeps " or complexes of defended buildings which formed the last @-@ ditch defences of the capital . 
 = = Restoration and tourism = = 
 The Tower of London has become established as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country . It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period , when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about . Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour . The Crown Jewels also garner much interest , and have been on public display since 1669 . The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th century , despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors . Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose @-@ built ticket office was erected . By the end of the century , over 500 @,@ 000 were visiting the castle every year . 
 Over the 18th and 19th centuries , the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished . Only the Wakefield and St Thomas 's Towers survived . The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England 's medieval past . One of the effects was the emergence of Gothic Revival architecture . In the Tower 's architecture , this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower . It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements . Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as " castellated Gothic of the 15th century " . Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites ; many of the post @-@ medieval structures left vacant were demolished . In 1855 , the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office , which was gradually phased out of the castle . At the same time , there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London . 
 Public interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers , of whom the work of William Harrison Ainsworth was particularly influential . In The Tower of London : A Historical Romance he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination . Harrison also played another role in the Tower 's history , as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th @-@ century prisoners . Working on the suggestion , Anthony Salvin refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of Prince Albert . Salvin was succeeded in the work by John Taylor . When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it ; as a result , several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post @-@ medieval internal decoration removed . 
 Although only one bomb fell on the Tower of London in the First World War ( it landed harmlessly in the moat ) , the Second World War left a greater mark . On 23 September 1940 , during the Blitz , high @-@ explosive bombs damaged the castle , destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower . After the war , the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public . 
 In 1974 , there was a bomb explosion in the Mortar Room in the White Tower , leaving one person dead and 35 injured . No one claimed responsibility for the blast , but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it . 
 In the 21st century , tourism is the Tower 's primary role , the remaining routine military activities , under the Royal Logistic Corps , having wound down in the latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle . However , the Tower is still home to the ceremonial regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers , and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor , the Royal Fusiliers . Also , a detachment of the unit providing the Queen 's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower , and with the Yeomen Warders , takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day . On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company , these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions , and 41 on other occasions . 
 Since 1990 , the Tower of London has been cared for by an independent charity , Historic Royal Palaces , which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown . In 1988 , the Tower of London was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites , in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site . However , recent developments , such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby , have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations ' Heritage in Danger List . The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006 . Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory , once used by past kings and queens . Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower , the responsibility of day @-@ to @-@ day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor . At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times , in accordance with the belief that if they are absent , the kingdom will fall . They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders . The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883 . As well as having ceremonial duties , the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower . Just over 2 @.@ 7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2015 . 
 = = Crown Jewels = = 
 The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III ( 1216 – 1272 ) . The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia , including jewels , plate , and symbols of royalty such as the crown , sceptre , and sword . When money needed to be raised , the treasure could be pawned by the monarch . The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy , and consequently was closely guarded . A new position for " keeper of the jewels , armouries and other things " was created , which was well rewarded ; in the reign of Edward III ( 1312 – 1377 ) the holder was paid 12d a day . The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels , gold , and silver , and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers . In 1649 , during the English Civil War , the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties . Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and re @-@ used , and the crowns were " <unk> broken and defaced " . When the monarchy was restored in 1660 , the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th @-@ century spoon and three ceremonial swords . The rest of the Crown Jewels had to be recreated . In 1669 , the Jewel House was demolished and the Crown Jewels moved into Martin Tower where they could be viewed by the paying public . This was exploited two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them . Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper . Although they laid their hands on the Imperial State Crown , Sceptre and Orb , they were foiled when the keeper 's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm . The Crown Jewels are on display in the Jewel House in the Waterloo Block . 
 = = Menagerie = = 
 The Royal Menagerie is first referenced during the reign of Henry III . In 1251 , the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep for the King 's polar bear , probably a gift from Haakon IV of Norway ; the bear attracted a great deal of attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames . In 1254 , the sheriffs were ordered to subsidise the construction of an elephant house at the Tower . The exact location of the medieval menagerie is unknown , although the lions were kept in the barbican known as Lion Tower . The royal collection was swelled by diplomatic gifts including three leopards from Frederick III , the Holy Roman Emperor . By the 18th century , the menagerie was open to the public ; admission cost three half @-@ pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions . In 1828 there were over 280 animals representing at least 60 species The last of the animals left in 1835 , relocated to Regent 's Park , after one of the lions was accused of biting a soldier . The Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life . Consequently , even though the animals had long since left the building , the Lion Tower was not demolished until the last keeper 's death in 1853 . 
 During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste . 
 = = Ghosts = = 
 Anne Boleyn was beheaded in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII ; her ghost supposedly haunts the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula , where she is buried , and has been said to walk around the White Tower carrying her head under her arm . This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song " With Her Head <unk> Underneath Her Arm " . Other reported ghosts include Henry VI , Lady Jane Grey , Margaret Pole , and the Princes in the Tower . In January 1816 , a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him , and reportedly died of fright a few days later . In October 1817 , a tubular , glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels , Edmund Lenthal <unk> . He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife , leading her to exclaim : " Oh , Christ ! It has seized me ! " Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported , more recently , by night staff at the Tower . 
 = Melville Island ( Nova Scotia ) = 
 Melville Island is a small peninsula in Nova Scotia , Canada , located in the Northwest Arm of Halifax Harbour , west of Deadman 's Island . It is part of the Halifax Regional Municipality . The land is rocky , with thin , acidic soil , but supports a limited woodland habitat . 
 The site was discovered by Europeans in the 17th century , though it was likely earlier explored by aboriginals . It was initially used for storehouses before being purchased by the British , who built a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp to hold captives from the Napoleonic Wars and later the War of 1812 . The burial ground for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman 's Island . 
 Later , Melville Island was used as a receiving depot for black refugees escaping slavery in the United States , then as a quarantine hospital for immigrants arriving from Europe ( particularly Ireland ) . It briefly served as a recruitment centre for the British Foreign Legion during the Crimean War , and was then sold to the British for use as a military prison . In 1907 the land was granted to the Canadian government , which used it to detain German and Austro @-@ Hungarian nationals during the First World War . During the Second World War , prisoners were sent to <unk> Island instead , and ammunition depots were kept on Melville Island . 
 The peninsula now houses the clubhouse and marina of the Armdale Yacht Club . Melville Island has been the subject of a number of cultural works , most of which concern its use as a prison . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Melville Island is part of the Halifax Regional Municipality , on the southeast coast of Nova Scotia . The peninsula lies on the eastern boundary of Melville Cove in the Northwest Arm , an inlet between the Halifax Peninsula and Mainland Halifax . It has a total area of approximately 2 @,@ 000 square metres ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . Melville Island is 200 metres ( 660 ft ) west of Deadman 's Island , and southeast of Regatta Point . The peninsula lies on a fracture zone trending northwest – southeast , and is located at the border between the Halifax Slate Formation and a granite @-@ based formation . There is evidence of glacial scouring in the area . The surrounding seabed ranges from gravel to muddy gravel , and the shore is rocky . 
 The water surrounding Melville Island is salty and ranges from 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) in summer to partially or completely frozen in winter . The water is polluted by sewage discharges from Halifax and is considered heavily contaminated . Water colour ranges from olive brown to greenish black , with little current . The water depth around Melville Island is 4 @.@ 5 to 10 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 to 34 ft ) . 
 The peninsula features thin and acidic soil , and hosts plants like <unk> , Indian pear , Labrador tea , wintergreen , and blueberry shrubs . It is a woodland area , with birch , tamarack , maple , oak , beech , and white pine trees . Given the development of the land by the Armdale Yacht Club , plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits ; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971 . Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel . Local birds include grebes , loons , and alcids . 
 There is no weather monitoring station on Melville Island ( the closest is the Halifax dockyards ) ; however , as with most of the surrounding area , Melville has a humid continental climate heavily influenced by the water temperature in Halifax Harbour . Average air temperatures range from − 4 @.@ 4 ° C ( 24 @.@ 1 ° F ) in January to 18 @.@ 9 ° C ( 66 @.@ 0 ° F ) in August . It receives about 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 59 in ) of precipitation per year , and may receive snow from October through April . Though the area is fairly sheltered , it is subject to damage from hurricanes and other storms , notably Hurricane Juan in 2003 . 
 = = Early use = = 
 Though the Halifax area was settled by aboriginals , particularly the Mi 'kmaq people , as early as 7000 BC , there is no archaeological evidence of native habitation on Melville Island prior to the arrival of the Europeans . The first Europeans to reach the land were likely French traders and missionaries in the 17th century . Halifax was founded by the British in 1749 . The first documented use of Melville Island was by Robert Cowie and John <unk> , who obtained a Crown grant in 1752 to allow them to build a storehouse . After Cowie 's death in 1781 , John Butler Kelly purchased what was then known as Cowie 's Island and quickly resold it in 1784 to James Kavanagh , the head of a prosperous family fishery , for £ 65 . Kavanagh used the land , known as Kavanagh 's Island according to the then @-@ prevalent tradition of place naming , to dry and store fish that he would then sell from his Halifax store . 
 = = French Revolutionary Wars = = 
 After the 1793 beheading of Louis XVI sparked a war between Britain and France ( see the French Revolutionary Wars ) , Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh 's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon . The commander of the Halifax garrison , Brigadier General James Ogilvie , objected to the plan , and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax . Several prisoners were able to escape from the makeshift prison , and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794 . 
 In August 1794 , a French ship captured in St. Domingo arrived in Halifax . A plan to house these prisoners in Halifax met with opposition from the citizenry because of a fear of " fever " ; indeed , surgeon John Halliburton suggested that if the plan was carried out , " the popular would burn down [ the housing ] with the sick prisoners inside " . Halliburton rented Kavanagh 's Island , likely on the suggestion of Governor John Wentworth , and by June 1795 had sent 70 sick and wounded prisoners to its makeshift prison hospital . The other prisoners were kept on the La Felix prison ship . Sixteen soldiers of the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment acted as guards for the hospital beginning in 1796 . Because of overcrowding aboard La Felix , some of its prisoners were allowed to live in Halifax , where some created such a disturbance that they were sent to Kavanagh 's Island to be imprisoned . In 1801 , the Treaty of Amiens resulted in most of the prisoners being returned to France , and the site was abandoned . 
 = = Napoleonic Wars ( 1803 – 1811 ) = = 
 The site was formally leased for prisoner housing in 1803 after fifteen French fishermen , three surgeons , and 188 seamen were brought to Halifax as prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars . Though many of these prisoners were later sent to England or Bermuda , one of the surgeons ( Antoine Noel ) was hired to care for the prisoners , while at least sixteen other prisoners were able to escape . Melville was purchased for £ 1000 in 1804 ( £ 68 @,@ 634 as of 2010 ) by Robert Murray , appointed by the British Admiralty as prison agent ; he was replaced shortly thereafter by John MacKellar . At the time , the facility had a maximum capacity of 200 prisoners . The makeshift prison was noted for discipline problems . 
 The land was officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 in honour of Henry Dundas , Viscount Melville ( who at the time had just been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty ) . A wooden barracks @-@ style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners , the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument , while a multi @-@ storey building was designed to hold officers . As no exchange system was established with the French , the prison quickly became overcrowded . Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time . 
 Upon their arrival on Melville , prisoners had their name and other details recorded in an entry book . Inmates were given yellow clothing that clearly identified them as prisoners of war , and were supplied with provisions of beef , bread , potatoes and salt from a local contractor " reputed to own most of the livestock in the region " . Some officers were allowed to send trade goods to Halifax , or even work in the city as domestic servants or <unk> . There were also prisoner @-@ run shops and a " small town fair " on Melville Island , frequented by British officers and residents of Halifax . Other prisoner pursuits included prison lotteries , model shipbuilding , beer @-@ brewing , fishing , and making molasses candy . Some prisoners were known to have pets or keep chickens . 
 In late 1805 , a group of officers broke parole and escaped ; this led the garrison captain to restrict the purchase of prisoner @-@ made goods as a means of punishment and enforcing discipline . More serious punishments included flogging or being confined to a barred hole in the prison cellar , known as the " Black Hole " , with only bread and water . One of the prisoners , Pierre Poulin , stabbed another to death in April 1805 , and was tried and hanged for murder in Halifax . The prisoners also maintained their own Grand Council ( Grand Conseil ) with which to impose discipline , though with a different focus than the British : anyone who disclosed a planned escape attempt to the guards was subject to being stoned to death ( though historian Brian Cuthbertson disputes the likelihood of this claim ) . Escapes and attempts were frequent , and attempted escapees were regarded " with high esteem " by the other prisoners . Before 1812 , approximately 130 prisoners , including 25 officers , escaped , of whom only 11 were recaptured despite advertised rewards in local newspapers . Many others were either sent to prisons in England or the West Indies , or were released after pledging allegiance to the British Crown . Approximately 1535 French prisoners were incarcerated at Melville between 1803 and 1813 , and an unknown number were held during Napoleon 's Hundred Days . Sixty @-@ six Frenchmen are known to have died in the prison , ten of whom were prisoners from the Hundred Days . Nine Spanish prisoners also died during this period . 
 = = War of 1812 = = 
 The War of 1812 brought an influx of American prisoners to Melville Island ; up to 1800 at a time were housed in its barracks or on a nearby 350 @-@ person prison ship , the Magnet . Most of the French prisoners were released or paroled to make room for the Americans , who were seen as more of a risk . David Stickney was the first recorded American prisoner , arriving on 4 July 1812 . Early in the war , many Americans were exchanged for British prisoners in Boston or Salem , Massachusetts , in an arrangement known as a " cartel " ; 1981 of the captives taken before October 1812 were thus exchanged , while another seventeen , accused of killing a Canadian farmer and raping his wife , were sent to England and imprisoned . African @-@ American captives were never considered for exchange , and were instead commonly released under the 1807 Abolition Act . 
 By the end of 1812 , maps of the peninsula showed a marked increase in buildings : a two @-@ story common prison , a small hospital , officers ' quarters , a gunner 's house , a turnkey store , fuel sheds , the agent 's office and guard house , a bell house , nine sentry boxes , and four oceanside outhouses . Despite this , the facility was severely overcrowded , a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African @-@ Americans from the majority white American population . <unk> prisoners were recorded by the end of 1812 , including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen . More than 3000 arrived over the next two years , including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area . 
 Accounts of prison life vary : Cuthbertson says that the prisoners were " reportedly well treated " , but prisoner complaints suggested they were " wretched indeed " . Because of the crowded conditions , " the authorities did everything they could to keep the prisoners quiet , " including lying to them . Captured privateers were sent to England in large numbers " to harass and distress that description of prisoners " . All letters sent to and by prisoners were read . Residents of the Melville prison barracks were lice @-@ infested and slept in tier @-@ hung hammocks ( first three , and later four tiers ) , and their activities were more restricted than those of earlier French prisoners . A strict cleaning regimen was observed in an attempt to promote sanitary conditions , and prisoners could be sent to solitary confinement for uncleanliness . Rations were considered " robust " : prisoners were given 0 @.@ 45 kilograms ( 1 lb ) each of bread and beef and a gill ( 0 @.@ 1421 litres ) of peas daily . 
 In October 1812 , John Mitchell was appointed as an " American agent " to oversee the treatment of the American prisoners at Melville and to arrange prisoner exchanges . He gave the Americans coffee , sugar , potatoes , tobacco , newspapers , and soap , and also provided money for other purchases . Mitchell was responsible for buying clothing , but lacked the funds to meet demand : in late 1813 , almost 1000 of the prisoners were <unk> , and many more had no jackets . Staff at the prison hospital attributed a tuberculosis outbreak to " want of comfortable clothing " . Though Mitchell visited Melville Island regularly , he was primarily concerned with speaking to the officers , not the common prisoners . Mitchell was removed in October 1814 in retaliation for the treatment of the British prisoner agent , Thomas Barclay , by the United States government . 
 Despite the conditions in the prison , the Americans continued the French tradition of establishing shops within the prison . Goods sold included cigars and smuggled rum . Gambling was a popular pastime , particularly backgammon and other dice games , as well as dancing , singing , and storytelling . One prisoner was able to counterfeit Spanish coins , which found their way into the Halifax economy . On Sundays , church services were conducted and visitors were allowed , though many visiting Haligonians were United Empire Loyalists who came " to gratify their eyes ... with sight of what they called ' rebels ' " . 
 The 320 American survivors of the Battle of Boston Harbor were interned on Melville Island in 1813 , and their ship , renamed the HMS Chesapeake , was used to ferry prisoners from Melville to England 's Dartmoor Prison . Many officers were paroled to Halifax , but some began a riot at a performance of a patriotic song about the Chesapeake 's defeat . Parole restrictions were tightened : beginning in 1814 , paroled officers were required to attend a monthly muster on Melville Island , and those who violated their parole were confined to the prison . After foiled escape plots in 1813 and 1814 , fears of a mass escape led to increased security and a 600 @-@ prisoner transport to England . Around this time , Lieutenant William Miller , who had been in charge of the prisoners , was replaced by Captain J. <unk> ; Miller had been noted for his rudeness , including one occasion when he told the prisoners to " die and be damned , as there is one hundred and fifty acres of land to bury you in , God damn you . " He had also been accused of cruelty by American newspapers , though some prisoners defended him and the veracity of the media claims is questionable . 
 The crowded and insanitary prison led to frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases , including smallpox , typhoid , pneumonia , and dysentery , and a corresponding increase in mortality rates . 195 American prisoners died on Melville Island of various causes , most of whom were buried on Deadman 's Island ; James Brooke suggests a death rate of one per week . The war ended in December 1814 , but news of this did not reach Melville until March 1815 , during which time about fifty prisoners died . The prisoners were released to " quit Halifax at their own expense " , though some were able to find berths on trade ships . All but 120 had left by mid @-@ April ; most of those remaining were hospital patients , who were sent to the Naval Hospital in Halifax in early May . Melville Island was decommissioned in May 1815 , and its goods , including 1170 hammocks , were sold at auction in Halifax . 
 By the decommissioning , over 10 @,@ 000 French , Spanish and American prisoners had been held at the prison . The vast majority had been Americans : there were <unk> recorded US prisoners , <unk> of whom were privateers from the 92 such ships brought to Halifax . 
 = = Receiving depot = = 
 After the decommissioning of the military prison , Melville Island was used as a receiving depot for some of the black refugees , the estimated 1600 – 2000 escaped slaves who arrived in Halifax between 1815 and 1818 . In April 1815 , seventy @-@ six refugees were moved to Melville from the Halifax Poor House , many ill with smallpox . The refugees were given blankets , " colourful " clothing ( often the uniforms of captured or demobilized soldiers ) , and children 's shoes . Rations included pork or beef , potatoes , rice , cornmeal , molasses , spruce beer ( to prevent scurvy ) , and sometimes coffee . To discourage men from leaving their families at the depot as they worked in Halifax , rations were only given to heads of families . Thomas Jeffery was granted a salary of £ 1500 ( £ 86 @,@ 655 as of 2010 ) for administering the depot . Eighty @-@ two refugees died during the smallpox outbreak , and 500 were vaccinated to prevent the further spread of the disease . An increasing number passed through Melville Island on their way to Canadian settlements : between 727 and 798 are recorded from April to July 1815 . Most of these found work in Halifax or moved to land grants , but some returned the following winter " when in distress " . At least 107 of these refugees died on Melville Island . The province 's lieutenant @-@ governor ordered that the refugees be moved to Preston or Halifax in May 1816 , and put the land up for lease to " a person of unexceptionable character " , but no lease is recorded during this period . The hospital was officially closed in June 1816 . 
 Beginning in 1818 , Melville Island was used as a quarantine hospital for ill immigrants arriving in Nova Scotia . The hospital was operational for short periods in 1818 , 1831 , and 1846 . By 1829 , ten buildings were left on Melville Island , all " in a state of neglect and decay " . In 1831 , three doctors ( Matthias Hoffman , Samuel Head and John Stirling ) were paid £ 30 each ( £ 2125 as of 2010 ) to care for patients at the quarantine hospital ; a nurse later arrived as Matron , bringing with her two teenaged children . In 1847 , over 1200 Irish immigrants fleeing the Irish Potato Famine were ordered quarantined on Melville Island by the Board of Health ; of these , 203 were held in the " fever hospital " , and 30 died . <unk> victims were also held at Melville , during which time the medical staff were not allowed to leave for fear of spreading the infection . 
 Diseases encountered among the immigrants included smallpox , typhus , and yellow fever . There were 37 recorded deaths . 
 = = British Army = = 
 In 1855 , Nova Scotia politician Joseph Howe developed a plan to use Melville Island as a recruitment and training centre for American soldiers to fight for the British in the Crimean War . US neutrality laws prevented Americans from participating in overseas wars , so recruiters sent to the US advertised for men to work on the Nova Scotia Railway , and faced arrest if their true purpose was discovered . Upon arrival in Halifax , the men were sent to Melville Island for enlistment and basic training . The first group of 66 men arrived on 6 April 1855 , but all refused to join the British Foreign Legion . However , by the end of May there were 71 newly recruited soldiers on the peninsula , and up to 158 total had enlisted . American discontent with the project forced its abandonment in June ; the Melville Island depot closed , and the recruits were sent first to Halifax and then to England . Overall the recruitment project enlisted between 500 and 700 men , mostly German and Irish nationals . 
 After the recruitment project ended , the Admiralty sold the land to the British army for £ 2800 ( £ 204 @,@ 081 as of 2010 ) for use as a military prison . The first 70 prisoners arrived in 1856 . At this time , flogging was gradually being phased out as a punishment for military members , who were instead imprisoned under the Mutiny Act of 1844 ; the purchase of Melville Island allowed these prisoners to be removed from the overcrowded Halifax Citadel . A 22 @-@ man military guard supervised the prisoners , who were subjected to hard labour : the chief warder imported 500 tonnes ( 492 long tons ; 551 short tons ) of granite from Purcell 's Cove for them to break . Punishments included solitary confinement or " shot drill " , where an inmate was made to carry 11 @-@ kilogram ( 24 lb ) cannonballs from one end of the yard to the other . A new 34 @-@ cell prison building was constructed in 1884 to alleviate overcrowding . There were some escape attempts during this period , the most violent of which involved the stone hammers used to break stone being repurposed as projectiles and weapons . 
 British officers from the Halifax garrison conducted inspections of the prison four times per year , and maintenance was carried out either by the prisoners themselves or by soldiers from the Halifax garrison . The prison also housed a schoolroom and chapel , both staffed by army personnel . A new stone prison was built before 1905 next to the older wooden barracks , as well as housing for warders and their families . The new building alleviated reported problems with lack of lighting and ventilation in the previous structure . In December of that year , the Canadian Permanent Force took over <unk> of the prison , at which time there were three remaining prisoners . The land was granted to the Canadian Government as the British left Nova Scotia in 1907 . The name was changed in 1909 from " military prison " to " detention barracks " , reflecting a shift in attitude towards incarcerated military personnel : inmates were known as detainees , not prisoners , and after their discharge from the military they maintained no permanent criminal record . 
 = = First and Second World Wars = = 
 When the First World War began in 1914 , Canadian police were given the ability to detain German and Austro @-@ Hungarian nationals , and incarcerate any who refused to agree not to support their homelands in the war . In September , a Spanish ship carrying a large number of men en route to Germany to report for military service was intercepted by the HMS Glory , which brought the ship to Halifax Harbour . Once there , the Germans aboard were taken to Melville Island with a garrison guard , interrogated , and imprisoned under the supervision of the detention barracks staff . Over the next several months , more German nationals were brought to Melville , detained either by British ships or by Canadian police forces . Escape attempts began in October , and a procedure to count prisoners twice daily was instituted in an attempt to prevent them . The anglophone guards often could not communicate with the prisoners or even pronounce their names , resorting to nicknames and complicating efforts in prisoner management . Repairs were made to the prison buildings after several inmates escaped by sawing a hole through the floor of the wooden barracks . 
 Initially there was no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters ; censorship arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa , and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare . As the war progressed , groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk and the number of inmates per institution . After the 1917 Halifax Explosion , prisoners were transferred to the 800 @-@ man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst , Nova Scotia . One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky , although this is disputed . 
 On 10 April 1935 , a fire completely destroyed the old wooden prison barracks , so when the Second World War began in 1939 , the remaining prisoners and guards were sent to McNab 's Island . Melville Island was used first to confine deserters from the army , then from 1941 as a temporary storage facility for Canadian Army ammunition depots . When VE Day caused riots in downtown Halifax , there were rumours of a plan to break into the depots and deploy hand grenades ; a trooper squad was sent to guard against this possibility , but no " invasion " occurred . 
 = = 1945 – present = = 
 After the end of the Second World War , military activities on Melville ended ; the land was initially awarded to the Naval Sailors Association , a decision that prompted some disagreement among members of Parliament . Haligonians pushed for the area to be repurposed for recreation , partially due to anxieties about its use as a storage facility for potentially toxic chemicals . In 1947 , the Canadian Army leased Melville Island to the Armdale Yacht Club for C $ 1 per year . The club demolished some of the buildings , renovated and expanded others , widened the road , and filled in a new embankment for boating . Further renovations were done in 1952 and the 1960s , adding verandahs to the two clubhouses ( one of which dates to 1808 and was used as a warden 's house ) and remodelling their interiors . Though the club 's lease was initially year @-@ to @-@ year , in 1956 it began a 99 @-@ year lease from the Department of National Defence . The club dredged Melville Cove , added a " marine railway " , and created a large marina , at which dozens of boats are now docked . 
 = = Culture = = 
 During certain periods , Melville Island was a social destination for Halifax residents . Haligonians visited the " town fair " run by French inmates during the Napoleonic period . The peninsula was called a " great resort of the ladies of Halifax " by an 1855 newspaper . However , from the beginning of the First World War to 1947 , visitors to Melville were restricted . Though it was re @-@ opened with the arrival of the Armdale Yacht Club , the area 's history was largely forgotten until the 2000 establishment of Deadman 's Island Park on the adjacent peninsula . Since then , the site has become a tourist attraction , though its historicity is limited by the land 's current use as a marina . A model made from beef and pork bones by French prisoners and a cell key to Melville Island are preserved at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax . 
 The peninsula has also been the subject of artistic and literary treatments . A number of writings by Melville prisoners have been preserved , including a diary by François @-@ Lambert <unk> and an account credited to Benjamin Waterhouse ( though historians are unsure of its true authorship ) . Politician Joseph Howe wrote a poem describing its use as a military prison ( See Poem ) . The site 's history has been the subject of a book by Brian Cuthbertson , and another by Iris Shea and Heather Watts . The prison is the subject of a painting held by the UK National Trust and a Nova Scotian folk song , among other cultural works . 
 = Saskatchewan Highway 7 = 
 Saskatchewan Highway 7 is a major paved undivided provincial highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan , running from the Alberta border to Saskatoon . Highway 7 continues west into Alberta where it becomes Alberta Highway 9 . 
 Highway 7 is an important trade and travel route linking Saskatoon with several of its bedroom communities such as Delisle and Vanscoy , as well as larger centres farther afield such as Rosetown and Kindersley . Its primary use , however , is by travelers heading for Calgary , Alberta and the Canadian west coast . 
 Despite being one of the most heavily used roads in the province , as of 2015 only short stretches of the highway between Saskatoon and Rosetown have been divided to add passing lanes . The only passing lanes west of Rosetown 's eastern elevator access interchange , is a small section East and West of Flaxcombe . Extensive oil exploration and development has been occurring since 2010 , primarily in the Kindersley Region , from Brock to the Alberta Border . Heavy traffic , agriculture , grain transport , and oilfield service , as well as oil and fuel transports , are common on this highway . Agriculture , and oilfield services are the main industries of the area . The only District hospital on Hwy 7 is located at Kindersley . 
 Agrium Vanscoy Potash Operations is Canada 's third largest producer of potash fertilizer . In the 1930s early homesteaders would maintain Highway 7 as a means to supplement their income . Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for direction of travel with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines . Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961 . 
 Highway 7 currently terminates at its junction with 22nd Street West ( Highway 14 ) in west Saskatoon , although it is marked to run concurrently to Highway 11 ( Idylwyld Drive ) . In 2005 , work began on realigning Highway 7 in order to make way for the Blairmore Suburban Centre development including the Bethlehem High School , Tommy Douglas Collegiate and the Shaw Centre located where Highway 7 linked with 22nd Street prior to 2006 . Realignment is being conducted in two phases . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The entirety of Highway 7 is a primary weight asphalt concrete ( AS ) national highway within the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure ( SHS ) West Central Municipal Government Committee planning jurisdiction . Travel on Highway 7 begins east at the Alberta - Saskatchewan provincial border through the Missouri Coteau which features mixed prairie vegetation . Entering Alberta , the highway continues west as Alberta Highway 9 . Alsask is a village of about 150 people on the border and Highway 44 . The Military Dome site radar station is a heritage site and has been acquired by Alsask along with the 1960s airforce base . At Alsask , Highway 7 turns north east until km 3 @.@ 9 when again the highway is routed east . Again at km 6 @.@ 1 the highway turns north east until km 19 @.@ 8 just past the intersection with Highway 317 . Marengo , a small village of about 50 residents is 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) north of the junction . Highway 7 continues for several kilometres east reaching the village of Flaxcombe , which has a population of just over 100 . Highway 307 north provides access to the villages of Coleville and Smiley . This area belongs to the West Central Regional Economic Development Authority ( REDA ) . The town of Kindersley is the largest center featuring both oil and agricultural industries along Highway 7 and with a population of about 4 @,@ 500 is almost at city status of 5 @,@ 000 residents . As of 2009 , the Average Annual Daily Traffic ( AADT ) ranges from approximately 1 @,@ 600 to 2 @,@ 000 vehicles per day ( vpd ) near the Alberta @-@ Saskatchewan border to over 3 @,@ 000 vpd near Kindersley , updated statistics , and vehicle types in 2013 show evidence that the 2009 vehicle count is out of date and severely <unk> actual traffic flow . Due to its being a key route between Calgary , the fast @-@ growing city of Saskatoon , and economic drivers such as regional oil activity , inland grain terminal locations adjacent to Hwy 7 , and Saskatchewan 's strong economy , this highway 's capacity is under pressure . 
 Continuing east , Highway 7 comes to a short 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) concurrency between Highway 658 south and Highway 658 north . The village of <unk> is also located between the Highway 658 junction and Highway 30 junction . 
 Highway 30 south provides access to the hamlet of <unk> . The highway takes a few gentle curves north east at km 106 @.@ 1 through the unincorporated areas of Fiske and McGee to the junction with Highway 4 . Rosetown is a town about half the size of Kindersley located at this junction . The Goose Lake Plain landscape area of the Moist Mixed Prairie ecoregion is the main feature between Rosetown and Saskatoon . The bearing of the highway continues north east until the town of Zealandia whose population is hovering around 100 people . After Zealandia , the highway continues in a north @-@ northeast direction coming to junction with Highway 768 north and the junction with Highway 655 west and with Highway 655 south . The village of Tessier is next along this north east section of highway , and then Delisle . Delisle , a town , with a population of about 800 residents is located at the intersection of Highway 7 , Highway 45 south , and Saskatchewan Highway 673 east on the south west side of town . The AADT along the route fluctuates between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 vpd until Delisle . The intersection with Highway 766 is to the north east of Delisle . The corner of Highway 672 ( South and east ) is at the intersection with Highway 7 at the village of Vanscoy . Agrium Vanscoy Potash Mine is located 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) south west of Saskatoon , just to the north west of Vanscoy . The potash mine was established in 1931 as Cominco Fertilizers Ltd. changing names in 1995 to Agrium Inc . , the nation 's third largest producer of potash The AADT on Highway 7 near Vanscoy increases to over 5 @,@ 600 vpd . Both Highway 672 east and Highway 766 east provide access to Pike Lake Provincial Park . Highway 7 continues north westerly arriving at the first interchange at km 249 @.@ 7 with Highway 60 south . 
 The twinned overpass is 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) in length continuing on as a 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) length of twinned highway . This twinned section of the highway 
 handles between 7 @,@ 000 and 12 @,@ 000 vpd on average throughout the year . The 11th Street West intersection provides access from the south end of the City of Saskatoon to Highway 7 . Highway 7 becomes concurrent with Highway 14 at the west end of Saskatoon . This is the new Blairmore Suburban Development Area ( SDA ) hosting seven new neighbourhoods and a future interchange at the intersection of Highway 14 west , Dalmeny Road north , and 22nd Street West . Highway 7 continues east along 22nd Street West , concurrent with Highway 14 .

 The Old Bone Trail was the name of the red river cart trail between Saskatoon and Rosetown . The Saskatchewan Highway Act was established in 1922 , in compliance with the 1919 Canadian highway act . At the initial stages of the Saskatchewan Highway Act , 10 miles ( 16 km ) of provincial highways were gravel and the rest were earth roads . The road allowances were laid out as a part of the Dominion Land survey system for homesteading . Travel along the Provincial Highway 7 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances , barbed wire fencing and the Canadian Northern rail line . As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel , the first highway was designed on 90 @-@ degree , right @-@ angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads . 
 Mr. Ralph Glen Chapman an early 20th century settler in Pleasant Valley maintained 10 miles ( 16 km ) of Highway 7 . Mr. Block of the German Mennonite settlement at Fiske maintained a stretch of Highway 7 as a means of supplementing his income in the 1930s . In 1939 , Andy Anderson in the same fashion , kept a 10 miles ( 16 km ) stretch of Highway 7 clear . 
 In 1944 the widening of Highway 7 was undertaken . The Elma rural municipality ( R.M. ) requested that an automatic warning system should be established at the level crossing of the Canadian National Railway and Highway 7 . At this same time , the rural municipality requested that the hills be gravelled which are situated on either side of Flaxcombe . The third concern in 1948 was to construct an all @-@ weather highway between Kindersley and Alsask , and this too was requested of the Department of Highways ( DOH ) . In 1950 , the rates of pay for roadwork were 60 cents an hour for a single labourer , 80 cents an hour for man and two horses , a labourer with four horses would earn C $ 1 @.@ 00 per hour and for man with six horses $ 1 @.@ 20 per hour In the 1950s the R.M. provided grants to the local snow plough club to keep the highway clear after storms . The 1951 oil strike at Coleville resulted in a Husky service station and bulk plant opening at Flaxcombe on Highway 7 in 1955 . It was located on the railroad to facilitate loading crude oil into rail cars . Highway 7 was rebuilt between 1960 and 1961 . Highway 7 currently terminates at its junction with 22nd Street West ( Highway 14 ) in west Saskatoon . In 2005 , work began on realigning Highway 7 in order to make way for the Blairmore Suburban Centre development including the Bethlehem High School , Tommy Douglas Collegiate and the Shaw Centre located where Highway 7 linked with 22nd Street prior to 2006 . Realignment is being conducted in two phases . Starting in 2006 , Highway 7 was linked with Betts Avenue , a new city street , which in turn intersected 22nd Street at a traffic signal . The city and province have begun to build an interchange farther west ( but still with the city limits ) at the junction of Highway 14 and Highway 684 ( Dalmeny Road ) , at which point the new Highway 7 alignment links with this interchange . Long @-@ term plans call for a link to be created from Highway 684 to the Yellowhead Highway in Saskatoon 's north side , though it has not yet been announced whether the Highway 7 designation will be applied north of Highway 14 . There are plans for a major construction in 2008 @-@ 2009 west of Saskatoon on Highway 7 .

 = Edward Millen = 
 Edward Davis Millen ( 7 November 1860 – 14 September 1923 ) was an Australian journalist and politician who served as the first Minister for Repatriation . 
 Millen emigrated to Australia from England around 1880 and established himself as a journalist , subsequently serving in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1894 to 1898 , during which time he fiercely opposed the proposed Federation despite supporting the principle . He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 until his election to the Australian Senate as a Free Trader from New South Wales at the first federal election in 1901 . Millen led the conservative parties in the Senate from 1907 until shortly before his death in 1923 . 
 He served as Vice @-@ President of the Executive Council ( 1909 – 10 ) and Minister for Defence ( 1913 – 14 ) in two short @-@ lived Liberal governments before his appointment as the first Minister for Repatriation in 1917 . He organised the new department and co @-@ ordinated Australia 's repatriation effort , and was briefly acting Prime Minister in 1919 , when he settled a seamen 's strike . Millen resigned from the ministry in February 1923 and died later that year , his illness attributed to his heavy workload in the post @-@ war years . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Millen was born in Deal , Kent in 1860 to John Bullock Millen , who was a pilot of the Cinque Ports , and Charlotte ( née Davis ) . He migrated to New South Wales in 1880 , having been educated in England and employed in the marine insurance business . On 19 February 1883 he married Constance Evelyn Flanagan at Bourke ; they settled as graziers in <unk> . Millen , who had worked as a journalist in Bourke and <unk> and wrote for the Central Australian and Bourke Telegraph ( of which he reputedly became part @-@ owner ) , became editor of the Western Herald and Darling River Advocate around 1889 , part @-@ owning the business together with Philip Chapman until 1901 . During this period he also worked as a land agent , acquiring an office in O 'Connell Street in Sydney and a house in Burwood by 1902 . 
 Millen stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade candidate for Bourke in 1891 , but was defeated ; he contested the seat again in 1894 and won . He became known as a strong advocate for land reform , urging changed pastoral conditions and suggesting additional government assistance to deal with Australia 's dry climate , particularly during the 1890s drought . 
 = = State politics = = 
 Millen was a foundation member of the New South Wales Australasian Federation League in 1893 , formed to campaign for the unification of the six Australian colonies into a single Commonwealth , and in 1896 was active at the Bathurst People 's Federation Council . His distrust of Edmund Barton 's leadership led to his defeat as a candidate for the Australian Federal Convention in 1897 . In the Legislative Assembly , he objected strenuously to the proposed nature of the Senate , calling equal representation for all states " objectionable and dangerous " , and claimed that the New South Wales conventional delegates were elected because of their proficiency at " political business " , absolving New South Wales of the obligation of endorsing their decisions . As a result , Millen opposed the 1898 Federation referendum , becoming a founding member of the Anti @-@ Convention Bill League in April . 
 At the 1898 election , Millen was defeated by nine votes by a National Federal candidate . Having overcome his opposition to Federation , he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 April 1899 as one of Premier George Reid 's twelve appointments to guarantee the passage of legislation for the 1899 referendum . At the first federal election in March 1901 , Millen stood for the Senate as a Free Trade candidate and was elected as the second of six senators for New South Wales . He resigned his Legislative Council seat in May of that year . 
 = = Early Senate career = = 
 Millen was an early leader in the Senate , serving as deputy to Josiah Symon 's unofficial leadership of the Free Trade Senators in 1901 . He advocated against high tariffs and bounties , claiming that industries that could not withstand free trade were " not entitled to much consideration at [ the Senate 's ] hands " . He was also a vigorous supporter of the White Australia policy , advocating the cessation of Kanaka immigration and the gradual deportation of those who had already arrived in Queensland ; his opposition was based on a concern that " inferior labour would ... tend to degrade labour throughout the Commonwealth " , as well as concerns about racial purity . 
 Millen succeeded Symon as leader of the Free Traders in the Senate in 1907 , and following the Fusion with the Protectionists in 1909 became Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice @-@ President of the Executive Council under Prime Minister Alfred Deakin ; he would lead the various conservative parties in the Senate continuously until his death . In 1913 , following Joseph Cook 's one @-@ seat victory in the election , Millen became Minister for Defence , a position he held at the outbreak of World War I. In April 1914 he refused Winston Churchill 's suggestion that Australia need not maintain a fleet in its own territorial waters , and expressed " the sharpest criticism of the British " in a memorandum tabled in the Senate . He continued to privately criticise Britain 's management of the war , but the Cook Government ultimately placed the navy under the control of the British Admiralty in August 1914 . He oversaw the initial recruitment of 20 @,@ 000 men for the Australian Imperial Force and <unk> the defence proposals for the war , but following the Labor Party 's victory at the 1914 election he returned to leading the Opposition in the Senate , although he did become a member of the parliamentary war committee . 
 = = Minister for Repatriation = = 
 Following the 1916 Labor split over conscription , Millen was included in Billy Hughes 's Nationalist ministry in February 1917 , initially as Vice @-@ President of the Executive Council but by September as Australia 's first Minister for Repatriation , dealing largely with veterans ' affairs . Together with Major Nicholas Lockyer , the controller of repatriation , Millen had responsibility for the creation of a new governmental department . The many returned servicemen in the department 's staff , most of whom had little administrative experience , caused problems ; Charles Bean wrote in 1918 that soldiers had " a dread of Millen as a politician first , last and all the time " . Millen organised the passage of the War Service Homes Act 1918 – 19 , which established the War Service Homes Commission , but the administration of the scheme by Commissioner J. T. Walker led to a series of parliamentary inquiries by the joint committee of public accounts . Walker 's appointment by Millen came into question , and the resulting investigation into the Commissioner 's accountability to the Minister and to Parliament has been described as " one of the fullest examinations of ... ministerial responsibility for the actions of an autonomous public corporation in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament " . 
 Millen introduced the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill , which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen , into the Senate in March 1920 . In response to the bill , and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans ' movement , the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear on the floor of the other . This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives , where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party , although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution . 
 During Hughes 's absence in Europe in mid @-@ 1919 , the acting Prime Minister was the Treasurer , William Watt ; Millen served as acting Prime Minister when Watt fell ill during July . Millen and Watt brought a successful resolution to the seamen 's strike . In 1920 he was sent to Geneva as Australia 's delegate to the first meeting of the General Assembly of the League of Nations , where he secured mandated Pacific protectorates for Australia despite opposition from Japan . He returned to Australia in 1921 , having arranged for the funding of Australia 's debts and reorganised Australia House . 
 Millen 's heavy workload had begun to affect his health and he considered retirement , but he ultimately decided to continue and was re @-@ elected to the Senate at the 1922 election . He retired from the ministry in February 1923 , and in March was granted leave of absence because of his deteriorating health . He died aged 63 from chronic nephritis on 14 September 1923 at Caulfield in Melbourne , survived by his wife and two daughters . Presbyterian services were held at Parliament House in Melbourne and St Stephen 's Church in Sydney , and Millen was given a state funeral . He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery .

 Millen experienced fierce criticism from both the press and parliament during his time as Minister for Repatriation , but he is remembered as an important figure in Australia 's war effort and subsequent recovery . He has been described as the " most significant " contributor to the development of repatriation in Australia , which he as inaugural minister largely defined . After his death , Billy Hughes described him as unequalled in Senate leadership , and George Pearce remembered him as " one of the ablest and most destructive critics the Federal Parliament ever had " . 
 = 1941 Florida hurricane = 
 The 1941 Florida hurricane was a compact but strong tropical cyclone that affected the Bahamas , Florida , and the southeastern United States in October 1941 . The fifth known storm of the 1941 Atlantic hurricane season , it was first observed to the north of the Virgin Islands on October 3 . The storm tracked generally westward , reaching peak winds of 120 miles per hour ( 193 km / h ) before passing through the Bahamas . After weakening somewhat , the storm later passed across southern Florida with winds of 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) . The hurricane then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm , but regained hurricane intensity and made another landfall along the Florida Panhandle . Turning northeast , it crossed Georgia and South Carolina , and entered the Atlantic Ocean on October 8 . 
 In advance of the storm , preparations were extensive ; residents boarded up homes and businesses , while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas . In the Bahamas , where winds reached 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) , the storm killed three people . The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard . In Florida , damage was relatively severe , and included the deaths of several people . High winds brought down trees and power lines , though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns . In the Everglades region , a storm surge flooded local streets . As the storm progressed northward , the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles . Throughout the state , the hurricane inflicted $ 675 @,@ 000 USD ( $ 10 @.@ 9 million 2011 USD ) in damage . The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On October 3 , the first indications of a tropical system were observed 300 miles ( 483 km ) to the north of the Virgin Islands . A tropical storm is estimated to have been present late that day , though observations were very sparse near the cyclone . The next day , morning observations confirmed the presence of a circulation center , and soon afterward the cyclone underwent rapid intensification : it became a hurricane late that day , and 24 hours later , on October 5 , the storm reached a peak of 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) — equivalent to a modern @-@ day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . Shortly afterward , the smaller @-@ than @-@ average , fast @-@ moving cyclone tracked over Cat Island in the Bahamas , where a weather station indicated a pressure of 28 @.@ 48 inches of mercury ( 964 mb ) inside the eye . The measurement coincided with light winds of 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) , meaning it was not in the exact center of the eye , so a recent reanalysis found the central pressure to be somewhat lower , at 962 mb ( 28 @.@ 41 inHg ) . After striking Cat Island , the cyclone began a weakening trend and passed south of New Providence , seat of the Bahamian capital Nassau , early on October 6 . At the time , the storm was still found to be a compact , well @-@ developed hurricane . 
 Later that day , it made landfall 13 mi ( 21 km ) south of Miami in South Florida ; observers reported that the small eye produced calm conditions at Goulds , near Homestead . The storm contained peak winds of 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) — equivalent to low @-@ end Category 2 status — and a radius of maximum wind just 10 mi ( 16 km ) from the center . Originally , the Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) listed winds of 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) at landfall in South Florida , but reanalysis determined that these winds occurred somewhat earlier , over the eastern Bahamas . Maintaining a small size , the hurricane moved through the Everglades , passing between Everglades City and Fort Myers . The storm entered the Gulf of Mexico as a strong tropical storm and broadly curved toward the northwest , tracking offshore along the west coast of Florida . It remained over open waters and recovered its intensity until the following day , when it made landfall at Carrabelle with winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) , equivalent to a high @-@ end Category 1 hurricane , and a measured central pressure of 29 inHg ( 982 mb ) . The cyclone still exhibited a small radius of outermost closed isobar but had reduced its forward speed . 
 Turning north and then northeast , the storm moved beyond Tallahassee and entered Georgia . It weakened as it progressed inland , and after passing through South Carolina , the storm re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October 8 with winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . While over water , the storm re @-@ intensified , reaching peak winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) on October 9 . The cyclone kept its intensity for two more days as it moved toward the southeast , executed a small loop , and turned generally toward the east @-@ northeast , passing south of Bermuda on the night of October 11 . The storm became extratropical on October 12 , fully dissipating the next day . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 During the days before the storm 's arrival in Florida , the Weather Bureau issued 40 tropical cyclone @-@ related advisories . Extensive preparations that resulted in a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings . In southern Florida , residents boarded up homes and businesses , and sought shelter in large structures . Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms , while some residents sat in hotel lobbies , listening to radio broadcasts . In Miami , stores sold out of various essentials — including bread and butter — as people prepared for the storm . Evacuations were recommended from Homestead to Key West , and three Coast Guard planes dropped warnings to boats near the Florida coast . The Civilian Conservation Corps also evacuated 150 of its workers from West Summerland Key to Key West . 
 Local chapters of the American Red Cross organized first @-@ aid stations and shelters ; transportation was provided to those who were unable to reach the shelters . In advance of the storm , Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana , Cuba . The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves , while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland . The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm , establishing depots in West Palm Beach , Miami , and Fort Myers , and the Governor of Florida , <unk> Holland , ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work . A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm . The state also opened all of the school buildings in Dade County as emergency shelters .

 = = = Bahamas = = = 
 In the Bahamas , where considerable property damage was reported , the storm killed three people . Winds in Nassau reached 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) . City streets were filled with debris , including a schooner , four sloops , and numerous other boats deposited by the winds on Nassau 's Bay Street . The winds knocked down trees and power lines , resulting in fires and extensive power outages . Along the coast , boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed against seawalls . No casualties occurred in the city . A schooner , the Goodwill II , sank during the storm . Properties and gardens received significant damage . On Cat Island , the storm produced 1 @.@ 62 inches ( 40 mm ) of rainfall . 
 Two men , Christopher <unk> and <unk> Johnson drowned near Andros Island after trying to reach shore from a drowning schooner . One man , Samuel Seymour , was killed on Cat Island after his home was toppled by the wind , and several other injuries were reported on the island . " Most homes , all churches , and most public buildings " on Cat Island were also destroyed by the storm . The storm also downed telephone lines and destroyed crops . As a result , the Duke of Windsor , governor @-@ general of the Bahamas , cabled to the Red Cross for assistance , and a ship carrying " food , clothing , building materials and seeds " was quickly dispatched to Cat Island . According to a survey conducted a few days after the hurricane , 300 families on Cat Island were left homeless as were 120 families on <unk> Island . To aid these families , the Duke of Windsor announced on October 7 that he would establish a relief fund for those affected by the storm . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 On making landfall , the storm generated high winds at the Fowey Rocks Light , although they were below hurricane force . A peak wind gust of 123 mph ( 198 km / h ) was reported at Dinner Key with sustained winds up to 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . Unusually little rain fell in association with the storm ; 0 @.@ 35 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 mm ) of precipitation was reported in Miami , while locations closer to the center of the cyclone received less than 1 inch ( 25 mm ) . The light rainfall was evident throughout southeastern Florida , except for the Florida Keys , where thunderstorms enhanced the precipitation . This aspect of the storm was considered highly unusual , as most tropical cyclones are characterized by heavy rainfall . According to one study , the unusual precipitation patterns can be attributed to one of two possible conditions : " the air might have been too dry " , or " the horizontal convergence of air might have been insufficient to produce a large enough transport of moisture upwards " . The intense winds blew salt water several miles inland ; due to the lack of rainfall , the salt burned vegetation throughout the region . The high winds brought down trees and utility poles and shattered some windows in Dade County . 
 No deaths were reported in the region , although minor damage was inflicted on communication lines and homes and several injuries were reported . Several communities lost electricity . Some hospitals were left without power , forcing the delivery of six babies by candlelight . The storm injured seven people in the Miami area , including five firefighters who were injured " as they fought a blaze fanned by the high winds " of the hurricane . As the hurricane tracked inland , it passed over the Everglades , producing winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) at Everglades City . Along the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee , winds gusted to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) ; barometric pressure there fell to 995 mb ( 29 @.@ 38 inHg ) . Storm surge in the region triggered foot @-@ deep flooding of some streets in local towns . Docks and fishing equipment suffered extensive damage in the region . As the hurricane passed offshore , winds reached 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) near Tampa Bay . The storm also grounded a fishing schooner from Cuba off the coast of Collier County , Florida . Although no one was injured , members of the schooner crew were detained by immigration authorities . 
 After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico , the hurricane made another landfall at Carrabelle on the Florida Panhandle . Winds in the region were estimated at 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) , and tides ran at up to 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above normal . In Tallahassee , the winds downed trees and power lines and scattered debris , rendering roads impassable . The Tallahassee Democrat reported that " at the height of the wind several hundred <unk> were seen rushing into their yard to gather pecans which were knocked down by the swaying trees " . The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region ; replacement automobiles were sparse , as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army . Despite a lack of electricity due to the winds , the Tallahassee Democrat managed to publish 6 @,@ 000 copies of a special storm edition . Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks ; however , upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary . Considerable crop and property damage was reported ; total losses in the state were estimated at $ 675 @,@ 000 USD ( $ 10 @.@ 9 million in today 's terms ) . Seven injuries were reported , and five men drowned in the storm tide at a fishing net drying yard in Panacea , Florida . Initially , there were reports of 20 missing fishermen . Thirty @-@ four Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle , Florida , when ten boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided . The fishermen 's supply of food was destroyed by salt water , but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries . After their rescue , they reported that five men had drowned in a small boat nearby . 
 The storm was still producing high wind gusts as it tracked into Georgia , killing one person and leaving a trail of considerable damage as far north as Albany . The single death in Georgia was a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl , Frances Hester , of Pavo , Georgia , who died after tripping over an electrical wire downed by the storm . Up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rain fell within the state . The storm passed through South Carolina with little damage . Throughout parts of the southeastern United States , rainfall associated with the hurricane was unusually light and unevenly distributed along its track . 
 = Helvellyn = 
 Helvellyn ( pronunciation : / <unk> / ) ( possible meaning : pale yellow moorland ) is a mountain in the English Lake District , the highest point of the Helvellyn range , a north @-@ south line of mountains to the north of <unk> , between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater . 
 Helvellyn is the third @-@ highest point both in England and in the Lake District , and access to Helvellyn is easier than to the two higher peaks of Scafell Pike and <unk> Fell . The scenery includes three deep glacial coves and two sharp @-@ topped ridges on the eastern side ( Striding Edge and Swirral Edge ) . 
 The volcanic rocks of which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano , many of them in violently explosive eruptions , about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period . During the last ice age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today . 
 Since the end of the last ice age , small populations of arctic @-@ alpine plants have survived in favourable spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves . Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly , the Mountain <unk> , also live on and around Helvellyn . 
 Mineral veins , some with deposits of the lead ore galena , do exist within Helvellyn ’ s rocks , but attempts to find sufficient quantities of lead to be worth mining have not been successful . 
 Tourism has been a more successful industry in the area . For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District , and many have made their way to the top of Helvellyn . Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth , both of whom lived nearby at one period . Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions . The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District , and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales . 
 However , traversing the mountain is not without dangers ; over the last two hundred years there have been a number of fatalities . The artist Charles Gough is more famous for his death on Striding Edge in 1805 than for what he achieved in his life . 
 Among many human feats upon the mountain , one of the strangest was the landing and take @-@ off of a small aeroplane on the summit in 1926 . 
 = = Topography = = 
 The top of Helvellyn is a broad plateau , trending roughly from north @-@ west to south @-@ east for about a kilometre between Lower Man and the start of Striding Edge . Throughout this distance it remains more than 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) high . To the west the ground drops gently at first but then more steeply down to Thirlmere , while on the eastern side three deep glacial coves , each backed by high cliffs , are separated by two spectacular sharp ridges or arêtes . The middle of these coves contains Red Tarn . 
 Like much of the main ridge of the range , Helvellyn stands on the watershed between Thirlmere and the Derwent river system to the west , and Ullswater and the Eden river system to the east . 
 Streams on the west side drain directly into Thirlmere , apart from Helvellyn Gill which flows into a parallel valley to the east of Great How and empties into St John 's Beck . However , when Thirlmere reservoir was built , a leat was constructed to capture the water of Helvellyn Gill , so that it is now directed into the reservoir . 
 A never @-@ failing spring called Brownrigg Well exists 90 m ( 300 ft ) below the summit of Helvellyn , about 500 m ( 550 yd ) due west of the highest point , at the head of Whelpside Gill . In the nineteenth century a leat was constructed to direct the water of this spring into the gill to its north to serve the needs of the Helvellyn Mine further down . This leat has now fallen into disuse . The gill it led to is not named on any map , but some authors have referred to it as Mines Gill . 
 Whelp Side , between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill , appears as a distinct shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west , largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places , and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir . North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes , a more craggy stretch of hillside , beneath the north @-@ west ridge , with a loose scree covering in places . 
 The deep coves on the rocky eastern side of Helvellyn drain into Ullswater . Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unite below Catstye Cam to form Glenridding Beck , which flows through Glenridding village to the lake , while Nethermost Cove drains into the same lake via Grisedale Beck and Patterdale village . 
 Red Tarn , enclosed between Striding Edge and Swirral Edge , is about 25 m ( 82 ft ) deep , but in the mid @-@ nineteenth century a dam was built to increase its capacity and supply the needs of the Greenside Mine near Glenridding . That dam has now gone and the tarn has returned to its natural size . It contains brown trout and <unk> , a species of whitefish found in only four bodies of water in the Lake District . 
 A second reservoir was built around 1860 in Brown Cove , between Swirral Edge and Lower Man , along with one further down the valley in Keppel Cove . These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine . The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place , but water now leaks through its base . The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen , but again water leaks freely through it . It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove . Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn to the north of Swirral Edge . 
 = = = Ridges = = = 
 A total of five ridges diverge from the summit ridge of Helvellyn at different points . 
 The north @-@ west ridge continues from Lower Man over Browncove Crags , becoming almost insignificant when it reaches the shore of Thirlmere , yet still separating the valley of Helvellyn Gill from the reservoir , before finally rising again to the wooded height of Great How at its terminus . 
 The north ridge , the main ridge of the range , also descends from Lower Man , passing over White Side and Raise to Sticks Pass , then over <unk> Dodd and Great Dodd to terminate at Clough Head . 
 The north @-@ east ridge is known as Swirral Edge , a sharp arête which joins the summit ridge at a point half @-@ way along , and which terminates in the shapely pyramid of Catstye Cam . 
 The east ridge is another sharp arête known as Striding Edge . This joins the summit ridge at its southern end , not far from Helvellyn 's summit . It passes over the subsidiary top of High Spying How and leads to <unk> Moor before descending to its final top , <unk> , beside the south end of Ullswater . 
 The south ridge continues the main ridge of the Helvellyn range over Nethermost Pike , High Crag and <unk> Pike to terminate at Grisedale Tarn . 
 The former county boundary between Cumberland and Westmorland lay along the Helvellyn Ridge ; this meant that the summit of Helvellyn was the highest point in Westmorland , making it a Historic County Top . 
 = = = Subsidiary tops = = = 
 = = Routes = = 
 The whole of Helvellyn , above the conifer plantations to the west and the intake walls surrounding the valleys of Glenridding and Grisedale to the east , is Open Access land . 
 Routes up Helvellyn can begin from the villages of Glenridding or Patterdale to the east , Grasmere to the south , or from a number of places along the A591 road to the west , and can follow any of the mountain 's five ridges , or the ridges of its neighbours , as well as some of the gills and shoulders on the west side of the range . Walkers can choose between many routes . 
 = = = The eastern ridges = = = 
 Striding Edge is a popular route which involves some scrambling , linking the summit ridge of <unk> Moor to Helvellyn 's summit by what becomes a sharp arête . 
 Striding Edge begins at Hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Wall and then stretches for over 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 9 mi ) to the Helvellyn summit plateau . This starting point is accessible from both Glenridding and Patterdale . Hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Wall used to be a prominent gap in the stone wall on the top of the ridge where a gate was missing . Today the gap has been filled in and a ladder stile crosses the wall . From here the initial part of the ridge is relatively rounded and has a solid path running along the right @-@ hand side . This changes upon reaching High Spying How , the highest point on the ridge - 863 m ( 2 @,@ 831 ft ) . At this point a narrow path continues close to the top of the ridge , which becomes increasingly narrow , and scramblers will often follow the very top of the arête . 
 The path on the right @-@ hand side continues until near the end of the ridge where it switches over to the left @-@ hand side . <unk> who continue on the top of the ridge are forced to descend an awkward short gully down from the final rock tower to rejoin the path . At this point the ridge connects with the main Helvellyn massif . Reaching the summit plateau involves a steep walk or scramble up about 80 m ( 260 ft ) of rough rocky terrain , known as The Abyss by W. A. <unk> , author of a popular series of mountain guide books between 1940 and the late 1960s . From the top of this climb the summit is only 200 m ( 220 yd ) away . 
 Striding Edge is a notorious accident spot among hikers and scramblers . In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge up to the summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice , and can be the most dangerous part of the walk . Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle . In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents . Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008 . 
 Swirral Edge offers a shorter but equally exciting scramble along a similar sharp arête . The main path to it comes up from Red Tarn , which is linked by a surprisingly level path to Hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Wall , making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding . The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam . 
 The climb up or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known accident spot . In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground . There have been a number of accidents at this spot in recent years , making it as dangerous as Striding Edge . 
 Nethermost Pike also has an east ridge which gives an alternative route to Helvellyn from Grisedale , which many walkers overlook . It can be combined with a scramble on Eagle Crag , or this part can be bypassed by taking the path to Nethermost Cove before joining the ridge . 
 = = = Other approaches from the east = = = 
 From Patterdale a long but safe and easy walk ( 11 @.@ 5 km ( 7 @.@ 1 mi ) ) on a good path follows the track up Grisedale to the tarn , and then takes the old pony track up the south ridge of Helvellyn . The second part of this walk takes a safe route well away from crags on the side of the ridge ( see The south ridge below . ) 
 From Glenridding a similar long but safe and easy walk ( 11 @.@ 5 km ( 7 @.@ 1 mi ) ) follows Greenside Road , past the old lead mine and towards Keppel Cove . This track , another old pony track , then zig @-@ zags up the fellside to join the main ridge path at the col between Raise and White Side . 
 = = = The south ridge = = = 
 Grisedale Tarn is the starting point for the south ridge of Helvellyn , and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale , or from <unk> Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck . Above the tarn the old pony track zig @-@ zags up the fellside , and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags on the side of the ridge , and avoiding all the intermediate tops . In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible , over the tops of <unk> Pike , High Crag and Nethermost Pike . 
 = = = The western approaches = = = 
 Shorter and quicker routes to the top of Helvellyn , though with less attractive scenery , begin from several points along the A591 road along the west side of the mountain . Two of these may be combined to create a circular walk . Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest . 
 Stannah at Legburthwaite is the starting point for the bridleway to Sticks Pass , from which Helvellyn can be approached along the main ridge track from the north . 
 From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn . The old pony route took a very safe and steady route for the benefit of early visitors , who took horses and a guide from the inn . The route traverses the flank of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man . The other route , known as the White Stones Route , originally marked by stones painted white , crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from <unk> . 
 <unk> is the start of the most direct route to the top of Helvellyn , " the modern pedestrian highway " which has been paved where necessary . It zig @-@ zags up the fellside above Helvellyn Gill , over Browncove Crags and joins the main ridge at Lower Man . 
 Several possible routes begin at Wythburn church . A bridleway winds up the fellside , over Comb Crags and traverses the slopes of Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth , the col just below Helvellyn . Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill , or Middle Tongue between these two gills . The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine , perhaps better used as a descent . Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it . 
 = = = Longer routes = = = 
 Helvellyn may be included in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction , but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north . Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six @-@ hour circular route of 16 miles off @-@ road and 10 miles on @-@ road riding . This may begin ( and finish ) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere . 
 Helvellyn can also be included in a circular walk from Patterdale : up Striding Edge , down to Grisedale Tarn and back over St Sunday Crag . 
 = = = Climbing routes = = = 
 Helvellyn is a popular area for winter climbing in the Lake District . The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes , clustered around the prow @-@ shaped buttress on the right hand side of the face , known to climbers as Viking Buttress , and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit . 
 Nethermost Cove also has some routes , including a large gully between Striding Edge and the back of the cove . 
 Browncove Crags on the western side of the mountain has some north @-@ facing routes . These are easier to access from a car park , and they can be linked with the Red Tarn routes . 
 = = Fell top assessors = = 
 The Lake District National Park Authority employs two " Fell top assessors " during the winter months , usually between December and March . Working alternate weeks , one of these walks up Helvellyn each day during that period to check the weather , snow and walking conditions . Their report and daily photograph appear on <unk> , the Lake District weather forecast website and phone line service , which also includes a local weather forecast from the Met Office . The fell top assessors also put their assessments and photos on Twitter . This information is important for people who go out hillwalking and climbing in winter , helping them to plan their routes and get an idea of the mountain conditions . 
 = = Wild camping = = 
 Many people do camp on Helvellyn throughout the year , often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge , Swirral Edge , and the summit of Helvellyn itself . Although camping in England is illegal without the permission of the landowner , there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District . This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively , for no more than one night , and have left no trace of their campsite behind . 
 = = Summit = = 
 The summit of Helvellyn takes the form of a broad plateau , sloping gently to the south @-@ west , but dropping abruptly to the north @-@ east into Red Tarn cove . So smooth and large is this summit that a small aeroplane was able to land on it in 1926 ( see History below ) . The highest point , 950 m ( 3 @,@ 120 ft ) above sea level , is the top of a small rocky knoll , marked by a loose cairn . In former times this knoll used to be known as Helvellyn High Man ( or Higher Man . ) Nearby there is a cross @-@ shaped stone shelter ; to the north is an Ordnance Survey trig point , slightly lower than the summit at 949 m ( 3 @,@ 114 ft ) . 
 The view from the top on a clear day extends across the whole of the Lake District to the Solway Firth and hills of south @-@ west Scotland to the north @-@ west , Cheviot and the Pennine Hills to the north @-@ east , Morecambe Bay , Blackpool and the coast of North Wales to the south , and the Irish Sea to the west . Snowdon is hidden by the Coniston Fells , and the Isle of Man is largely hidden behind the Great Gable and Pillar group of fells . 
 The subsidiary top , Helvellyn Lower Man , is about 700 m ( 770 yd ) to the north @-@ west . Its summit is small compared to the plateau of Helvellyn , but it offers better views to the north @-@ west , as the ground falls steeply away from it on that side . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 For centuries shepherds have walked over all parts of Helvellyn in the course of their work . It is only since the late eighteenth century that people have visited the mountain for pleasure or recreation . 
 One of the earliest accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn for the pleasure of doing so is contained in James Clarke 's guidebook of 1787 . He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn .
