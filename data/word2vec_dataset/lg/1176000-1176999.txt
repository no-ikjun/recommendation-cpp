 Conservapedia / <unk> / is an English @-@ language wiki encyclopedia project written from an American conservative , Young Earth creationist , and Christian fundamentalist point of view . The website was started in 2006 by American homeschool teacher and attorney Andrew Schlafly , son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , to counter what he perceived as a liberal bias present in Wikipedia . It uses editorials and a wiki @-@ based system to generate content . 
 Examples of Conservapedia 's ideology include its accusations against and strong criticism of U.S. President Barack Obama , the Democratic Party , evolution , and Wikipedia 's alleged liberal bias , as well as views of the theory of relativity as promoting moral relativism , claims of a proven link between abortion and breast cancer , praise for a number of Republican politicians , support of celebrities and artistic works that it views as promoting moral standards in line with Christian family values , and acceptance of fundamentalist Christian doctrines such as Young Earth creationism . Conservapedia 's " Conservative Bible Project " is a crowd @-@ sourced version of the Bible which Conservapedia claims will be " free of corruption by liberal untruths " . 
 The site has received negative reactions from the mainstream media , as well as from notable political figures , including commentators and journalists , and has been criticized for bias and inaccuracies . 
 = = Background = = 
 Conservapedia was created in November 2006 by Andrew Schlafly , a <unk> and Princeton @-@ educated attorney and a homeschool teacher . He started the project after reading a student 's assignment written using Common Era dating notation rather than the Anno Domini system that he preferred . Although he was " an early Wikipedia enthusiast , " as reported by Shawn Zeller of Congressional Quarterly , Schlafly became concerned about bias after Wikipedia editors repeatedly undid edits to the article about the 2005 Kansas evolution hearings . Schlafly expressed hope that Conservapedia would become a general resource for American educators and a counterpoint to the liberal bias that he perceived in Wikipedia . 
 The " Eagle Forum University " online education program , which is associated with Phyllis Schlafly 's Eagle Forum organization , uses material for various online courses , including U.S. history , stored on Conservapedia . Editing of Conservapedia articles related to a particular course topic is also a certain assignment for Eagle Forum University students . 
 Running on MediaWiki software , the site was founded in 2006 , with its earliest articles dating from November 22 . By January 2012 , Conservapedia contained over 38 @,@ 000 pages , not counting pages intended for internal discussion and collaboration , minimal " stub " articles , and other miscellany . Regular features on the front page of Conservapedia include links to news articles and blogs that the site 's editors consider relevant to conservatism . Editors of Conservapedia also maintain a page titled " Examples of Bias in Wikipedia " that compiles alleged instances of bias or errors on Wikipedia pages . It was , at one point , the most @-@ viewed page on the site . 
 = = Editorial viewpoints and policies = = 
 Conservapedia has editorial policies designed to prevent vandalism and what Schlafly sees as liberal bias . According to The Australian , although the site 's operators claim that the site " strives to keep its articles concise , informative , family @-@ friendly , and true to the facts , which often back up conservative ideas more than liberal ones " , on Conservapedia " arguments are often circular " and " contradictions , self @-@ serving rationalizations and hypocrisies abound . " 
 = = = Comparison to Wikipedia = = = 
 Shortly after its launch in 2006 , Schlafly described the site as being competition for Wikipedia , saying " Wikipedia has gone the way of CBS News . It 's long overdue to have competition like Fox News . " Many editorial practices of Conservapedia differ from those of Wikipedia . Articles and other content on the site frequently include criticism of Wikipedia as well as criticism of its alleged liberal ideology . 
 Launching the online encyclopedia project , Schlafly asserted the need for an alternative to Wikipedia due to editorial philosophy conflicts . The site 's " Conservapedia Commandments " differ from Wikipedia 's editorial policies . Wikipedia 's policies include following a neutral point of view and avoiding original research . In response to Wikipedia 's core policy of neutrality , Schlafly has stated : " It 's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral . I mean let 's take a point of view , let 's disclose that point of view to the reader " , and " Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators . They make no effort to retain balance . It ends up having all the neutrality of a lynch mob " . 
 In a March 2007 interview with The Guardian , Schlafly stated , " I 've tried editing Wikipedia , and found it and the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views . In one case my factual edits were removed within 60 seconds — so editing Wikipedia is no longer a viable approach " . On March 7 , 2007 , Schlafly was interviewed on BBC Radio 4 's flagship morning show , Today , opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond . Schlafly raised several concerns : that the article on the Renaissance does not give any credit to Christianity , that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non @-@ American spellings even though most users are American , that the article on American activities in the Philippines has a distinctly anti @-@ American bias , and that attempts to include pro @-@ Christian or pro @-@ American views are removed very quickly . Schlafly also claimed that the Wikipedia policy of allowing both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti @-@ Christian bias . 
 = = = Licensing of content = = = 
 Conservapedia allows users to " use any of the content on this site with or without attribution . " The copyright policy also states , " This license is revocable only in very rare instances of self @-@ defense , such as protecting continued use by Conservapedia editors or other licensees . " It also does not permit " unauthorized mirroring . " Wikipedia co @-@ founder Jimmy Wales has raised concerns about the fact that the project is not licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) or a similar copyleft license , stating that " [ p ] eople who contribute [ to Conservapedia ] are giving them full control of the content , which may lead to unpleasant results . " 
 = = = Vandalism = = = 
 The site has stated that it prohibits unregistered users from editing entries due to concerns over vandalism , disruption or defamation . Brian Macdonald , a Conservapedia editor , commented that vandalism was intended to " cause people to say , ' That Conservapedia is just wacko . ' " Macdonald has spent many hours daily reverting , in the words of Stephanie Simon of the Los Angeles Times , " malicious editing " . Vandals had inserted " errors , pornographic photos and satire . " For example , U.S. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales was said to be " a strong supporter of torture as a law enforcement tool for use against Democrats and third world inhabitants " . 
 = = = Other editorial policies = = = 
 Conservapedia states on its " Manual of Style " page that " American English spellings are preferred but Commonwealth spellings , for de novo or otherwise well @-@ maintained articles are welcome . " It prefers that articles about the United Kingdom use British English , while articles about the United States use American English , to resolve editorial disputes . Initially , Schlafly and other Conservapedia editors considered Wikipedia 's policy allowing British English spelling to be anti @-@ American bias . 
 The " Conservapedia Commandments " also require edits to be " family @-@ friendly , clean , concise , and without gossip or foul language " and that users make most edits on their site quality edits to articles ; accounts that engage in what it considers " unproductive activity , such as 90 % talk and only 10 % quality edits " may be blocked . The commandments also cite the United States Code as justification for legal action against edits that contain obscenities or are vandalism or spam . Conservapedia policies encourage its users to choose usernames " based on [ their ] real name or initials " , and users that have usernames deemed " frivolous " by the admins are blocked ; one of the site 's criticisms of Wikipedia is " silly administrator names " , which is claimed to reflect Wikipedia 's " substantial anti @-@ intellectual element " . 
 = = Conflict with scientific views = = 
 Various Conservapedia articles contradict established fields of science . On March 19 , 2007 , the British free newspaper Metro ran the article " Weird , wild wiki on which anything goes " , articulating the dismissal of Conservapedia by the Royal Society , saying " People need to be very careful about where they look for scientific information " . A Los Angeles Times journalist noted Conservapedia 's critics voiced concern that children stumbling on the site may assume Conservapedia 's scientific content is accurate . 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 Although not all Conservapedia contributors subscribe to a young @-@ earth creationist point of view — former administrator Terry <unk> stated to the Los Angeles Times that he did not take the Genesis creation account literally — sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young @-@ earth creationist perspective and an over @-@ reliance on Christian creationist home @-@ schooling textbooks . In an analysis in early 2007 , science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over @-@ reliance on citations from the works of home @-@ schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Conservapedia 's article on evolution presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with evidence in the fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism . The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community . Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution . 
 = = = Environmentalism = = = 
 According to Conservapedia , global warming is a " liberal hoax " . An entry on the " Pacific Northwest Arboreal Octopus " has received particular attention , although Schlafly has asserted that this page was intended as a parody of environmentalism . As of March 4 , 2007 , the entry has been deleted . 
 = = = Abortion = = = 
 Conservapedia asserts that there is a proven link between abortion and breast cancer , while the scientific consensus is that the best studies indicate that there is no such association . 
 = = = Relativity = = = 
 Conservapedia has also received criticism for its articles regarding the theory of relativity , particularly on their entry titled " <unk> to relativity " , an article that lists examples purportedly demonstrating that the theory is incorrect . Attention was drawn to the article by a Talking Points Memo posting , in which they reported on Conservapedia 's entry and stated that Andy Schlafly , Conservapedia 's founder , " has found one more liberal plot : the theory of relativity " . New Scientist , a science magazine , criticized Conservapedia 's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia 's arguments against it . Against Conservapedia 's statements , New Scientist stated that one is unlikely to find a single physicist that would claim that the theory of general relativity is the whole answer to how the universe works , and said that the theory of relativity has passed every test it has been put through . 
 University of Maryland physics professor Robert L. Park has also criticized Conservapedia 's entry on the theory of relativity , arguing that its criticism of the principle as " heavily promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to mislead people in how they view the world " confuses a physical theory with a moral value . Similarly , New Scientist stated at the end of their article that : 
 In the end there is no liberal conspiracy at work . Unfortunately , humanities scholars often confuse the issue by misusing the term " relativity " . The theory in no way encourages relativism , regardless of what Conservapedia may think . The theory of relativity is ultimately not so much about what it renders relative — three @-@ dimensional space and one @-@ dimensional time — but about what it renders absolute : the speed of light and four @-@ dimensional space @-@ time . 
 In October 2010 , Scientific American criticized Conservapedia 's attitude towards the Theory of Relativity , assigning them a zero score on their 0 to 100 fallacy @-@ versus @-@ fact " Science Index " , describing Conservapedia as " the online encyclopedia run by conservative lawyer Andrew Schlafly , [ which ] implies that Einstein 's theory of relativity is part of a liberal plot . " 
 Another claim is that " Albert Einstein 's work had nothing to do with the development of the atomic bomb " , and that Einstein was only a minor contributor to the theory of relativity . 
 = = Ideology = = 
 The Guardian of the United Kingdom has referred to Conservapedia 's politics as " right @-@ wing " , although it is sometimes described as far @-@ right or New Right . 
 = = = Liberalism = = = 
 Many Conservapedia articles criticize values that its editors associate with " liberal ideology " . The article " Liberal " once began with text originating from Schlafly personally : " A liberal ( also leftist ) is someone who rejects logical and biblical standards , often for self @-@ centered reasons . There are no coherent liberal standards ; often a liberal is merely someone who craves attention , and who uses many words to say nothing . " Leonard Pitts quoted it in a critical comment saying " You may judge Conservapedia 's own bias by reading its definition of liberal " . Conservapedia 's entry on ' Liberal ' has since been changed to begin with : 
 A liberal is someone who favors censorship of Christianity plus increased government spending and power , as in <unk> . Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda , including same @-@ sex marriage . Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working . Liberals are often anti @-@ Christian , or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians . The liberal ideology has worsened over the years and degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology . Some liberals simply support , in knee @-@ jerk fashion , the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own . 
 = = = Partisan politics = = = 
 Schlafly said in an interview with National Public Radio that Wikipedia 's article on the history of the Democratic Party is an " attempt to legitimize the modern Democratic Party by going back to Thomas Jefferson " and that this statement is " specious and worth criticizing " . He also has claimed that Wikipedia is " six times more liberal than the American public " , a claim that has been labeled " sensational " by Andrew Chung of the Canadian newspaper the Toronto Star . 
 John <unk> of the St. Petersburg Times observed that the Conservapedia article about the Democratic Party contained a criticism about the party 's alleged support for same @-@ sex marriage , and associated the party with the homosexual agenda . 
 The Conservapedia entries on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama are critical of their respective subjects . During the 2008 presidential campaign , its entry on Obama asserted that he " has no clear personal achievement that cannot be explained as the likely result of affirmative action " . Some Conservapedia editors urged that the statement be changed or deleted , but Schlafly , a classmate of Obama , responded by asserting that the Harvard Law Review , the Harvard University legal journal for which Obama and <unk> worked together , uses racial quotas and stated : " The statement about affirmative action is accurate and will remain in the entry " . In addition , Hugh Muir of the British newspaper The Guardian mockingly referred to Conservapedia 's assertion that Obama has links to radical Islam as " dynamite " and an excellent resource for " US <unk> " . 
 In contrast , the articles about conservative politicians , such as former U.S. Republican president Ronald Reagan and former British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , have been observed as praising their respective subjects . Mark <unk> of the Juneau Empire considered the Conservapedia entry on Sarah Palin , the Republican vice @-@ presidential candidate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election , a " kinder , gentler " and " far shorter and less controversial " reference for one wishing to learn about Palin in contrast with the corresponding Wikipedia entry , which <unk> found to be plagued by disputes over inclusion of potentially controversial details about her life . 
 = = = Atheism = = = 
 In July 2008 , American Prospect associate editor Ezra Klein derided the Conservapedia article on atheism in his weekly column : " As Daniel DeGroot notes , you 've got to wonder which ' unreasonable ' explanations they rejected when formulating that entry " . 
 The website sometimes adopts a strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political or ideological opponents . For instance , in May 2009 , Vanity Fair and The Spectator reported that Conservapedia 's article on atheist Richard Dawkins featured a picture of Adolf Hitler at the top . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Conservapedia project has come under significant criticism for numerous factual inaccuracies and factual relativism . Wired magazine noted that Conservapedia was " attracting lots of derisive comments on blogs and a growing number of phony articles written by mischief makers " . Iain Thomson in Information World Review wrote that " leftist subversives " may have been creating deliberate parody entries . Conservapedia has been compared to <unk> , a wiki written from a creationist perspective , and <unk> , a wiki with a Reformed theology focus . Fox News obliquely compared it with other new conservative websites competing with mainstream ones , such as <unk> , a Christian version of social networking site MySpace , and <unk> , a Christian version of video site YouTube . 
 Tom Flanagan , a conservative professor of political science at the University of Calgary , has argued that Conservapedia is more about religion , specifically Christianity , than conservatism and that it " is far more guilty of the crime they 're attributing to Wikipedia " than Wikipedia itself . Matt <unk> of the military @-@ oriented newspaper Stars and Stripes called Conservapedia " a Web site that caters mostly to evangelical Christians " . Its scope as an encyclopedia , according to its founders , " offers a historical record from a Christian and conservative perspective " . APC magazine perceives this to be representative of Conservapedia 's own problem with bias . Conservative Christian commentator Rod Dreher has been highly critical of the website 's " Conservative Bible Project " , an ongoing retranslation of the Bible which Dreher attributes to " insane hubris " on the part of " right @-@ wing ideologues " . 
 The project has also been criticized for promoting a false dichotomy between conservatism and liberalism and for promoting relativism with the implicit idea that there " often are two equally valid interpretations of the facts " . Matthew Sheffield , writing in the conservative daily newspaper The Washington Times , argued that conservatives concerned about bias should contribute more often to Wikipedia rather than use Conservapedia as an alternative since he felt that alternative websites like Conservapedia are often " incomplete " . Author Damian Thompson asserts that the purpose of Conservapedia is to " dress up nonsense as science " . 
 Bryan <unk> , writing for the LGBT magazine The Advocate , referred to the project as " Wikipedia for the bigoted " . On the satirical news program The Daily Show , comedian Lewis Black lampooned its article on homosexuality . Writing in The Australian , columnist Emma Jane described Conservapedia as " a disturbing parallel universe where the ice age is a theoretical period , intelligent design is empirically testable , and relativity and geology are junk sciences . " 
 Opinions criticizing the site rapidly spread throughout the blogosphere around early 2007 . Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time . In May 2008 , Schlafly and one of his homeschooled students appeared on the CBC program The Hour for the same purpose . 
 Stephanie Simon of the Los Angeles Times quoted two Conservapedia editors who commented favorably about Conservapedia . Matt Barber , policy director for the conservative Christian political action group Concerned Women for America , praised Conservapedia as a more family @-@ friendly and accurate alternative to Wikipedia . 
 Wired magazine , in an article entitled " Ten Impressive , Weird And Amazing Facts About Wikipedia " , highlighted several of Conservapedia 's articles , including those on " Atheism and obesity " and " Hollywood values " , amongst others . It also highlighted Conservapedia 's " Examples of bias in Wikipedia " article , which encourages readers to contact Jimmy Wales and tell him to " sort it out . " 
 Conservapedia 's use of Wikipedia 's format to create a conservative Christian alternative encyclopedia has been mirrored by other sites , such as <unk> ( formerly <unk> ) , <unk> and <unk> , which adopted the format of the more prominent Facebook , YouTube and MySpace , respectively . 
 Wikipedia 's co @-@ creator Jimmy Wales said about Conservapedia that " free culture knows no bounds " and " the reuse of our work to build variants [ is ] directly in line with our mission " . Wales denied Schlafly 's claims of liberal bias in Wikipedia . 
 = = = RationalWiki = = = 
 In April 2007 , Peter Lipson , a doctor of internal medicine , repeatedly attempted to edit Conservapedia 's article on breast cancer to include evidence arguing against Conservapedia 's claim that abortion was a major cause of the disease . Conservapedia administrators " questioned his credentials and shut off debate " . Several editors whose accounts were blocked by Conservapedia administrators , including Lipson , started another website , RationalWiki , a sometimes satirical and sometimes serious wiki website with articles written from a secular , progressive perspective . 
 RationalWiki 's self @-@ stated purpose is to analyze and refute " pseudoscience " , the " anti @-@ science movement " , and " crank ideas " , as well as to conduct " explorations of authoritarianism and fundamentalism " and explore " how these subjects are handled in the media . " 
 According to an article published in the Los Angeles Times in 2007 , RationalWiki members " monitor Conservapedia . And — by their own admission — engage in acts of cyber @-@ vandalism . " 
 = = = Lenski dialogue = = = 
 On June 9 , 2008 , New Scientist published an article describing Richard Lenski 's 20 @-@ year E. coli experiment , which reported that the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize citrate . Schlafly contacted Lenski to request the data . Lenski explained that the relevant data was in the paper and that Schlafly fundamentally misunderstood it . Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data . Lenski replied again that the relevant data was already in the paper , that the " raw data " were living bacterial samples , which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs , and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive , including claims of outright deceit . The Daily Telegraph later called Lenski 's reply " one of the greatest and most comprehensive put @-@ downs in scientific argument " . 
 The exchange , recorded on a Conservapedia page entitled " Lenski dialog " , was widely reported on news @-@ aggregating sites and web logs . Carl Zimmer wrote that it was readily apparent that " Schlafly had not bothered to read [ Lenski 's paper ] closely " , and PZ Myers criticized Schlafly for demanding data despite having neither a plan to use it nor the expertise to analyze it . During and after the Lenski dialogue on Conservapedia , several users on the site were blocked for " insubordination " for expressing disagreement with Schlafly 's stance on the issue . 
 The dialogue between Lenski and Conservapedia is noted in Richard Dawkins ' The Greatest Show on Earth : The Evidence for Evolution in a chapter concerning Lenski 's research . 
 = = Conservative Bible Project = = 
 Conservapedia hosts the " Conservative Bible Project " , a project aiming to rewrite the English translation of the Bible in order to remove terms described as " liberal bias " . The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia 's founder to be later liberal additions . These include the story of the adulteress in the Gospel of John in which Jesus declares " Let him who is without sin cast the first stone " . The project also intends to remove Jesus 's prayer on the cross , " Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing " , since it appears only in the Gospel of Luke and since , according to Schlafly , " the simple fact is that some of the persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing . This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible " . 
 The Bible project has met with extensive criticism , including from fellow evangelistic Christian conservatives . Rod Dreher , a conservative editor and columnist , described the project as " insane hubris " and " crazy " ; he further described the project as " It 's like what you 'd get if you crossed the Jesus Seminar with the College Republican chapter at a rural institution of Bible <unk> ' " . Ed Morrissey , another conservative Christian writer , wrote that bending the word of God to one 's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology , rather than the other way around . Joseph Farah , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of WorldNetDaily , stated : " I 've seen some incredibly stupid and misguided initiatives by ' conservatives ' in my day , but this one takes the cake " and " There 's certainly nothing ' conservative ' about rewriting the Bible " . Creation Ministries International wrote " Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda , no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda , is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as ' politically correct ' Bibles . " 
 On October 7 , 2009 , Stephen Colbert called for his viewers to incorporate him into the Conservapedia Bible as a Biblical figure and viewers responded by editing the Conservapedia Bible to include his name . This was followed by an interview between Colbert and Schlafly on December 8 , 2009 . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Isabel in New York and New England = 
 The effects of Hurricane Isabel in New York and New England were relatively minor and primarily limited to wind damage . Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 , 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . It moved northwestward , and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) on September 11 . After fluctuating in intensity for four days , Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on September 18 . It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day . 
 Damage in New York totaled $ 90 million ( 2003 USD , $ 105 million 2008 USD ) , with Vermont reporting about $ 100 @,@ 000 in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 117 @,@ 000 in 2008 USD ) . Falling trees from moderate winds downed power lines across the region , causing sporadic power outages . Two people died as a result of the hurricane , both due to the rough surf from Isabel . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Hours before Isabel made landfall on North Carolina , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for a portion of the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey / New York border to <unk> . About a day before the hurricane moved ashore , forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10 % chance of passing within 75 miles ( 120 km ) of New York City . Other portions of southern New England were estimated to have similar probabilities , with the same forecast predicting a 3 % chance for it passing within 75 miles ( 120 km ) of Eastport , Maine . By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore , forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into Canada as an extratropical cyclone . 
 New York Governor George Pataki urged residents to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline . The State Emergency Management Office began preparing for the hurricane about a week before it moved ashore . The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation , with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices . The state 's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized in the event of an emergency . Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment in the event of an emergency , such as helicopters , generators , high @-@ axle vehicles , and communications equipment . State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed . The State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational , and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding . Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The pressure gradient between a ridge and Isabel produced strong northeast winds of at least tropical storm force across southeastern New York . Shinnecock Inlet recorded a peak gust of 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) . A station at LaGuardia Airport recorded a wind gust of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) , where airplane flights averaged a 90 @-@ minute delay . The strongest winds occurred in the outer rainbands , during which many trees , tree limbs , and power lines fell across the region . In the New York metropolitan area , moderate winds downed 640 trees and 801 tree limbs . A man driving through Great Neck Estates was critically injured when a tree limb fell onto the car . Additionally , a falling tree branch hit a man in the head , resulting in a serious head injury . In and around New York City , about 1 @.@ 1 million customers were left without power , though most outages were fixed by the day after the hurricane passed through the region . Offshore of Long Beach , rough waves killed a man while <unk> . Further to the northwest the winds were not as severe , though in some places in the south @-@ central portion of the state the winds downed some trees . A falling tree hit and damaged a car in Cobleskill . The winds also knocked out power to about 3 @,@ 000 customers in the Schoharie and eastern Mohawk Valleys . In the northeast portion of the state , a few trees and power lines were blown down in Moriah , Westport , and Lewis . Precipitation was generally light in the state , with a few scattered locations reporting over 1 inch ( 25 mm ) . In Livingston County , the rainfall overflowed the reservoir , causing moderate flood damage . Initially , gasoline futures on the New York Stock Exchange rose in anticipation of a threat from the hurricane , though later dropped when the storm failed to disrupt oil refining facilities . The hurricane brought unusual birds to the western portion of the state , including petrels and shearwaters normally found in salt @-@ water regions or over the open ocean . Most of the birds died within a few days due to the sudden change in habitat . In Cayuga County , downed power lines lit one building on fire , causing minor smoke and water damage though no injuries . Damage in the state totaled $ 90 million ( 2003 USD , $ 105 million 2008 USD ) . 
 Rainfall reached 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in portions of western Connecticut and Massachusetts . Strong surf from Isabel caused a man to drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett , Rhode Island , and being swept out to sea . Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina . A few days after Isabel moved ashore , the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2 @,@ 000 gallons ( <unk> l ) of water and 25 @,@ 000 pounds ( 11 @,@ 340 kg ) of ice to North Carolina . In Vermont , the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) in Pleasant Valley , causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state . In Richmond , trees fell on and damaged three trucks , and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car . Damage in the state totaled about $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2003 USD , $ 117 @,@ 000 in 2008 USD ) . Rainfall reached 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine . 
 = Overloaded : The Singles Collection = 
 Overloaded : The Singles Collection is the first greatest hits album of English girl group Sugababes . It was released on 10 November 2006 — almost one year following the departure of founding member Mutya Buena and the introduction of her replacement , Amelle Berrabah . Overloaded features twelve of the group 's singles , four of which reached number one in the UK . The Sugababes collaborated with members from Orson to produce two new tracks for the album , " Easy " and " Good to Be Gone " . Overloaded received positive reviews from critics , who generally praised it as a reflection of the group 's success . 
 The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . By October 2008 , it had sold 600 @,@ 000 copies in the UK . Overloaded also reached the top twenty on the record charts of Ireland and Portugal , and the top forty on the charts in Austria , Denmark , Germany , the Netherlands , Norway and Switzerland . Its lead single " Easy " was released one week prior to the album 's release , and reached the top ten on the singles charts of Slovakia and the United Kingdom . To promote Overloaded , the Sugababes performed at the 100 Club in London and embarked on the album 's accompanying tour in the UK and Ireland from March to April 2007 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shortly following the release of the Sugababes ' fourth studio album , Taller in More Ways , it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band . Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah , who was announced as Buena 's replacement 24 hours after her departure . In June 2006 , the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007 . However , group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006 , which would include all of the group 's hits . When rumours arose that the release of the album was premature , band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album . She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena 's departure , saying : " When Mutya left , we decided it was even more important , we should do this as closure so we don 't have to relive history all the time . " Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this , saying : " When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway . But when she left it seemed even more appropriate . " 
 = = Release and content = = 
 Overloaded was released in the UK on 13 November 2006 . In addition , a remix album titled Overloaded : The Remix Collection and a greatest hits DVD , Overloaded : The Videos Collection were released on the same day . Overloaded was not released in the United States , despite being reported that it would be available in the country on 5 December 2006 . According to Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian , the group looks " positively regal " on the album cover . The album contains twelve of the group 's previous singles , four of which reached number one in the UK : " Freak Like Me " , " Round Round " , " Hole in the Head " and " Push the Button " . 
 The Sugababes collaborated with members from Orson to produce two brand new tracks for the album , " Easy " and " Good to Be Gone " . Buchanan spoke upon the collaboration , saying : " When we started working with the Orson guys the sound just blew us away – it 's so fresh , but has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career . It 's perfect for this album . " Range , however , explained how she initially did not like the song in comparison to " Good to Be Gone " . After leaving the studio , she called the other members of the group and spoke of her dissatisfaction with " Easy " . Range realised she enjoyed the song after listening to it the following day , and later named it one of her favourite songs by the group . Despite being titled The Singles Collection , the album does not contain all of the group 's previous singles ; " New Year " , " Soul Sound " , " Angels with Dirty Faces " and " Follow Me Home " are omitted , although " Run for Cover " is included as a bonus track on the UK version . " Red Dress " was re @-@ recorded to feature the vocals of Berrabah instead of Buena following the latter 's departure from the group .

 Overloaded received positive reviews from critics , who praised the album as a reflection of the group 's success . Andy Kellman of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five . He praised the tracks as " an ideal introduction " to the Sugababes , and noted that the new songs recorded with Berrabah " indicate that the group hasn 't lost any of its momentum " . Daily Record writer Rick Fulton gave the album a full five @-@ star rating , saying : " Changing members can 't dampen the winning formula of Sugababes – sassy vocals over electro beats " . He concluded that Overloaded proves the group as the UK 's best . Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian gave the album a four out of five star rating and wrote that the group 's longevity " practically makes them the Status Quo of the genre " . 
 The Herald Sun 's Cameron Adams noted that Overloaded is a reminder of " what a good pop act " the Sugababes are , although he was less favourable of the new tracks . Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY concluded that Overloaded is " awash with hits " and is indicative of why the group was named the most successful female act of the 21st century . Tim <unk> from Pitchfork Media rated Overloaded eight and a half out of ten ; he praised the more emotional tracks on the album , writing : " While people may remember the group for their frothy pop , their greatest hits collection Overloaded is equally impressive for its devastatingly earnest balladry " . Gigwise 's Jenna <unk> @-@ Burton described the album as " pure pop perfection at its very best " .

 = Suharto = 
 Suharto ( Javanese : <unk> ; <unk> : <unk> ; O @-@ Javanese : <unk> ; pronunciation ; 8 June 1921 – 27 January 2008 ) was the second President of Indonesia , holding the office for 31 years from the ousting of Sukarno in 1967 until his resignation in 1998 . 
 Suharto was born in a small village , Kemusuk , in the <unk> area near the city of Yogyakarta , during the Dutch colonial era . He grew up in humble circumstances . His Javanese Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth , and he was passed between foster parents for much of his childhood . During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia , Suharto served in Japanese @-@ organised Indonesian security forces . Indonesia 's independence struggle saw his joining the newly formed Indonesian army . Suharto rose to the rank of Major General following Indonesian independence . An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by Suharto @-@ led troops and was blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party . The army subsequently led an anti @-@ communist purge which the CIA described as " one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century " and Suharto wrested power from Indonesia 's founding president , Sukarno . He was appointed acting president in 1967 and President the following year . He then mounted a social propaganda campaign known as De @-@ <unk> in an effort to reduce the former President 's influence and prestige . Support for Suharto 's presidency was strong throughout the 1970s and 1980s but eroded following a severe financial crisis that led to widespread unrest and his resignation in May 1998 . Suharto died in 2008 . 
 The legacy of Suharto 's 31 @-@ year rule is debated both in Indonesia and abroad . Under his " New Order " administration , Suharto constructed a strong , centralised and military @-@ dominated government . An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia and an avowedly anti @-@ Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the Cold War . For most of his presidency , Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialisation , dramatically improving health , education and living standards . Indonesia 's invasion and occupation of East Timor during Suharto 's presidency resulted in at least 100 @,@ 000 deaths . By the 1990s , the New Order 's authoritarianism and widespread corruption were a source of discontent . 
 According to Transparency International , Suharto is the most corrupt leader in modern history , having embezzled an alleged $ 15 – 35 billion during his rule . In the years after his presidency , attempts to try him on charges of corruption and genocide failed because of his poor health and because of lack of support within Indonesia for moves to bring charges against him . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Suharto was born on 8 June 1921 during the Dutch East Indies era , in a plaited bamboo walled house in the hamlet of Kemusuk , a part of the larger village of <unk> . The village is 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) west of Yogyakarta , the cultural heartland of the Javanese . Born to ethnic Javanese parents , he was the only child of his father 's second marriage . His father , <unk> , had two children from his previous marriage , and was a village irrigation official . His mother , <unk> , a local woman , was distantly related to Sultan Hamengkubuwono V by his first concubine . 
 Five weeks after Suharto 's birth , his mother suffered a nervous breakdown and he was placed in the care of his paternal great @-@ aunt , <unk> . <unk> and <unk> divorced early in Suharto 's life and both later remarried . At the age of three , Suharto was returned to his mother , who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies . In 1929 , Suharto 's father took him to live with his sister , who was married to an agricultural supervisor , <unk> , in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low @-@ yielding farming area near Wonogiri . Over the following two years , he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father . 
 <unk> took to raising the boy as his own , which provided Suharto a father @-@ figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro . In 1931 , he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school , living first with <unk> 's son <unk> , and later with his father 's relative <unk> . While living with <unk> , Suharto became <unk> with <unk> , a <unk> ( " guru " ) of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing . The experience deeply affected him and later , as president , Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language . Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk , where he continued studying at a lower @-@ fee Muhammadiyah middle school in the city of Yogyakarta until 1939 . 
 Like many Javanese , Suharto had only one name . In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called " Haji " or " el @-@ Haj Mohammed Suharto " but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used . The spelling " Suharto " reflects modern Indonesian spelling , although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned . At the time of his birth , the standard transcription was " Soeharto " and he preferred the original spelling . The international English @-@ language press generally uses the spelling ' Suharto ' while the Indonesian government and media use ' Soeharto ' . 
 Suharto 's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti @-@ colonialism , or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings . Unlike Sukarno and his circle , Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers . Consequently , he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth . He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940 .

 = = = World War II and Japanese occupation = = = 
 Suharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in <unk> . He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes . Following a spell of unemployment , he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army ( KNIL ) in June 1940 , and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta . With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies , the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese . Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal , graduated from a short training course at KNIL <unk> in Gombong to become a sergeant , and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in <unk> . 
 Following the Dutch surrender to the invading Japanese forces in March 1942 , Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to <unk> . After months of unemployment , he then became one of thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese @-@ organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force . In October 1943 , Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese @-@ sponsored militia , the PETA ( Defenders of the Fatherland ) in which Indonesians served as officers . In his training to serve with the rank of <unk> ( platoon commander ) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese bushido , or " way of the warrior " , used to indoctrinate troops . This training encouraged an anti @-@ Dutch and pro @-@ nationalist thought , although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists . The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto 's own way of thinking . 
 Suharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at Wates , south of Yogyakarta , until he was admitted for training for company commander ( <unk> ) in Bogor from April to August 1944 . As company commander , he conducted training for new PETA recruits in Surakarta , Jakarta , and Madiun . The Japanese surrender and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote <unk> area ( on the slopes of Mount Wilis ) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed PETA rebellion of February 1945 in Blitar , led by <unk> . 
 = = = Indonesian National Revolution = = = 
 Two days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific , independence leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence , and were appointed President and Vice @-@ President respectively of the new Republic . Suharto disbanded his regiment in accordance with orders from the Japanese command , and returned to Yogyakarta . As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence , Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army . On the basis of his PETA experience , he was appointed deputy commander , and subsequently a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945 . Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around Magelang and Semarang , and was subsequently appointed head of a brigade as lieutenant @-@ colonel , having earned respect as a field commander . In the early years of the War , he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I ; Suharto was promoted Major and became Battalion X 's leader . 
 The arrival of the Allies , under a mandate to return the situation to the status quo ante bellum , quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces , i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces . Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T ( " Tiger " ) Brigade on 17 May 1946 . It earned him the respect of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel <unk> <unk> , who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters ( MPP ) , a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces . The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring . By August 1946 , Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III ( the " Diponegoro Division " ) stationed in Yogyakarta . In late 1946 , the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for defence of the west and southwest of Yogyakarta from Dutch forces . Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable ; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of opium through the territory he controlled , to generate income . In September 1948 , Suharto was dispatched to meet Musso , chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the communist uprising in Madiun . 
 In December 1948 , the Dutch launched " Operation Crow " , which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital Yogyakarta . Suharto was appointed to lead the <unk> III , consisting of two battalions , which waged guerilla warfare against the Dutch from the hills south of Yogyakarta . In dawn raids on 1 March 1949 , Suharto 's forces and local militia recaptured the city , holding it until noon . Suharto 's later accounts had him as the lone plotter , although other sources say Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta , and the Panglima of the Third Division , ordered the attack . However , General Abdul Nasution said that Suharto took great care in preparing the " General Offensive " ( Indonesian Serangan Umum ) . Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war . Internationally , the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations , which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949 . Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949 . 
 During the Revolution , Suharto married Siti <unk> ( known as Madam Tien ) , the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo . The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive , lasting until Tien 's death in 1996 . The couple had six children : Siti <unk> <unk> ( Tutut , born 1949 ) , Sigit <unk> ( born 1951 ) , Bambang <unk> ( born 1953 ) , Siti <unk> ( " Titiek Suharto " , born 1959 ) , <unk> Mandala Putra ( Tommy , born 1962 ) , and Siti <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , born 1964 ) . Within the Javanese upper class , it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce to supplement the family budget , allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role . The commercial dealings of Tien , her children and grandchildren became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto 's presidency . 
 = = = Post @-@ Independence military career = = = 
 In the years following Indonesian independence , Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army , primarily in Java . In 1950 , as a Colonel , he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar Uprising , a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch @-@ established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity , the United States of Indonesia . During his year in Makassar , Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours , the Habibie family , whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto 's vice @-@ president , and went on to succeed him as President . In 1951 – 1952 , Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic @-@ inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java . Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953 , he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti @-@ bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area . He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops . His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism . 
 Between 1956 and 1959 , he served in the important position of commander of Diponegoro Division based in Semarang , responsible for Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces . His relationship with prominent businessmen Liem Sioe Liong and Bob Hasan , which extended throughout his presidency , began in Central Java , where he was involved in a series of " profit generating " enterprises conducted primarily to keep the poorly funded military unit functioning . Army anti @-@ corruption investigations implicated Suharto in a 1959 smuggling scandal . Relieved of his position , he was transferred to the army 's Staff and Command School ( <unk> ) in the city of Bandung . While in Bandung , he was promoted to brigadier @-@ general , and in late 1960 , promoted to army deputy chief of staff . In 1961 , he was given an additional command , as head of the army 's new Strategic Reserve ( later KOSTRAD ) , a ready @-@ reaction air @-@ mobile force based in Jakarta . 
 In January 1962 , Suharto was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala , a joint army @-@ navy @-@ air force command based in Makassar . This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch , who were preparing it for its own independence , separate from Indonesia . In 1965 , Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno 's Konfrontasi , against the newly formed Malaysia . Fearful that Konfrontasi would leave Java thinly covered by the army , and hand control to the 2 million @-@ strong Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) , he authorised a <unk> intelligence officer , Ali Murtopo , to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians . 
 = = Overthrow of Sukarno ( 1965 ) = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965 , when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI ’ s proposal for a " fifth armed force " consisting of armed peasants and workers . However , this idea was rejected by the army ’ s leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces . In May , the " Gilchrist Document " aroused Sukarno 's fear of a military plot to overthrow him , a fear which he mentioned repeatedly during the next few months . On his independence day speech in August , Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti @-@ imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes , and warned the Army not to interfere . 
 While Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics , the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger , while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled . Sukarno 's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars , the military and the communists . The military , nationalists , and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno 's protection . They feared imminent establishment of communist state in Indonesia . By 1965 , the PKI had 3 million members , and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali . PKI has become the strongest political party in Indonesia . 
 = = = <unk> coup and anti @-@ communist purge = = = 
 Before dawn on 1 October 1965 , six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard , Diponegoro Division , and <unk> Division . Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace , the national radio station , and telecommunications centre . At 7 : 10 am Untung bin <unk> announced on radio that the " 30 September Movement " had forestalled a coup attempt on Sukarno by " CIA @-@ backed power @-@ mad generals " , and that it was " an internal army affair " . The 30 September Movement never made any attempt on Suharto 's life . Suharto had been in Jakarta army hospital that evening with his three @-@ year @-@ old son Tommy who had a scalding injury . It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief , a key member of 30 September Movement and close family friend of Suharto . According to Latief 's later testimony , the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno @-@ loyalist , hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals , upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality . 
 Upon being told of the killings , Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square . He mobilized KOSTRAD and RPKAD ( now Kopassus ) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta , capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance . Suharto announced over the radio at 9 : 00 pm that six generals had been kidnapped by " counter @-@ revolutionaries " and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno . He said he was in control of the army , and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno . Suharto issued an ultimatum to Halim Air Force Base , where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno , air force commander Omar Dhani and PKI chairman <unk> Nusantara Aidit had gathered , causing them to disperse before <unk> soldiers occupied the air base on 2 October after short fighting . With the failure of the poorly organised coup , and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security , Suharto 's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October ( he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October ) . On 5 October , Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals ' bodies . 
 Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup 's organisers and their aims . The army 's version , and subsequently that of the " New Order " , was that the PKI was solely responsible . A propaganda campaign by the army , and Islamic and Catholic student groups , convinced both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup attempt , and that the killings were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes . The army in alliance with religious civilian groups led a campaign to purge Indonesian society , government , and armed forces of the communist party and leftist organisations . The purge spread from Jakarta to much of the rest of the country . ( see : Indonesian killings of 1965 – 1966 ) . The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed . As many as 1 @.@ 5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another . As a result of the purge , one of Sukarno 's three pillars of support , the Indonesian Communist Party , was effectively eliminated by the other two , the military and political Islam . 
 = = = Power struggle = = = 
 Sukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population , and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup . For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement , there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno , including student agitation , stacking of parliament , media propaganda and military threats . 
 In January 1966 , university students under the banner of KAMI , begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation . The students received support and protection with the army , with Suharto often engaging in coordination meetings with student leaders . Street fights broke out between the students and pro @-@ Sukarno loyalists with the pro @-@ Suharto students prevailing due to army protection . 
 In February 1966 , Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant @-@ general ( and to full general in July 1966 ) . The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno 's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president . On 11 March 1966 , the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting ( which Suharto had not attended ) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace ( 60 km away ) by helicopter . Three <unk> generals , Major @-@ General Basuki Rahmat , Brigadier @-@ General M Jusuf , and Brigadier @-@ General <unk> went to Bogor to meet Sukarno . There , they secured a presidential decree ( see Supersemar ) that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security . 
 Using the Supersemar letter , Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day , and proceeded to purge pro @-@ Sukarno elements from the parliament , the government and military , accusing them of being communist sympathisers . The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters . The army arrested pro @-@ Sukarno and pro @-@ communist members of the MPRS ( parliament ) , and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy , air force , and the police force with his supporters , who then began an extensive purge within each services . 
 In June 1966 , the now @-@ purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of Marxism @-@ Leninism , ratifying the Supersemar , and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life . Against the wishes of Sukarno , the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations ( Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year ) . Suharto did not seek Sukarno 's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president amongst elements of the armed forces . 
 By January 1967 , Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces , and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno . On 22 February 1967 , Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency , and on 12 March , the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president . Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace ; little more was heard from him , and he died in June 1970 . On 27 March 1968 , the MPRS appointed Suharto for the first of his five @-@ year terms as President . 
 = = The " New Order " ( 1967 – 1998 ) = = 
 = = = Ideology = = = 
 Suharto promoted his " New Order " , as opposed to Sukarno 's " Old Order " , as a society based on the Pancasila ideology . After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi @-@ religious cult , Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as basic principle . He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians , from primary school students to office workers . In practice , however , the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto 's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as " anti @-@ Pancasila " . 
 The New Order also implemented the <unk> ( " Dual Function " ) policy enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government , economy , and society . 
 = = = Consolidation of power = = = 
 Having been appointed president , Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere primus inter pares and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti @-@ communist purge . Suharto , aided by his " Office of Personal Assistants " ( Aspri ) clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division , particularly Ali Murtopo , began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives . 
 Having successfully stood @-@ down MPRS chairman General Nasution 's 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority , Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972 . In 1967 , generals Hartono <unk> <unk> , Kemal Idris , and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo ( dubbed " New Order Radicals " ) opposed Suharto 's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non @-@ ideological two @-@ party system similar to those found in many Western countries . Suharto then proceeded to send <unk> overseas as ambassador , while Kemal Idris and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo were sent to distant North Sumatera and South Sulawesi as regional commanders . 
 Suharto 's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime . While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement ( Angkatan ' 66 ) were successfully co @-@ opted into the regime , Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections ( " <unk> " movement ) , the costly construction of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah theme park ( 1972 ) , the domination of foreign capitalists ( Malari Incident of 1974 ) , and lack of term limits of Suharto 's presidency ( 1978 ) . The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists ( such as future national figures <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , Adnan <unk> Nasution , <unk> Siregar , and Sjahrir ) and even sending army units to occupy university campus of <unk> ( Bandung Institute of Technology ) from January – March 1978 . In April 1978 , Suharto moved decisively by issuing decree on " Normalization of Campus Life " ( <unk> ) which prohibited political activities on @-@ campus not related to academic pursuits . 
 On 15 – 16 January 1974 , Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in Jakarta during visit of Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka . Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors was encouraged by General Sumitro , deputy commander of armed forces . Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto 's Aspri inner circle . It was reported to Suharto that the riots were engineered by Sumitro who wished to destabilize the regime utilizing the student unrest , resulting in Sumitro 's dismissal and forced retirement . This incident is referred as Malari Incident ( <unk> Lima <unk> <unk> / Disaster of 15 January ) . However , Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent . 
 In 1980 , fifty prominent political figures signed the Petition of Fifty which criticised Suharto 's use of Pancasila to silence his critics . Suharto refused to address the petitioners ' concerns , and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements .

 To placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections , as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967 , Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations . The law provided for a parliament ( <unk> <unk> Rakjat / MPR ) with the power to elect presidents , consisting of a lower house ( Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat / DPR ) and regional representatives . 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government , while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of general election . This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs , particularly the appointment of presidents . 
 To participate in the elections , Suharto realized the need to align himself with a political party . After initially considering alignment with Sukarno 's old party the <unk> , in 1969 Suharto decided to take @-@ over control of an obscure military @-@ run federation of NGOs called Golkar ( " Functional Group " ) and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right @-@ hand man Ali Murtopo . The first general election was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants ; consisting of Golkar , four Islamic parties , as well as five nationalist and Christian parties . Campaigning on a non @-@ ideological platform of " development " , and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics , Golkar managed to secure 62 @.@ 8 % of the popular vote . The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second @-@ term in office with Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX as vice @-@ president . 
 It is not the military strength of the Communists but their fanaticism and ideology which is the principal element of their strength . To consider this , each country in the area needs an ideology of its own with which to counter the Communists . But a national ideology is not enough by itself . The well being of the people must be improved so that it strengthens and supports the national ideology . 
 On 5 January 1973 , to allow better control , the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into PPP ( Partai Persatuan Pembangunan / United Development Party ) while the five non @-@ Islamic parties were fused into PDI ( Partai <unk> Indonesia / Indonesian Democratic Party ) . The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership , while establishing the " re @-@ call " system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions . Using this system dubbed the " Pancasila Democracy " , Suharto was re @-@ elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978 , 1983 , 1988 , 1993 , and 1998 . Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election , ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition . For all intents and purposes , he held all governing power in the nation . 
 Suharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de @-@ politicized " floating mass " supportive of the national mission of " development " , a concept similar to corporatism . The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs . For instance , the government created <unk> ( Korps <unk> Republik Indonesia ) in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty , organized the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> Indonesia ) as the only legal labour union in February 1973 , and established the MUI in 1975 to control Islamic clerics . In 1966 to 1967 , to promote assimilation of the influential Chinese @-@ Indonesians , the Suharto government passed several laws as part of so @-@ called " Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem " , whereby only one Chinese @-@ language publication ( controlled by the army ) was allowed to continue , all Chinese cultural and religious expressions ( including display of Chinese characters ) were prohibited from public space , Chinese schools were phased @-@ out , and the ethnic @-@ Chinese were encouraged to take @-@ up Indonesian @-@ sounding names . In 1968 , Suharto commenced the very successful family @-@ planning program ( Keluarga <unk> / KB ) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increasing per @-@ capita income . A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972 . 
 Suharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security , organized by the Kopkamtib ( Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order ) and <unk> ( State Intelligence Coordination Agency ) . To maintain strict control over the country , Suharto expanded the army 's territorial system down to village @-@ level , while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the <unk> ( " Dual Function " ) of the military . By 1969 , 70 % of Indonesia 's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers . Suharto authorized Operasi Trisula which destroyed PKI @-@ remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in Blitar area in 1968 , and ordered several military operations which ended the communist <unk> @-@ <unk> insurgency in West Kalimantan ( 1967 – 1972 ) . Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement 's members to flee abroad . Notably , in March 1981 , Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by Islamic extremists at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok . 
 To comply with New York Agreement of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of West Irian into Indonesia before end of 1969 , the Suharto government begin organizing for a so @-@ called " Act of Free Choice " scheduled for July – August 1969 . The government sent RPKAD special forces under Sarwo Edhie Wibowo which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch @-@ organized militia ( <unk> <unk> Korps / <unk> ) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 , while sending Catholic volunteers under Jusuf Wanandi to distribute consumer goods to promote pro @-@ Indonesian sentiments . In March 1969 , it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channeled via 1 @,@ 025 tribal chiefs , citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population . Using the above strategy , the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia , which was duly noted by United Nations General Assembly in November 1969 . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 To stabilize the economy and to ensure long @-@ term support for the New Order , Suharto ’ s administration enlisted a group of mostly American @-@ educated Indonesian economists , dubbed the " Berkeley Mafia " , to formulate significant changes in economic policy . By cutting subsidies , decreasing government debt , and reforming the exchange rate mechanism , inflation was lowered from 660 % in 1966 to 19 % in 1969 . The threat of famine was alleviated by influx of USAID rice aid shipments in 1967 to 1968 . 
 With a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth , the New Order reversed Sukarno 's economic self @-@ sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law . Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia . The first foreign investors to re @-@ enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company . Following government regulatory frameworks , domestic entrepreneurs ( mostly Chinese @-@ Indonesians ) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import @-@ substitution light @-@ manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group . 
 From 1967 , the government secured low @-@ interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter @-@ Governmental Group on Indonesia ( <unk> ) to cover its budget deficit . With the <unk> funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the 1973 oil crisis , the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five @-@ year plans , dubbed <unk> ( <unk> Pembangunan Lima <unk> ) I to VI from 1969 to 1998 . 
 Outside the formal economy , Suharto created a network of charitable organizations ( " <unk> " ) run by the military and his family members , which extracted " donations " from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits . While some proceeds were used for charitable purposes , much of the money was re @-@ cycled as slush fund to reward political allies and to maintain support for the New Order . 
 In 1975 , the state @-@ owned oil company , Pertamina , defaulted on its foreign loans as a result of mismanagement and corruption under the leadership of Suharto ’ s close ally , Ibnu <unk> . The government bail @-@ out of the company nearly doubled the national debt . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 Upon assuming power , Suharto government adopted policy of neutrality in the Cold War , but was nevertheless quietly aligned with the Western bloc ( including Japan and South Korea ) with the objective of securing support for Indonesia 's economic recovery . Western countries , impressed by Suharto 's strong anti @-@ communist credentials , were quick to offer their support . Diplomatic relations with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in 30 September Movement ( diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990 ) . Due to Suharto 's destruction of PKI , Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia . However , from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states . Regionally , having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966 , Indonesia became a founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) in August 1967 . This organization is designed to establish peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as ongoing Vietnam War . 
 In 1974 , the neighbouring colony of Portuguese Timor descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the Carnation Revolution , whereby the left wing populist Fretilin ( Frente <unk> de Timor @-@ Leste Independente ) emerged triumphant . With approval from Western countries ( including from US president Gerald Ford and Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam during their visits to Indonesia ) , Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent establishment of a communist state . After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups UDT and APODETI , Suharto authorized full @-@ scale invasion of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia 's 27th province of East Timor in July 1976 . The " encirclement and annihilation " campaigns of 1977 – 1979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands , although continuing guerilla resistance caused the government to maintain strong military force in the half @-@ island until 1999 . An estimated minimum of 90 @,@ 800 and maximum of 213 @,@ 600 conflict @-@ related deaths occurred in East Timor during Indonesian rule ( 1974 – 1999 ) ; namely , 17 @,@ 600 – 19 @,@ 600 killings and 73 @,@ 200 to 194 @,@ 000 ' excess ' deaths from hunger and illness , although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70 % of the violent killings . 
 = = = Socio @-@ economic progress and growing corruption = = = 
 Real socio @-@ economic progress sustained support for Suharto 's regime across three decades . By 1996 , Indonesia 's poverty rate has dropped to around 11 % compared with 45 % in 1970 . From 1966 to 1997 , Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5 @.@ 03 % pa , pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US $ 806 to US $ 4 @,@ 114 . In 1966 , manufacturing sector made @-@ up less than 10 % of GDP ( mostly industries related to oil and agriculture ) . By 1997 , manufacturing had risen to 25 % of GDP whereby 53 % of exports consisted of manufactured products . The government invested into massive infrastructure development ( notably the launching of series of <unk> telecommunication satellites ) , consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid @-@ 1990s was considered at par with China . Suharto was keen to capitalize on such achievements to justify his regime , and an MPR resolution in 1983 granted him the title of " Father of Development " . 
 Suharto government 's health @-@ care programs ( such as the <unk> program ) increased life expectancy from 47 years ( 1966 ) to 67 years ( 1997 ) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60 % . The government 's <unk> program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrollment ratio reaching 90 % by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls . Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self @-@ sufficiency by 1984 , an unprecedented achievement which earns Suharto a gold medal from FAO in November 1985 . 
 In the early 1980s , Suharto government responded to fall in oil exports due to the 1980s oil glut by successfully shifting pillar of the economy into export @-@ oriented labour @-@ intensive manufacturing , made globally competitive by Indonesia 's low wages and a series of currency devaluations . Industrialization was mostly undertaken by ethnic @-@ Chinese companies which evolved into immense conglomerates dominating the nation 's economy . The largest <unk> are the Salim Group led by Liem Sioe Liong ( <unk> Salim ) , Sinar Mas Group led by <unk> Ek Tjong ( Eka <unk> Widjaja ) , Astra Group led by <unk> Han <unk> ( William <unk> ) , <unk> Group led by Lie Mo Tie ( Mochtar Riady ) , Barito Pacific Group led by Pang Djun <unk> ( <unk> Pangestu ) , and <unk> Group led by Bob Hasan . Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of Chinese @-@ Indonesian conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic @-@ minority status , but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country . In exchange for Suharto 's patronage , the conglomerates provided vital financing for his " regime maintenance " activities . 
 In the late 1980s , Suharto government decided to de @-@ regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth . Suharto decreed the " October Package of 1988 " ( <unk> 88 ) which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit ; resulting in a 50 % increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991 . To promote savings , the government introduced the <unk> program to the populace . Jakarta Stock Exchange , re @-@ opened in 1977 , recorded bull @-@ run due to spree of domestic IPOs and influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990 . The sudden availability of credit fueled strong economic growth in the early 1990s , but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto 's regime . 
 The growth of the economy is coincided by rapid expansion in corruption , collusion , and nepotism ( <unk> , <unk> , dan <unk> / <unk> ) . In the early 1980s , Suharto 's children , particularly Siti <unk> <unk> ( " Tutut " ) , <unk> Mandala Putra ( " Tommy " ) , and Bambang <unk> , had grown into greedy adults . Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies . Examples include the toll @-@ expressway market which was monopolized by Tutut , national car project monopolized by Bambang and Tommy , and even the cinema market monopolized by 21 Cineplex owned by Suharto 's cousin <unk> . The family is said to control about 36 @,@ 000 km ² of real estate in Indonesia , including 100 @,@ 000 m ² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40 % of the land in East Timor . Additionally , Suharto 's family members received free shares in 1 @,@ 251 of Indonesia 's most lucrative domestic companies ( mostly run by Suharto 's ethnic @-@ Chinese cronies ) , while foreign @-@ owned companies were encouraged to establish " strategic partnerships " with Suharto family 's companies . Meanwhile , the myriad of <unk> run by Suharto family grew even larger , levying millions of dollars in " donations " from the public and private sectors each year . 
 In early 2004 , the German anti @-@ corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believes to be the ten most self @-@ enriching leaders in the past two decades ; in order of amount allegedly stolen USD , the highest ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $ 15 billion – $ 35 billion . 
 = = = The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 By the 1980s , Suharto 's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society , engineered elections , and use of the military 's coercive powers . Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976 , Suharto undertook a re @-@ organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president . In March 1983 , he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration . As a Roman Catholic , he was not a political threat to Suharto . 
 From 1983 to 1985 , army squads killed up to 10 @,@ 000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate ( see " Petrus Killings " ) . Suharto 's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions . The Tanjung Priok massacre saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984 . A retaliatory series of small bombings , including the bombing of Borobudur , led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists , including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and Abu Bakar Bashir ( later leader of Jemaah Islamiyah ) . Attacks on police by a resurgent Free Aceh Movement in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2 @,@ 000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992 . In 1984 , the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license ( <unk> ) which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information . 
 Western concern over communism waned with end of Cold War , and Suharto 's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny , particularly following the 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre in East Timor . Suharto was elected as head of the Non @-@ Aligned Movement in 1992 , while Indonesia became a founding member of APEC in 1989 and host to the Bogor APEC Summit in 1994 . 
 Domestically , the business dealings of Suharto 's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent @-@ seeking opportunities . The March 1988 MPR session , military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of <unk> , a Suharto @-@ loyalist , as vice @-@ president . Moerdani ’ s criticism of the Suharto family 's corruption saw the President dismiss him from the position of military chief . Suharto proceeded to slowly " de @-@ <unk> " his regime ; he dissolved the powerful Kopkamtib in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists . 
 In an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military , Suharto begin courting support from Islamic elements . He undertook a much @-@ publicised hajj pilgrimage in 1991 , took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto , and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic @-@ oriented generals . To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese @-@ Indonesian conglomerates , Suharto formed the <unk> ( Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals ' Association ) in November 1990 , which was led by his protégé BJ Habibie , the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978 . During this period , race riots against ethnic @-@ Chinese begin to occur quite regularly , beginning with April 1994 riot in Medan . 
 By the 1990s , Suharto 's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as Habibie , Harmoko , <unk> Kartasasmita , and Akbar Tanjung , who owed their position solely to Suharto . As sign of Habibie 's growing clout , when several prominent Indonesian magazines criticised Habibie 's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 ( most of the vessels were of scrap @-@ value ) , Suharto ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994 . 
 In the 1990s , elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto 's economic development , were becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children , fueling demands for " Reformasi " ( reform ) of the almost 30 @-@ year @-@ old New Order government . By 1996 , Megawati Sukarnoputri , the daughter of Sukarno and chairwoman of the normally compliant PDI , was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent . In response , Suharto backed a co @-@ opted faction of PDI led by <unk> , which removed Megawati from the chair . On 27 July 1996 , an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting . This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists , 23 of whom were kidnapped , and some killed , by army squads led by Suharto 's son @-@ in @-@ law , Major @-@ General Prabowo <unk> . 
 = = = Economic crisis and resignation = = = 
 Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997 – 98 . From mid @-@ 1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar . Due to poor bank lending practices , many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah . The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies , causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop from a pre @-@ crisis level of Rp . 2 @,@ 600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp . 17 @,@ 000 . Consequently , many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13 @.@ 7 % leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country . Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country 's dollar reserves . In exchange for US $ 43 billion in liquidity aid , between October 1997 and the following April , Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for an economic reform process . In January 1998 , the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance ( <unk> ) , issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits , and set @-@ up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system . Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation , the government raised interest rate up to 70 % pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy . 
 In December 1997 , Suharto for the first time did not attend an ASEAN presidents ' summit , which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke , creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency . In mid @-@ December , as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $ 150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country , he appeared at a press conference to re @-@ assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah . However , his attempts to re @-@ instill confidence had little effect . Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process , further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership . 
 The economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension . Anti @-@ Chinese riots occurred in <unk> ( 1996 ) , Tasikmalaya ( 1996 ) , Banjarmasin ( 1997 ) , and Makassar ( 1997 ) ; while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and <unk> settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997 . Golkar won the rigged 1997 MPR elections and in March 1998 , Suharto was voted unanimously to another five @-@ year term . He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice @-@ president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates ( his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs ) . The appointments and the government 's <unk> 1998 budget created further currency instability , and rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices . The Government 's May 1998 increase in fuel prices by 70 % triggered riots in Medan . 
 With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country 's mounting economic and political crises , prominent political figures , including Muslim politician <unk> Rais , spoke out against his presidency , and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations . The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998 , when security forces killed four demonstrators from Jakarta 's Trisakti University . Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1 @,@ 000 people . Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence . Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General Wiranto and Prabowo , and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic @-@ Chinese and discredit the student movement . 
 On 16 May , tens of thousands of university students demanding Suharto ’ s resignation , occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building . Upon Suharto 's return to Jakarta , he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet . These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet . According to Wiranto , on 18 May , Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security ; however , Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population . On 21 May 1998 , Suharto announced his resignation , upon which vice @-@ president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution . 
 = = Post @-@ presidency = = 
 After resigning from the presidency , Suharto <unk> himself in his family compound in the Menteng area of Jakarta , protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances . Suharto 's family spend much of their time fending @-@ off corruption investigations . However , Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president , as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney @-@ general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999 . 
 In May 1999 , Time Asia estimated Suharto 's family fortune at US $ 15 billion in cash , shares , corporate assets , real estate , jewelry and fine art . Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than $ US 27 billion in damages for libel over the article . On 10 September 2007 , Indonesia 's Supreme Court awarded Suharto damages against Time Asia magazine , ordering it to pay him one trillion rupiah ( $ 128 @.@ 59 million ) . The High Court reversed the judgment of an appellate court and Central Jakarta district court ( made in 2000 and 2001 ) . 
 Suharto was placed highest on Transparency International 's list of corrupt leaders with an alleged misappropriation of between US $ 15 – 35 billion during his 32 @-@ year presidency . 
 On 29 May 2000 , Suharto was placed under house arrest when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency . In July 2000 , it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US $ 571 million of government donations to one of a number of foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments . But in September court @-@ appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health . State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease . On 26 March 2008 , a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation , Supersemar , to pay US $ 110 m ( £ 55 m ) . 
 In 2002 , Suharto 's son Tommy , was sentenced to 15 years ' jail . He had been convicted of ordering the killing of a judge who had sentenced him to 18 months jail for corruption and illegal weapons possession . In 2006 , he was freed on " conditional release . " 
 In 2003 , Suharto 's half @-@ brother <unk> was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $ 10 million from the Indonesian state . He was sentenced to four years in jail . He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years , initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the " judicial mafia " which uncovered offers of $ 600 @,@ 000 to various judges . <unk> confessed to the scheme in October 2005 , leading to the arrest of his lawyers . His full four @-@ year term was reinstated . After a brief standoff at a hospital , in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers , he was arrested on 30 November 2005 . 
 On 9 July 2007 , Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto , to recover state funds ( $ 440 m or £ 219 m , which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund , and a further $ 1 @.@ 1 billion in damages ) . 
 = = = Health crises = = = 
 After resigning from the presidency , Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for stroke , heart , and intestinal problems . His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial . Moreover , there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him . In 2006 , Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto 's health and fitness for trial . One physician , Brigadier @-@ General Dr <unk> <unk> , stated his doubts about by noting that " [ Suharto ] has two permanent cerebral defects . " In a later Financial Times report , Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re @-@ examination , and called it part of a " last opportunity " to prosecute Suharto criminally . Attorney General Abdurrahman left open the possibility of filing suit against the Suharto estate . " 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 4 January 2008 , Suharto was taken to the Pertamina hospital , Jakarta with complications arising from a weak heart , swelling of limbs and stomach , and partial renal failure . His health fluctuated for several weeks but progressively worsened with anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart and kidney complications , internal bleeding , fluid on his lungs , and blood in his faeces and urine which caused a haemoglobin drop . On 23 January , Suharto 's health worsened further , as a sepsis infection spread through his body . His family consented to the removal of life support machines , and he died on 27 January at 1 : 10 pm 
 Suharto 's body was taken from Jakarta to the Giri <unk> mausoleum complex near the Central Java city of Solo . He was buried alongside his late wife in a state military funeral with full honours , with the Kopassus elite forces and KOSTRAD commandos as the honour guard and pallbearers and Commander of Group II Kopassus Surakarta Lt. Colonel <unk> <unk> . In attendance were the incumbent president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as " Ceremony Inspector " , and vice @-@ president , government ministers , and armed forces chiefs of staff . Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to see the convoy .

 = The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ( video game ) = 
 The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King is a 2003 action / hack and slash video game developed by EA Redwood Shores for the PlayStation 2 and Windows . It was ported to the GameCube and Xbox by Hypnos Entertainment , to the Game Boy Advance by Griptonite Games , to mobile by <unk> , and to OS X by Beenox . The game was published by Electronic Arts . It is a sequel to the 2002 game The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers . 
 The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson 's 2002 film The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers and his 2003 film The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , which was released shortly after the game . As it is not an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien 's 1954 novel , The Return of the King , the third volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy , anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could not be represented in the game . This is because , at the time , Vivendi Universal Games , in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises , held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien 's literary works , whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films . 
 The game is similar to its predecessor in basic gameplay , but differs by adding multiple storylines , more playable characters and increased interaction with environments . A two @-@ player co @-@ op mode is also available for some missions . As with The Two Towers , The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers , using many of the actual reference photos , drawings , models , props and other assets from the film . The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics , audio , and gameplay , although its camera positioning and short length were criticized . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Described by the developers as a modern version of Gauntlet , The Return of the King is a hack and slash action game played from a third @-@ person perspective . The game is very similar to its predecessor in basic gameplay . Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage and can be easily blocked , and a fierce attack , which does more damage , but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack . Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields . Each character also has a ranged attack , a " killing move " ( which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies ) , a parry ( which can deflect enemy attacks ) , a knock back ( which pushes nearby enemies away ) , a jump back ( in which the player character jumps back away from the enemy ) , a devastating attack ( a charged fierce attack ) and a special ability . Playable characters in the console and PC versions are Gandalf , Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli , Frodo and Sam , with Faramir , Pippin and Merry available as unlockable characters . Playable characters in the GBA version are Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli , Frodo , Gandalf , and Éowyn , with Gollum and Sam available as unlockable characters . 
 Each playable character has their own set of combos and attributes . After the end of each level the player can upgrade their characters ' abilities and combos using experience points . The number of points available to the player depends on the efficiency of their kills . During each level , the player will be continually graded on the skill with which they dispatch enemies ; " Fair " , " Good " , " Excellent " and " Perfect . " The more skill with which the player kills , the more experience they acquire . The player 's skill is measured by an on @-@ screen meter which increases as the player dispatches enemies . To avoid the meter dropping back down , the player must avoid being hit , and kill enemies using a variety of different methods . When a player reaches a Perfect level , all of their attacks increase in strength , and the experience from each kill is doubled . However , Perfect status only lasts for a brief period of time . A new aspect of Return of the King is that at the end of each level , rather than purchasing upgrades for the individual character , the player can also purchase " Fellowship " upgrades which apply to every playable character . However , characters will only be able to avail of a particular skill when they have reached the corresponding experience level . 
 A major change from The Two Towers is the interactive nature of the game environments . The player can operate machinery , for example bridges and catapults , to complete objectives , and use environmental objects as weapons , such as spears and cauldrons , to kill enemies . The levels are also twice the size of the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear . Unlike The Two Towers , The Return of the King features a co @-@ op mode , allowing two players to play through the game together . The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode , with USB headset support , although this was removed from the European version of the game . 
 The Game Boy Advance version is more of a hack and slash RPG , and is played from an isometric three @-@ quarter top @-@ down view . A major gameplay difference in this version is the addition of " runes " which players can etch into their weapons , granting them special abilities . The game also features co @-@ op multiplayer through the Game Boy link function , and unlockable content when connected to the GameCube version via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Todd Arnold , senior producer of The Return of the King , stated that the game was not intended to re @-@ tell the story of the film , but to allow the player to come as close as possible to experiencing the critical parts of the film for themselves . Levels were designed with this goal in mind , with just enough plot to give context to the player 's actions . Liberties were thus taken with the plot , and critics noted there was little footage which could spoil the film for those who had not seen it . GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin said " if you didn 't know anything about the story of The Return of the King , then the story of the game may be hard to follow , though you 'll still get the gist of it . " However , he also advised , " in case you don 't want any aspect of the movie spoiled for you , it 'd be wise to hold off on playing The Return of the King until after you 've seen the movie . " 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The game begins during the Battle of the <unk> at Helm 's Deep , with the Uruk @-@ hai having just penetrated the outer walls . With the defenders falling back to the inner court , Gandalf ( voiced by Ian McKellen ) appears on a hill @-@ top flanked by thousands of Rohirrim . The player takes control of Gandalf as he enters the battle and helps defeat the Uruk @-@ hai and orc army . After this level , the game splits into three separate mission arcs , each with its own individual set of characters . The " Path of the Wizard " follows Gandalf , the " Path of the King " follows Aragorn ( Viggo Mortensen ) , Legolas ( Orlando Bloom ) and Gimli ( John Rhys @-@ Davies ) , and the " Path of the Hobbits " follows Frodo ( Elijah Wood ) and Sam ( Sean Astin ) , although initially only Sam is playable . 
 The Path of the Wizard continues immediately after the events of the first level . The remains of the Uruk @-@ hai and orc army flee into Fangorn Forest . However , within the forest , the Ents , led by Treebeard , have awoken and joined the fight against Sauron . Gandalf helps the <unk> as they destroy the rest of the army , and then assists them in bringing down a dam holding back the River <unk> . This floods Isengard , trapping Saruman ( Christopher Lee ) , who had joined forces with Sauron , in his tower , Orthanc . Gandalf and Pippin ( Billy Boyd ) then head to Minas Tirith , capital of Gondor , leaving Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli and the Rohirrim to follow them . Gandalf has gone ahead of the others because Sauron mistakenly believes that Pippin has the Ring , and Gandalf plans to use this confusion to distract Sauron as Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum ( Andy Serkis ) towards Mount Doom to destroy the Ring . In Minas Tirth , Gandalf helps repulse the enemies from the walls for a time , but eventually , they break through the city 's defenses . Gandalf and the soldiers of Minas Tirith then retreat to a courtyard , where they must defend the fleeing civilians from the enemy . Once the people are safely inside , Gandalf can do little but await the arrival of Aragorn . 
 The Path of the King picks up with Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli and the Rohirrim on the way to Minas Tirith . Before arriving , however , the three companions must walk the Paths of the Dead in an effort to convince the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring . To do so , they must defeat the King of the Dead ( <unk> Monroe ) in combat . After this , the Paths of the Dead start to collapse , and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them . With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them , they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields . Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith , they face orcs , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . They must also defend Merry ( Dominic Monaghan ) and Éowyn ( Lorri Holt ) , allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch @-@ king of Angmar . As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed , the Army of Dead arrive , destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith . 
 The Path of the Wizard and Path of the King share the same final level , set at the Black Gate of Mordor . In a further effort to distract Sauron from the approach of Frodo and Sam , Gandalf advises that Aragorn and the remaining army marches to the Gates of Mordor as a direct challenge to Sauron , who will send out a vast army to meet them , thus keeping his attention away from Mount Doom . Upon arriving at the Gate , the party are confronted by the Mouth of Sauron ( Roger L. Jackson ) , who tells them that Frodo is dead . They kill him and must then face a massive army of orcs , before fighting the remaining Nazgûl . Not believing Frodo to be dead , they plan to fight as long as they can , ultimately sacrificing themselves so as to give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring . 
 In The Path of the Hobbits , Frodo , Sam and Gollum must first escape from Osgiliath , fighting past orcs to get to the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl . However , upon escaping , Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself . He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam , but Sam follows them into Shelob 's lair . In the lair , Gollum abandons Frodo , and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs , eventually facing Shelob herself , who has attacked Frodo . Sam defeats Shelob , but upon reaching Frodo , he mistakenly believes him to be dead . About to go to Mount Doom on his own , he hides as a group of orcs arrive , and hears them say that Frodo is alive , but unconscious . They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol . As Sam is about to enter the Tower , the orcs begin fighting among themselves , and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo . Together , they head to Mount Doom . However , before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below , he is attacked by Gollum , who takes the Ring . In the final level , the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum on the edge of the precipice . Frodo successfully defeats Gollum , knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever .

 Following the success of the video game tie @-@ in of The Two Towers film , an adaptation of The Return of the King was announced on April 25 , 2003 . While The Two Towers was released on the three major consoles ( PlayStation 2 , GameCube and Xbox ) and the Game Boy Advance , The Return of the King was also set for release on PC . Executive producer Neil Young revealed playable characters would include Gandalf , Aragorn , Legolas , Gimli , Frodo , Sam and two to four unlockable characters . He also stated the characters ' fighting styles would be much more differentiated from one another than they had been in Two Towers , and he explained the game would offer three separate story branches rather than one , but the player would be unable to complete the game or get to the final level by playing through only one branch . Young stated " there are certain gates that prevent the player from progressing that might break the fiction , but that motivates them to essentially bring a party of characters through the game to its conclusion . " 
 EA debuted the game at the 2003 E3 event in May , announcing that compared to Two Towers , Return of the King had more playable characters , larger and less linear levels , multiple narrative paths , bigger and more intelligent bosses , interactive environments , and a co @-@ op mode . Footage from the films and parts of Howard Shore 's score would feature , and members of the film 's cast would lend their voices and likenesses to the game . On May 15 , a playable demo was made available for the PS2 , featuring the first Minas Tirith level along with a non @-@ playable demo of the co @-@ op gameplay in a customized level specifically designed for E3 . EA also revealed they were working on having Gollum as a playable character , although this ultimately did not happen , except in the GBA version . 
 The developers called The Return of the King " bigger and better " than The Two Towers . " In The Two Towers the player would occasionally run into 10 or 15 enemies , " said lead game designer Chris <unk> , " in The Return of the King there are areas where the player faces up to 40 orcs [ ... ] Fans familiar with The Two Towers will find that the combat experience in The Return of the King feels familiar but much deeper . " Before creating levels , the developers would initially look at the script and determine what parts from the film to highlight in that particular level , and how to structure that event as a mission . They would then write in @-@ depth level designs out on paper , going into details such as combat setup , special props and enemy types , all the while using the film as their main reference point . They would then create an animatic of the level , working out problems and fine @-@ tuning design concepts . The levels would then be created in the game environment . The game is also graphically improved over The Two Towers . According to Neil Young , " we 've developed some new lighting techniques to allow the characters to look richer . We are pushing 2x the number of <unk> & 2x the texture density [ ... ] we also stream our geometry and textures from the disc so the game has a much higher density of imagery . " Enemy AI was improved , and developers also spent a lot of time working on the sound of the game , which was THX certified . 
 Producer Glen Schofield stated the biggest challenge the developers were facing was " just trying to match the breathtaking look and feel of the movies " . Similarly , Neil Young said " We wanted to make something that 's authentic and true to the movie . The people on our team really care about making a game that aspires to more than just a sequel , they want to make this equivalent to the movie experience itself . " EA Redwood Shores worked closely with New Line Cinema to make the games as authentic as possible , using the actual reference photos , drawings , models , props , lighting studies and motion capture data . EA 's partner relations director , Nina <unk> said 
 Both New Line and the film production company in New Zealand are integrally tied into the entire development process of the game . Right from the conceptual stage down to the final production builds , their input is sought and listened to . We don 't consider New Line a licensor , but more a true partner . As soon as we have the earliest storyboards and bare bones outline for a game , New Line are right at the table with me , giving their feedback . This is also the stage at which we introduce Peter Jackson , Barrie Osborne and the rest of the film production team to the key concepts and get their feedback . From here on , I meet with the actors , the film @-@ makers and New Line on a regular basis to illicit feedback and new ideas as we move forward with the development . We are so deeply tied into the film production that we actually opened our own offices within the 3 foot 6 Weta offices in New Zealand during the pick @-@ up shooting so we could be closer to the action and the assets . 
 <unk> said that during development of the game , she travelled to New Zealand once a month with builds of the game for the filmmakers to play , and on which to give their feedback , and that in total , EA had acquired a quarter of a million different assets from the production . Schofield further pointed out " we even hired the same stunt doubles from the movie to help us render the most realistic movements in the game . " <unk> also said " we want the game to not just look like the films but to be exactly like the films . " She commented that no details in the game were made up ; " when we were reproducing Minas Tirith [ ... ] we felt the team would benefit from being able to see and feel a piece of the actual movie set . Unfortunately , the set had already been dismantled . So , while in New Zealand , I searched the various warehouses to find remnants of the dismantled set . After much work , I returned to San Francisco proudly bearing four bricks from the Minas Tirith set . "

 The Return of the King received " generally favorably reviews " across all systems ; the Game Boy Advance version holds an aggregate score of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on thirteen reviews ; the GameCube version 84 out of 100 , based on twenty @-@ three reviews ; the PC version 78 out of 100 , based on eighteen reviews ; the PlayStation 2 version 85 out of 100 , based on thirty @-@ one reviews ; and the Xbox version 84 out of 100 , based on thirty @-@ one reviews . 
 As an adaptation , the game was praised by GameZone 's Michael Knutson as " the best movie to game conversion that has come out in a long time " and by GameSpy 's Raymond Padilla as setting " a new standard for video game adaptations of movies . " 
 The graphics and THX @-@ certified audio were lauded by critics . The game 's animations , scenery , player models , cutscenes , music and voice acting were particularly well received . " Sound effects used in the game will also blow you away , " Knutson said , " Everything from the explosions , swords clashing , hundreds of incoming enemies storming your way , all sounds like it came directly from the movie ! " GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin noted that " Frame rate issues do affect each version of the game , to varying degrees , and none of the character models for the main characters look all that remarkable , " but conceded that " all other aspects of The Return of the King 's graphics are outstanding [ ... ] The game 's audio is even more effective than the graphics at conveying the intensity of the action . " Ian McKellen 's narration of the game as Gandalf was also praised . 
 The game 's combat was praised by most critics . Electronic Gaming Monthly 's Crispin Boyer described the game as " a thrill ride . And not just ' cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year 's equally slick Two Towers prequel . Many of Return of the King 's levels actually force you to <unk> while you hack and slash . " PC Gamer UK 's Tony Ellis wrote " combat in <unk> is superbly satisfying . Your blows connect with a solid , visceral thud you can almost feel . " He also noted the variation between levels . Eurogamer 's Kristan Reed praised the " subtleties of the combat . " In contrast , Game Informer 's Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be " repetitious " , writing " sometimes I got the feeling that I was working harder only to have less fun than in Two Towers . " The co @-@ op mode was also praised . 
 The Return of the King was criticized for its poor camera placement . " What 's the use of a new graphics engine and character models when the view is from so far away ? " asked Kato . Reed complained about " camera switches which reverse the controls , or worse , completely obscure your viewpoint . On just about every mission the camera switching confuses the hell out of you . " The game 's save function was also criticized . Ellis commented that " You can only save after completing a level [ ... ] which is not so good when you 're forced to slog through the same sequences over and over again . " Critics also complained about the unskippable cut scenes , occasionally unclear objectives and relatively short length . 
 The GBA version also received good reviews . GameZone 's Steve Hopper found it very similar to the GBA version of Two Towers , but wrote " all in all this is solid action game that I can wholeheartedly recommend for gamers who loved The Two Towers and want more of the same brand of hack and slash action . " IGN 's Craig Harris wrote " the enhancements to the gameplay definitely enhance an already solid action game , and it 's also a very recommended two player experience as well . The Return of the King is a nice compliment to a great film , and a decent follow @-@ up to an already enjoyable action title on the handheld . " GameSpot 's Frank Provo called it " more satisfying and ultimately more playable " than Two Towers , and praised the differentiation between the characters , the graphics and the experience system . GameSpy 's Matt <unk> was less impressed , criticizing the game 's " technical flaws , " especially its collision detection . He called it a " repetitive beat- ' em @-@ up that require [ s ] dozens of hours of devotion to unlock every last item , level , and character . "

 " Cripples , Bastards , and Broken Things " is the fourth episode of the HBO medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones , which first aired on May 8 , 2011 . It was written by Bryan Cogman and directed by Brian Kirk . In this episode Lord Eddard Stark , the new Hand of the King , investigates the sudden death of his predecessor . Jon Snow , Eddard 's bastard son , defends a new recruit who has just joined the rangers at " the Wall . " Exiled prince Viserys becomes increasingly frustrated as the Dothraki horde he needs to invade Westeros and win back his crown continues to linger at Vaes Dothrak . The episode ends with Eddard 's wife Catelyn arresting Tyrion Lannister on suspicion of attempting to murder her son Bran . 
 The title comes from the original book , spoken by Tyrion after he provides Bran Stark with a saddle design that will allow him to ride despite his paraplegia : " I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things . " While the episode is more exposition @-@ heavy than previous episodes , its viewership increased slightly over the third episode , and it was well received by critics . The scenes at the Wall were highlighted by multiple critics as particularly compelling and accessible .

 Lord Eddard Stark begins quietly inquiring into the death of Jon Arryn , the previous Hand of the King , who had long served as the Kingdom 's chief administrative nobleman . Questioning Grand Maester Pycelle ( Julian Glover ) , who tended Jon Arryn in his final days , Stark learns that Arryn 's last words were " the seed is strong " and that he was reading a book titled The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms . 
 Helped by Petyr " Littlefinger " Baelish ( Aidan Gillen ) and his net of informers , Eddard follows up on two more clues regarding the last days of his predecessor . He questions a smith 's apprentice whom Jon Arryn had visited in his last days and , due to his resemblance to King Robert , Stark deduces that the boy is the king 's bastard . Eddard also plans to question Jon Arryn 's former squire , but the recently knighted young man is killed while jousting at the tournament held in Eddard 's honor . The knight responsible for his untimely end is Ser Gregor Clegane ( Conan Stevens ) , also known as " the Mountain " due to his towering size . He is a Lannister bannerman and is the older brother of " the Hound " Sandor Clegane . Baelish tells Sansa the secret of the Clegane brothers : as children , Gregor brutally burned his brother 's face , thus explaining the Hound 's scars .

 " Cripples , Bastards , and Broken Things " is the first episode of the series that was not written by the show 's creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss . The script was authored by writer Bryan Cogman , based on George R. R. Martin 's original work . 
 Cogman worked on the Game of Thrones 's pilot as a writing assistant and was contracted for the full series as script @-@ editor and the unofficial " keeper of the mythos " for the show , entrusted with the task of writing the series bible outlining character and background information , and making sure that the world @-@ building remained consistent . In this capacity , he was approached by Benioff and Weiss , who asked him to write a treatment for the fourth episode . Believing it was only an exercise that would be completely rewritten by another professional writer , he completed the script that ended up being episode four . 
 The chapters of the book covered in this episode are Bran IV ( less the first few pages that were included in the previous episode ) , Eddard V , Jon IV , Eddard VI , Catelyn V , Sansa II , Daenerys IV ( chapters 25 – 30 and 37 ) . Among the scenes created for the show , there are the conversations between Theon and Tyrion , Sansa and Septa <unk> , Doreah and Viserys , Jory Cassel and Jaime , Jon and Samwell and Eddard Stark and Cersei . The character of Alliser Thorne is given some more depth by justifying his harshness towards the new recruits , and a more subdued version of Bran 's dream is included . 
 During the bathtub scene in which Viserys recalls the old Targaryen dragons , he lists names taken from the books ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) and others invented for the show . Among them a dragon called Vermithrax is mentioned , which is an homage to Vermithrax <unk> from the 1981 film Dragonslayer . Author George R. R. Martin once ranked the film the fifth best fantasy movie of all time , and called Vermithrax " the best dragon ever put on film , " and the one with " the coolest dragon name as well . "

The scene used in the auditions belonged to " Cripples , Bastards , and Broken Things , " with Sam explaining to Jon how his father forced him to take the black . According to author and executive producer George R. R. Martin , Bradley delivered " a heartbreaking performance . " 
 Australian actor Conan Stevens , whose official website lists his height as 214 cm ( 7 ' 1 / 4 " ) , first appears as the gigantic knight Gregor Clegane , known as " the Mountain . " Stevens had sought to join the production since HBO started developing Game of Thrones . Since the character of Gregor Clegane , the role he believed he was most fitted for , did not appear in the pilot , he auditioned for the role of Khal Drogo instead in the hopes of getting noticed by the casting team . Although that role went to Jason Momoa , Stevens was chosen for the part of Gregor . 
 Other recurring roles making their first appearance in the episode include Dominic Carter as commander of the City Watch Janos <unk> , Jerome Flynn as the mercenary ( " <unk> " ) Bronn , and Joe Dempsie as the smith 's apprentice Gendry .

 Out of the different storylines , many critics singled out the scenes on the Wall as the best . Myles McNutt from Cultural Learnings wrote that " Jon Snow ’ s time at the Wall is maybe my favorite central location of those introduced early in the series , and it is in large part due to the work done in this episode , " and Maureen Ryan stated that " they 're exceptionally well acted and written . John Bradley is a great addition as Samwell Tarly , and I continue to be very impressed with Kit Harington 's quietly charismatic performance as Jon . " Besides the acting and the writing , both agreed that one of the reasons the Night 's Watch scenes worked for them is that it was easy to connect with the story of a group of raw recruits bonding under a hard @-@ nosed trainer who tries to prepare them to face great danger . 
 The closing scene was praised by HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall , highlighting Michelle Fairley 's acting as Catelyn gathers allies to arrest Tyrion . 
 = The Gathering Storm ( novel ) = 
 The Gathering Storm is the 12th book of the fantasy series The Wheel of Time . It was incomplete when its author , Robert Jordan , died on September 16 , 2007 , from cardiac amyloidosis . His widow Harriet McDougal and publisher Tom Doherty chose Brandon Sanderson to continue the book after Jordan 's death . 
 Jordan originally intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light , but when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print . The expected final book was then split into three volumes : The Gathering Storm , Towers of Midnight , and A Memory of Light . The books would be published a year apart with the first volume , The Gathering Storm , published on October 27 , 2009 ; a week earlier than originally announced . Upon its release , it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on the The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list , making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat . 
 The three books will together encompass what can be considered Jordan 's final vision of the series . In the foreword , Sanderson states that they can be thought of as " the three volumes of A Memory of Light or as the final three books of The Wheel of Time . Both are correct . " He also comments on the differing writing style , suggesting that it could be compared to different film directors directing the same script . The Gathering Storm consists of a prologue , 50 chapters , and an epilogue . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The series ' storyline has been leading up to the " Last Battle " ( <unk> Gai <unk> ) — a fight between the forces of Light and Shadow . According to prophecy in the series the primary protagonist Rand al 'Thor , as the Dragon Reborn , will " fight the [ battle ] " , and must be present for the forces of Light to have a chance at winning and stopping the being known as the Dark One , the primary antagonist , from escaping his prison . 
 The Gathering Storm follows many plot threads but focuses on two characters , Rand al 'Thor and Egwene al 'Vere . While it follows al 'Thor 's attempts to unite and rally the world 's forces for the Last Battle , it also addresses his struggle with his sanity , caused by the corruption of his mind from the use of the male half of the One Power . The unification of the White Tower , the headquarters of the female users of the One Power known as Aes Sedai , is addressed from al 'Vere 's perspective , as well as the exposure of the Black Ajah , a secretive and opposing faction within the story . While the stories of other main characters such as Perrin <unk> and Mat <unk> are briefly touched upon , they have little bearing on the main plot line . Some main characters such as Elayne <unk> and Lan <unk> do not appear at all , but are referred to .

 As Rand 's story begins , he is restoring order in the nation of Arad Doman while searching for <unk> , one of the Dark One 's favored servants known as the Forsaken . The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage , another Forsaken captured at the end of Knife of Dreams . After being freed by her allies , Semirhage is given a Domination Band , an item used to control male <unk> , and locks it around Rand 's neck . She and Black Ajah sister Elza <unk> use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover , Min <unk> . Unable to channel , he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power , a different power normally only granted by the Dark One , using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza . After this , he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless . He banishes his adviser Cadsuane <unk> for not securing the Domination Band , promising to kill her if he sees her face again . 
 Rand meets with the Seanchan , a civilization that invaded the continent earlier in the series . Their leader <unk> rejects Rand 's offer of a truce after sensing a dark aura that emanated from Rand after he channeled the True Power . Following the meeting , <unk> declares herself Empress and prepares a surprise attack against the White Tower . 
 <unk> 's hiding place is traced to a remote palace . Confirming her presence , Rand uses the Choedan Kal , a powerful magical artifact , to eliminate the entire building with <unk> , a magic that wipes the target from time . This horrifies Min and <unk> al 'Meara and they turn to Cadsuane for help . Giving up on saving Arad Doman from the Seanchan and starvation , Rand returns to the city of Tear . 
 <unk> , under the instruction of Cadsuane , locates Tam al 'Thor , Rand 's father , who meets with Rand in an attempt to break his emotional isolation . Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane , nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had almost done . Rand Travels to the Seanchan @-@ held city of <unk> Dar , intending to destroy their entire army , but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is . Nearly mad with rage and grief , he Travels to the top of <unk> , the location where he killed himself in a past life . Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel , he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world . <unk> <unk> , a voice in Rand 's head from his past life , suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right . Agreeing , Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself , destroying it . Rand is finally able to laugh again .

 The second main plot thread follows Egwene al 'Vere , leader of the rebel faction of Aes Sedai . After her capture by the White Tower in the previous book , Egwene works to undermine Elaida a <unk> 's rule and mend the strife it is causing in the White Tower . She is initially granted freedom of the tower as novice , but after publicly denouncing Elaida , Elaida names her a follower of the Dark One , and orders her imprisonment . When Elaida fails to prove her accusation , Egwene is released . 
 Egwene returns to her room to find Verin <unk> , who announces that she is of the Black Ajah . Taking advantage of a loophole in the oath Verin had sworn that she could not betray them " until the hour of my death " , she fatally poisons herself , allowing her to use her last hour to reveal everything she has learned to Egwene . Verin explains that although she was forced to swear to them or face death , she used the position to research the Ajah . She gives Egwene a journal detailing the group 's structure and nearly every member before succumbing to the poison . 
 When the Seanchan attack the White Tower , its fractured state prevents an effective defense . Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene , leading a group of novices , succeeds in driving them off . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene . They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders . After awakening in the camp , she argues that they may have ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for the defeat of the Seanchan . 
 Egwene begins to expose the Black Ajah among the rebels , requiring every sister to re @-@ swear her allegiances . Fifty sisters are exposed and executed , while twenty are able to escape . Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid , the rebels prepare an immediate attack . Just before the attack is mounted , the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid , and that they would have Egwene as their leader , the <unk> Seat . The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower .

 = = = Robert Jordan , illness and death ( 2005 – 2007 ) = = = 
 Under the pen name Robert Jordan , James Oliver Rigney , Jr. began writing the intended final book , A Memory of Light , before the release of the previous book Knife of Dreams in 2005 . Scheduled for publication by Tor Books in 2009 , it was intended to conclude the series , which began in 1990 with The Eye of the World , originally intended as a series of four or five books . According to Forbes , Jordan had intended for it to be the final book " even if it reaches 2 @,@ 000 pages . " After Jordan fell fatally ill in December 2005 from a rare disease , cardiac amyloidosis , he still intended to finish at least A Memory of Light , and thus the main story arc , if the " worse comes to worst . " Later he made preparations in case he was not able to finish the book . " I 'm getting out notes , so if the worst actually happens , someone could finish A Memory of Light and have it end the way I want it to end . " Shortly before his death , Jordan made a performance of the final book in a two and a half hour session to his wife and cousin , Wilson W. Grooms , Jr . Grooms stated in a later blog post " he became the <unk> and told the bones of it ALL to Harriet and me ! " 
 The book was not completed at the time of Jordan 's death on September 16 , 2007 . His widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher , Tor Books president Tom Doherty made the decision to have the book completed posthumously , with McDougal saying , " I am sad to see the series end . But I would be far more distressed to leave it unfinished , incomplete and dangling forever . " 
 On December 11 , 2007 , four months after Jordan 's death , it was announced that McDougal had chosen Brandon Sanderson to finish the final book in the series , although the decision itself had been made the preceding month . Sanderson had been chosen partly because McDougal had read and liked his novels , and partly because of a eulogy he had written for Jordan . McDougal later expanded on her reasons , saying , " I do think [ he ] has a natural feeling for the ethical and moral issues of life . " 
 = = = Brandon Sanderson , split and The Gathering Storm ( 2007 – 2009 ) = = = 
 Brandon Sanderson was devastated by the news of Jordan 's death ; he has been a fan of the series since he was 15 years old and he cites Jordan as an inspiration . He is known for the novel <unk> and the <unk> series . He did not want to imitate Jordan 's style as he felt it would " turn into parody . " 
 In an interview with Sci Fi Wire , Sanderson stated it was a great honor to be given the chance to complete the series but conceded he was unable to fill Jordan 's shoes . Some parts of the book were nearly finished by Jordan , while others have only a couple of paragraphs to describe a twenty @-@ page scene , but he describes Jordan 's notes as " amazing . " He later elaborated that " the amount of material [ Jordan ] left behind is what makes this book possible . " Speaking to The Guardian , he stated that although some people wouldn 't like the book , and any failures would be blamed on him , " I say that I win because I get to be part of this . " Through February 2008 Sanderson reread the entire series , posting his impressions of each book on his blog . The reread lasted until March 2008 , at which point he " began to grasp the daunting nature of this book , " with so many plot lines that needed to be resolved . 
 When writing the book Sanderson was assisted by Maria Simons , Jordan 's assistant before his death and " right arm " , and Alan <unk> , the series continuity manager , together known as " Team Jordan " . Sanderson eventually dedicated the book to them , writing that " without [ them ] this book wouldn 't have been possible . " 
 Sanderson was originally working to a target of 200 @,@ 000 words , later 250 @,@ 000 words and by April 2008 up to 400 @,@ 000 words . By the end of October 2008 the 400 @,@ 000 estimate was still in effect . Sanderson later estimated the final length of A Memory of Light to be at least 750 @,@ 000 words . Information emerged on the Internet pertaining to the book , with a draft cover suggesting it was to be split into volumes . On March 30 , 2009 , Tor Books confirmed A Memory of Light was to be split into three volumes , the first of which , The Gathering Storm , would be released on November 3 , 2009 . This date was later changed to October 27 , 2009 , a week earlier than planned . 
 Although Jordan himself had promised only a single book , according to Sanderson neither Jordan 's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this . Sanderson claimed that he could not do the story and characters justice with a single volume , so a split was inevitable . The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes , rather than two , so that a reasonably sized and <unk> volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date . Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume , it would not have been able to be released before November 2011 , and likely would have been so large ( around 2 @,@ 000 pages ) that it would be unpublishable . 
 On the split , Sanderson stated that without it he would have had to " railroad the story from climax to climax " and would sacrifice aspects even of major characters , eventually deciding that " The Wheel of Time deserved better . " 
 The first volume was originally intended to be titled A Memory of Light : Gathering Clouds . The other volumes had working subtitles of Shifting Winds and <unk> Gai <unk> for the second and third installments respectively . At the point the title A Memory of Light was dropped because book stores were worried it would be confusing , Sanderson decided the subtitle Gathering Clouds was " too generic , too basic " to be used as a title on its own . McDougal decided upon The Gathering Storm based on suggestions from Doherty . Sanderson states he considers the name to be " one of the more bland Wheel of Time titles . " 
 = = = Release ( 2009 ) = = = 
 Tor published several samples of The Gathering Storm leading up to its release . The first and second chapters were released for free on September 4 and 23 . An e @-@ book of the prologue , " What the Storm Means " , was released for purchase on September 17 , 2009 . Before the release , the final titles of the last two books were also revealed to be Towers of Midnight and A Memory of Light for the 13th and 14th books respectively . Sanderson felt using the title A Memory of Light for the final book was " the best way to honor Mr. Jordan 's wishes . " 
 The Gathering Storm was released on October 27 , 2009 , with an initial print run of one million books . Sanderson supported the release with a 25 city book signing tour , with McDougal attending some events . The first event in the tour was a midnight release party in Provo , Utah with several hundred fans of the series attending . An unabridged audiobook was released , produced and read by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer , who have so far produced all the audiobooks for the series .

 The Gathering Storm , like the previous four books in the series , entered the top of The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction for the week of November 6 , 2009 ; it ended Dan Brown 's The Lost Symbol 's seven @-@ week reign . It dropped to the fourth position after one week . The book sold well in the United Kingdom ; BookScan records 13 @,@ 017 sold copies in the first week of sale . 
 Upon the release of the book the reception was positive . It was agreed that , compared to other books in the series , the pace was faster . Many subplots were resolved , something Zack Handlen writing for the AV Club found satisfying , saying that the book had " a blessed willingness to tie up loose ends , " something he felt Jordan had been unwilling to do . In a positive review , Seth Bracken of Deseret News explained that the pace is jarring but it also " creates a sense of urgency . " Reviewers noted that Sanderson 's style comes through in the novel , Handlen felt Sanderson 's prose " lacks some of the descriptive punch " compared to Jordan 's . Michael Mason @-@ D <unk> writing for the Lincoln Journal Star went on to say Sanderson 's " voice comes through in certain ways " , describing the book as the " ultimate fan fiction . " 
 In a review of the audio book , AudioFile magazine were positive , saying the narrators bring " intensity and passion " to the series . The audio book was also a finalist in AudioFile 's The <unk> 2010 awards in the sci @-@ fi and fantasy category .

 = Adore ( The Smashing Pumpkins album ) = 
 Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins , released in June 1998 by Virgin Records . After the multi @-@ platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent yearlong world tour , follow @-@ up Adore was considered " one of the most anticipated albums of 1998 " by MTV . Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems and musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin . Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize Adore as " a band falling apart " . 
 The result was a much more subdued and electronica @-@ tinged sound that Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called " a complete break with the past " . The album divided the fan base and sold only a fraction of the previous two albums . However , the album was well received by critics , and became the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music <unk> and has gained a cult following . A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on CD and vinyl in September 2014 as a part of the band 's project to reissue their back catalogue from 1991 – 2000 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Smashing Pumpkins had cemented their place as a cultural force with the multi @-@ platinum Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness . Already sensing the limits of their guitar @-@ driven hard rock sound , the band had started to branch out during the making of Mellon Collie , and , after the chart @-@ topping success of the electronic @-@ leaning " 1979 " , the band zeroed in on electronica . As the sprawling and massively successful Infinite Sadness tour wound down , Billy Corgan found himself facing many difficult issues , including musical burnout , the absence of his " best friend and musical soul mate in the band " Jimmy Chamberlin , the end of his marriage , and the death of his mother to cancer . 
 In this period , the band released two new singles on movie soundtracks — " Eye " and " The End Is the Beginning Is the End " . Both songs incorporated electronic elements , yet retained the hard rock elements of the band 's previous material ; one reviewer called the two singles " balls @-@ out , full @-@ energy chargers " and wrote off the Pumpkins ' previous remarks that the upcoming album would " rock " less . However , the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs . Corgan , James Iha , D 'arcy Wretzky , and Matt Walker spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes , and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner . Corgan , hoping to maintain the band 's progressive rock @-@ inspired experimentation , soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of folk rock and electronica that was at once " ancient " and " futuristic " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The Smashing Pumpkins started demoing in February 1997 and recorded 30 songs for the album which , at one point , looked set to be a double album . The band subsequently cut the number of tracks on the album to 14 . 
 After playing several festival dates in summer 1997 , the band began working at a variety of Chicago studios with producer Brad Wood — with whom Corgan previously had worked in the early 1990s . While Mellon Collie had mostly been recorded with the full participation of all of the band members , the band dynamics during the new sessions soon muddled as Corgan , uninspired by his bandmates , worked mostly alone . Wood , too , was leaving Corgan unsatisfied , so , after six weeks in Chicago , the band — minus Wood and Matt Walker — relocated to Los Angeles and started work at Sunset Sound , with Corgan now the de facto producer . 
 The band rented a house , and hoped that living communally would foster good relations and a happier recording environment . According to Corgan , Iha refused to live in the house and rarely visited . The recording sessions continued to be slow @-@ moving and heavily technical . In the absence of a drummer , the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation . The band also enlisted Joey Waronker , of Beck 's band , and Matt Cameron , of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam , for a few songs each . Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks , with the band giving him mostly free rein . 
 At the behest of the band 's management , Rick Rubin was brought in to produce one song , " Let Me Give the World to You " , but the song was left off the album , later to be re @-@ recorded for Machina II / The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music . With around thirty songs recorded , Corgan began to see an end , and enlisted Mellon Collie co @-@ producer Flood to help finish the recording , pull the album together , and mix the songs . 
 Art direction for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky , Billy Corgan , and Corgan 's then @-@ girlfriend and frequent collaborator Yelena Yemchuk . The artwork for the album and its singles consisted almost entirely of black @-@ and @-@ white photographs shot by Yemchuk , many of which featured model Amy Wesson . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Corgan was deliberately setting out to widen his band 's sound and message , explaining that he was not " talking to teenagers anymore . I 'm talking to everyone now . It 's a wider dialogue . I 'm talking to people who are older than me and younger than me , and our generation as well . " He said that much of the record was " an attempt to go back to what 's important at a musical core and build it outward . " He would later reflect that he was " stuck on the idea that I needed to prove I was an artist , which is the death knell of any artist " . 
 Distorted guitars and live drums , the previous hallmarks of the Pumpkins sound , took a back seat in a sonic palette that included much more synthesizers , drum programming , acoustic guitar , and piano . At least five songs on the album are driven chiefly by piano , while the track " <unk> + <unk> " contains only electronic instruments and Corgan 's vocals . 
 " Tear " was written for the Lost Highway soundtrack , but was rejected by David Lynch in favor of " Eye " . " Pug " was originally recorded as a " minor key blues death march " with drums by Matt Cameron , while the album version uses drum programming . The only song on the album to feature Cameron , " For Martha " , is a tribute to Corgan 's mother that was primarily recorded as one live take . 
 Apart from being the first album without Jimmy Chamberlin , Adore was the first album to not include writing contributions from James Iha , who was concurrently working on his solo album Let It Come Down . However , he did contribute the track " Summer " to the " Perfect " single . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 The lead @-@ up to Adore was marked by conflicting statements as to the album 's sound — Corgan initially said the band was heading in the direction of the heavy @-@ metal @-@ guitar @-@ and @-@ electronic music @-@ driven " The End is the Beginning is the End " in summer 1997 , while the band 's management reported the album would be all @-@ acoustic . In early 1998 , Corgan called the sound " arcane night music " , elaborating , " The people that say it 's acoustic will be wrong . The people that say it 's electronic will be wrong . The people that say it 's a Pumpkins record will be wrong . I will try to make something that is indescribable " . 
 Adore was released on June 1 , 1998 in most of the world , the same day the video for first single " Ava Adore " premiered . The album booklet and music video showed off the band 's new gothic look . The second single , " Perfect " , was also accompanied by a music video , which debuted on August 16 . 
 = = = An Evening with The Smashing Pumpkins = = = 
 After the marathon Infinite Sadness tour , the band embarked on a scaled @-@ back 36 @-@ date world tour entitled An Evening with The Smashing Pumpkins to support Adore . Abroad , the Pumpkins played at what had been called an " eclectic mix of interesting venues " , among them the rooftop of a <unk> record store in Paris , France , in the botanic gardens of Brussels , Belgium , at the Cannes Film Festival , and at an International Shipping Harbor in Sydney , Australia . In the United States , the Pumpkins donated 100 % of their ticket profits to local charities ( yet one stop on the tour , Minneapolis , was a free concert and underestimated the attendance of the show ) . In the end , the Pumpkins , with the help of their fans , raised over $ 2 @.@ 8 million in this manner . 
 The lineup was the most expansive yet , including former John Mellencamp and Melissa Etheridge drummer Kenny Aronoff , percussionists Dan Morris and Stephen Hodges , and David Bowie pianist Mike Garson . Violinist Lisa Germano was also set to appear , but did not ultimately appear in the touring line @-@ up . The set was mainly Adore material , with only a handful of reworked Mellon Collie songs and no songs from prior to 1995 , eliminating many of their radio hits and fan favorites , with the exception of some shows performed in South American countries like Brazil and Chile , where they played for the first time , so they included old hits like " Today " and " Disarm " . 
 In retrospect , Corgan rued the decision to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff , instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album . " That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind . I remember Kenny saying , ' I feel like I 'm tripping on LSD ' because he kept hearing things that were not in time , and it drove him crazy , " said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes . Performing with Garson was also challenging because , according to Corgan , " he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling , so he literally cannot play the same thing twice . So we 'd have gigs where he 'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he 'd come and play the extreme opposite style - like <unk> . I really respect Mike , but to play with him was always challenging ; precisely because he is such a supreme musician . " 
 = = Reception and aftermath = = 
 Critical reception to Adore was generally positive . Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine regarded Adore as " the most intimate album the Pumpkins have ever made and also the prettiest , a parade of swooning melodies and gentle , unfolding nocturnes . " Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media described the album as " the Pumpkins ' best offering since Siamese Dream . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Adore as " a hushed , elegiac album that sounds curiously out of time , " though he noted that the album " ultimately isn 't a brave step forward . " Adore was considered one of " an inspiring range of 25 classic alternative American albums " by The Guardian . The lyrics received particular praise from critics — Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , who in 1993 had criticized Corgan 's lyrics as " too often sound [ ing ] like sophomoric poetry " , said Corgan " took a big leap forward as a lyricist " starting with Adore . Schreiber , who criticized Mellon Collie as " lyrical rock @-@ bottom " , called Adore 's lyrics " poetic " , particularly singling out " To Sheila " . Greg Kot emphasized the " oblique , private longings , and weighty , sometimes awkward conceits " in the lyrics , while David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called them " unsettled and unsettling . " The contributions of Wretzky and Iha also received praise , with Kot noting that " Iha 's quirky guitar accents and Wretzky 's <unk> resolve [ . . . ] give Adore a warmth and camaraderie no other Pumpkins album can match . " 
 Despite this , public reception to Adore was lukewarm . Adore entered the Billboard album charts at number two with 174 @,@ 000 units of the album sold , and was certified platinum by the RIAA five weeks later , but the album soon departed the charts , leaving Adore far short of the sales figures of its predecessors . Two additional promotional singles , " <unk> " and " To Sheila " , were released to radio stations but failed to gain traction and were never released as commercial singles . As of May 2005 , Adore has sold 1 @.@ 1 million units in the U.S. , and at least three times as many copies worldwide . 
 Corgan initially blamed fans for the failure , then himself , saying that he " made the mistake of telling people it was a techno record " and that if he " would have told everyone Adore was the Pumpkins ' acoustic album we would have never had the problems that we had . " " Even the album title was misunderstood . " , Billy Corgan wrote on the band 's website that the title Adore “ was a joke that no one ever got , ” explaining that Adore was meant as a play on “ A Door , ” meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band ’ s career . By the end of 1998 , Corgan , who would later call the making of Adore " one of the most painful experiences of my life " , was already writing material for the band 's next album , and Jimmy Chamberlin was readmitted into the band . 
 " Adore was like an aging Hollywood superstar , " Corgan later told Q. " She 's 55 years old and she 's had three <unk> . She looks in the mirror one day and suddenly realises that she can 't sustain the energy anymore . That record was all about dreams dying . " In 1999 , Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 101 on his list of " The Top 136 Or So Albums Of The Nineties " .

 Cameroon ( / <unk> / ; French : Cameroun ) , officially the Republic of Cameroon ( French : République du Cameroun ) , is a country in West Africa . It is bordered by Nigeria to the west ; Chad to the northeast ; the Central African Republic to the east ; and Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , and the Republic of the Congo to the south . Cameroon 's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny , part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean . 
 Cameroon is home to more than 1738 different linguistic groups . French and English are the official languages . The country is often referred to as " Africa in miniature " for its geological and cultural diversity . Natural features include beaches , deserts , mountains , rainforests , and savannas . The highest point at almost 4 @,@ 100 metres ( 13 @,@ 500 ft ) is Mount Cameroon in the Southwest Region of the country , and the largest cities in population @-@ terms are Douala on the Wouri river , its economical capital and main seaport , Yaoundé , its political capital , and Garoua . After independence , the newly united nation joined the Commonwealth of Nations , although the vast majority of its territories had previously been a German colony and , after World War I , a French mandate . The country is well known for its native styles of music , particularly <unk> and <unk> , and for its successful national football team . 
 Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter @-@ gatherers in the southeastern rainforest . Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos <unk> ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century , and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and <unk> . Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun . 
 After World War I , the territory was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates . The Union des Populations du Cameroun ( UPC ) political party advocated independence , but was outlawed by France in the 1950s . It waged war on French and UPC militant forces until 1971 . In 1960 , the French @-@ administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President <unk> Ahidjo . The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon . The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984 . 
 Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability . This has permitted the development of agriculture , roads , railways , and large petroleum and timber industries . Nevertheless , large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty as subsistence farmers . Power lies firmly in the hands of the authoritarian president since 1982 , Paul Biya , and his Cameroon People 's Democratic Movement party . The English @-@ speaking territories of Cameroon have grown increasingly alienated from the government , and politicians from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even secession ( for example : the Southern Cameroons National Council ) of the former British @-@ governed territories . 
 = = History = = 
 The territory of present @-@ day Cameroon was first settled during the Neolithic Era . The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the Baka ( Pygmies ) . From here , Bantu migrations into eastern , southern , and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2 @,@ 000 years ago . The Sao culture arose around Lake Chad c . AD 500 and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state , the <unk> Empire . Kingdoms , <unk> , and chiefdoms arose in the west . 
 Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472 . They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp <unk> <unk> in the Wouri River and named it Rio dos <unk> ( Shrimp River ) , which became Cameroon in English . Over the following few centuries , European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples , and Christian missionaries pushed inland . 
 In the early 19th century , Modibo Adama led Fulani soldiers on a jihad in the north against non @-@ Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the Adamawa Emirate . Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population . The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Arab slave trade network . 
 The Bamum tribe have a writing system , known as Bamum script or Shu Mom . The script was given to them by Sultan Ibrahim Njoya in 1896 , and is taught in Cameroon by the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project . The German Empire claimed the territory as the colony of Kamerun in 1884 and began a steady push inland . They initiated projects to improve the colony 's infrastructure , relying on a harsh system of forced labour , which was much criticised by the other colonial powers . 
 With the defeat of Germany in World War I , Kamerun became a League of Nations mandate territory and was split into French Cameroun and British Cameroons in 1919 . France integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers , modifying the system of forced labour . 
 The British administered their territory from neighbouring Nigeria . Natives complained that this made them a neglected " colony of a colony " . Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons , ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives , who felt swamped . The League of Nations mandates were converted into United Nations <unk> in 1946 , and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun . 
 France outlawed the most radical political party , the Union des Populations du Cameroun ( UPC ) , on 13 July 1955 . This prompted a long guerrilla war and the assassination of the party 's leader , Ruben Um <unk> . In the more peaceful British Cameroons , the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria . 
 = = = Independence ( 1960 ) = = = 
 On 1 January 1960 French Cameroun gained independence from France under President <unk> Ahidjo . On 1 October 1961 , the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon . Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency , continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971 . 
 His political party , the Cameroon National Union ( <unk> ) , became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972 , the federal system of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon , headed from Yaoundé . Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism , prioritising cash crops and petroleum development . The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve , pay farmers , and finance major development projects ; however , many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them . 
 Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor , Paul Biya . However , Ahidjo remained in control of the <unk> and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning . Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government , but a failed coup d 'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor . 
 An economic crisis took effect in the mid @-@ 1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions , drought , falling petroleum prices , and years of corruption , mismanagement , and cronyism . Cameroon turned to foreign aid , cut government spending , and privatised industries . With the reintroduction of multi @-@ party politics in December 1990 , the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy , and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of <unk> . In February 2008 , Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into violent protests in 31 municipal areas . 
 In May 2014 , in the wake of the <unk> schoolgirl kidnapping , Presidents Paul Biya of Cameroon and Idriss Déby of Chad announced they are waging war on Boko Haram , and deployed troops to the Nigerian border . 
 = = Politics and government = = 
 The President of Cameroon is elected and creates policy , administers government agencies , commands the armed forces , negotiates and ratifies treaties , and declares a state of emergency . The president appoints government officials at all levels , from the prime minister ( considered the official head of government ) , to the provincial governors and divisional officers . The president is selected by popular vote every seven years . 
 The National Assembly makes legislation . The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five @-@ year terms and meet three times per year . Laws are passed on a majority vote . Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president . 
 The 1996 constitution establishes a second house of parliament , the 100 @-@ seat Senate , was established in April 2013 and is headed by a senate president who is the constitutional successor in case of untimely vacancy of the presidency . The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs , fons , and <unk> to govern at the local level and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law . 
 Cameroon 's legal system is largely based on French civil law with common law influences . Although nominally independent , the judiciary falls under the authority of the executive 's Ministry of Justice . The president appoints judges at all levels . The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals , the court of appeal , and the supreme court . The National Assembly elects the members of a nine @-@ member High Court of Justice that judges high @-@ ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security . 
 = = = Political culture = = = 
 Cameroon is viewed as rife with corruption at all levels of government . In 1997 , Cameroon established anti @-@ corruption bureaus in 29 ministries , but only 25 % became operational , and in 2012 , Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt . On 18 January 2006 , Biya initiated an anti @-@ corruption drive under the direction of the National Anti @-@ Corruption Observatory . There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon , for instance , customs , public health sector and public procurement . 
 Human rights organisations accuse police and military forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects , ethnic minorities , homosexuals , and political activists . Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities , and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the behest of the government . However , since the first decade of the 21st century , an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct . 
 President Biya 's Cameroon People 's Democratic Movement ( <unk> ) was the only legal political party until December 1990 . Numerous regional political groups have since formed . The primary opposition is the Social Democratic Front ( SDF ) , based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by John Fru Ndi . 
 Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections , which rivals contend were unfair . Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations , disrupting meetings , and arresting opposition leaders and journalists . Freedom House ranks Cameroon as " not free " in terms of political rights and civil liberties . The last parliamentary elections were held on 30 September 2013 . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Cameroon is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie . Its foreign policy closely follows that of its main ally , France ( its former colonial ruler ) . Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence , although military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government . Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich <unk> peninsula ( however , this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement ) and with Gabon 's president , El <unk> Omar Bongo , over personal rivalries . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 The constitution divides Cameroon into 10 semi @-@ autonomous regions , each under the administration of an elected Regional Council . Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor . 
 These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president , reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions , administering the civil service , keeping the peace , and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units . Governors have broad powers : they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army , gendarmes , and police . All local government officials are employees of the central government 's Ministry of Territorial Administration , from which local governments also get most of their budgets . 
 The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions ( French départements ) . These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ( <unk> ) . The divisions are further split into sub @-@ divisions ( arrondissements ) , headed by assistant divisional officers ( sous @-@ <unk> ) . The districts , administered by district heads ( chefs de district ) , are the smallest administrative units . 
 The three northernmost regions are the Far North ( Extrême Nord ) , North ( Nord ) , and Adamawa ( <unk> ) . Directly south of them are the Centre ( Centre ) and East ( Est ) . The South Province ( Sud ) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border . Cameroon 's western region is split into four smaller regions : the Littoral ( Littoral ) and Southwest ( Sud @-@ Ouest ) regions are on the coast , and the Northwest ( Nord @-@ Ouest ) and West ( Ouest ) regions are in the western <unk> . 
 = = Education and health = = 
 In 2010 , the literacy rate of Cameroon was estimated to be 71 @.@ 3 % ( male 78 @.@ 3 % and female 64 @.@ 8 % ) . Most children have access to state @-@ run schools that are cheaper than private and religious facilities . The educational system is a mixture of British and French precedents with most instruction in English or French . 
 Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa . Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes , domestic duties , early marriage , pregnancy , and sexual harassment . Although attendance rates are higher in the south , a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there , leaving northern schools chronically understaffed . 
 School attendance in Cameroon is also affected by child labor . Indeed , the U.S. Department of Labor Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor reported that 56 % of children aged 5 to 14 were working children and that almost 53 % of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school . In December 2014 , a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs mentioned Cameroon among the countries that resorted to child labor in the production of cocoa . 
 The quality of health care is generally low . In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5 @,@ 000 people , according to the World Health Organization . Due to financial cuts in the health care system , there are few professionals . Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon , emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high . Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed . Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills . Outside the major cities , facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped . 
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 54 @.@ 71 years in 2012 , among the lowest in the world . Endemic diseases include dengue fever , filariasis , leishmaniasis , malaria , meningitis , schistosomiasis , and sleeping sickness . The HIV / AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5 @.@ 4 % for those aged 15 – 49 , although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low . Breast ironing , a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon , may affect girls ' health . Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) , while not widespread , is practiced among some populations ; according to a 2013 UNICEF report , 1 % of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM . Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to Western medicine . 
 = = Geography = = 
 At 475 @,@ 442 square kilometres ( 183 @,@ 569 sq mi ) , Cameroon is the world 's 53rd @-@ largest country . It is slightly larger than the nation of Sweden and comparable in size to Papua New Guinea . The country is located in Central and West Africa on the Bight of Bonny , part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean . Cameroon lies between latitudes 1 ° and 13 ° N , and longitudes 8 ° and 17 ° E. 
 Tourist literature describes Cameroon as " Africa in miniature " because it exhibits all major climates and vegetation of the continent : coast , desert , mountains , rainforest , and savanna . The country 's neighbours are Nigeria and the Atlantic Ocean to the west ; Chad to the northeast ; the Central African Republic to the east ; and Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south . 
 Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical , climatic , and vegetative features . The coastal plain extends 15 to 150 kilometres ( 9 to 93 mi ) inland from the Gulf of Guinea and has an average elevation of 90 metres ( 295 ft ) . Exceedingly hot and humid with a short dry season , this belt is densely forested and includes some of the wettest places on earth , part of the Cross @-@ Sanaga @-@ Bioko coastal forests . 
 The South Cameroon Plateau rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 133 ft ) . Equatorial rainforest dominates this region , although its alternation between wet and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast . This area is part of the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion . 
 An irregular chain of mountains , hills , and plateaus known as the Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast — Cameroon 's highest point at 4 @,@ 095 metres ( 13 @,@ 435 ft ) — almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon 's northern border at 13 ° <unk> . This region has a mild climate , particularly on the Western High Plateau , although rainfall is high . Its soils are among Cameroon 's most fertile , especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon . Volcanism here has created crater lakes . On 21 August 1986 , one of these , Lake <unk> , belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1 @,@ 700 and 2 @,@ 000 people . This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion . 
 The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy , rugged Adamawa Plateau . This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country 's north and south . Its average elevation is 1 @,@ 100 metres ( 3 @,@ 609 ft ) , and its average temperature ranges from 22 ° C ( 71 @.@ 6 ° F ) to 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) with high rainfall between April and October peaking in July and August . The northern lowland region extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of 300 to 350 metres ( 984 to 1 @,@ 148 ft ) . Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass . This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures . 
 Cameroon has four patterns of drainage . In the south , the principal rivers are the Ntem , Nyong , Sanaga , and Wouri . These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea . The Dja and <unk> drain southeastward into the Congo River . In northern Cameroon , the Bénoué River runs north and west and empties into the Niger . The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad , which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries . 
 = = Economy and infrastructure = = 
 Cameroon 's per @-@ capita GDP ( Purchasing power parity ) was estimated as US $ 2 @,@ 300 in 2008 , one of the ten highest in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . Major export markets include France , Italy , South Korea , Spain , and the United Kingdom . Cameroon is aiming to become an emerging country by 2035 . 
 Cameroon has had a decade of strong economic performance , with GDP growing at an average of 4 % per year . During the 2004 – 2008 period , public debt was reduced from over 60 % of GDP to 10 % and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3 billion . Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States ( of which it is the dominant economy ) , the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa ( <unk> ) and the Organization for the <unk> of Business Law in Africa ( <unk> ) . Its currency is the CFA franc . 
 Unemployment was estimated at 30 % in 2001 , and about a third of the population was living below the international poverty threshold of US $ 1 @.@ 25 a day in 2009 . Since the late 1980s , Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to reduce poverty , privatise industries , and increase economic growth . The government has taken measures to encourage tourism in the country . 
 Cameroon 's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and <unk> . An estimated 70 % of the population farms , and agriculture comprised an estimated 19 @.@ 8 % of GDP in 2009 . Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools . They sell their surplus produce , and some maintain separate fields for commercial use . Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs . Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas , cocoa , oil palms , rubber , and tea . Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau , cash crops include coffee , sugar , and tobacco . Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands , and in the north , natural conditions favour crops such as cotton , groundnuts , and rice . Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices . 
 Livestock are raised throughout the country . Fishing employs 5 @,@ 000 people and provides over 100 @,@ 000 tons of seafood each year . <unk> , long a staple food for rural Cameroonians , is today a delicacy in the country 's urban centres . The commercial bushmeat trade has now surpassed deforestation as the main threat to wildlife in Cameroon . 
 The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves , estimated to cover 37 % of Cameroon 's total land area . However , large areas of the forest are difficult to reach . Logging , largely handled by foreign @-@ owned firms , provides the government US $ 60 million a year in taxes ( as of 1998 ) , and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber . Nevertheless , in practice , the industry is one of the least regulated in Cameroon . 
 Factory @-@ based industry accounted for an estimated 29 @.@ 7 % of GDP in 2009 . More than 75 % of Cameroon 's industrial strength is located in Douala and <unk> . Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources , but these are not extensively mined ( see Mining in Cameroon ) . Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986 , but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy . Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers , but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon 's energy . The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station , located at <unk> . The rest of Cameroon 's energy comes from oil @-@ powered thermal engines . Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies . 
 Transport in Cameroon is often difficult . Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities ( all of them one @-@ lane ) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather , since only 10 % of the roadways are tarred . Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers . Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders , and since 2005 , the problem has intensified in the east as the Central African Republic has further destabilised . 
 Intercity bus services run by multiple private companies connect all major cities . They are the most popular means of transportation followed by the rail service <unk> . Rail service runs from Kumba in the west to <unk> in the east and north to Ngaoundéré . International airports are located in Douala and Yaoundé , with a third under construction in <unk> . Douala is the country 's principal seaport . In the north , the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria . 
 Although press freedoms have improved since the first decade of the 21st century , the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups . Newspapers routinely self @-@ censor to avoid government reprisals . The major radio and television stations are state @-@ run and other communications , such as land @-@ based telephones and telegraphs , are largely under government control . However , cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since the first decade of the 21st century and are largely unregulated . <unk> states that " [ President ] Paul Biya is one of the longest servings heads of state in the world and as long as he remains in power , Cameroon will continue to steadily progress economically without much surprises " . 
 = = Military = = 
 The Cameroon Armed Forces , ( French : Forces armées <unk> , FAC ) as of 2015 , consists of the country 's army ( French : Armée de Terre ) , the country 's navy ( French : Marine Nationale de la République ( MNR ) , includes naval infantry ) , the Cameroonian Air Force ( French : Armée de l 'Air du Cameroun , AAC ) , Fire Fighter Corps , Rapid Intervention Brigade and the Gendarmerie . 
 Males and females that are 18 years of age up to 23 years of age and have graduated high school are eligible for military service . Those that do so are obliged 4 years of service . There is no conscription in Cameroon , but the government makes periodic calls for volunteers . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 The population total in Cameroon was 20 @,@ 030 @,@ 362 in 2011 . The life expectancy is 53 @.@ 69 years ( 52 @.@ 89 years for males and 54 @.@ 52 years for females ) . 
 Cameroon 's population is almost evenly divided between urban and rural dwellers . Population density is highest in the large urban centres , the western highlands , and the northeastern plain . Douala , Yaoundé , and Garoua are the largest cities . In contrast , the Adamawa Plateau , southeastern Bénoué depression , and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated . 
 According to the Cameroon government website , the fertility rate was 5 @.@ 0 in 2004 . 
 People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment . Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east . Although the national sex ratio is relatively even , these out @-@ migrants are primarily males , which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions . 
 Both monogamous and polygamous marriage are practiced , and the average Cameroonian family is large and extended . In the north , women tend to the home , and men herd cattle or work as farmers . In the south , women grow the family 's food , and men provide meat and grow cash crops . Like most societies , Cameroonian society is male @-@ dominated , and violence and discrimination against women is common . 
 Estimates identify anywhere from 230 to 282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon . The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into northern and southern divisions . The northern peoples are Sudanese groups , who live in the central highlands and the northern lowlands , and the Fulani , who are spread throughout northern Cameroon . A small number of <unk> Arabs live near Lake Chad . Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of Bantu and Semi @-@ Bantu languages . Bantu @-@ speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones , while speakers of Semi @-@ Bantu languages live in the Western <unk> . Some 5 @,@ 000 <unk> and Baka Pygmy peoples roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small , roadside settlements . Nigerians make up the largest group of foreign nationals . 
 = = = Refugees = = = 
 In 2007 , Cameroon hosted a total population of refugees and asylum seekers of approximately 97 @,@ 400 . Of these , 49 @,@ 300 were from the Central African Republic ( many driven west by war ) , 41 @,@ 600 from Chad , and 2 @,@ 900 from Nigeria . <unk> of Cameroonian citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005 . 
 In the first months of 2014 , thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon . 
 On 4 June 2014 , <unk> reported : 
 Almost 90 @,@ 000 people have fled to neighbouring Cameroon since December and up to 2 @,@ 000 a week , mostly women and children , are still crossing the border , the United Nations said . 
 " Women and children are arriving in Cameroon in a shocking state , after weeks , sometimes months , on the road , foraging for food , " said <unk> Cousin , executive director of the World Food Programme ( WFP ) . 
 = = = Languages = = = 
 The European languages introduced during colonialism have created a linguistic divide between the population who live in the Northwest and Southwest regions and the French @-@ speaking remainder of the country . Both English and French are official languages , although French is by far the most understood language ( more than 80 % ) . 
 German , the language of the original colonisers , has long since been displaced by French and English . Cameroonian Pidgin English is the lingua franca in the formerly British @-@ administered territories . A mixture of English , French , and Pidgin called <unk> has been gaining popularity in urban centres since the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Cameroon has a high level of religious freedom and diversity . The predominant faith is Christianity , practiced by about two @-@ thirds of the population , while Islam is a significant minority faith , adhered to by about one @-@ fifth . In addition , traditional faiths are practiced by many . Muslims are most concentrated in the north , while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions , but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country . Large cities have significant populations of both groups . Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sunnis ( including Wahhabis ) , Shias , Ahmadis , Sufis , and non @-@ denominational Muslims . 
 People from the North @-@ West and South @-@ West provinces are largely Protestant , and the French @-@ speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic . Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs , or a syncretic combination of the two . People widely believe in witchcraft , and the government outlaws such practices . Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence . The Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram has been reported as operating in North Cameroon . 
 In the northern regions , the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim , but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims , Christians , and followers of indigenous religious beliefs ( called <unk> ( " pagan " ) by the Fulani ) . The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim . Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities , in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Music and dance = = = 
 Music and dance are an integral part of Cameroonian ceremonies , festivals , social gatherings , and storytelling . Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether . The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion . Traditionally , music is transmitted orally . In a typical performance , a chorus of singers echoes a soloist . 
 Musical accompaniment may be as simple as clapping hands and stomping feet , but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers , clappers , drums and talking drums , flutes , horns , rattles , scrapers , stringed instruments , whistles , and xylophones ; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region . Some performers sing complete songs by themselves , accompanied by a <unk> instrument . 
 Popular music styles include <unk> bey of the coast , <unk> of the Bassa , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> . Nigerian music has influenced Anglophone Cameroonian performers , and Prince Nico <unk> 's highlife hit " Sweet Mother " is the top @-@ selling African record in history . 
 The two most popular styles of music are <unk> and <unk> . Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music , highlife , soul , and Congo music . Performers such as Manu Dibango , Francis <unk> , Moni <unk> , and Petit @-@ Pays popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s . <unk> originated as war music among the Ewondo . Artists such as Anne @-@ Marie <unk> developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s , and performers such as Mama <unk> and Les <unk> <unk> popularised it internationally during the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Cuisine varies by region , but a large , one @-@ course , evening meal is common throughout the country . A typical dish is based on <unk> , maize , cassava ( manioc ) , millet , plantains , potatoes , rice , or yams , often pounded into dough @-@ like <unk> . This is served with a sauce , soup , or stew made from greens , groundnuts , palm oil , or other ingredients . Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions , with chicken often reserved for special occasions . Dishes are often quite hot , spiced with salt , red pepper sauce , and Maggi .

 " Party in the U.S.A. " is a song by American singer Miley Cyrus for her first extended play ( EP ) The Time of Our Lives ( 2009 ) . It was released on August 11 , 2009 , by Hollywood Records as the lead single from the project . The song was written and produced by Dr. Luke , with additional songwriting provided by Jessie J and Claude Kelly . " Party in the U.S.A. " was originally intended for Jessie J , but after deciding it was not edgy enough for her , they passed it to Cyrus and adjusted the lyrics to fit her persona . Not completely identifying with " Party in the U.S.A. " , Cyrus chose it for The Time of Our Lives partially due to a need for tracks . The song is a pop song , while the lyrics reflect her relocating from Nashville , Tennessee , to Hollywood , California . This is one of four collaborations between Cyrus and Dr. Luke , with EP title track " The Time of Our Lives " , will.i.am 's " Fall Down " and " Wrecking Ball " following in 2013 . 
 In the United States , the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . The song was the seventh best @-@ selling digital single of 2009 in the United States .

 Soon after signing a record deal with Lava Records , aspiring English singer Jessie J commenced to work on her debut album . She collaborated with songwriters and producers Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly in her first writing session , where " Party in the U.S.A. " was conceived with the intention of being performed by Jessie J. However , she decided not to record the song , believing it was not edgy enough for her to perform . She explained , " And I remember thinking this song is amazing , but I don 't know if it 's me 110 percent , you know . You can kind of feel it . " The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke . The writing team then reworked the lyrics , intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus ' joint clothing line with Max Azria , exclusively sold in Wal @-@ Mart stores . In order to please audiences , Dr. Luke , Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun , upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus ' personality . " They feel they 're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist " , Kelly said of the song 's fans . To write his contributions to the song , Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus ' songwriting : " It ’ s the same song from a different point of view , you just have to find that unique perspective . " To record the song 's instrumentation , they decided to mingle computerized sound with " the warmth of live instrumentation " , using live electric guitars and drums . Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives . This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus . Dr. Luke would later co @-@ produce Cyrus ' 2013 smash hit single " Wrecking Ball " . 
 Cyrus has stated " Party in the U.S.A. " is not a reflection of her musically , as she preferred songs with more of an edge .

However , she did state she enjoyed Britney Spears ' music , also mentioned in the song . " Party in the U.S.A. " was chosen as the lead single from The Time of Our Lives , as Cyrus thought personnel were " picking up on it " , although she did not expect for it to be commercially successful .

 Cyrus contacted Chris Applebaum to direct the accompanying music video for " Party in the U.S.A. " , with ideologies for the video already conceived . Her ideas for the video 's theme were about " high @-@ gloss , glamorous white trash . " She told Applebaum she desired to pay tribute to one of her favorite films , Grease ( 1978 ) , and her parents ' courting days . Video conception sprang forward with the idea to resemble the scene in Grease where John Travolta sings " Sandy " . In the scene , Travolta exits from a car and walks over to a jungle gym , where he sits on a swing and performs the song as projections are displayed in the background . To render homage to her parents ' courting days , Cyrus and Applebaum named a drive @-@ in theater in the video Corral Drive @-@ In after a Kentucky drive @-@ in where Cyrus ' parents had a date . " In addition , Miley 's mom Tish used to drive ' 79 black Pontiac Trans Am , Smokey and the Bandit ( 1977 ) style , and obviously that 's the car that Miley arrives in " , Applebaum said . 
 The video commences by showing a drive @-@ in theater in the day . Cyrus later arrives in a black 1979 Pontiac Trans Am , clothed by a black tank top , distressed hot pants , cowboy boots and a black vest . Cyrus and several female extras make their way to a blue pick @-@ up truck , where Cyrus sings using a digital microphone and the extras accompany her . In the song 's second verse , Cyrus lies against a wall depicting the drive @-@ in 's name , " Corral Drive @-@ In " . Then , an American flag unravels before a single wall in a vacant landscape , where she performs as sparkled confetti drops from above . Later , she , standing on a swing in the center , and numerous backup dancers appear in a jungle gym during the evening . For the song 's last refrain , Cyrus performs with four backup dancers on a stage , where the background portrays the American flag and letters above it that spell " USA " . Cut @-@ scenes feature people entering the drive @-@ in theater , Cyrus walking throughout the drive @-@ in alone , or her and the backup dancers performing in the jungle gym . The video ends with Cyrus flipping her hair in the stage setting . 
 A 90 @-@ second snippet was shown on September 23 , 2009 , on Dancing with the Stars . Subsequently that day , the video premiered online on ABC 's Music Lounge . Jocelyn Vena of MTV said , " The video is reminiscent of Cyrus ' performance of the track on the Teen Choice Awards over the summer — minus the pole dancing . " According to a survey held by MTV , responses for the music video varied from populations who were " not feeling it " for various reasons to those who enjoyed " the video 's energy and thought that the added bit of sexiness was a healthy progression for Cyrus . " At the 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards , the video won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best International Artist Video and was nominated for the MuchMusic Video Award for People 's Choice : Favourite International Video , but lost to Adam Lambert 's video for " <unk> Want From Me " .

 Cyrus ' first live performance of " Party in the U.S.A. " at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10 , 2009 . Clothed by a tank top that revealed a portion of her bra , black hot pants and leather boots , Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer . Midway through the performance , Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole ( which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics ) for approximately forty seconds . Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage : " [ My ] performance tonight is funny , but I wanted it to be about [ something more ] . I 'm like , ' This is to represent where I am from . I 'm so proud of it . ' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses , me shooing them away . " The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen @-@ oriented event , which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance . Ian Drew , senior editor of US Weekly said , " She already has this risque image , so it really wasn 't much of a stretch . That 's how Britney [ Spears ] took off . She was the good girl gone bad , and it looks to be working for Miley as well . " Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears , but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account . Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday : Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance , which , according to Fischer , was unacceptable . " Miley 's only 16 . Why is she rushing it ? " , she concluded .

" Chris Adler commented : " This is a classic record . We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest , yet contagious records of our career . It was difficult to contain us — we didn 't even understand at the time what we had created . "

 = 7th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 7th Infantry Division is an infantry division of the United States Army . Today , it exists as a unique 250 @-@ man deployable headquarters based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord overseeing several units , though none of the 7th Infantry Division 's own historic forces are active . 
 The division was first activated in December 1917 in World War I , and based at Fort Ord , California for most of its history . Although elements of the division saw brief active service in World War I , it is best known for its participation in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II where it took heavy casualties engaging the Imperial Japanese Army in the Aleutian Islands , Leyte , and Okinawa . Following the Japanese surrender in 1945 , the division was stationed in Japan and Korea , and with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 was one of the first units in action . It took part in the Inchon Landings and the advance north until Chinese forces counter @-@ attacked and almost overwhelmed the scattered division . The 7th later would fight in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill and the Battle of Old Baldy . From 1953 to 1971 , the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone . Its main garrison was Camp Casey , South Korea . During these occupation duties , the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan . The division 's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade , 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia , which alluded to its history during the Korean War . On 2 April 1971 , the division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lewis , Washington . In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison , Fort Ord. [ 133 ] In the late 1980s , it briefly saw action overseas in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras and Operation Just Cause in Panama . In the early 1990s , it provided domestic support to the civil authorities in Operation Green Sweep and during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots . The division 's final role was as a training and evaluation unit for Army National Guard brigades , which it undertook until its inactivation in 2006 . 
 On 26 April 2012 , the Department of Defense announced the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would be reactivated as an administrative unit . This was done on 10 October 2012 at Joint Base Lewis McChord . On 23 December 2014 , it was announced the Headquarters will reorganize into a deployable unit in response to increasing demands for " readily available , high @-@ level leadership cadres drawn from divisional headquarters " .

 The 7th Infantry Division was created during World War I and was activated on 6 December 1917 as the 7th Division of the regular army at Camp Wheeler , Georgia . One month later , it prepared to deploy to Europe as a part of the American Expeditionary Force . Two brigades were assigned to the division , the 13th Infantry Brigade and the 14th Infantry Brigade . Most of the division sailed to Europe aboard the SS Leviathan . 
 While on the Western Front , the 7th did not see action at full divisional strength , though its infantry and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces . On 11 October 1918 , it first came under shell fire and later , at Saint @-@ Mihiel , came under chemical attack . Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River , capturing positions and driving German forces out of the region . It was at this time that the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia . 
 In early November , the 7th began preparing for an assault on the Hindenburg Line as part of the Second Army . The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre plain , but the main assault was never conducted as hostilities ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the armistice . During its 33 days on the front line , the 7th Division suffered 1 @,@ 709 casualties , including 204 killed in action and 1 @,@ 505 wounded in action. and was awarded a campaign streamer for Lorraine . The division then served on occupation duties as it began preparations to return to the continental United States . The 7th Division arrived home in late 1919 , and was gradually demobilized at Camp Meade , Maryland until on 22 September 1921 , when it was inactivated . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 On 1 July 1940 , the 7th Division was reactivated at Camp Ord , California , under the command of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell . The 12th and 13th Brigades did not reactivate as part of an army @-@ wide elimination of brigade commands within its divisions . The division was instead centered around three infantry regiments ; the 17th Infantry Regiment , the 32nd Infantry Regiment , and the 53rd Infantry Regiment . Also assigned to the division were the 31st , 48th , 49th and 57th Field Artillery Battalions , as well as the 7th Signal Company , the 707th Ordnance Company , the 7th Quartermaster Company , the 7th Reconnaissance Troop , the 13th Engineer Battalion , the 7th Medical Battalion , and the 7th Counter Intelligence Detachment . Most of the troops in the division were selective service soldiers , conscripted as a part of the US Army 's first peacetime military draft . 
 The 7th Division was assigned to III Corps of the Fourth United States Army , and transferred to Longview , Washington , in August 1941 to participate in tactical maneuvers . Following this training , the division moved back to Fort Ord , California , where it was located when the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor caused the United States to declare war . The formation proceeded almost immediately to San Jose , California , arriving 11 December 1941 to help protect the west coast and allay civilian fears of invasion . The 53rd Infantry Regiment was removed from the 7th Division and replaced with the 159th Infantry Regiment , newly deployed from the California Army National Guard . For the early parts of the war , the division participated mainly in construction and training roles . Subordinate units also practiced boat loading at the Monterey Wharf and amphibious assault techniques at the Salinas River in California . 
 On 9 April 1942 , the division was formally redesignated as the 7th Motorized <unk> and transferred to Camp San Luis Obispo on 24 April 1942 . Three months later , divisional training commenced in the Mojave Desert in preparation for its planned deployment to the African theater . It was again designated the 7th Infantry Division on 1 January 1943 , when the motorized equipment was removed from the unit and it became a light infantry division once more , as the Army eliminated the motorized division concept fearing it would be logistically difficult and that the troops were no longer needed in North Africa . The 7th Infantry Division began rigorous amphibious assault training under US Marines from the Fleet Marine Force , before being deployed to fight in the Pacific theater instead of Africa . USMC General Holland Smith oversaw the unit 's training . 
 = = = = Aleutian Islands = = = = 
 Elements of the 7th Infantry Division first saw combat in the amphibious assault on Attu Island , the western @-@ most Japanese entrenchment in the Aleutian islands chain . Elements landed on 11 May 1943 , spearheaded by the 17th Infantry Regiment . The initial landings were unopposed , but Japanese forces mounted a counteroffensive the next day , and the 7th Infantry Division fought an intense battle over the tundra against strong Japanese resistance . The division was hampered by its inexperience and poor weather and terrain conditions , but was eventually able to coordinate an effective attack . The fight for the island culminated in a battle at <unk> Harbor , when the division destroyed all Japanese resistance on the island on 29 May , after a suicidal Japanese bayonet charge . During its first fight of the war , 600 soldiers of the division were killed , while killing 2 @,@ 351 Japanese and taking 28 prisoners . After American forces secured the island chain , the 159th Infantry Regiment was ordered to stay on the island , and the 184th Infantry Regiment took its place as the 7th Division 's third infantry regiment . The 184th Infantry remained with the division until the end of the war . The 159th Infantry Regiment stayed on the island for some time longer until returning to the United States , where it remained until the end of the war . 
 American forces then began preparing to move against nearby Kiska island , termed Operation Cottage , the final fight in the Aleutian islands campaign . In August 1943 , elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division , only to find the island deserted by the Japanese . It was later discovered that the Japanese had withdrawn their 5 @,@ 000 @-@ soldier garrison during the night of 28 July , under cover of fog .

 After the campaign , the division moved to Hawaii where it trained in new amphibious assault techniques on the island of Maui , before returning to Schofield Barracks on Oahu for brief leave . It was reassigned to V Amphibious Corps , a US Marine Corps command . The division left Pearl Harbor on 22 January 1944 , for an offensive on Japanese territory . On 30 January 1944 , the division landed on islands in the Kwajalein Atoll in conjunction with the 4th Marine Division , code named Operation Flintlock . The 7th Division landed on the namesake island while the 4th Marine Division forces struck the outlying islands of Roi and Namur . The Division made landfall on the western beaches of the island at 09 : 30 on 1 February . It advanced halfway through the island by nightfall the next day , and reached the eastern shore at 1335 hours on 4 February , having wrested the island from the Japanese . The victory put V Amphibious Corps in control of all 47 islands in the atoll . The 7th Infantry Division suffered 176 killed and 767 wounded . On 7 February , the division departed the atoll and returned to Schofield Barracks . 
 Elements took part in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok Atoll on 18 February 1944 , code named Operation Catchpole . Because of the speed and success of the attack on Kwajalein , the attack was undertaken several months ahead of schedule . After a week of fighting , the division secured the islands of the atoll . The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training . There , in June 1944 , General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division . 
 = = = = Leyte = = = = 
 The 7th Infantry Division left Hawaii on 11 October , heading for Leyte and include the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were aided against the Japanese . At this time it was under the command of XXIV Corps of the Sixth United States Army . On 20 October 1944 , the division made an assault landing at Dulag , Leyte , initially only encountering light resistance . Following a defeat at sea on 26 October , the Japanese launched a large , uncoordinated counteroffensive on the Sixth Army . After heavy fighting , the 184th Infantry secured airstrips at Dulag , while the 17th Infantry secured San Pablo , and the 32nd Infantry took Buri . The 17th Infantry troops moved north to take <unk> on 29 October , in intense jungle warfare that produced high casualties . The division then shifted to the west coast of Leyte on 25 November and attacked north toward Ormoc , securing Valencia on 25 December . An amphibious landing by the 77th Infantry Division effected the capture of Ormoc on 31 December 1944 . The 7th Infantry Division joined in the occupation of the city , and engaged the 26th Japanese Infantry Division , which had been holding up the advance of the 11th Airborne Division . The 7th Division 's attack was successful in allowing the 11th Airborne Division to move through , however , Japanese forces proved difficult to drive out of the area . As such , operations to secure Leyte continued until early February 1945 . Afterward , the division began training for an invasion of the Ryukyu island chain throughout March 1945 . It was relieved from the Sixth Army and the Philippine Commonwealth military , which went on to attack Luzon . 
 = = = = Okinawa = = = = 
 The division was reassigned to XXIV Corps , Tenth United States Army , a newly formed command , and began preparations for the assault on Okinawa . The Battle of Okinawa began on 1 April 1945 , L @-@ Day , when the 7th Infantry Division participated in an assault landing south of Hagushi , Okinawa alongside the 96th Infantry Division , and the 1st , and 6th Marine <unk> of III Amphibious Corps . These divisions spearheaded an assault that would eventually land 250 @,@ 000 men ashore . The 7th Division quickly moved to Kadena , taking its airfield , and drove from the west to the east coast of the island on the first day . The division then moved south , encountering stiff resistance from fortifications at Shuri a few days later . The Japanese had moved 90 tanks , much of their artillery , and heavy weapons away from the beaches and into this region . Eventually , XXIV Corps destroyed the defenses after a 51 @-@ day battle in the hills of southern Okinawa , which was complicated by harsh weather and terrain . During the operation , the division was bombarded with tens of thousands of rounds of field artillery fire , encountering Japanese armed with spears as it continued its fight across the island . Japanese also fought using irregular warfare techniques , relying on hidden cave systems , snipers , and small @-@ unit ambushes to delay the advancing 7th Infantry Division . After the fight , the division began capturing large numbers of Japanese prisoners for the first time in the war , due to low morale , high casualties , and poor equipment . It fought for five continuous days to secure areas around the Nakagusuku Wan and Skyline Ridge . The division also secured Hill 178 in the fighting . It then moved to Kochi Ridge , securing it after a two @-@ week battle . After 39 days of continuous fighting , the 7th Infantry Division was sent into reserve , having suffered heavy casualties . 
 After the 96th Infantry Division secured Conical Hill , the 7th Infantry Division returned to the line . It pushed into positions on the southern <unk> Mura hills , where Japanese resistance was heaviest . It was placed on the extreme left flank of the Tenth Army , taking the <unk> peninsula , <unk> , and <unk> , fending off a series of Japanese counterattacks . Despite heavy Japanese resistance and prolonged bad weather , the division continued its advance until 21 June 1945 , when the battle ended , having seen 82 days of combat . The island and surrendering troops were secured by the next day . During the Battle of Okinawa , the soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division killed between 25 @,@ 000 and 28 @,@ 000 Japanese soldiers and took 4 @,@ 584 prisoners . Balanced against this , the 7th Division suffered 2 @,@ 340 killed and 6 @,@ 872 wounded for a total of 9 @,@ 212 battle casualties during 208 days of combat . The division was slated to participate in Operation Downfall as a part of XXIV Corps under the First United States Army , but these plans were scrapped after the Japanese surrendered following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
 During World War II , soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division were awarded three Medals of Honor , 26 Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , 982 Silver Star Medals , 33 Legion of Merit Medals , 50 Soldier 's Medals , 3 @,@ 853 Bronze Star Medals , and 178 Air Medals . The division received four campaign streamers and a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation during the war . The three Medals of Honor were awarded to Leonard C. Brostrom , John F. Thorson , and Joe P. Martinez .

 A few days after V @-@ J Day , the division moved to Korea to accept the surrender of the Japanese Army in South Korea . After the war , the division served as an occupation force in Korea and Japan . Seven thousand , five hundred members of the unit returned to the United States , and the 184th Infantry Regiment was reassigned to the California Army National Guard , cutting the division to half its combat strength . To replace it , the 31st Infantry Regiment was assigned to the division . The 7th Infantry Division remained on occupation duty in Korea patrolling the 38th parallel until 1948 , when it was reassigned to occupation duty in Japan , in charge of northern Honshū and all of Hokkaido . During this time , the US Army underwent a drastic reduction in size . At the end of World War II , it contained 89 divisions , but by 1950 , the 7th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force . It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan alongside the 1st Cavalry Division , 24th Infantry Division , and 25th Infantry Division , all under control of the Eighth United States Army . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 , the 7th Infantry Division commander , Major General David G. Barr , assembled the division at Camp Fuji near Mount Fuji . The division was already depleted due to post @-@ war shortages of men and equipment and further depleted as it sent large numbers of reinforcements to strengthen the 25th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division , which were sent into combat in South Korea in July . The division was reduced to 9 @,@ 000 men , half of its wartime strength . To replenish the ranks of the understrength division , the Republic of Korea assigned over 8 @,@ 600 poorly trained Korean soldiers to the division . With the addition of priority reinforcements from the US , the division was eventually increased to 25 @,@ 000 when it entered combat . Also fighting with the 7th Infantry Division for much of the war were members of the three successive <unk> Battalions sent by Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as part of the UN forces . 
 The division paired with the 1st Marine Division under X Corps to participate in the Inchon Landing , code named Operation Chromite . The two divisions would be supported by the 3rd Infantry Division in reserve . Supported by 230 ships of the US Navy , X Corps began landing at Inchon on 15 September 1950 , catching the North Korean Army by surprise . The 7th Infantry Division began landing on 18 September , after the 1st Marine Division , securing its right flank . X Corps quickly advanced to Seoul , and the 1st Marine Division attacked the 20 @,@ 000 defenders of the city from the north and southwest , while the 7th Infantry Division 's 32nd Infantry Regiment attacked from the southeast . The 31st Infantry followed behind . Seoul fell to the Americans after suffering moderate casualties , particularly for the Marines . The division then began advancing south to cut off North Korean supply routes . The 32nd Infantry crossed the Han River on 25 September to create a bridgehead , and the next day , the division advanced to 30 miles south of Seoul and linked up with the 1st Cavalry Division at Osan . Radio miscommunication and attack from nearby North Korean forces caused a miscommunication , the soldiers of the 1st Cavalry and 7th Infantry briefly engaged in a small @-@ arms firefight with one another , unable to communicate . Seoul was liberated one day later with the help of air assets from the 1st Cavalry Division . The combined forces of the Eighth Army cut off and captured retreating North Korean troops from Pusan . X Corps was kept separate from the rest of the Eighth Army to avoid placing a burden on the logistical system . It withdrew back through the ports of Inchon and Pusan , as part of a plan to conduct another amphibious assault in North Korea . The entire battle for Inchon and Seoul cost the division 106 killed , 411 wounded and 57 missing American soldiers , and 43 killed , 102 wounded South Korean soldiers . 
 By mid @-@ October , the North Korean army had been almost completely destroyed , and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into Korea as quickly as possible to end the war . The 7th Infantry Division , still part of X Corps , participated in a second amphibious assault on the east coast of North Korea , landing at Wonsan on 26 October , and <unk> on 29 October . The landing was delayed due to the presence of mines , and by the time X Corps arrived , South Korean forces were already occupying the ports . The division advanced to <unk> , on the China – North Korea border by the Yalu River , one of the northernmost advances for UN soldiers of the war . Much of X Corps followed behind . On 21 November , the 17th Infantry reached the bank of the Yalu river . The advance went quickly for the 7th Infantry Division and South Korean troops while the Marines were not able to advance as quickly . The division halted its advance until 24 November while other units of the Eighth Army 's IX Corps and South Korean II Corps caught up and supply lines were established . During this time , the 7th Division 's regiments were spread out on the front line . The 31st Infantry Regiment remained at the Chosin Reservoir with the 1st Marine Division while the 32nd and 17th Infantry Regiments were much further to the northeast , closer to the South Korean I Corps . It was during this time that the division was served by a new type of unit , the 1st Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ( <unk> ) .

 On 25 November , Chinese forces entered the war against the United Nations , advancing across the Yalu border and attacking the Eighth Army 's IX Corps and South Korean II Corps in the west and X Corps in the east . X Corps found itself under attack from the 20th , 26th and 27th Chinese field armies , commanding a total of 12 divisions . During the furious action that followed , the 7th Infantry Division 's spread out regiments were unable to resist the overwhelming Chinese forces . Three of the Division 's infantry battalions were attacked from all sides the next day . 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry ( nicknamed Task Force Faith ) was trapped with two other battalions by the 80th and 81st Chinese infantry divisions from the 27th Field Army . In the subsequent Battle of Chosin Reservoir , the three battalions were destroyed by overwhelming Chinese forces suffering over 2 @,@ 000 casualties . The 31st Infantry suffered heavy casualties trying to fight back the Chinese forces further north , but the 17th Infantry was spared of heavy attack , retreating along the Korean coastline , out of range of the offensive . By the time X Corps ordered a retreat , most of the 7th Infantry Division , save the 17th Infantry Regiment , had suffered 40 percent casualties . The scattered elements of the division saw repeated attacks as they attempted to withdrawal to the port of Hungnam in December 1950 . These attacks cost the division another 100 killed before it was fully evacuated . The division suffered 2 @,@ 657 killed and 354 wounded during the retreat . Most of the dead were members of Task Force Faith . 
 The division returned to the front lines in early 1951 , spearheaded by the 17th Infantry , which had suffered the fewest casualties from the Chinese offensive . Division elements advanced through <unk> in South Korea , and blocking enemy offensives from the northwest . The division reached full strength and saw action around <unk> , <unk> , and Pyeongchang as part of an effort to push the North Korean and Chinese forces back above the 38th parallel and away from Seoul . The 7th Infantry Division engaged in a series of successful " limited objective " attacks in the early weeks of February , a series of small unit attacks and ambushes between the two sides . It would continue slowly advancing and clearing enemy hilltop positions through April . By April the entire Eighth Army was advancing north as one line stretching across the peninsula , reaching the 38th parallel by May . The division , assigned to IX Corps , then assaulted and fought a fierce three @-@ day battle culminating with the recapture of the terrain that had been lost near the Hwachon Reservoir just over the 38th parallel in North Korea . In capturing the town bordering on the reservoir it cut off thousands of enemy troops . The division fought on the front lines until June 1951 when it was assigned to the reserve for a brief rest and refitting .

 When the division returned to the lines in October , after another assignment in reserve , it moved to the Heartbreak Ridge sector recently vacated by the 2nd Infantry Division , where it was supported by the 3rd Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division . During this new deployment the division fought in the Battle for Heartbreak Ridge , to take an area of staging grounds for the Korean and Chinese armies . It remained static in the region until 23 February 1952 when it was sent into reserve and relieved by the 25th Infantry Division . The next year saw the 7th Division engaged in an extended campaign for nearby land , the Battle of Old Baldy . The 7th Division continued to defend " Line Missouri " through September 1952 , though it became known as the " Static Line " as UN forces made few meaningful gains in the time . 
 The 7th Infantry Division 's Operation Showdown launched in the early morning hours of 14 October 1952 , with the 31st Infantry and 32nd Infantry at the head of the attack . The target of the assault was the Triangle Hill complex northeast of Kumhwa . The 7th Infantry Division remained in the Triangle Hill area until the end of October , when it was relieved by the 25th Infantry Division . The 7th Infantry Division was highly praised by commanders for its tenacity through the fight . 
 The division continued patrol activity around Old Baldy Hill and Pork Chop Hill into 1953 , digging tunnels and building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around the hill . In April , the North Korean Army began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces . During the Battle of Porkchop Hill , the Chinese 67th and 141st divisions overran Pork Chop Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire . The hill had been under the control of the 31st Infantry . The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day . On 6 July the North Koreans and Chinese launched a determined attack against Pork Chop resulting in five days of fierce fighting with few meaningful results . By the end of July , five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending the hill , while a Chinese division was in position to attack it . During this standoff , the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from the hill in preparation for an armistice , which would end major hostilities . 
 During the Korean War , the division saw a total of 850 days of combat , suffering 15 @,@ 126 casualties , including 3 @,@ 905 killed in action and 10 @,@ 858 wounded . For the next few years , the division remained on defensive duty along the 38th parallel , under the command of the Eighth Army . Thirteen members of the division received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Korean War : Charles H. Barker , Raymond Harvey , Einar H. Ingman , Jr . , William F. Lyell , Joseph C. Rodriguez , Richard Thomas Shea , Daniel D. <unk> , Jack G. Hanson , Ralph E. Pomeroy , Edward R. <unk> , Jr . , Benjamin F. Wilson , Don C. Faith , Jr . , and Anthony T. <unk> .

 From 1953 to 1971 , the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone . Its main garrison was Camp Casey , South Korea . During these occupation duties , the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan . The division 's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade , 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade , 7th Infantry Division . In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia , which alluded to its history during the Korean War . On 2 April 1971 , the division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lewis , Washington . 
 In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison , Fort Ord. The unit did not see any action in Vietnam or during the post @-@ war era , but was tasked to keep a close watch on South American developments . It trained at Fort Ord , Camp Roberts , Fort Hunter Liggett and Fort Irwin . On 1 October 1985 the division was redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division ( Light ) , organized again as a light infantry division . It was the first US division specially designed as such . The various battalions of the 31st , and 32nd regiments moved from the division , replaced by battalions from other regiments , including battalions from the 21st Infantry Regiment , the 27th Infantry Regiment , and the 9th Infantry Regiment . The 27th and 9th infantry regiments participated in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras . 
 In 1989 the 7th Infantry Division participated in Operation Just Cause in Panama , briefly occupying the country in conjunction with the 82nd Airborne Division . Elements of the 7th Infantry Division landed in the northern areas of Colón Province , Panama , securing the Coco Solo Naval Station , Fort <unk> , France Field , and Colón while the 82nd Airborne and U.S. Marines fought in the more heavily populated southern region . Once Panama City was under U.S. control , the 82nd quickly re @-@ deployed and left the city under the control of the 7th Division 's 9th Infantry Regiment until after the capture of Manuel Noriega . It suffered four killed and three wounded in the operation . 
 In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closing of Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the central California coastline . By 1994 , Fort Ord closed and the 7th Infantry Division subsequently relocated to Fort Lewis , Washington . Elements of the division including the 2nd Brigade participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation ; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots , called Operation Garden Plot . The division 's soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles to act as crowd control and supported the Los Angeles Police Department and California National Guard in preventing the riots from escalating in violence . It was part of a force of 13 @,@ 000 troops called into the city . 
 In 1993 the division was slated to be inactivated as part of the post @-@ Cold War drawdown of the US Army . The 1st Brigade relocated to Fort Lewis and was later reflagged as the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division while the 2nd Brigade and the 3rd Brigade of the 7th was inactivated at Fort Ord. The division headquarters was formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis .
