 <unk> subdivision is an example of a subdivision rule with one edge type ( that gets subdivided into two edges ) and one tile type ( a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles ) . Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex . 
 The Penrose tiling can be generated by a subdivision rule on a set of four tile types ( the curved lines in the table below only help to show how the tiles fit together ) : 
 Certain rational maps give rise to finite subdivision rules . This includes most <unk> maps . 
 Every prime , non @-@ split alternating knot or link complement has a subdivision rule , with some tiles that do not subdivide , corresponding to the boundary of the link complement . The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement ; because the universe wraps around itself ( i.e. is not simply connected ) , an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern . The subdivision rule describes that pattern . 
 The subdivision rule looks different for different geometries . This is a subdivision rule for the trefoil knot , which is not a hyperbolic knot : 
 And this is the subdivision rule for the Borromean rings , which is hyperbolic : 
 In each case , the subdivision rule would act on some tiling of a sphere ( i.e. the night sky ) , but it is easier to just draw a small part of the night sky , corresponding to a single tile being repeatedly subdivided . This is what happens for the trefoil knot : 
 And for the Borromean rings : 
 = = Subdivision Rules in Higher Dimensions = = 
 Subdivision rules can easily be generalized to other dimensions . For instance , barycentric subdivision is used in all dimensions . Also , binary subdivision can be generalized to other dimensions ( where <unk> get divided by every <unk> ) , as in the proof of the Heine @-@ Borel theorem . 
 = = Rigorous definition = = 
 A finite subdivision rule <formula> consists of the following . 
 1 . A finite 2 @-@ dimensional CW complex <formula> , called the subdivision complex , with a fixed cell structure such that <formula> is the union of its closed 2 @-@ cells . We assume that for each closed 2 @-@ cell <formula> of <formula> there is a CW structure <formula> on a closed 2 @-@ disk such that <formula> has at least two vertices , the vertices and edges of <formula> are contained in <formula> , and the characteristic map <formula> which maps onto <formula> restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell . 
 2 . A finite two dimensional CW complex <formula> , which is a subdivision of <formula> . 
 3.A continuous cellular map <formula> called the subdivision map , whose restriction to every open cell is a homeomorphism . 
 Each CW complex <formula> in the definition above ( with its given characteristic map <formula> ) is called a tile type . 
 An <formula> <unk> for a subdivision rule <formula> is a 2 @-@ dimensional CW complex <formula> which is the union of its closed 2 @-@ cells , together with a continuous cellular map <formula> whose restriction to each open cell is a homeomorphism . We can subdivide <formula> into a complex <formula> by requiring that the induced map <formula> restricts to a homeomorphism onto each open cell . <formula> is again an <formula> <unk> with map <formula> . By repeating this process , we obtain a sequence of subdivided <formula> <unk> <formula> with maps <formula> . 
 Binary subdivision is one example : 
 The subdivision complex can be created by gluing together the opposite edges of the square , making the subdivision complex <formula> into a torus . The subdivision map <formula> is the doubling map on the torus , wrapping the meridian around itself twice and the longitude around itself twice . This is a four @-@ fold covering map . The plane , tiled by squares , is a subdivision complex for this subdivision rule , with the structure map <formula> given by the standard covering map . Under subdivision , each square in the plane gets subdivided into squares of one @-@ fourth the size . 
 = = Quasi @-@ isometry properties = = 
 Subdivision rules can be used to study the quasi @-@ isometry properties of certain spaces . Given a subdivision rule <formula> and subdivision complex <formula> , we can construct a graph called the history graph that records the action of the subdivision rule . The graph consists of the dual graphs of every stage <formula> , together with edges connecting each tile in <formula> with its subdivisions in <formula> . 
 The quasi @-@ isometry properties of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules . For instance , the history graph is quasi @-@ isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when the subdivision rule is conformal , as described in the combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Islamic Girih tiles in Islamic architecture are self @-@ similar tilings that can be modeled with finite subdivision rules . In 2007 , Peter J. Lu of Harvard University and Professor Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton University published a paper in the journal Science suggesting that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with self @-@ similar fractal <unk> tilings such as Penrose tilings ( presentation 1974 , predecessor works starting in about 1964 ) predating them by five centuries . 
 Subdivision surfaces in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision . These subdivision surfaces ( such as the Catmull @-@ Clark subdivision surface ) take a polygon mesh ( the kind used in 3D animated movies ) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas . Although many points get shifted in this process , each new mesh is <unk> a subdivision of the old mesh ( meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh , you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one , plus several more edges and vertices ) . 
 Subdivision rules were applied by Cannon , Floyd and Parry ( 2000 ) to the study of large @-@ scale growth patterns of biological organisms . Cannon , Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects ( in their example , a tree trunk ) whose large @-@ scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same . Cannon , Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue . They suggested that the " negatively curved " ( or non @-@ <unk> ) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large @-@ scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self @-@ similar fractals . In particular they suggested that such " negatively curved " local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue . 
 = = Cannon 's conjecture = = 
 Cannon , Floyd , and Parry first studied finite subdivision rules in an attempt to prove the following conjecture : 
 Cannon 's conjecture : Every Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2 @-@ sphere at infinity acts geometrically on hyperbolic 3 @-@ space . 
 Here , a geometric action is a <unk> , properly discontinuous action by isometries . This conjecture was partially solved by Grigori Perelman in his proof of the <unk> conjecture , which states ( in part ) than any Gromov hyperbolic group that is a 3 @-@ manifold group must act geometrically on hyperbolic 3 @-@ space . However , it still remains to show that a Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2 @-@ sphere at infinity is a 3 @-@ manifold group . 
 Cannon and Swenson showed that a hyperbolic group with a 2 @-@ sphere at infinity has an associated subdivision rule . If this subdivision rule is conformal in a certain sense , the group will be a 3 @-@ manifold group with the geometry of hyperbolic 3 @-@ space . 
 = = Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem = = 
 Subdivision rules give a sequence of tilings of a surface , and tilings give an idea of distance , length , and area ( by letting each tile have length and area 1 ) . In the limit , the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface . The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur . 
 Its statement needs some background . A tiling <formula> of a ring <formula> ( i.e. , a closed annulus ) gives two invariants , <formula> and <formula> , called approximate moduli . These are similar to the classical modulus of a ring . They are defined by the use of weight functions . A weight function <formula> assigns a non @-@ negative number called a weight to each tile of <formula> . Every path in <formula> can be given a length , defined to be the sum of the weights of all tiles in the path . Define the height <formula> of <formula> under <formula> to be the infimum of the length of all possible paths connecting the inner boundary of <formula> to the outer boundary . The circumference <formula> of <formula> under <formula> is the infimum of the length of all possible paths circling the ring ( i.e. not <unk> in R ) . The area <formula> of <formula> under <formula> is defined to be the sum of the squares of all weights in <formula> . Then define 
 <formula> 
 <formula> . 
 Note that they are invariant under scaling of the metric . 
 A sequence <formula> of tilings is conformal ( <formula> ) if mesh approaches 0 and : 
 For each ring <formula> , the approximate moduli <formula> and <formula> , for all <formula> sufficiently large , lie in a single interval of the form <formula> ; and 
 Given a point <formula> in the surface , a neighborhood <formula> of <formula> , and an integer <formula> , there is a ring <formula> in <formula> separating x from the complement of <formula> , such that for all large <formula> the approximate moduli of <formula> are all greater than <formula> . 
 = = = Statement of theorem = = = 
 If a sequence <formula> of tilings of a surface is conformal ( <formula> ) in the above sense , then there is a conformal structure on the surface and a constant <formula> depending only on <formula> in which the classical moduli and approximate moduli ( from <formula> for <formula> sufficiently large ) of any given annulus are <formula> <unk> , meaning that they lie in a single interval <formula> . 
 = = = Consequences = = = 
 The Combinatorial Riemann Mapping Theorem implies that a group <formula> acts geometrically on <formula> if and only if it is Gromov hyperbolic , it has a sphere at infinity , and the natural subdivision rule on the sphere gives rise to a sequence of tilings that is conformal in the sense above . Thus , Cannon 's conjecture would be true if all such subdivision rules were conformal . 
 = Ash Crimson = 
 Ash Crimson ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a video game character in The King of Fighters fighting game series developed by SNK Playmore . His first appearance was in The King of Fighters 2003 as leader of its Hero Team . Ash , a teenager , participates in the series ' fighting tournaments . He employs a personal fighting style that involves pyrokinesis with green flames . Despite being the series ' protagonist since its third story arc , Ash 's behavior is generally antagonistic and he tries to steal powers from several recurring characters , leaving them powerless . His identity and intentions are further explored in the most @-@ recent title , The King of Fighters XIII , and he has been featured in print adaptations and a drama CD based on the games . 
 SNK Playmore staff created Ash as an evil main character , in contrast to previous main characters . His moves have been reworked in every game in which he has appeared , gaining new techniques as a result of his actions or modified to balance the character roster . Critical response to Ash has been largely negative due to his androgynous appearance and his technique . In interviews and press releases , video game publisher UTV Ignition Entertainment noted that he was unpopular with Western gamers and his design was better suited to Japanese fans . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2003 , Ash leads the New Hero Team of Duo Lon and Shen Woo which participates in a new King of Fighters tournament . After the tournament , he ambushes host Chizuru Kagura and steals her powers , telling Iori Yagami he will be his next opponent . In The King of Fighters XI , the character teams up with Oswald and Shen Woo . At the game 's end Ash leaves his teammates to fight each other , after disclosing that Oswald 's price for joining him was finding a drug he can only obtain after defeating their pharmacist 's enemy : Shen Woo . He later finds a berserker , Iori , defeats him and steals his powers . When Ash 's comrade Elisabeth <unk> accuses him of abandoning his original mission and becoming obsessed with power , he leaves after saying that Kyo Kusanagi will be his next victim . Ash also appears as an available fighter in the KOF : Maximum Impact 2 update KOF Maximum Impact Regulation A and The King of Fighters XII , games without a storyline . 
 In The King of Fighters XIII Ash is the only character not part of a team , and it is learned that he works for Those From the Past ( seen in 2003 and XI ) . However , he has a conflict with organization leader Saiki at the end of the game . Ash is the final boss in The King of Fighters XIII as " Ash driven insane by the Spiral of Blood " ( <unk> , Chi no Rasen ni <unk> <unk> ) ( also known as Evil Ash ) with power stolen from Saiki , who is trying to possess him . He ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy Saiki . 
 Ash has made appearances in various other King of Fighters media as well . In the fourth chapter of the anime The King of Fighters : Another Day , he sets fire to a city to lure Kyo into a trap . He is also prominent in the manhua adaptations of The King of Fighters 2003 by Wing Yang and King Tung . In the 2003 tournament , Ash 's team is defeated in the final but later helps defeat the demon Mukai . Although he is not part of the recurring tournament in The King of Fighters XII manhua , he briefly confronts Kyo in an attempt to steal his powers . Ash also appears in the CD drama KOF : Mid Summer Struggle , which has a mock King of Fighters tournament . Outside The King of Fighters , the character appears in a dating sim part of the Days of Memories series . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 Ash was designed as an " attractive evil character " , in contrast to previous King of Fighters heroes . The supervising designer created the character as desired , with few changes since conception . When The King of Fighters 2003 was released and Ash introduced , the staff did not want to disclose information about him , instead telling fans to look forward to his " exploits . " His canonical height is <unk> ( 5 ' 10 " ) and he weighs <unk> ( 130 lbs ) . According to a staff member , Falcoon , the goal was to make Ash an ambiguous protagonist who made players " feel bad " for cheering for him . Although Falcoon did not design the character , he added details while illustrating him . Due to Ash 's late appearance in The King of Fighters 2003 , the staff joked that teammate Shen Woo seemed more like the series ' main character than Ash did . For The King of Fighters XIII , producer Kei Yamamoto wanted gamers who had played previous titles with Ash to consider the character 's motivation and whether they could relate to him . One of three reasons for the title of KOF : Maximum Impact 2 Regulation " A " was Ash 's introduction to the spin @-@ off series . Falcoon called the character " really wild " because of his role in the series and his personality . Nona ( another artist in charge ) said that of the original King of Fighters characters , he liked Ash and looked forward to his development . 
 In The King of Fighters XII Ash was the character the staff worked on the most , reworking his movements and speech to be more consistent with the rest of the cast . The King of Fighters XIII producer Kei Yamamoto jokingly called him a character players could use to " show off " . His EX version in the game makes more multiple hits than his regular form , and the " disgusting " style of his " Genie " ( <unk> ) move is said to fit his character . Since his introduction , Ash has acquired new moves in accordance with his action in the series . After The King of Fighters 2003 Ash gained Chizuru Kagura 's " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , a move allowing him to steal his opponents ' special moves . After defeating Iori Yagami , the character acquired the " Fructidor " ( <unk> ) Neo Max move ( his strongest attack in The King of Fighters XIII ) . During the game 's development , the staff considered returning Fructidor 's animation style to an earlier version they had tested . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Ash Crimson 's character had a mixed reception in video @-@ game publications . When he was introduced , GameSpy 's Christian Nutt called him a " clone " of Guile from the Street Fighter series because of their similar movesets but Ash 's team was praised as new characters with new elements in the series . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN wrote that a major fan complaint was the character 's strength in the games , which made him one of the strongest opponents despite an apparent lack of effort . According to Thomas , Ash is " nothing if not strange " and the writer lamented his many appearances in the KOF 2003 manhua compared with more @-@ popular characters . When playable characters for the arcade version of The King of Fighters XIII were introduced , Anime News Network 's Todd Ciolek speculated about Ash 's lack of teammates and wondered if he was alone because " no one likes Ash now . " Marissa Meli of UGO Networks ranked Ash sixteenth on a list of " The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters " , with Meli jokingly attributing his androgynous appearance to a desire by Japanese designers to confuse Western gamers about their sexuality . Although he called Ash 's voice one of " Gaming 's Top 10 <unk> Voices " , Dan <unk> of Now Gamer referred to him as a female character and writers for Game Informer joked about their surprise at the discovery that Ash is a male character . After UTV Ignition Entertainment polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of The King of Fighters XII , the company announced that Ash 's unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two ( featuring Kyo and Iori ) . 
 In an interview with Ignition Entertainment director of business development Shane Bettehausen , Alex <unk> of Diehard GameFan said that North American SNK fans detested Ash and complained about his inclusion in The King of Fighters XII without a storyline while popular series characters were overlooked . Bettehausen defended the character , calling him " nuanced and improved " and his moves " incredibly effective " . In June 2009 , Stephen Totilo of Kotaku interviewed Bettehausen , who asked him while Totilo was playing to guess Ash 's gender . When Totilo said the character was female , <unk> called KOF " progressive " in introducing a cross @-@ dressing character and said that fans were apparently " warming up to him " . On Destructoid , Jonathan Holmes praised Ash 's character as " defying traditional gender roles while kicking some ass " and called him " the perfect mascot for the <unk> series as a whole . " Merchandising related to Ash 's appearance has also been released . 
 = Cunard Building = 
 Not to be confused with the 1921 Cunard Building ( New York City ) 
 The Cunard Building is a Grade II * listed building in Liverpool , England . It is located at the Pier Head and along with the neighbouring Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building is one of Liverpool 's Three Graces , which line the city 's waterfront . It is also part of Liverpool 's UNESCO designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City . 
 It was designed by William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was constructed between 1914 and 1917 . The building 's style is a mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival , and its development has been particularly influenced by Italian palace design . The building is noted for the ornate sculptures that adorn its sides . 
 The building was , from its construction until the 1960s , the headquarters of the Cunard Line , and the building still retains the name of its original tenants . It was also home to Cunard 's passenger facilities for trans @-@ Atlantic journeys that departed from Liverpool . Today , the building is owned by the Merseyside Pension Fund and is home to numerous public and private sector organisations . It is located directly opposite from Albion House , the former headquarters of White Star Line . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1914 the Cunard Steamship Company commissioned the construction of new headquarters for the company . Cunard 's expansion had meant that they had outgrown their previous offices , which were also in Liverpool , and the site chosen for construction was at the former George 's Dock , in between the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building . The building was designed by the architects William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was inspired by the grand palaces of Renaissance Italy . It was constructed by Holland , Hannen & Cubitts between 1914 and 1917 , with Arthur J. Davis , of Mewes and Davis , acting as consultant on the project . 
 In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company merged with the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line , which became the largest passenger steamship company in the world , helping to make Liverpool one of the most important centres of the British trans @-@ Atlantic ocean liner industry . The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm , with both administrative and ship @-@ designing facilities located within the building . Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building , including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth . Given that Liverpool was a major trans @-@ Atlantic port and due to the building 's proximity to the River Mersey , the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers , both prior to and after sailing . Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first , second and third class passengers , a booking hall , luggage storage space , and a currency exchange . The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees . During the Second World War , the sub @-@ basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises . The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war . Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building . 
 The building remained the headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s , when they decided to relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England 's south coast and their global headquarters to New York . Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969 . In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II * listed building status by the English Heritage . Initially , it was listed together with the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building under Pier Head , but in 1985 each building gained its own listing . In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund , an organisation that provides pension services to public sector workers in Liverpool . Today , the building provides a range of office accommodation for a variety of public and private sector organisations , including Government Office North West . In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams to draw up a conservation plan to preserve the building . The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building . 
 In October 2013 Liverpool City Council approved the acquisition of the Cunard Building for use as offices and as a cruise liner terminal . The council projected that the building would accommodate 1000 staff relocated from Millennium House and leases in the Capital Building , saving an estimated £ 1 @.@ 3 million . The anticipated use as cruise terminal however had to be abandoned due to the high costs associated with security and border control . 
 = = Architectural design = = 
 The Cunard Building 's architectural style can be generally described as a mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival , with a degree of Beaux @-@ Arts influence on the building 's structural form . Willink and Caldwell 's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general , with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential . Despite the strong Italian influence , the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the building itself and , as the building itself is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration , its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux @-@ Arts buildings such as those in New York . 
 The Cunard Building is approximately rectangular in shape , with nine bays on the east and west sides , and seventeen bays on the north and south sides . However , as it was constructed after the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building on either side of it , space limitations meant that the east ( landward ) side was actually built 30 foot ( 9 m ) wider than the west . The central bays on each side provide the main entrance points into the building . Each entrance consists or a large panelled oak door , adorned by a pair of fluted columns and with a coffered ceiling . The Cunard Building stands six storeys tall and has two basement levels . Due to its construction on the site of the former George 's Dock , part of the original dock wall is still visible in the eastern boundary of the first basement level . 
 The frame of the building was constructed from reinforced concrete , which was then clad in Portland stone . Several highly detailed sculptures adorn the outside of the building , including ones of Britannia and Neptune , as well as others representing peace , war , and storms . There are also sculptures of the Zodiac and the coat of arms of the United Kingdom 's allies during the First World War . Another series of sculptures on the building depict different races from around the world , which reflect the global operations of the Cunard company . Marble was used to furnish several parts of the inside of the building , particularly on the ground floor corridors that link the north and south entrances . It was imported from several locations in Italy and Greece , including Attica , Carrara , and Arni Alto . 
 As the initial usage of the Cunard Building was mixed , there are a variety of features within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within . Initially , Cunard 's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities , these rooms where developed to include both <unk> in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light . Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge , which is located on the first floor . These fitting are also in the former board room , which is located in a ' commanding ' position on the fifth floor , overlooking the river below . 
 One of the most notable features of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub @-@ basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company 's property and also the luggage of passengers . Coal was also stored in the basement , with a small railway track providing a link to the boiler room , which was used to heat the building . Many original features of the basement still exist , including the timber baggage racks , ship logs and other maritime documents . Several secure vaults , which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items , are still used today to hold historic documents , drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard 's Liners , such as the RMS Queen Mary . 
 = = Cunard War Memorial = = 
 The Cunard War Memorial is located on the west side of the Cunard Building and was erected in memory of the Cunard employees who were killed during the First World War , and later the Second World War . A Grade II listed monument , it was designed by Arthur Davis , who acted as consultant during the construction of the Cunard Building itself . It was erected around 1920 , although it wasn 't officially unveiled until 1921 , by the Earl of Derby , Edward Stanley . Prior to being located at the Pier Head , the monument had been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London . 
 The monument consists of a large bronze statue that sits atop a Doric style column , which is itself raised above the ground by a pedestal base . The statue was sculpted by Henry Alfred Pegram , whilst John Stubbs & Sons provided the stonework . Due the architects wishes that the monument be in keeping with the design of the Cunard Building , Davis designed the memorial to match the Greek features of building . The figure on top is of man , who is said to represent victory , standing above the prow of a Roman ship . Around him there are other naval references including ropes , anchors , and shells . After the Second World War , the monument become dedicated to all Cunard employees who died in both wars . An inscription on the side of the memorial reads " pro patria " , which is Latin for , " for one 's country " . 
 = Destination : Imagination = 
 " Destination : Imagination " is a television special of the animated television series Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends . The plot of the special follows Frankie , who becomes trapped in a huge , mysterious world where she is treated like royalty but forced not to leave . Bloo , Mac , Coco , Eduardo , and Wilt journey through the world to rescue her , facing perils and challenges along the way . 
 Written by Lauren Faust and Tim McKeon , " Destination : Imagination " was directed by Rob Renzetti and series creator Craig McCracken . The plot was conceived after the crew decided that they wanted to make an episode with adventure , featuring the characters going out on a large quest of sorts . Due to the dark and serious storytelling approach used , the special came out " edgier " than most episodes of Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends . 
 The special originally broadcast on Cartoon Network on November 27 , 2008 , on Thanksgiving Day . It was well received and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming One Hour or More ) . It was also nominated for two Annie Awards — one for Best Animated Television Production Produced for Children and another for McCracken and Renzetti 's directing . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 During the pouring rain , a mother and father leave a heavily chained toy box at the doorstep of Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened . The next day , Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker ; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it . When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep , Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic . In a fit of anger toward Herriman , she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it . She falls inside , only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats . She hears and sympathizes with a young boy 's voice ( Max Burkholder ) , later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World ( given the name by the crew of the show ) , who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster 's . 
 Frankie adores the world and goes to visit it every day , being treated like royalty by the voice . But one day , when she goes to leave , the friend refuses to allow her and locks every exit in the castle they are abiding in . Bloo , Mac , Coco , Eduardo , and Wilt become curious with her sudden disappearance . They go up to the attic and enter the toy box , discovering for themselves the vast world that resides in it . They ask around a small town if anyone has seen a woman of Frankie 's description but nobody responds . A group of <unk> policemen discover they have entered the world and chase after them , but the gang are saved by a heroic man . He tries to warn them that their pursuit of Frankie will lead through extremely dangerous environments , but they are determined to rescue her . Mr. Herriman , in the meantime , is outraged by Frankie 's disappearance and attempts to find a replacement for her , but to no avail . 
 After failing to cross a musical and colorful bridge , the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie @-@ like doppelgangers and moves to chase them . They escape through a Super Mario World @-@ like environment and go to the house of a toy dog , where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder . Mac does not eat the crumpets ( since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar , and he can 't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind ) and is able to save the others . As they try to escape , they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face — World — who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto . World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert ; but latches on a horse , truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by , and World is able to move once more . It gallops off to the castle , where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her . However , Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her , she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster 's and Mr. Herriman 's constant nagging . The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her to take care of them . She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is " sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks , an ounce of help , or a tiny little smidgen of respect " . They attempt to console her , but World gasses them and they fall asleep . When they awaken , they find themselves in a fake version of Foster 's created by World , who shrank them into it . 
 Frankie begins to hear their tiny voices calling to her and , though World tries to distract her from it , she finally discovers her friends . World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever . She calms him down enough to befriend and <unk> the gang , but Mr. Herriman bursts in , having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang 's obstacles , and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World to " think long and hard about what you 've done " . World 's world falls to pieces until it 's nothing but a white void . World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera @-@ like creature to attack them all ( made of the remaining refuse of his world ) . The gang manages to escape the toy box . Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box . Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box , due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence . World gets happy already and shouts that he 's free and everyone is really confused , Frankie 's answer is : " Well , think of it this way : Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted , except one thing , but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else . For him , that thing is a friend . That 's all he wanted ; that 's what he was trying to protect . So I brought him here . Here he can have all the friends in the world ! I mean come on , isn 't friendship what Foster 's is all about ? " <unk> Bloo shouts , " No , it 's all about me ! " promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove , to the delight of everyone else . 
 World adapts to the new environment and lives as a stuffed rag doll in the home .

 " Destination : Imagination " was co @-@ written by Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends co @-@ creator Lauren Faust along with Tim McKeon . Other series co @-@ founder Craig McCracken directed it along with Rob Renzetti . The special was conceived by the four , along with Darrick Bachman , Edward Baker , Vaughn Tada , and Alex Kirwan , as a means of creating an adventure story , to " send the gang on a fantastic quest . " 
 The character of World was created as a means to have an imaginary friend that was an entire world instead of the usual " sentient being that you hang out with . " Baker suggested that the character should be portrayed as a young child , which McCracken agreed because it brought originality to the story , and allowed him to " be more emotional , to not understand the bigger picture , to be confused and vulnerable and like a kid , to throw a fit when they don 't get their way . " 
 The special was written with the goal of " telling the story in the most honest and sincere way . " The writers attempted to continue the tense and unpleasant relationship between Frankie and Mr. Herriman , which they had begun developing since the series began , but approaching it in a believable and sensible fashion . With the heavy plot running through the special , the writers tried to use Bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it . They wrote Bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously , but did not want him to be cruel or malicious . 
 A lot of the special was more " edgy " and dark than what had been done previously on Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends . A major reason behind this was the peril , danger , and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily . McCracken explains , " When we start a show one of the first things we think about is tone , is this a goofy one , is it a serious one , whatever it may be we stay true to that tone . This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way . "

 " Destination : Imagination " was originally broadcast on Thanksgiving Day , November 27 , 2008 , on Cartoon Network , at 8 : 00 P.M. EST . It followed an afternoon @-@ long marathon of the animated series Chowder and a My Gym Partner 's A Monkey Thanksgiving special entitled " A Thanksgiving Carol " . The first special for the series , entitled " Good Wilt Hunting , " had also aired on Thanksgiving , back in 2006 . At the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards , the special won the award for " Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming One Hour or More ) " , winning over Spike TV 's Afro Samurai : Resurrection . It was nominated for two Annie Awards for Best Animated Television Production Produced for Children and Directing for an Animated Television Production or Short Form . The special lost both to Nickelodeon 's Avatar : The Last Airbender . 
 " Destination : Imagination " received generally positive reviews from television critics . Newsarama reporter Steve Fritz called it " one of the best and — well — most imaginative chapters , ever . " Fritz praised Tom Kane and Grey DeLisle 's performance as Mr. Herriman and Frankie , calling it " stellar , " along with the dark and " edgy " undertones of the special . 
 = Chevrolet Volt = 
 The Chevrolet Volt is a plug @-@ in hybrid manufactured by General Motors , also marketed in rebadged variants as the Holden Volt in Australia and New Zealand , and with a different fascia as the Vauxhall Ampera in the United Kingdom and as the Opel Ampera in the remainder of Europe . 
 Sales of the 2011 Volt began in the U.S. in mid @-@ December 2010 followed by various European countries and other international markets in 2011 . Global combined Volt / Ampera family sales totaled over 110 @,@ 000 unit by the end of March 2016 , with the U.S. as the leading market with over 96 @,@ 600 Volts delivered through May 2016 . Canada is the world 's second largest market with almost 6 @,@ 400 Volts sold through May 2016 . About 10 @,@ 000 Opel / Vauxhall Ampera cars had been sold in Europe as of December 2015 , with the Netherlands leading the European region with almost 5 @,@ 000 Amperas and over 1 @,@ 000 Volts registered . The Volt / Ampera family of vehicles is the world 's all @-@ time best @-@ selling plug @-@ in hybrid vehicle as of March 2016 . 
 The Volt operates as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge . From there its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle 's range as needed . When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked ( by a clutch ) to a planetary gear set , and hence the output drive axle , to improve energy efficiency . The Volt 's regenerative braking also contributes to the on @-@ board electricity generation . Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) cycle , the 2013 / 15 model year Volt all @-@ electric range is 38 mi ( 61 km ) , with a combined electric mode / gasoline @-@ only rating of 62 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 8 L / 100 km ; 74 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ equivalent ) . 
 The second generation Volt improved battery system and drivetrain increased the all @-@ electric range to 53 miles ( 85 km ) , its EPA rated fuel economy in charge @-@ sustaining mode to 42 mpg @-@ US ( 5 @.@ 6 L / 100 km ; 50 mpg @-@ imp ) , and the combined city / highway fuel economy in all @-@ electric mode to 106 MPG @-@ e , up from 98 MPG @-@ e . Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. and Canada began in October 2015 as a 2016 model year . 
 The Volt has won several awards , including the 2009 Green Car Vision Award , 2011 Green Car of the Year , 2011 North American Car of the Year , 2011 World Green Car , 2012 European Car of the Year , and 2016 Green Car of the Year . Controversies regarding the Volt include the extent to which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt ’ s development , which continued through General Motors ' 2009 government @-@ led bankruptcy , and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) performed on a Volt in 2011 . At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 The Society of Automotive Engineers ' ( SAE ) definition of a hybrid vehicle states that the vehicle shall have " two or more energy storage systems both of which must provide propulsion power , either together or independently . " General Motors has avoided the use of the term " hybrid " when describing its Voltec designs , even after the carmaker revealed that in some cases the combustion engine provided some assist at high speeds or to improve performance . Instead General Motors describes the Volt as an electric vehicle equipped with a " range extending " gasoline powered internal combustion engine ( ICE ) as a genset and therefore dubbed the Volt an " Extended Range Electric Vehicle " or E @-@ REV . In a January 2011 interview , the Chevy Volt 's Global Chief Engineer , Pamela Fletcher , referred to the Volt as " an electric car with extended range . " 
 According to the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) definitions , the Volt is a plug @-@ in hybrid vehicle , due to the combination of an internal combustion engine and two electric motors , along with a battery that can accept off @-@ board energy . The Volt operates as a purely electric vehicle for the first 25 to 50 miles ( 40 to 80 km ) in charge @-@ depleting mode . When the battery capacity drops below a pre @-@ established threshold from full charge , the vehicle enters charge @-@ sustaining mode , and the Volt 's control system will select the most optimally efficient drive mode to improve performance and boost high @-@ speed efficiency . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Concept vehicle = = = 
 The Chevrolet Volt concept car debuted at the January 2007 North American International Auto Show , becoming the first @-@ ever series plug @-@ in hybrid concept car shown by a major car manufacturer . The Volt concept vehicle had four doors with a rear liftgate and seating for four passengers . This was a significant change in design when compared to the General Motors EV1 of the 1990s , which only seated two to reduce weight and to make the necessary room for the lead @-@ acid battery pack . The top speed was also increased on the Volt , from the electronically limited 80 miles per hour ( 130 km / h ) to 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) . The battery pack size was reduced , from about 10 @.@ 6 cu ft ( 300 L ) in volume in the EV1 , to 3 @.@ 5 cu ft ( 100 L ) in the Volt . 
 General Motors ' then @-@ Vice @-@ Chairman Robert Lutz said the two @-@ seater sports car being developed by Tesla , the Tesla Roadster , and the rapid advancement of lithium @-@ ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show . Lutz 's initial idea was to develop an all @-@ electric car , but Jon Lauckner , General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development , convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery , range anxiety concerns , and lack of public charging infrastructure , they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range , but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels , so it would be a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience . 
 Most of the Volt initial design parameters defined for the development of the concept car , then referred as the " <unk> " in homage to the iPod , were kept throughout the process up to the final production version . A key design parameter was a target of 40 miles ( 64 km ) for the all @-@ electric range , selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs , and mainly because research showed that in the U.S. 78 percent of daily commuters travel 40 miles or less . This target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight . This requirement translated using a lithium @-@ ion battery pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 kWh considering that the battery would be used until the state of charge ( SOC ) of the battery reached 30 % . This limit to the SOC was necessary in order to maintain operational performance under a wide range of environments , and to minimize the battery degradation to allow at least a ten @-@ year life span . The initial target range for the gasoline engine / generator was set between 250 to 300 miles ( 400 to 480 km ) and the vehicle had to be family size for four or five passengers . 
 Another key design decision was to develop the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion , which initially was called the E @-@ Flex Systems , “ E ” stands for electric drive and “ Flex ” for the different sources of electricity , but later was renamed Voltec drive system . The E @-@ Flex or Voltec powertrain is an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles , and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity @-@ generating systems . The E @-@ Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric , to fuel cell @-@ powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board , such as engine @-@ generator sets ( genset ) fueled by gasoline , diesel , biodiesel , ethanol fuel ( E100 ) , or flex @-@ fuel ( E85 ) . Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on @-@ board electricity generation . On October 2006 the E @-@ flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors . 
 The Volt concept car became the first application of the E @-@ Flex ( Voltec ) drive system with a combination of an electric motor , the same used in the Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell , a 16 kW · h ( 58 MJ ) lithium @-@ ion battery pack with 136 kW of peak power , and a genset consisting of a small 1 @.@ 0 L , 3 @-@ cylinder turbocharged flex @-@ fuel capable engine linked to a 53 kW ( 71 hp ) generator . General Motors called this genset an electric vehicle ( EV ) range extender . The vehicle was propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of 120 kW ( 160 hp ) delivering 236 lb ft ( 320 <unk> ) of motoring torque . The concept car featured several advanced materials from GE Automotive Plastics which allowed GM to reduce the vehicle weight up to 50 percent . 
 The Volt concept featured a 12 US gal ( 45 L ; 10 @.@ 0 imp gal ) fuel capacity providing the vehicle a total driving range of around 640 mi ( 1 @,@ 030 km ) , which considered a gasoline fuel efficiency of about 50 mpg @-@ US ( 4 @.@ 7 L / 100 km ; 60 mpg @-@ imp ) and a 40 mi ( 64 km ) all @-@ electric range . According to General Motors estimates , a daily drive of 60 mi ( 97 km ) , combined with an overnight recharge to support the first 40 all @-@ electric miles , would yield an effective gasoline fuel economy of 150 mpg @-@ US ( 1 @.@ 6 L / 100 km ; 180 mpg @-@ imp ) . General Motors also emphasized that the Volt would further reduce dependence on imported oil if E85 ethanol was used instead of gasoline to power the on @-@ board generator engine . Robert Lutz added that if the driver used E85 , " the fuel economy figure became 525 miles per ( equivalent ) petroleum gallon " , as only 15 % of gasoline is used in this blend . General Motors also noted that actual production of the Volt depended on further battery development , because the required rechargeable batteries needed to make the Volt a viable vehicle did not exist in the market and had yet to be developed . The concept car was actually powered by two 12 @-@ volt conventional car batteries , just enough power to allow the vehicle to move at low speeds in the stand .

 = = = Production model = = = 
 The production design model officially unveiled on September 16 , 2008 , as part of General Motors centennial celebration at the <unk> headquarters in Detroit . The production model differed greatly in design from the original concept car . The carmaker cited necessary aerodynamic changes needed to reduce the concept car 's high drag coefficient of Cd = 0 @.@ 43 down to a more efficient Cd = 0 @.@ 28 , though still somewhat higher than the Toyota Prius Cd = 0 @.@ 25 . Another reason was the use of General Motors ' new global compact vehicle platform Delta II to keep costs reasonable , and shared with the 2010 model year Chevrolet Cruze . Another significant difference from the concept car is the seating , as the production Volt seats four rather than five passengers . This change was due to the higher @-@ than @-@ usual central tunnel that runs from the front console to the rear seat that houses the car 's T @-@ shaped battery pack . 
 After the concept was put into the pipeline for production , General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt 's lithium @-@ ion battery pack . The carmaker evaluated about twenty @-@ five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium @-@ ion battery makers around the world . Due to their more promising cell technologies , two companies were selected in June 2007 , Compact Power ( CPI ) , which uses a lithium manganese oxide ( <unk> ) cell made by its parent company , LG Chemical ; and Continental Automotive Systems , which uses lithium iron phosphate based cylindrical cells made by <unk> . By the end of October 2007 CPI ( LG Chem ) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes , and <unk> delivered theirs by January 2008 . General Motors testing process was conducted at the laboratory the carmaker had created for the GM EV1 program . The battery packs included monitoring systems designed to keep the batteries cool and operating at optimum capacity despite a wide range of ambient temperatures . In order to make sure the battery pack would last ten years and 150 @,@ 000 miles ( 240 @,@ 000 km ) expected for the battery warranty , the Volt team decided to use only half of the 16 kWh capacity to reduce the rate of capacity degradation , limiting the state of charge ( SOC ) up to 80 % of capacity and never depleting the battery below 30 % . General Motors also was expecting the battery could withstand 5 @,@ 000 full discharges without losing more than 10 % of its charge capacity . 
 In April 2008 General Motors started extensive battery testing . In two years the carmaker put the battery packs to the equivalent of 150 @,@ 000 real @-@ world miles ( 240 @,@ 000 km ) and ten years of use . The durability of the battery pack was tested for a broad range of extreme ambient conditions including a shaker table to simulate potholes and a thermal chamber , to simulate temperatures varying from 116 ° F ( 47 ° C ) , typical of the Southwest deserts , to − 40 ° F ( − 40 ° C ) typical of the Alaska tundra . In April 2008 the lithium @-@ ion battery pack was placed in Chevrolet <unk> fitted with the Volt powertrain to be used as test mules for further real @-@ world testing . In October 2008 General Motors chose CPI ( LG Chemical ) to provide the battery systems for the first production version of the Volt . In July 2008 General Motors confirmed that a non @-@ turbocharged , 1 @.@ 4 L 4 @-@ cylinder engine would be used as the range extender , and that the intention was to build it in Flint , Michigan . In April 2009 , General Motors allowed journalists to test the Volt powertrain in the body of Chevrolet Cruze sedans used as test mules which lacked the range @-@ extending generator at the GM Technical Center in Warren , Michigan . 
 The first pre @-@ production test car based on the final Volt design was built in June 2009 , in Warren , Michigan , and by October 2009 , 80 Volts had been built and were tested under various conditions . On March 31 , 2010 , the first factory @-@ built Volt was produced at the Detroit Hamtramck Assembly Plant in order to test the production line and for quality control purposes , both of the tooling and the pre @-@ production vehicles produced before regular production began . 
 Tony <unk> was the Volt Vehicle Line Director from 2006 to 2012 , and he was known as employee # 1 and led the team from concept to production . 
 Official introduction 
 General Motors held a ceremony at its Detroit Hamtramck Assembly Plant on November 30 , 2010 , to introduce the first Chevrolet Volt off the assembly line . The first Volt built for retail sale was earmarked for display at General Motors ' Heritage Center museum in Sterling Heights , Michigan . The second unit was offered at a public auction , with an opening bid of US $ 50 @,@ 000 and it was won by Rick Hendrick who paid US $ 225 @,@ 000 . The proceeds went to fund math and sciences education in Detroit through the Detroit Public Schools Foundation . Deliveries to retail customers in the United States began in mid December 2010 . Volt deliveries began in Canada in September 2011 . The first deliveries of the Chevrolet Volt in Europe took place in November 2011 . The European version of the Volt , the Opel Ampera , was released to retail customers in Europe in February 2012 . Deliveries of the right @-@ hand drive Vauxhall Ampera in the UK began in May 2012 . The Holden Volt was released in Australia in December 2012 .

 The 2011 Chevrolet Volt has a 16 kWh / 45 A · h ( 10 @.@ 4 kWh usable ) lithium @-@ ion battery pack that can be charged by plugging the car into a 120 @-@ 240 VAC residential electrical outlet using the provided SAE J1772 @-@ compliant charging cord . No external charging station is required . The Volt is propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of 111 kW ( 149 hp ) delivering 273 lb · ft ( 370 N · m ) of torque . Capacity of the battery pack was increased to 16 @.@ 5 kWh ( 10 @.@ 9 kWh usable ) for 2013 models , which increased the all @-@ electric range from 35 to 38 mi ( 56 to 61 km ) . Other specifications remained the same . The battery pack capacity was increased to 17 @.@ 1 kWh for 2015 models . This incremental upgrade is likely to reflect in an improvement in range over previous model years , but as of July 2014 , the 2015 Volt has not been re @-@ certified with the EPA . 
 While driving , after the Volt battery has dropped to a predetermined threshold from full charge , a small naturally aspirated 1 @.@ 4 L 4 @-@ cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine ( Opel 's Family 0 ) with approximately 80 hp ( 60 kW ) , powers a 55 kW generator to extend the Volt 's range . The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system . The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor , with the excess going to the batteries , depending on the state of charge ( SOC ) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels . 
 The Volt requires premium gasoline with a minimum 91 or octane rating because the higher octane rating fuel permits the 10 @.@ 5 : 1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition timing advance in order to maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10 % as compared to regular gasoline . For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months , the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation , and as a result , the fuel filler has to be depressurized before opening the tank . Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) all @-@ electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline . If the driver does not run on gasoline , the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine . A configuration with an E85 flex @-@ fuel capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013 . 
 Operating and driving modes 
 The Voltec drivetrain has three power converting elements : 
 Primary traction electric motor / generator , provides good acceleration for driving at lower speeds and regeneration for braking , its maximum output of 111 kW setting the maximum output of the whole system . 
 Secondary electric motor / generator , works primarily as generator capable of producing 55 kW or when necessary acts as a motor assisting the primary electric motor . 
 Internal combustion engine of 63 kW power , engaged when the batteries reach the predetermined threshold . 
 These units are connected via a planetary gear and three electrically controlled hydraulic clutches to provide power output for propulsion in any of four programmed operating modes : 
 Single motor electric – The primary motor runs solely on battery power , maximum propulsion power is 111 kW . 
 Dual motor electric – At higher vehicle speeds the secondary motor engages over the planetary gear such that it reduces the speed of the primary motor . This facilitates higher efficiency and better mileage for the combined system , without increasing the maximum power . 
 Single motor extended – The battery reaches its minimum charge which triggers the combustion engine . The engine drives the secondary motor which now works as a generator , via the charging electronics , to keep the minimum battery charge level . The primary motor can still provide its 111 kW for short acceleration , albeit not sustained . 
 Dual motor extended – The electric motors are used again in dual configuration with increased efficiency at higher speeds . Additionally the gasoline engine contributes propulsion power via the planetary gear . While power is drained from the battery the amount is less than in mode 2 for the same propulsion power , thus extending the range . 
 The drivetrain permits the Volt to operate as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level , at which time it commences to operate as a series hybrid design where the gasoline engine drives the generator , which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors . The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the electrical grid . 
 While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads , ( typically above 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) at light to moderate loads ) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels , in which case the Volt operates as a power @-@ split or series @-@ parallel hybrid . After its all @-@ electric range has been depleted , at speeds between 30 to 70 miles per hour ( 48 to 113 km / h ) , the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient drive mode , which improves performance and boosts high @-@ speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent . 
 While operating modes are switched automatically the Volt allows the driver to choose from three drive modes : normal , sport and mountain . The mountain mode , which is expected to be required only under unusual power demand conditions , increases minimum battery state of charge ( SOC ) to around 45 % , thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades . The driver will hear more engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode . The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher , and the response to the throttle pedal is quicker . The Ampera has an additional option , the " City Mode " or " battery hold " , allowing the driver to save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones . The 2013 model year Volt includes a " Hold " option to provide the same choice . 
 = = = = Battery = = = = 
 The 2011 Volt 's lithium @-@ ion battery ( Li @-@ ion ) battery pack weighs 435 lb ( 197 kg ) and " consists of 288 individual cells arranged into nine modules . Plastic frames hold pairs of lithium @-@ ion cells that sandwich an aluminum cooling fin . The design and construction of that aluminum plate was critical to ensuring an even temperature distribution with no hot or cool spots across the flat , rectangular cell . The battery pack has its own cooling circuit that is similar to , but independent from , the engine cooling system . " 
 For the 2011 / 2012 model years , the battery pack stores 16 kWh of energy but it is controlled or buffered via the energy management system to use only 10 @.@ 3 kWh of this capacity to maximize the life of the pack . For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes , as the software only allows the battery to operate within a state of charge ( SOC ) window of 65 % , after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level . The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions . When more power is required , such as mountain mode , the lower limit of the SOC will rise to 45 % to ensure there is enough power available . The battery capacity was increased to 16 @.@ 5 kWh for the 2013 model year , the SOC window will be increased to use 10 @.@ 8 kWh of the total battery energy , and the buffer to ensure battery life will not be reduced . These changes will increase the Volt 's all @-@ electric range but charging will take slightly longer . The improved battery performance and durability were achieved through minor changes to the material composition of the battery cell chemistry . 
 Despite containing near identical energy ( + / - 0 @.@ 5 kWh ) , the Volt 's battery pack is over 70 % lighter than the EV1 's original 1 @,@ 310 lb ( 590 kg ) , 16 @.@ 5 kWh AC Delco lead @-@ acid battery pack , mainly because the Volt uses higher specific energy Li @-@ ion batteries . Li @-@ ion batteries are expected to become less expensive as economies of scale take effect . 
 Because batteries are sensitive to temperature changes , the Volt has a thermal management system to monitor and maintain the battery cell temperature for optimum performance and durability . The Volt 's battery pack provides reliable operation , when plugged in , at cell temperatures as low as − 13 ° F ( − 25 ° C ) and as high as 122 ° F ( 50 ° C ) . The Volt features a battery pack that can be both warmed or cooled . In cold weather the battery coolant is electrically heated during charging or operation in order to provide full power capability ; in hot weather the battery coolant can be chilled utilizing the vehicle 's air @-@ conditioning system preventing over @-@ temperature damage . 
 The Volt 's battery is guaranteed by General Motors for eight years or 100 @,@ 000 miles ( 160 @,@ 000 km ) , and will cover all 161 battery components . GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30 % after 8 years or 100 @,@ 000 miles . GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some of the performance of degraded battery packs . The Volt ’ s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second , allowing it to keep track of the Volt ’ s battery pack in real @-@ time , 85 % of which ensure the battery pack is operating safely and 15 % monitor battery performance and life . 
 The Volt uses a plug specification published in 2009 , SAE J1772 @-@ 2009 , that is considered a standard for electric cars in North America . Depending on in @-@ car settings a full charge will take approximately 10 hours ( 12A setting ) to as much as 14 hours ( 8A setting ) from a standard North American 120 V , 15 A outlet and about 4 hours from a 240 VAC source and suitable 240V EVSE . The Volt comes with a 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) charging cord suitable for the standard household power outlet in its country of sale . If plugged in , recharging can be controlled remotely through a smartphone application .

 In order to save energy , the Volt will sometimes heat the seats instead of blowing heated air through HVAC system , as heating the vehicle 's cabin draws significant power , and can even exceed what is needed to move the vehicle on occasions .

 According to General Motors the Volt 's all @-@ electric range with fully charged batteries varies from 25 to 50 miles ( 40 to 80 km ) depending on terrain , driving technique , and temperature . The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) official all @-@ electric range is 35 miles ( 56 km ) with an energy consumption of 36 kWh per 100 miles ( 810 kJ / km ) . This range is based on the agency 's five @-@ cycle tests using varying driving conditions and climate controls . The total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery is 379 miles ( 609 @.@ 9 km ) according to EPA tests . 
 The Volt 's nominal usable battery capacity is 10 @.@ 3 kWh . The Volt 's fuel tank capacity is 9 @.@ 3 US gallons ( 35 L ; 7 @.@ 7 imp gal ) . Aside from charge sustaining modes of operation , the battery capacity is completely used first , and then the fuel is consumed . In the event that the car is operated until it runs out of gasoline , the gasoline @-@ powered generator shuts down , and the Volt continues to operate , tapping into a reserve portion of the battery capacity which is below the regular minimum state @-@ of @-@ charge . The reserve battery capacity provides an extra 3 to 4 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 to 6 @.@ 4 km ) . If this reserve battery capacity is also exhausted , the Volt slows to a stop . 
 2013 – 2015 model years 
 As a result of its improved battery chemistry , the 2013 model year Volt increased its EPA 's rated all @-@ electric range to 38 miles ( 61 km ) with an energy consumption of 35 kWh per 100 miles ( 788 kJ / km ) , down from 36 kWh ( 810 kJ / km ) in the 2012 model . The total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery is 380 miles ( 611 @.@ 6 km ) . The 2014 and 2015 Volt have the same EPA ratings .

 United States 
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) officially rated the 2011 model year Volt 's combined city / highway fuel economy in all @-@ electric mode at 93 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) ( 2 @.@ 5 L gasoline equivalent / 100 km ; 112 mpg @-@ imp gasoline equivalent ) and 94 MPG @-@ e for the 2012 model year . This rating considers a conversion factor of 33 @.@ 7 kWh of electricity being the energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline . The EPA rating in gasoline @-@ only mode is 37 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 44 mpg @-@ imp ) . The overall combined city / highway gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy rating for the 2011 Volt is 60 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 72 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) , The EPA also included in the 2011 Volt 's fuel economy label a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios : 30 , 45 , 60 and 75 miles ( 121 km ) driven between a full charge , and a never charge scenario . This information was included in order to make the consumers aware of the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges . Under the gasoline @-@ only scenario ( never charge ) , the 37 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 44 mpg @-@ imp ) figure results from 35 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 7 L / 100 km ; 42 mpg @-@ imp ) city driving and 40 mpg @-@ US ( 5 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 48 mpg @-@ imp ) on the highway . 
 For the 2012 model year , EPA revised the Volt 's fuel economy ratings , increasing the combined city / highway rating in all @-@ electric mode from 93 MPG @-@ e to 94 MPG @-@ e , and the highway rating was increased from 90 MPG @-@ e to 93 MPG @-@ e . As a result of its improved battery pack , the 2013 model year EPA rating climbed to a combined city / highway fuel economy of 98 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ( 2 @.@ 4 L gasoline equivalent / 100 km ; 118 mpg @-@ imp gasoline equivalent ) . The EPA rating in gasoline @-@ only mode is the same 37 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 44 mpg @-@ imp ) as the previous models . The combined gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy rating of the 2013 / 2014 model year Volt is 62 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 8 L / 100 km ; 74 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent , 63 MPG @-@ e in city driving and 61 MPG @-@ e in highway . 
 When introduced in December 2010 , the 2011 Volt was the most fuel efficient car sold in the American market in the compact class , with a combined gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy of 60 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 72 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) , until it was surpassed by the 2012 Ford Focus Electric in February 2012 . The all @-@ electric Focus has a combined fuel economy of 105 mpg @-@ US ( 2 @.@ 2 L / 100 km ; 126 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) . Nevertheless , the Volt remained as the most fuel efficient car with an internal combustion engine available in the United States until May 2014 , when the BMW i3 REx replaced the Volt as the most efficient EPA @-@ certified current year vehicle with a gasoline engine , with a combined gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy of 88 mpg @-@ US ( 2 @.@ 7 L / 100 km ; 106 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) . 
 In December 2012 General Motors reported , based on data collected through its OnStar telematics system since Volt deliveries began , that Volt owners drive around 900 mi ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) , or a month and a half , between fill @-@ ups . By mid June 2014 , GM reported that among Volt owners who charge regularly , they typically drive more than 970 mi ( 1 @,@ 560 km ) between fill @-@ ups and visit the gasoline station less than once a month . In early October 2014 , based on General Motors ' real time tally of miles driven by Volt owners in North America , the company reported they have accumulated a total of 1 billion miles ( 1 @.@ 6 billion km ) traveled , of which , about 62 @.@ 5 % were driven in all @-@ electric mode . 
 A 2014 analysis conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory using a sample of 21 @,@ 600 all @-@ electric cars and plug @-@ in hybrids , found that Volt owners traveled on average 9 @,@ 112 miles in all @-@ electric mode ( e @-@ miles ) per year , while Leaf owners traveled 9 @,@ 697 e @-@ miles per year , despite the Volt 's shorter all @-@ electric range , about half of the Leaf 's . The 2015 edition of the EPA 's annual report " Light @-@ Duty Automotive Technology , Carbon Dioxide Emissions , and Fuel Economy Trends " estimates the following utility factors for 2015 model year plug @-@ in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver , whether in electric only or blended modes , The Volt has a utility factor of 66 % , compared with 83 % for the BMW i3 REx , 45 % for the Ford Energi models , 43 % for the McLaren P1 , 37 % for the BMW i8 , and 29 % for the Toyota Prius PHV .

 = = = Operating cost and payback period = = = 
 According to Consumer Reports in December 2011 , the Chevrolet Volt fuel cost in electric mode was 3 @.@ 8 ¢ / mile , while the Nissan Leaf had a cost of 3 @.@ 5 ¢ / mi . The Volt 's higher cost per mile was attributed to its heavier weight . Their estimates used the U.S. national average electricity rate of 11 ¢ / ( kWh ) and energy consumption rates as measured on their own , unofficial tests . When comparing the Volt in range @-@ extended mode with the four most fuel efficient gasoline @-@ powered cars as tested by the magazine , the plug @-@ in hybrid had a cost of 12 @.@ 5 ¢ / mi ( using premium gasoline ) while the Toyota Prius had a cost of 8 @.@ 6 ¢ / mi . , the Honda Civic Hybrid 9 @.@ 5 ¢ / mi . , the Toyota Corolla 11 @.@ 9 ¢ / mi . , and the Hyundai Elantra 13 @.@ 1 ¢ / mi . The analysis also found that , on trips up to 100 mi ( 160 km ) , the Volt was cheaper to drive than the other four cars because the Volt was able to drive 35 mi ( 56 km ) using less expensive electric power . Consumer Reports found that , using their proprietary testing , the Volt overall fuel efficiency was 99 mpg @-@ US ( 2 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 119 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) , and using only range @-@ extended mode the overall fuel economy was 32 mpg @-@ US ( 7 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 38 mpg @-@ imp ) and equivalent to the Toyota Corolla . The report noted that , as of 2011 , plug @-@ in electric cars are more expensive to buy , and the previous operating costs do not include maintenance , depreciation or other costs . 
 According to Edmunds.com , the price premium paid for the Volt in 2012 , after discounting the US $ 7 @,@ 500 U.S. federal tax credit , takes a long time for consumers to recover in fuel savings , often longer than the normal ownership time period . Edmunds compared the Volt ( priced at US $ 31 @,@ 712 ) with the same @-@ size gasoline @-@ powered Chevrolet Cruze ( priced at US $ 19 @,@ 656 ) and found that the payback period for the plug @-@ in hybrid is 15 years for gasoline prices at US $ 3 per gallon , 12 years at US $ 4 per gallon , and drops to 9 years with gasoline prices at US $ 5 per gallon . At February 2012 prices , the break even period is 14 years . These estimates assume an average of 15 @,@ 000 miles ( 24 @,@ 000 km ) annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com 's true market value estimates . 
 In a similar comparison carried out by TrueCar in April 2012 for The New York Times , the analysis found that the payback period for the Volt takes 26 @.@ 6 years versus a Chevrolet Cruze Eco , assuming it was regularly driven farther than its battery @-@ only range allows , and with gasoline priced at US $ 3 @.@ 85 per gallon . The analysis assumes an average of 15 @,@ 000 miles ( 24 @,@ 000 km ) driven a year , a fuel economy of 34 @.@ 3 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 86 L / 100 km ; 41 @.@ 2 mpg @-@ imp ) for the Cruze Eco , priced at US $ 19 @,@ 925 , and a Volt price of US $ 31 @,@ 767 , after discounting the US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax . TrueCar also found that with gasoline priced at US $ 5 per gallon , the payback time could drop to about 8 years if the Volt were to be operated exclusively on battery power . The newspaper also reported that according to the March 2012 Lundberg Survey , gasoline prices would need to reach US $ 12 @.@ 50 a gallon for the Volt to break even , while the Nissan Leaf would be competitive with a similar gasoline @-@ powered compact car at US $ 8 @.@ 53 a gallon . 
 Since the Edmunds and The New York Times pieces however , numerous rebuttal articles have surfaced that have identified various flaws in the methodologies and calculations used by Edmunds and TrueCar in their estimation of the Volt 's pay @-@ back period . Namely both sources strict use of the Volt 's " gasoline engine only " EPA fuel economy rating of 37 mpg , when in fact when operated as intended any real @-@ world use will most typically include an initial 38 miles of all @-@ electric power during which zero gasoline would be consumed . Thus resulting in significantly higher total fuel economy that admittedly will be entirely dependent on how often and how far the car is driven . Many of these articles further suggest that the usage model used by TrueCar of 114 trips of 131 mi ( 211 km ) per trip was not typical of the majority of American daily driving patterns , and their use of a projected cost US $ 3 @.@ 85 per gallon as the cost of gasoline throughout the entire payback period quite unrealistic . An article from the online automotive publication The Truth About Cars indicates that when the Volt is charged and driven daily exclusively on its available electric power for its EPA rated 38 miles of all @-@ electric range ( 13 @,@ 780 mi ( 22 @,@ 180 km ) annually ) the payback period for the Volt would be much lower and similar to that of other plug @-@ in electric @-@ cars such as the Nissan Leaf or approximately 8 @.@ 7 years ( as indicated by TrueCar ) . 
 = = = Tailpipe emissions = = = 
 While operating in all @-@ electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions . However , the clean air benefit is mostly local because , depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries , air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants . The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle . When the Volt 's battery is depleted and the gasoline @-@ powered engine engages , the plug @-@ in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles . The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all @-@ electric mode and how much in charge @-@ sustaining mode . 
 United States 
 The California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) classified the Volt as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle ( ULEV ) , as CARB tests do not account for the Volt electric range . With all tests conducted under conditions where the engine is running the CARB rated the Volt 's carbon monoxide ( CO ) emissions at 1 @.@ 3 g / mile ( 0 @.@ 81 g / km ) , missing the limit for SULEV classification by 0 @.@ 3 g / mile ( 0 @.@ 19 g / km ) . 
 The EPA rating for the model year 2011 Volt 's tailpipe emissions is 84 grams of CO2 per mile , ( 52 @.@ 5 CO2 g / km ) . Tailpipe emissions for the improved model year 2014 / 15 Volt fell to 81 grams of CO2 per mile , ( 50 @.@ 6 CO2 g / km ) . CO2 emissions are produced by the internal combustion engine in extended @-@ range mode , and only after the Volt 's primary battery charge has been depleted . In the other air pollutants category , the Volt rates six out of ten , with ten being best . 
 The EPA also estimated the upstream CO2 emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the vehicle . Since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region , the EPA considered three scenarios / ranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor , the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor , and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the Rockies . The following table shows the Volt tailpipe emission plus total upstream CO2 emissions for the three scenarios , compared with other four popular plug @-@ in hybrids and the average gasoline @-@ powered car :

 The 2011 Chevrolet Volt standard features include 4 @-@ wheel anti @-@ lock brakes with traction control ; <unk> electronic stability control system with brake assist ; tire @-@ pressure monitoring system ; and 8 total airbags : dual @-@ stage frontal , side @-@ impact and knee for driver and front passenger , and roof @-@ rail side @-@ impact for front and rear outboard seating positions , with a passenger sensing system . There is also available an optional emergency assistance system . A safety cage , built with high @-@ strength and ultra high @-@ strength steel , surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact in the event of a crash . Crush zones framing the trunk and the engine crumple to absorb crash energy before it reaches occupants . Door hinges and latches in harmony with door structure and its steel reinforcements to keep doors closed during an impact . The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was named " Top Safety Pick " by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . The Volt received the top ratings of " Good " for front , side , and rear impact crash tests , and also on rollover protection . All injury measurements except one were rated good , indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes according to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS ’ s testing . The Volt 's lower rating of " Acceptable " was for torso injuries . 
 The Volt received a five @-@ star overall crash safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , the highest @-@ possible score . This rating was obtained with NHTSA 's New Car Assessment Program which is used for 2011 model year vehicles . 
 Accident and rescue handling 
 In August 2010 , General Motors began a training program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt . The program began at the 2010 Fire @-@ Rescue International in Chicago , using a pre @-@ production Volt for a live extrication exercise . Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle ’ s powertrain and its 12 @-@ volt electrical system , which controls its high @-@ voltage components , and then proceed to extricate injured occupants . As of January 2011 , additional training workshops had taken place in several other cities corresponding to the Volt 's initial launch markets . An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders . The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information . 
 GM recommends that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals , and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard as the result of a collision . The high @-@ voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment , and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module . During the Volt development the lithium @-@ ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests , including overcharge , discharge , vibration , excessive heat and cold , short circuit , humidity , fire , crush , water immersion , salt water immersion , and nail penetration . 
 Warning sounds 
 Due to significant noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in all @-@ electric mode at low speeds , the Volt is fitted with a manually activated electronic warning sound system called Pedestrian @-@ Friendly Alert System for use when the car is operating at low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car 's presence .

This smartphone application features the ability to check fuel efficiency as well as the vehicle 's current electric range . It also helps monitor the charging , giving owners key information about the current charge level and the amount of time it will take until it is fully charged . The application also is able to control features such as locking / unlocking doors , and acts as a remote starter . A five @-@ year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt 's base price , which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year .

 = = Second generation ( 2015 – ) = = 
 The second generation Chevrolet Volt was officially unveiled at the January 2015 North American International Auto Show . Retail deliveries began in the United States and Canada in October 2015 as a 2016 model year , with 1 @,@ 324 units delivered in the U.S. that month . Availability in the American market was limited to California and the other 10 states that follow California ’ s zero emission vehicle regulations . GM scheduled the second generation as a 2017 model year to be released in the 39 remaining states by early 2016 . Manufacturing of the 2017 MY Volt began in February 2016 , and the first units arrived at dealerships at the end of February 2016 . The 2017 model complies with stricter Tier 3 emissions requirements and it will be available nationwide . 
 The second generation Volt has an upgraded powertrain with a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ liter engine that uses regular gasoline ; the 18 @.@ 4 kWh battery pack has new chemistry that stores 20 % more electrical energy and uses fewer cells , 192 compared with 288 on the 2014 Volt ; it uses a new power controller that is integrated with the motor housing ; the electric motors weigh 100 lb ( 45 kg ) less and use smaller amounts of rare earth metals . GM engineers explained that the second generation Volt was developed using extensive input from Volt owners . 
 These improvements allow the 2016 Volt to deliver better EPA ratings than the first generation model . The all @-@ electric range was officially rated at 53 mi ( 85 km ) , up from 38 mi ( 61 km ) attained by the 2015 Volt . The gains in efficiency allow the second generation Volt to improve its combined fuel economy in gasoline @-@ only ( charge @-@ sustaining ) mode to 42 mpg @-@ US ( 5 @.@ 6 L / 100 km ; 50 mpg @-@ imp ) , up from 37 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 44 mpg @-@ imp ) for the previous model . The official second generation Volt 's rating for combined city / highway fuel economy in all @-@ electric mode is 106 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) , up from 98 MPG @-@ e for the 2015 first generation model . The combined gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy rating of the 2016 model year Volt is 77 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 1 L / 100 km ; 92 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent , 82 MPG @-@ e in city driving and 72 MPG @-@ e in highway . Both the all @-@ electric range and fuel economy ratings are the same for the 2017 model year Volt . 
 In April 2013 , CEO Daniel Akerson announced that GM expects the second generation Volt to be priced on the order of US $ 7 @,@ 000 to US $ 10 @,@ 000 lower than the 2013 model year with the same features . The 2016 Volt pricing will start at US $ 33 @,@ 170 before any available government incentives , plus US $ 825 for destination . The starting price is US $ 1 @,@ 175 lower than the 2015 Volt . In California , order books for the second generation Volt were opened on May 28 , 2015 . 
 In July 2014 , Opel announced that due to the slowdown in sales , the Ampera would be discontinued after the launch of second generation Volt , and between 2014 and 2018 , Opel planned to introduce in Europe a successor product in the electric vehicle segment . General Motors announced in February 2016 that the all @-@ <unk> Opel Ampera @-@ e hatchback will go into production in 2017 . This is the European version of the Chevrolet Bolt EV . 
 In April 2015 , General Motors confirmed that it will not build the second generation Volt in right @-@ hand @-@ drive configuration . Due to low sales , only 246 units had been sold in Australia by mid @-@ April 2015 , the Holden Volt will be discontinued once the remaining stock is sold out .

 Assembly of the Volt was assigned to Detroit / Hamtramck Assembly plant following the conclusion of the 2007 UAW @-@ GM contract talks . For initial production the gasoline engine is being imported from the Opel engine plant in Aspern , Austria . In November 2010 , General Motors began investing US $ 138 @.@ 3 million at its engine operations plant in Flint , Michigan to support increased production of the Ecotec 1 @.@ 4 L engine that is used in the Chevrolet Cruze , the upcoming 2012 Chevrolet Sonic , and the variant used in the Chevrolet Volt . The Flint plant was expected to start production of 400 engines a day in early 2011 , ramp up daily production to 800 engines in late 2011 , and to increase its capacity to 1 @,@ 200 a day by late 2012 . In May 2011 , General Motors decided to invest an additional US $ 84 million at the Flint plant to further increase 1 @.@ 4 L engine production capacity . 
 In 2010 , General Motors planned an initial production for calendar year 2011 of 10 @,@ 000 Volts and 45 @,@ 000 units for 2012 , up from the 30 @,@ 000 units initially announced . In May 2011 , the carmaker again raised its production targets , as Volt and Ampera production capacity was increased to 16 @,@ 000 units in 2011 , including 3 @,@ 500 units for exports and 2 @,@ 500 demonstration units destined to U.S. dealerships , and the rest for U.S. sales . However , in November 2011 GM 's sales chief announced that they would not meet its sales goal of 10 @,@ 000 vehicles in 2011 . 
 Out of the 2012 production , General Motors expected to produce 10 @,@ 000 Amperas for sale in Europe , 6 @,@ 000 destined for Opel and 4 @,@ 000 for Vauxhall in the UK . In addition , 2 @,@ 000 Volts will be made available for the region . By early 2012 GM abandoned its sales target to deliver 45 @,@ 000 Volts in the U.S and instead announced that production in 2012 will depend on demand . By March 2012 the Volt plant has a global production capacity of 60 @,@ 000 vehicles per year . 
 The Volt 's battery cells are produced by LG Chem in South Korea and then shipped to the US , where the battery packs are assembled at a purpose @-@ built facility in Brownstown Charter Township , Michigan owned and operated by General Motors . Compact Power , the North American subsidiary of LG Chem , is building a battery plant in Holland , Michigan to manufacture the advanced battery cells for the Volt and other carmakers , with capacity to produce enough cells for 50 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 battery packs per year . The US $ 303 million Holland plant was funded by 50 % U.S. Department of Energy matching stimulus funds and is planned to open by mid @-@ 2012 . 
 The 2011 Chevrolet Volt was officially launched on November 30 , 2010 at a ceremony at the Hamtramck plant , where the first production unit for retail sale came off the assembly line . The first retail vehicle was delivered to a customer in Denville , New Jersey on December 15 , 2010 . GM reported it had built 12 @,@ 400 Volts in total through December 2011 . This includes dealers ' demo vehicles in North America and Amperas in dealerships in Europe , crash test vehicles and other unavailable Volts owned by GM . 
 GM halted production for about one month at the Detroit / Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades , including the installation of new tooling , equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility . These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production . After the plant retooling , the production rate reached 150 units per day four days a week by August 2011 . The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower @-@ emission version . A four @-@ week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012 . GM said it had around 3 @,@ 600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand . GM also extended the traditional two @-@ week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant . GM closed its Detroit @-@ Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15 , 2012 , affecting roughly 1 @,@ 500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all @-@ new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt . This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production . 
 Production of the 2013 model year Volt began in July 2012 and customer deliveries began during the same month . In October 2012 , GM announced that the Cadillac ELR extended @-@ range luxury coupe will be built at the Detroit @-@ Hamtramck Assembly plant , together with he Chevrolet Volt , Opel Ampera , and Holden Volt . The addition of the ELR to the plant represents an additional US $ 35 million investment , bringing the total product investment to US $ 561 million since December 2009 . The first 2014 ELRs rolled off the production line in late May 2013 . These were pre @-@ production units destined for testing purposes before production for retail customers began at the end of 2013 . Deliveries of the 2014 model year Volt began in August 2013 . Volt sales in the U.S. reached the 50 @,@ 000 unit milestone in October 2013 , with over 60 @,@ 000 vehicles of the Volt / Ampera family sold worldwide . Production of the 2015 model year Volt ended in mid @-@ May 2015 , while manufacturing of pre @-@ production units of the second generation began in March 2015 .

 Sales of the 2011 Chevrolet Volt began in selected markets due to limited initial production , as General Motors ' original target for 2011 was 10 @,@ 000 units . The first cars were delivered in Washington D.C. , the New York City metropolitan region , California , and Austin , Texas . By May 2011 the Volt had been launched also in Connecticut , Maryland , Michigan , New Jersey , and Virginia . Deliveries in Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , North Carolina , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Washington began in the third quarter of 2011 . In June 2011 , Chevrolet dealers nationwide began taking orders for the 2012 Volt , and deliveries in all 50 states began in November 2011 . 
 The suggested retail price ( MSRP ) for the 2011 Chevrolet Volt in the U.S. started at US $ 40 @,@ 280 which excluded destination freight charge , tax , title , license , dealer fees and optional equipment and before any savings due to factory incentives , tax deductions , or other available subsidies for qualifying buyers . The MSRP for the 2012 Volt starts at US $ 39 @,@ 995 including a US $ 850 destination freight charge and excludes tax , title and license fees , or other available government subsidies . The base price is US $ 1 @,@ 005 less than the 2011 model year , and General Motors explained that this price reduction is possible because of a " wider range of options and configurations that come with the expansion of Volt production for sale nationally . " The price will drop to US $ 34 @,@ 995 including destination charges for the 2014 model year . 
 Due to the capacity of the Volt 's battery pack it qualifies for the maximum US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax credit as specified in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 . The federal tax credit phases out over a one @-@ year period after the manufacturer has sold at least 200 @,@ 000 vehicles in the U.S. Several states also have additional incentives or rebates available for plug @-@ in electric vehicles for qualifying buyers . The 2011 Volt price including all available regular production and premium options is US $ 44 @,@ 600 , including destination charges and before tax credits or any subsidies . For the 2012 model year the price of the Volt with all available options is US $ 46 @,@ 265 before tax credits or any subsidies available . 
 Although the Volt 's retail price is higher than its main competitor , the 2011 Nissan Leaf , the lease payment for the Volt is almost the same as its competitor , except that the Leaf has a lower initial payment . General Motors explained that " the apparent disparity between the Volt 's sticker and lease prices is a reflection of the company 's calculation that the vehicle will maintain a very high residual value after three years — significantly higher than that of the LEAF . " 
 The price for the home charging units is US $ 490 plus installation costs . The Voltec is a home @-@ charging unit built by SPX for Volt owners . It is a 240 @-@ volt ( Level II ) charger , and , according to General Motors , can replenish the Volt 's batteries in about four hours . Consumer Reports has advised buyers to budget up to US $ 2 @,@ 000 , as many older homes may need a substantial electrical upgrade because the U.S. National Electrical Code requires that the charger have its own dedicated 220 @-@ volt , 30 @-@ amp circuit . Early buyers can benefit from the federal tax credit available for charging equipment . 
 The 2011 Volt was not submitted for application to the California Air Resources Board 's ( CARB ) Clean Vehicle Rebate Project rebate and therefore was not required to meet the 10 @-@ year 150 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 240 @,@ 000 km ) battery warranty requirement for enhanced advanced technology partial zero @-@ emissions vehicles ( enhAT @-@ PZEV ) . The Volt team explained that for the launch General Motors decided to go with a common national package which includes an 8 @-@ year 100 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 160 @,@ 000 km ) battery warranty . For this reason owners of the 2011 Volt did not qualify for California 's rebates and free access to use carpool lanes even when traveling solo . A third package , scheduled for 2013 , is under development with an E85 flex @-@ fuel engine . General Motors engineering team commented that " introducing two or three packages of an entirely new technology set and platform at the same time wasn 't an option . " 
 In February 2012 General Motors began deliveries of a low emission version destined for California that features a new low emissions package that allows the 2012 Chevrolet Volt to qualify as an enhanced , advanced technology – partial zero emissions vehicle ( enhAT @-@ PZEV ) and have access to California ’ s high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( HOV ) . The new standard California version of the Volt features a modified engine and exhaust components . The catalytic converter was modified to add a secondary air @-@ injection pump that " streams ambient air into the exhaust stream to increase its ability to remove pollutants . " Owners of a 2012 Volt with the low emissions package are eligible to apply for one of 40 @,@ 000 available HOV lane stickers issued to vehicles that qualify as a California AT @-@ PZEV . The permits are handed out on a first @-@ apply , first @-@ served basis . Additionally , the new low emissions package makes the 2012 Volt eligible for owners to receive up to US $ 1 @,@ 500 in state rebates through the state ’ s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project ( CVRP ) . This incentive is in addition to the federal government ’ s US $ 7 @,@ 500 tax credit . Only the 2012 Volts manufactured after February 6 , 2012 , are fitted with the low emission package and sold as standard models in California . Other states where the Volt has solo driving access to HOV lanes are Florida , Georgia , New York and Virginia . 
 U.S. sales 
 Since sales began in December 2010 , a total of 98 @,@ 558 Volts have been sold in the country through June 2016 . The Volt ranked as the all @-@ time top selling plug @-@ in electric car in the United States until February 2015 , when it was surpassed by the all @-@ electric Nissan Leaf in March 2015 . Cumulative Volt sales passed Leaf sales in March 2016 , and became once again the best selling plug @-@ in car in the American market . 
 The top 10 selling states during the first quarter of 2012 were California , Michigan , Florida , Illinois , Texas , New York , Minnesota , Ohio , North Carolina and Maryland . California is the leading market and accounted for almost 23 % of Volt sales during this quarter , followed by Michigan with 6 @.@ 3 % of national sales . In California the leading regional markets are San Francisco , Los Angeles , and San Diego , all metropolitan areas notorious for their high congestion levels and where free access to high @-@ occupancy lanes for solo drivers has been a strong incentive to boost Volt sales in the state . 
 Resale value 
 In May 2011 Kelley Blue Book ( KBB ) projected the 2011 Chevrolet Volt resale value at just over US $ 17 @,@ 000 after 36 months , the length of a typical lease , which represents 42 % of the car 's US $ 41 @,@ 000 suggested retail price ( MSRP ) . KBB explains that even though the residual value seems low , the projection considers that the first 200 @,@ 000 Volts sold will qualify for a US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax credit , which effectively reduces the MSRP to US $ 33 @,@ 500 , making the US $ <unk> 51 % of its original value after the tax credit . In comparison , KBB notes , the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46 % after 36 months . KBB 's estimate assumed gasoline price will be around US $ 4 per gallon in 2014 . For 2012 , Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42 % of its original value after 3 years and 27 % after 5 years . Based on these figures , in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the plug @-@ in electric car category . KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35 @.@ 5 % average due to the US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax credit , which lowers the transaction price and pushes down the residual value . 
 Consumer Reports ' analysis show that many Chevrolets lose about half of their purchase price after three years of ownership , and if the Volt depreciates the same , US $ 17 @,@ 000 seems a reasonable estimate . However , Consumer Reports have noted that fuel @-@ efficient hybrids and diesel models often depreciate far less than most vehicles , which might increase the Volt 's resale value after three years above the US $ 17 @,@ 000 estimate . Additionally , if gasoline prices continue to rise or if the tax credits expire , the demand for used Chevrolet Volts could quickly increase , raising their market value . On the other hand , if the next @-@ generation Volt ’ s battery has twice the capacity and cost less , as General Motors has claimed , the first generation Volts will be obsolete when the new ones come out in 2015 . Considering these assumptions , Consumer Reports considers that " at this point we believe it ’ s still unclear how the Volt will fare . " 
 Pecan Street demonstration project 
 General Motors is sponsoring the Pecan Street demonstration project at the Mueller neighborhood in Austin , Texas . The project objective is to learn the charging patterns of plug @-@ in electric car owners , and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same , which is what the preliminary monitoring found when the plug @-@ in cars return home in the evening . As of June 2013 , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone thanks to GM 's commitment to match the federal government 's US $ 7 @,@ 500 rebate incentive , which halves the purchase price of the Volt .

 Chevrolet began taking orders in May 2011 and deliveries began in September 2011 in major cities only . During 2012 the Volt was the best selling plug @-@ in car in Canada , outselling all other PEVs combined . Despite a 24 % reduction from 2012 sales , the Volt continued as the top selling PEV in the Canadian market in 2013 , and again in 2014 with 1 @,@ 521 units . As of December 2015 , the Volt continued to rank as the top selling plug @-@ in electric car in Canada . Since September 2011 , a total of 6 @,@ 387 Volts have been delivered in Canada through May 2016 . The monthly sales record was set in May 2016 with 270 deliveries . 
 The suggested retail price ( MSRP ) for the 2012 Chevrolet Volt starts at CA $ 41 @,@ 545 ( US $ 42 @,@ 423 in June 2011 ) which excludes any charges , fees , and optional equipment and before any available subsidies or incentives for qualifying buyers . In the Canadian market , the Volt is offered in one standard trim level with two option packages , a Premium Trim Package and a Rear Camera and Park Assist Package . Some provinces are offering Government incentives including Ontario , Quebec ( both at CA $ 8 @,@ 500 US $ 8 @,@ 680 ) and British Columbia has announced their new <unk> BC program in which the Chevrolet Volt qualifies for a CA $ 5 @,@ 000 incentive / rebate as well as CA $ 500 towards charging equipment . 
 = = = Europe = = = 
 The European version of the Volt , the Opel Ampera ( known as the Vauxhall Ampera in the United Kingdom ) , was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show in March 2009 and also was exhibited at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show . Opel developed the battery control modules for the Ampera at the Opel Alternative Propulsion Center Europe in Mainz @-@ Kastel , Germany . The production version of the Ampera was unveiled at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show . The Ampera is assembled at the Detroit / Hamtramck Assembly plant , Michigan . 
 The main differences between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling . The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear fascia , with a large cut @-@ out in the rear bumper . The Opel Ampera features more stylized alloy wheels as standard , and the side skirts are body @-@ colored rather than black . In the inside there are only minor differences and both versions share the same exact powertrain and battery pack . A key operational difference was that the Ampera has four drive modes , one more than the 2011 / 12 model year Volt . The additional option is " City Mode " , which adapts battery management to the needs of commuter travel . City mode or " battery hold " engages the range @-@ extender immediately , allowing to save the energy currently stored in the battery , and when switched off , the range @-@ extender stops and the Ampera is then able to use the energy saved in the battery for pure electric driving , for example for traveling urban areas or restricted zones , such as the European low emission zones or to allow the Ampera to qualify for an exemption of the London congestion charge The 2013 model year Volt included the " Hold Drive " button to allow drivers to conserve battery @-@ pack energy for use at a particular time of their choice . 
 Sales 
 General Motors production target for 2012 was to manufacture 10 @,@ 000 Amperas for sale in Europe , 6 @,@ 000 destined for Opel and 4 @,@ 000 for Vauxhall in the UK , plus an additional 2 @,@ 000 Volts were to be made available for the region . The carmaker targeted the Ampera for business fleet market and local government agencies , where Opel has a strong customer base , while the Volt is aimed at retail customers . According to Opel , by June 2011 around 5 @,@ 000 customers across Europe had reserved an Ampera , with fleet or business customers representing 60 % of reservations , and a total of 7 @,@ 000 orders were received by March 2012 , with Benelux , Germany and the United Kingdom as the top markets in terms of orders . 
 The first deliveries of the Chevrolet Volt in Europe took place on November 30 , 2011 , to the U.S. Embassy in France . Distribution of the Opel Ampera to dealerships began in December 2011 , but deliveries to customers were delayed until February 2012 because Opel decided to wait until the NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt 's battery fire risk after a crash . Since May 2012 the Vauxhall Ampera is available through the Zipcar carsharing club in London , Bristol , Cambridge and Oxford . 
 The Opel / Vauxhall Ampera was Europe 's top selling plug @-@ in electric car in 2012 with 5 @,@ 268 units and captured a 21 @.@ 5 % market share of the region 's plug @-@ in electric passenger car segment . As of October 2013 , the Ampera held a market share of almost 10 % of European registration of plug @-@ in electric cars since 2011 . The market share in the Netherlands was 40 % and 10 % in Germany . Ampera sales fell 40 % in 2013 to 3 @,@ 184 cars , and within the plug @-@ in hybrid segment , the Ampera was surpassed in 2013 by the Mitsubishi Outlander P @-@ HEV ( 8 @,@ 197 ) , Volvo V60 plug @-@ in ( 7 @,@ 437 ) , and the Prius plug @-@ in ( 4 @,@ 314 ) . In 2013 the Ampera ranked eighth among Europe 's top selling plug @-@ in electric vehicles , and its market share fell to about 5 % . During the first five months of 2014 , only 332 units had been sold , down 67 % from the same period in 2013 . In July 2014 , Opel announced that due to the slowdown in sales , the Ampera will be discontinued after the launch of second generation Volt , and between 2014 and 2018 , Opel plans to introduce in Europe a successor product in the electric vehicle segment . Ampera sales totaled 939 units in 2014 , and only 215 units during the first nine months of 2015 . 
 As of December 2015 , Opel / Vauxhall Ampera sales totaled almost 10 @,@ 000 units since 2011 , with the Netherlands as the leading market with 5 @,@ 031 Amperas registered , followed by Germany with 1 @,@ 542 units , and the UK with 1 @,@ 250 units registered by the end of June 2015 . The Netherlands is also the top selling Volt market in Europe with 1 @,@ 062 units registered through December 2014 , > out of about 1 @,@ 750 Volts sold through 2014 . 
 Pricing 
 In February 2011 Opel announced that the Ampera was to be offered for a uniform price throughout the Eurozone at € 42 @,@ 900 ( US $ 56 @,@ 920 in May 2012 ) including VAT , but prices by country may vary due to the trim levels that will be offered in each market . The Chevrolet Volt also has a uniform price that starts at € 41 @,@ 950 ( US $ 55 @,@ 660 in May 2012 ) including VAT . The Opel Ampera is eligible to several subsidies and tax breaks available for plug @-@ in electric vehicles in several European countries . 
 In the UK , the Vauxhall Ampera starts at GB £ 37 @,@ 250 ( US $ 60 @,@ 400 in May 2012 ) before discounting the GB £ 5 @,@ 000 Plug @-@ in Car Grant The Chevrolet Volt will also be available in the UK at a cost of GB £ 33 @,@ 545 ( US $ 54 @,@ 400 in May 2012 ) before the government grant . All Volts in the UK will come standard with leather interior . 
 = = = China = = = 
 General Motors unveiled the Chevrolet Volt in Shanghai under its Chinese name of <unk> ( Wo Lan Da ) in September 2010 . The first Volts , out of the 10 @-@ vehicle demonstration fleet , arrived in China by late December 2011 . The demonstration program is taking place in Beijing , Tianjin and Shanghai . 
 The Volt went on sale in China by late 2011 with pricing starting at CN ¥ 498 @,@ 000 ( around US $ 78 @,@ 300 as of August 2012 ) and sales are limited to eight Chinese cities : Beijing , Shanghai , Hangzhou , Suzhou , Wuxi , Guangzhou , Shenzhen and Foshan . GM explained that 13 dealerships were selected in the eight cities , and they were chosen because these " cities have more elites who are inclined to try new technologies and lead the fashion tide . " 
 However , according to General Motors , in a move illegal under WTO rules the Chinese government refused the allow Chevrolet Volt owners access to up to US $ 19 @,@ 300 in government subsidies available for plug @-@ in vehicles unless GM had agreed to transfer intellectual property to a joint venture with a Chinese automaker for at least one of the Volt ’ s three core technologies : electric motors , complex electronic controls , and power storage devices , whether batteries or a fuel cell . General Motors negotiated with the Chinese government to let the Volt qualify for the subsidies without the technology transfer , but as of November 2011 , the subsidies were available only for electric cars made by Chinese automakers . As a result of the high import duties , General Motors reported in August 2012 that sales are minimal , those of a very low @-@ volume car . According to LMC Automotive , a total of 18 Volts have been sold in China through June 2012 . 
 In March 2012 , General Motors announced that an agreement was signed with the China Automotive Technology and Research Center ( <unk> ) to manage the Volt demonstration fleet in Beijing and to gather feedback from the fleet usage for one year . The demonstration Volts were scheduled to be delivered in April 2012 .

 Deliveries of the Holden Volt in the Australian market began in December 2012 , and the first Volt was delivered to the U.S. Ambassador in Canberra . Pricing starts at A $ 59 @,@ 990 ( around US $ 62 @,@ 598 ) . In November 2011 the first Holden Volt arrived in Australia for a series of evaluation tests . Holden has announced that the Volt underwent numerous modifications to better suit it to Australian roads , although the test vehicles are left @-@ hand drive . 
 The Holden Volt is available to purchase through 49 select Holden dealerships throughout metropolitan and rural Australia , with 18 in Victoria , 11 in New South Wales , 9 in Queensland , 7 in Western Australia and 4 in South Australia . A total of 80 Holden Volts were sold during 2012 , and 101 units in 2013 . A total of 246 Holden Volts had been sold in the country by mid April 2015 , with the stock of the first generation almost empty . General Motors announced that it will not build the second generation Volt in right @-@ hand @-@ drive configuration , so the Volt will be discontinued in the country when the remaining stock is sold out . 
 Brazil 
 General Motors do Brasil announced that it will import from five to ten Volts to Brazil during the first semester of 2011 as part of a demonstration and also to lobby the federal government to enact financial incentives for green cars . If successful , General Motors would adapt the Volt to operate on ethanol fuel , as most new Brazilian cars are flex @-@ fuel .

 = = = EPA fuel economy testing = = = 
 In 2008 , General Motors was concerned about how the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) would test the Volt to determine its official fuel economy rating . The controversy centered on whether , by including a gasoline engine , the Volt should be classified as a hybrid rather than an electric car as claimed by General Motors . If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids , the Volt 's EPA fuel economy rating would be around 48 mpg @-@ US ( 4 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 58 mpg @-@ imp ) due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power . General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA 's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid @-@ electrics . General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method to take into account the range of a plug @-@ in hybrid while running solely on electricity . Because the Volt can travel 40 miles ( 64 km ) on batteries alone , GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode , so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight . 
 The EPA official rating issued in November 2010 included separate fuel economy ratings for all @-@ electric mode and gasoline @-@ only mode , with an overall combined city / highway gasoline @-@ electricity fuel economy rating of 60 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 72 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) . To address the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges , EPA also included in the Volt 's fuel economy label a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios driven between a full charge , and a never @-@ charge scenario . According to this table the Volt 's fuel economy goes up to 168 mpg @-@ US ( 1 @.@ 40 L / 100 km ; 202 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) if driven 45 miles ( 72 km ) between full charges . Also , in recognition of the multiple operating modes that a plug @-@ in hybrid can be built with ( all @-@ electric , blended , and gasoline @-@ only ) , for the new fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory in the U.S. beginning in model year 2013 , EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug @-@ in hybrids . One label is for extended @-@ range electric vehicles , like the Chevy Volt , with two modes : all @-@ electric and gasoline @-@ only ; and a second label for blended mode that includes a combination of all @-@ electric , gasoline and electric operation , and gasoline only , like a conventional hybrid vehicle . 
 = = = EPA fuel economy rating = = = 
 In August 2009 , General Motors released its estimated city fuel economy rating for the Volt of 230 mpg @-@ US ( 1 @.@ 0 L / 100 km ; 280 mpg @-@ imp ) of gasoline plus 25 kWh / 100 mi ( 560 kJ / km ) of electricity using the EPA 's proposed method for evaluating plug @-@ in hybrids . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued a statement clarifying that the " EPA has not tested a Chevy Volt and therefore cannot confirm the fuel economy values claimed by GM . " In July 2010 , GM explained that their estimate was based on a formula that had not been officially approved and that they had been awaiting the EPA 's decision on how the equivalent fuel economy of plug @-@ in hybrids would be estimated . 
 The official EPA rating was issued in November 2010 and became the agency 's first fuel economy label for a plug @-@ in hybrids . The EPA rated the 2011 Volt combined fuel economy at 93 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) in all @-@ electric mode , and 37 mpg @-@ US ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 44 mpg @-@ imp ) in gasoline @-@ only mode , for an overall combined fuel economy rating of 60 mpg @-@ US ( 3 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 72 mpg @-@ imp ) equivalent ( MPG @-@ e ) . The label also shows the combined city @-@ highway fuel economy in all @-@ electric mode expressed in traditional energy consumption units , rating the Volt at 36 kWh per 100 miles ( 160 km ) .

 In 2009 , the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry said that " GM is at least one generation behind Toyota on advanced , “ green ” powertrain development . In an attempt to leapfrog Toyota , GM has devoted significant resources to the Chevy Volt . " and that " while the Chevy Volt holds promise , it is currently projected to be much more expensive than its gasoline @-@ fueled peers and will likely need substantial reductions in manufacturing cost in order to become commercially viable . " A 2009 Carnegie Mellon University study found that a PHEV @-@ 40 will be less cost effective than a HEV or a PHEV @-@ 7 in all of the scenarios considered , due to the cost and weight of the battery . Jon Lauckner , a Vice President at General Motors , responded that the study did not consider the inconvenience of a 7 miles ( 11 km ) electric range and that the study 's cost estimate of US $ 1 @,@ 000 per kWh for the Volt 's battery pack was " many hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour higher " than what it costs to make today . " 
 In early 2010 , it was reported that General Motors would lose money on the Volt for at least the first couple of generations , but it hoped the car would create a green image that could rival the Prius . 
 After the Volt 's sales price was announced in July 2010 , there was concern expressed of the launch price of the Volt and its affordability and resulting popularity , especially when the federal subsidies of US $ 2 @.@ 4 billion were taken into account in the development of the car . 
 General Motors CEO Edward Whitacre Jr. rejected as " ridiculous " criticism that the Volt 's price is too expensive . He said that " I think it 's a very fair price . It 's the only car that will go coast to coast on electricity without plugging it in , and nobody else can come close . " Despite the federal government being the major GM shareholder due to the 2009 government @-@ led bankruptcy of the automaker , during a press briefing at the White House a Treasury official clarified that the federal government did not have any input on the pricing of the 2011 Chevrolet Volt . 
 There have also been complaints regarding price markups due to the initial limited availability in 2010 of between US $ 5 @,@ 000 to US $ 12 @,@ 000 above the recommended price , and at least in one case a US $ 20 @,@ 000 mark up in California . Even though the carmaker cannot dictate vehicle pricing to its dealers , GM said that it had requested its dealers to keep prices in line with the company ’ s suggested retail price . 
 In May 2011 the National Legal and Policy Center announced that some Chevrolet dealers were selling Volts to other dealers and claiming the US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax credit for themselves . Then the dealers who bought the Volts sell them as used cars with low mileage to private buyers , who no longer qualify for the credit . General Motors acknowledged that 10 dealer @-@ to @-@ dealer Volt sales had taken place among Chevrolet dealers , but the carmaker said they do not encourage such practice . 
 In September 2012 , Reuters published an opinion / editorial article where it claimed that General Motors , nearly two years after the introduction of the car , was losing US $ 49 @,@ 000 on each Volt it built . The article concluded that the Volt is " over @-@ engineered and over @-@ priced " and that its technological complexity has put off many prospective buyers , due to fears the car may be unreliable . GM executives replied that Reuters ' estimates were significantly flawed as they also allocated the vehicle 's research and development program costs only against the number of Volts sold in the United States ( as of August 2012 ) , instead of spreading the total costs over the entire lifetime of the model , as well as including those units sold in Europe and other countries . GM explained that the investments will pay off once the innovative technologies of the Volt are applied across multiple current and future products . 
 = = = Battery pack fire risk = = = 
 In June 2011 a Volt that had been subjected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) to a 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) side pole impact crash test followed by a post @-@ impact rollover , caught fire three weeks later in the test center parking lot , burning nearby vehicles . The battery was found to be the source of the fire . After the fire , both Chevrolet and the NHTSA independently replicated the crash test and a subsequent vehicle rotation procedure to test for any fluid leakage , but in their first attempt they could not reproduce the conditions under which the battery pack ignited . The NHTSA said it had " concluded that the crash test damaged the Volt ’ s lithium @-@ ion battery and that the damage led to a vehicle fire that took several weeks to develop . " In further testing of the Volt 's batteries carried out by NHTSA in November 2011 , two of the three tests resulted in thermal events . One battery pack was rotated 180 degrees within hours after it was impacted and began to smoke and emit sparks after rotation . In the other case , the battery pack that was crashed @-@ tested one week earlier and that had been monitored since the test caught fire . The NHTSA then took an uncommon step on November 25 , 2011 and opened a formal safety defect investigation " without any data from real @-@ world incidents " to examine the potential risks involved from intrusion damage to the battery pack in the Chevrolet Volt . After the initial Volt fire , the NHTSA examined the Nissan Leaf and other plug @-@ in electric vehicles and said its testing “ has not raised safety concerns about vehicles other than the Chevy Volt . ” 
 As a result of this investigation , GM announced that it would offer any new GM car in exchange to any Volt owner who has concerns while the federal investigation was taking place . In December 2011 , the company said that if necessary they were prepared to recall all the vehicles and repair them upon determination of the cause of the fires , and also announced they would buy back the car if the owner was too afraid of the potential for a fire . GM 's CEO also said that it may be necessary to redesign or make changes to the battery pack depending on the recommendations from federal officials . As of December 1 , 33 Volt owners in the U.S. and 3 in Canada had requested a loaner car . As of December 5 , General Motors reported that a couple dozen Volt owners had requested the carmaker to buy back their cars , and the company had already agreed to repurchase about a dozen . Before the carmaker agrees to buy back each vehicle , other options are explored as GM primarily wants to provide loaner cars , but " if the only way we can make them happy is to repurchase it , then we will , " a GM spokesman said . General Motors explained that the buy back price includes the Volt purchase price , plus taxes and fees , less a usage fee based on how many miles the car has been run . As of January 5 , 2012 , GM reported that around 250 Volt owners had requested either a loaner vehicle or a potential buyback . 
 The NHTSA also said it was working with all automakers to develop postcrash procedures to keep occupants of electric vehicles and emergency personnel who respond to crash scenes safe . Additionally , NHTSA advised to be aware that fires may occur a considerable amount of time after a crash . General Motors said the first fire would have been avoided if GM 's protocols for deactivating the battery after the crash had been followed . These protocols had been used by GM since July 2011 but were not shared with the NHTSA until November 2011 . In another statement the carmaker stated that they “ are working with other vehicle manufacturers , first responders , tow truck operators , and salvage associations with the goal of implementing industrywide protocols . ” 
 Customer deliveries of the Opel Ampera in Europe were delayed until the NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt 's battery fire risk to make sure the vehicle is safe . However , deliveries of the first Chevrolet Volts in Europe began in France in November 2011 . Deliveries of the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK continued as scheduled for May 2012 . Opel Ampera deliveries began in February 2012 . 
 Battery enhancements 
 On January 5 , 2012 , General Motors announced that it would offer a customer @-@ satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident . The carmaker described the modifications as voluntary enhancements and stated that neither the car nor the battery was being recalled . General Motors determined the June fire was the result of a minor intrusion from a portion of the vehicle into a side section of the battery pack . This intrusion resulted in a small coolant leak inside the battery of approximately 50 mL ( 1 @.@ 8 imp fl oz ; 1 @.@ 7 US fl oz ) . When the vehicle was put through a slow roll , where it was rotated at 90 @-@ degree increments , holding in each position for about five minutes , an additional 1 liter ( 0 @.@ 22 imp gal ; 0 @.@ 26 U.S. gal ) of coolant leaked . With the vehicle in the 180 degrees position ( upside down ) , the coolant came in contact with the printed circuit board electronics at the top of the battery pack and later crystallized . Three weeks later this condition , in combination with a charged battery , led to a short circuit that resulted in the post @-@ crash fire . 
 General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash . The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt ’ s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision ; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels ; and add a tamper @-@ resistant bracket to the top of the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill . The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of 2 to 3 lb ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 36 kg ) , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack , reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack . 
 During December 2011 , GM conducted four crash tests of Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system , resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage . On December 22 , 2011 , the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt to the same test that led to the original fire , with no signs of the damage that is believed to have been the cause . The NHTSA said “ the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion ” though its investigation remained open . General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost . 
 All 12 @,@ 400 Chevrolet Volts produced until December 2011 , including all Amperas in stock at European dealerships , were scheduled to receive the safety enhancements . Since production was halted during the holidays , the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012 . Sales continued , and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock . General Motors sent a letter to Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012 . General Motors also decided to replace the 120 @-@ volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10 @,@ 000 Volts sold since late 2010 . The new cords were enhanced to add durability , and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords . 
 NHTSA findings 
 On January 20 , 2012 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed the Volt 's safety defect investigation related to post @-@ crash fire risk . The agency concluded that " no discernible defect trend exists " and also found that the modifications recently developed by General Motors are sufficient to reduce the potential for battery intrusion resulting from side impacts . The NHTSA also said that " based on the available data , NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline @-@ powered vehicles . " The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community , law enforcement officers , tow truck operators , storage facilities and consumers . 
 House of Representatives hearing 
 The chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs , Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending , U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25 , 2012 , to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only five months after the first postcrash battery fire occurred in June . The subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials , including from NHTSA , purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons . Both Daniel Akerson , General Motors CEO , and David L. Strickland , NHTSA administrator , denied any wrongdoing .

 = Arthur , Prince of Wales = 
 Arthur Tudor ( 20 September 1486 – 2 April 1502 ) was Prince of Wales , Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall . As the eldest son and heir apparent of Henry VII of England , Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor . His mother , Elizabeth of York , was the daughter of Edward IV , and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York . 
 Plans for Arthur 's marriage began before his third birthday ; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later . He grew especially close to his siblings Margaret and Henry , Duke of York , with the latter of whom he shared some tutors . At the age of eleven , Arthur was formally betrothed to Catherine of Aragon , a daughter of the powerful Catholic Monarchs in Spain , in an effort to forge an Anglo @-@ Spanish alliance against France . Arthur was well educated and , contrary to modern belief , was in good health for the majority of his life . Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501 , the couple took up residence at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire , where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment . Catherine would later firmly state that the marriage had not been consummated . 
 One year after Arthur 's death , Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur 's brother Henry , who had by then become Prince of Wales . Arthur 's untimely death paved the way for Henry 's accession as Henry VIII in 1509 . The potential for a question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine 's marriage , was much later ( and in a completely different political context ) exploited by Henry VIII and his Court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine 's union with Henry , eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church . 
 = = Infancy = = 
 In 1485 , Henry Tudor became King of England upon defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth . In an effort to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne and emphasise his family 's Welsh , that is to say Romano @-@ British , ancestry , Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary King Arthur . On this occasion , Camelot was identified as present @-@ day Winchester , and his wife , Elizabeth of York , was sent to Saint Swithun 's Priory ( today Winchester Cathedral Priory ) in order to give birth there . Born at Saint Swithun 's Priory on 20 September 1486 at about 1 am , Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth 's eldest child . Arthur 's birth was anticipated by French and Italian humanists eager for the start of a " Virgilian golden age " . Sir Francis Bacon wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature , he was " strong and able " . Young Arthur was viewed as " a living symbol " of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York , but also of the end of the Wars of the Roses . In the opinion of contemporaries , Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor . 
 Arthur became Duke of Cornwall at birth . Four days after his birth , the baby was baptised at Winchester Cathedral by the Bishop of Worcester , John Alcock , and his baptism was immediately followed by his Confirmation . John de Vere , 13th Earl of Oxford , Thomas Stanley , 1st Earl of Derby , William FitzAlan , 16th Earl of Arundel , Queen Elizabeth Woodville and Cecily of York served as godparents ; the latter two carried the prince during the ceremony . Initially , Arthur 's nursery in Farnham was headed by Elizabeth Darcy , who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV 's children , including Arthur 's own mother . After Arthur was created Prince of Wales in 1490 , he was awarded a household structure at the behest of his father . Over the next thirteen years , Henry VII and Elizabeth would have six more children , of whom only three – Margaret , Henry and Mary – would reach adulthood . Arthur was especially close to his sister Margaret ( b . 1489 ) and his brother Henry ( b . 1491 ) , with whom he shared a nursery . 
 On 29 November 1489 , after being made a Knight of the Bath , Arthur was appointed Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester , and was invested as such at the Palace of Westminster on 27 February 1490 . As part of his investiture ceremony , he progressed down the River Thames in the royal barge and was met at Chelsea by the Lord Mayor of London , John <unk> , and at Lambeth by Spanish ambassadors . On 8 May 1491 , he was made a Knight of the Garter at Saint George 's Chapel at Windsor Palace . It was around this time that Arthur began his formal education under John Rede , a former headmaster of Winchester College . His education was subsequently taken over by Bernard André , a blind poet , and then by Thomas Linacre , formerly Henry VII 's physician . Arthur 's education covered grammar , poetry , rhetoric and ethics and focused on history . Arthur was a very skilled pupil and André wrote that the Prince of Wales had either memorised or read a selection of Homer , Virgil , Ovid , Terence , a good deal of Cicero and a wide span of historical works , including those of Thucydides , Caesar , Livy and Tacitus . Arthur was also a " superb archer " , and had learned to dance " right pleasant and honourably " by 1501 . { { <unk> | Gunn | Monckton | 2009 | p = 9 } 00 } 
 = = Childhood = = 
 The popular belief that Arthur was sickly during his lifetime stems from a Victorian misunderstanding of a letter from 1502 ; on the contrary , there are no reports of Arthur being ill during his lifetime . Arthur grew up to be unusually tall for his age , and was considered handsome by the Spanish court : he had reddish hair , small eyes , a high @-@ bridged nose and resembled his brother Henry , who was said to be " extremely handsome " by contemporaries . As described by historians Steven Gunn and Linda Monckton , Arthur had an " amiable and gentle " personality and was , overall , a " delicate lad " . 
 In May 1490 Arthur was created warden of all the marches towards Scotland and the Earl of Surrey was appointed as the Prince 's deputy . From 1491 , Arthur was named on peace commissions . In October 1492 , when his father travelled to France , he was named Keeper of England and King 's Lieutenant . Following the example of Edward IV , Henry VII set up the Council of Wales and the Marches for Arthur in Wales , in order to enforce royal authority there . Although the council had already been set up in 1490 , it was headed by Jasper Tudor , Duke of Bedford . Arthur was first dispatched to Wales in 1501 , at the age of fifteen . In March 1493 , Arthur was granted the power to appoint justices of oyer and terminer and inquire into franchises , thus strengthening the council 's authority . In November of that year , the Prince also received an extensive land grant in Wales , including the County of March . 
 Arthur was served by sons of English , Irish and Welsh nobility , such as <unk> Óg FitzGerald , 9th Earl of Kildare , who had been brought to the English court as a consequence of the involvement of his father , Gerald Fitzgerald , 8th Earl of Kildare , in the crowning of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII 's reign . Other servants were Anthony Willoughby , a son of Robert Willoughby , 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke , Robert Radcliffe , the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John , a favourite nephew of Arthur 's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort . He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas , the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Thomas ap Rhys , Gruffydd grew quite close to Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521 , alongside the Prince 's tomb . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Henry VII planned to marry Arthur to a daughter of the Catholic Monarchs , Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , in order to forge an Anglo @-@ Spanish alliance against France . It was suggested that the choice of marrying Arthur to Ferdinand and Isabella 's youngest daughter , Catherine ( b . 1485 ) , would be appropriate . The Treaty of Medina del Campo ( 27 March 1489 ) provided that Arthur and Catherine would be married as soon as they reached canonical age ; it also settled Catherine 's dowry at 200 @,@ 000 crowns ( the equivalent of £ 5 million in 2007 ) . Since Arthur , not yet 14 , was below the age of consent , a papal dispensation ( i.e. , waiver ) allowing the marriage was issued in February 1497 , and the pair were betrothed by proxy on 25 August 1497 . Two years later , a marriage by proxy took place at Arthur 's <unk> Manor in Bewdley , near Worcester ; Arthur said to Roderigo de Puebla , who had acted as proxy for Catherine , that " he much rejoiced to contract the marriage because of his deep and sincere love for the Princess " . 
 In a letter from October 1499 , Arthur , referring to Catherine as " my dearest spouse " , had written : 
 " I cannot tell you what an earnest desire I feel to see your Highness , and how vexatious to me is this procrastination about your coming . Let [ it ] be hastened , [ that ] the love conceived between us and the wished @-@ for joys may reap their proper fruit . " 
 The young couple exchanged letters in Latin until 20 September 1501 , when Arthur , having attained the age of 15 , was deemed old enough to be married . Catherine landed in England about two weeks later , on 2 October 1501 , at Plymouth . The next month , on 4 November 1501 , the couple met each other for the first time at Dogmersfield in Hampshire . Arthur wrote to Catherine 's parents that he would be " a true and loving husband " ; the couple soon discovered that they had mastered different pronunciations of Latin and so were unable to communicate . Five days later , on 9 November 1501 , Catherine arrived in London . 
 On 14 November 1501 , the marriage ceremony finally took place at Saint Paul 's Cathedral ; both Arthur and Catherine wore white satin . The ceremony was conducted by Henry Deane , Archbishop of Canterbury , who was assisted by William Warham , Bishop of London . Following the ceremony , Arthur and Catherine left the Cathedral and headed for Baynard 's Castle , where they were entertained by " the best voiced children of the King 's chapel , who sang right sweetly with quaint harmony " . 
 What followed was a ceremony laid down by Arthur 's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort : the bed was sprinkled with holy water , after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting . She was undressed , veiled and " reverently " laid in bed , while Arthur , " in his shirt , with a gown cast about him " , was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber , while viols and tabors played . The Bishop of London blessed the bed and prayed for the marriage to be fruitful , after which the couple were left alone . This is the only public bedding of a royal couple recorded in Britain in the 16th century . 
 = = Death = = 
 After residing at <unk> Manor for a month , Arthur and Catherine headed for the marches in Wales , where they established their household at Ludlow Castle . Arthur had been growing weaker since his wedding , and although Catherine was reluctant to follow him , she was ordered by Henry VII to join her husband . Arthur found it easy to govern Wales , as the border had become quiet after many centuries of warfare . In March 1502 , Arthur and Catherine were afflicted by an unknown illness , " a malign vapour which proceeded from the air " . While Catherine recovered , Arthur died on 2 April 1502 at Ludlow , six months short of his sixteenth birthday . 
 News of Arthur 's death reached Henry VII 's court late on 4 April . The King was awoken from his sleep by his confessor , who quoted Job by asking Henry " If we receive good things at the hands of God , why may we not endure evil things ? " He then told the king that " [ his ] dearest son hath departed to God " , and Henry burst into tears . " Grief @-@ stricken and emotional " , he then had his wife brought into his chambers , so that they might " take the painful news together " ; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and " had ever preserved him " , adding that they had been left with " yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was , and [ they were ] both young enough " . Soon after leaving Henry 's bedchamber , Elizabeth collapsed and began to cry , while the ladies sent for the King , who hurriedly came and " relieved her " . 
 On 8 April , a general procession took place for the salvation of Arthur 's soul . That night , a dirge was sung in St Paul 's Cathedral and every parish church in London . On 23 April , Arthur 's body , which had previously been embalmed , sprinkled with holy water and sheltered with a canopy , was carried out of Ludlow Castle and into the Parish Church of Ludlow by various noblemen and gentlemen . On 25 April , Arthur 's body was taken to Worcester Cathedral via the River Severn , in a " special wagon upholstered in black and drawn by six horses , also caparisoned in black " . As was customary , Catherine did not attend the funeral . The Earl of Surrey acted as chief mourner . At the end of the ceremony , Sir William <unk> , Sir Richard Croft and Arthur 's household ushers broke their staves of office and threw them into the Prince 's grave . During the funeral , Arthur 's own arms were shown alongside those of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd and Brutus of Troy . Two years later , a chantry was erected over Arthur 's grave . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Shortly after Arthur 's death , the idea of <unk> the now @-@ widowed Catherine to the new heir , Henry , had arisen ; both the King and Isabella were keen on moving forward with the betrothal , and the pope granted a dispensation towards that end . After originally rejecting the idea , Henry announced , after his succession on 22 April 1509 , that he would marry Catherine . The wedding took place on 11 June . Catherine bore Henry six children : three sons died before reaching three months of age , a daughter was stillborn and another lived for only a week . The couple 's only surviving child was Mary I ( b . 1516 ) . 
 In 1526 , after eighteen years of marriage , Henry started to pursue the affections of Anne Boleyn , the sister of his former mistress , Mary Boleyn . At the same time , he became troubled by what became known as the King 's " great matter " , that is , finding an appropriate solution for his lack of male descendants . He found several possible options . He could have attempted to legitimise his illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy , but this would not be easy and would require the Pope 's intervention . He could have married his daughter Mary off and hoped for a grandson ; this was not seen as a real option , because Mary was a sickly child and was unlikely to conceive before Henry 's death . Finally , he could somehow reject Catherine and marry a bride more likely to bear children . Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne , the third was ultimately the most viable option to Henry , and it soon became the King 's wish to dissolve his marriage . 
 Henry believed that his marriage was cursed and found confirmation in the Bible , in Leviticus 20 : 21 . Although in the morning following his wedding , Arthur had claimed that he was thirsty " for I have been in the midst of Spain last night " and that " having a wife is a good pastime " , these claims are generally dismissed by modern historians as mere boasts of a boy who did not want others to know of his failure , and Catherine maintained the claim that she had married Henry while still a virgin until the day she died . After Henry 's constant support of the claim that Catherine 's first marriage had been consummated , an annulment was issued on 23 April 1533 , while the King had already married Anne on 25 January . Anne was beheaded for high treason in 1536 , after which Henry proceeded to marry four more times . At the time of his death in 1547 , Henry only had three living children ; his only son , Edward VI succeeded but died six years later . His successors were Henry 's daughters by Catherine and Anne , Mary I and Elizabeth I. Upon Elizabeth 's death in 1603 , the male line of the House of Tudor came to an end . 
 In 2002 , following the initiative of canon Ian MacKenzie , Arthur 's funeral was reenacted with a requiem mass at Worcester Cathedral , on occasion of the quincentenary of his death . Despite his role in English history , Arthur has remained largely forgotten since his death . 
 = = Popular culture = = 
 Arthur has been featured in several historical fiction novels , such as The King 's Pleasure , by Norah Lofts and Katherine , The Virgin Widow , by Jean Plaidy . In The Constant Princess , by Philippa Gregory , Catherine promises Arthur to marry his brother , thus fulfilling not only her own destiny of becoming Queen of England , but also the couple 's plans for the future of the kingdom . The Alteration , by Kingsley Amis , is an alternate history novel centred on the " War of the English Succession " , during which Henry VIII attempts to usurp the throne of his nephew , Stephen II , Arthur and Catherine 's son . 
 The historical drama The Six Wives of Henry VIII was broadcast in 1970 , with Martin Ratcliffe as " Prince Arthur " . In 1972 , BBC2 aired a historical miniseries titled The Shadow of the Tower , with " Lord Arthur , Prince of Wales " played by Jason Kemp .

 = Bede = 
 Bede ( / <unk> / <unk> ; Old English : <unk> or Bēda ; 672 / 673 – 26 May 735 ) , also referred to as Saint Bede or the Venerable Bede ( Latin : Bēda <unk> ) , was an English monk at the monastery of Saint Peter at Monkwearmouth and its companion monastery , Saint Paul 's , in modern Jarrow ( see Monkwearmouth @-@ Jarrow ) , Tyne and Wear , both of which were then in the Kingdom of Northumbria . He is well known as an author and scholar , and his most famous work , Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ( The Ecclesiastical History of the English People ) gained him the title " The Father of English History " . 
 In 1899 , Bede was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII ; he is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation ( Anselm of Canterbury , also a Doctor of the Church , was originally from Italy ) . Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator , and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo @-@ Saxons , contributing significantly to English Christianity . Bede 's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by Eusebius and Orosius , among many others . 
 = = Life = = 
 Almost everything that is known of Bede 's life is contained in the last chapter of his Historia ecclesiastica , a history of the church in England . It was completed in about 731 , and Bede implies that he was then in his fifty @-@ ninth year , which would give a birth date in 672 or 673 . A minor source of information is the letter by his disciple Cuthbert which relates Bede 's death . Bede , in the Historia , gives his birthplace as " on the lands of this monastery " . He is referring to the twinned monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow , in modern @-@ day Sunderland , claimed as his birthplace ; there is also a tradition that he was born at Monkton , two miles from the monastery at Jarrow . Bede says nothing of his origins , but his connections with men of noble ancestry suggest that his own family was well @-@ to @-@ do . Bede 's first abbot was Benedict Biscop , and the names " Biscop " and " Beda " both appear in a king list of the kings of Lindsey from around 800 , further suggesting that Bede came from a noble family . 
 Bede 's name reflects West Saxon <unk> ( Northumbrian <unk> , Anglian Bēda ) . It is an Anglo @-@ Saxon short name formed on the root of <unk> " to bid , command " . The name also occurs in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , <unk> 501 , as <unk> , one of the sons of the Saxon founder of Portsmouth . The Liber Vitae of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name , one of whom is presumably Bede himself . Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert , one of Bede 's works , mention that Cuthbert 's own priest was named Bede ; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the Liber Vitae . 
 At the age of seven , Bede was sent to the monastery of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith . Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk . It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys , particularly those of noble birth , to be fostered out ; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England . Monkwearmouth 's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682 , and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year . The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day ; it is dated 23 April 685 , and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day @-@ to @-@ day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church . In 686 , plague broke out at Jarrow . The Life of Ceolfrith , written in about 710 , records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices ; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy , who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith . The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained . The young boy was almost certainly Bede , who would have been about 14 . 
 When Bede was about 17 years old , Adomnan , the abbot of Iona Abbey , visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow . Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit , and it may be that Adomnan sparked Bede 's interest in the Easter dating controversy . In about 692 , in Bede 's nineteenth year , Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop , John , who was bishop of Hexham . The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25 ; Bede 's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional , but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded . There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon ; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices . In Bede 's thirtieth year ( about 702 ) , he became a priest , with the ordination again performed by Bishop John . 
 In about 701 Bede wrote his first works , the De Arte <unk> and De <unk> et <unk> ; both were intended for use in the classroom . He continued to write for the rest of his life , eventually completing over 60 books , most of which have survived . Not all his output can be easily dated , and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years . His last @-@ surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York , a former student , written in 734 . A 6th @-@ century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University ; it is known as the Codex <unk> . Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow , one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence . Bede was a teacher as well as a writer ; he enjoyed music , and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular . It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment , but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert . Translations of this phrase differ , and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem , or merely that he was inspired by the saint 's works . 
 In 708 , some monks at Hexham accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work De <unk> . The standard theological view of world history at the time was known as the six ages of the world ; in his book , Bede calculated the age of the world for himself , rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville , and came to the conclusion that Christ had been born 3 @,@ 952 years after the creation of the world , rather than the figure of over 5 @,@ 000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians . The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham , Wilfrid , who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation . Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation , but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede , who replied within a few days to the monk , writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid . Bede had another brush with Wilfrid , for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid , sometime between 706 and 709 , and discussed Æthelthryth , the abbess of Ely . Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695 , and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life , as Wilfrid had been her advisor . 
 In 733 , Bede travelled to York to visit Ecgbert , who was then bishop of York . The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735 , and it is likely that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit . Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734 , but was too ill to make the journey . Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne , and at some point visited the otherwise @-@ unknown monastery of a monk named <unk> , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk . Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles , and due to the fact that many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents , it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places , although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed . It seems certain that he did not visit Rome , however , as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica . Nothhelm , a correspondent of Bede 's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome , is known to have visited Bede , though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm 's visit to Rome . 
 Except for a few visits to other monasteries , his life was spent in a round of prayer , observance of the monastic discipline and study of the Sacred Scriptures . He was considered the most learned man of his time , and wrote excellent biblical and historical books . 
 Bede died on Thursday , 26 May 735 ( Ascension Day ) on the floor of his cell , singing Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit and was buried at Jarrow . Cuthbert , a disciple of Bede 's , wrote a letter to a <unk> ( of whom nothing else is known ) , describing Bede 's last days and his death . According to Cuthbert , Bede fell ill , " with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain " , before Easter . On the Tuesday , two days before Bede died , his breathing became worse and his feet swelled . He continued to dictate to a scribe , however , and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day . At three o 'clock , according to Cuthbert , he asked for a box of his to be brought , and distributed among the priests of the monastery " a few treasures " of his : " some pepper , and napkins , and some incense " . That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe , a boy named <unk> , and died soon afterwards . Cuthbert 's letter also relates a five @-@ line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed , known as " Bede 's Death Song " . It is the most @-@ widely copied Old English poem , and appears in 45 manuscripts , but its attribution to Bede is not certain — not all manuscripts name Bede as the author , and the ones that do are of later origin than those that do not . Bede 's remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century ; his tomb there was looted in 1541 , but the contents were probably re @-@ interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral . 
 One further oddity in his writings is that in one of his works , the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles , he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married . The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first @-@ person view . Bede says : " Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray . " Another passage , in the Commentary on Luke , also mentions a wife in the first person : " Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ . " The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device . 
 = = Works = = 
 Bede wrote scientific , historical and theological works , reflecting the range of his writings from music and metrics to exegetical Scripture commentaries . He knew patristic literature , as well as Pliny the Elder , Virgil , Lucretius , Ovid , Horace and other classical writers . He knew some Greek . 
 Bede 's scriptural commentaries employed the allegorical method of interpretation and his history includes accounts of miracles , which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history . Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world @-@ view of Early Medieval scholars . 
 He dedicated his work on the Apocalypse and the De Temporum Ratione to the successor of <unk> as abbot , <unk> . 
 Although Bede is mainly studied as a historian now , in his time his works on grammar , chronology , and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works . The non @-@ historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian renaissance . He has been credited with writing a penitential , though his authorship of this work is still very much disputed . 
 = = Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum = = 
 Bede 's best @-@ known work is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum , or An Ecclesiastical History of the English People , completed in about 731 . Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus , abbot of St Augustine 's Abbey , Canterbury . The first of the five books begins with some geographical background , and then sketches the history of England , beginning with Caesar 's invasion in 55 BC . A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain , including the martyrdom of St Alban , is followed by the story of Augustine 's mission to England in 597 , which brought Christianity to the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604 , and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria . These ended in disaster when Penda , the pagan king of Mercia , killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632 . The setback was temporary , and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy . The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby , traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history . The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury , and recounts Wilfrid 's efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex . The fifth book brings the story up to Bede 's day , and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia , and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter . Bede wrote a preface for the work , in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf , king of Northumbria . The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book ; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it , and he may even have been able to read it . The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy , and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf 's approval ; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede 's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility . 
 = = = Models and style = = = 
 Bede 's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history . His introduction imitates the work of Orosius , and his title is an echo of Eusebius 's Historia Ecclesiastica . Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the Acts of the Apostles as the model for the overall work : where Eusebius used the Acts as the theme for his description of the development of the church , Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo @-@ Saxon church . Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative , as Eusebius had done . Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times . For example , he almost always uses the terms " Australes " and " Occidentales " for the South and West Saxons respectively , but in a passage in the first book he uses " Meridiani " and " <unk> " instead , as perhaps his informant had done . At the end of the work , Bede added a brief autobiographical note ; this was an idea taken from Gregory of Tours ' earlier History of the Franks . 
 Bede 's work as a hagiographer , and his detailed attention to dating , were both useful preparations for the task of writing the Historia Ecclesiastica . His interest in computus , the science of calculating the date of Easter , was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo @-@ Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date . 
 Bede is described by Michael Lapidge as " without question the most accomplished <unk> produced in these islands in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period " . His Latin has been praised for its clarity , but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple . He knew rhetoric , and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation , depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words . However , unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm , whose Latin is full of difficulties , Bede 's own text is easy to read . In the words of Charles Plummer , one of the best @-@ known editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica , Bede 's Latin is " clear and limpid ... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence ... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his <unk> style . " 
 = = = Intent = = = 
 Bede 's primary intention in writing the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show the growth of the united church throughout England . The native Britons , whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans , earn Bede 's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons ; by the end of the Historia the English , and their Church , are dominant over the Britons . This goal , of showing the movement towards unity , explains Bede 's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter : much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute , including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664 . Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English , despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing . He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example , and to entertain , and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote . 
 N.J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf , the Northumbrian king . Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church , as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters . 
 Bede 's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian , but do not accept the possibility of miracles . Yet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth , expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day . Bede , like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia , felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher , truer faith , and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct . 
 = = = <unk> and biases = = = 
 Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of Wilfrid , a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day . This may be because Wilfrid 's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede 's monastic mind ; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid 's life , divisive and controversial as they were , simply did not fit with Bede 's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church . 
 Bede 's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by Procopius , who was writing in the sixth century . Frank Stenton describes this omission as " a scholar 's dislike of the indefinite " ; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede 's didactic purposes had no interest for him . 
 Bede was a Northumbrian , and this tinged his work with a local bias . The sources he had access to gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas . He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex , omitting , for example , any mention of Boniface , a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard , though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent . He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm , a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity . He lists seven kings of the Anglo @-@ Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium , or overlordship ; only one king of Wessex , Ceawlin , is listed , and none from Mercia , though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held . Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints . 
 Bede relates the story of Augustine 's mission from Rome , and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo @-@ Saxons . This , combined with Gildas 's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasions , led Bede to a very critical view of the native church . However , Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine 's mission , the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest , which , in the words of Barbara Yorke , would have naturally " curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo @-@ Saxons from the British clergy . " 
 = = = Use of Anno Domini = = = 
 At the time Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica , there were two common ways of referring to dates . One was to use <unk> , which were 15 @-@ year cycles , counting from 312 AD . There were three different varieties of indiction , each starting on a different day of the year . The other approach was to use regnal years — the reigning Roman emperor , for example , or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion . This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms , the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved . Bede used both these approaches on occasion , but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating : the anno domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus . Although Bede did not invent this method , his adoption of it , and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione , his work on chronology , is the main reason why it is now so widely used . 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied often in the Middle Ages , and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive . About half of those are located on the European continent , rather than on the British Isles . Most of the <unk> and 9th @-@ century texts of Bede 's Historia come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire . This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work , of which another 100 or so survive . It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482 , probably at Strasbourg , France . Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively , and a number of editions have been produced . For many years , early Anglo @-@ Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia , but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did . The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede 's works , the aim of all his scholarship , a belief common among historians in the past , is no longer accepted by most scholars . 
 Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the Historia Ecclesiastica . Stenton regarded it as one of the " small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place " , and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede 's " astonishing power of co @-@ ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition , the relation of friends , or documentary evidence ... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact , he had reached the conception of history . " Patrick Wormald described him as " the first and greatest of England 's historians " . 
 The Historia Ecclesiastica has given Bede a high reputation , but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history . His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church , and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out , led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church . Besides the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , the medieval writers William of Malmesbury , Henry of Huntingdon , and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations . Early modern writers , such as Polydore Vergil and Matthew Parker , the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury , also utilised the Historia , and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion . 
 Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede 's accounts . One historian , Charlotte Behr , thinks that the Historia 's account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened , but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede 's time . 
 It is likely that Bede 's work , because it was so widely copied , discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works . 
 = = Other historical works = = 
 = = = Chronicles = = = 
 As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time , in 725 Bede wrote the Greater Chronicle ( <unk> <unk> ) , which sometimes circulated as a separate work . For recent events the Chronicle , like his Ecclesiastical History , relied upon Gildas , upon a version of the Liber <unk> current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I ( 687 – 701 ) , and other sources . For earlier events he drew on Eusebius 's <unk> <unk> . The dating of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works , using the era of creation , the anno mundi . 
 = = = Lives = = = 
 His other historical works included lives of the abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow , as well as verse and prose lives of Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne , an adaptation of Paulinus of Nola 's Life of St Felix , and a translation of the Greek Passion of St Anastasius . He also created a listing of saints , the Martyrology . 
 = = Theological works = = 
 In his own time , Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical , as well as other theological works . The majority of his writings were of this type , and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament . Most survived the Middle Ages , but a few were lost . It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum , and why he was made a saint . 
 Bede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors , as well as made careful , judicious innovation in knowledge ( such as <unk> the age of the earth — for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century — see below ) that had theological implications . In order to do this , he learned Greek , and attempted to learn Hebrew . He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments . He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome 's Vulgate , which itself was from the Hebrew text . He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church . In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians , including works by Basil , Cassian , John Chrysostom , Isidore of Seville , Origen , Gregory of Nazianzus , Augustine of Hippo , Jerome , Pope Gregory I , Ambrose of Milan , Cassiodorus , and Cyprian . He used these , in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves , to write his commentaries and other theological works . He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius 's Life of Antony , and a copy of Sulpicius Severus ' Life of St. Martin . He also used lesser known writers , such as Fulgentius , Julian of <unk> , <unk> , and Prosper of Aquitaine . Bede was the first to refer to Jerome , Augustine , Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church . It is clear from Bede 's own comments that he felt his job was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers . 
 Bede also wrote homilies , works written to explain theology used in worship services . Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as Advent , Lent , or Easter , but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events . 
 Both types of Bede 's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages . A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the Glossa Ordinaria , an 11th @-@ century collection of biblical commentaries . Some of Bede 's homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon , and they were used in that form in the Monastic Office . Saint Boniface used Bede 's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent . 
 Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew . In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes , which gave the details of his sources , should be preserved by the copyist , and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works . Where he does not specify , it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses . A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed , but it is possible to tell , for example , that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil . There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers — he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day , one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery . Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete : it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny 's Encyclopedia , for example , but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii , as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De <unk> ratione . 
 = = = Works on the Old Testament = = = 
 The works dealing with the Old Testament included Commentary on Samuel , Commentary on Genesis , Commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah , On the Temple , On the Tabernacle , Commentaries on Tobit , Commentaries on Proverbs , Commentaries on the Song of Songs , Commentaries on the Canticle of Habakkuk , The works on Ezra , the Tabernacle and the Temple were especially influenced by Gregory the Great 's writings . 
 = = = Works on the New Testament = = = 
 Bede 's works included Commentary on Revelation , Commentary on the Catholic Epistles , Commentary on Acts , Reconsideration on the Books of Acts , On the Gospel of Mark , On the Gospel of Luke , and Homilies on the Gospels . At the time of his death he was working on a translation of the Gospel of St. John into English . He did this for the last 40 days of his life . When the last passage had been translated he said : " All is finished . " 
 = = Works on historical and astronomical chronology = = 
 De <unk> , or On Time , written in about 703 , provides an introduction to the principles of Easter computus . This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville 's Etymologies , and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius , with some revisions based on Jerome 's translation of the bible . In about 723 , Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject , On the Reckoning of Time , which was influential throughout the Middle Ages . He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus . 
 On the Reckoning of Time ( De <unk> ratione ) included an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos , including an explanation of how the spherical earth influenced the changing length of daylight , of how the seasonal motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the New Moon at evening twilight , and a quantitative relation between the changes of the tides at a given place and the daily motion of the moon . Since the focus of his book was the computus , Bede gave instructions for computing the date of Easter and the related time of the Easter Full Moon , for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the zodiac , and for many other calculations related to the calendar . He gives some information about the months of the Anglo @-@ Saxon calendar in chapter XV . Any codex of Bede 's Easter cycle is normally found together with a codex of his " De Temporum Ratione " . 
 For calendric purposes , Bede made a new calculation of the age of the world since the creation , which he dated as <unk> BC . Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world , he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid , his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations . Once informed of the accusations of these " lewd rustics , " Bede refuted them in his Letter to <unk> . 
 In addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping , he also wrote De natura rerum , or On the Nature of Things , modelled in part after the work of the same title by Isidore of Seville . His works were so influential that late in the 9th century <unk> the Stammerer , a monk of the Monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland , wrote that " God , the <unk> of natures , who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation , in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth " . 
 = = Educational works = = 
 Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school . One of these was his De arte metrica , a discussion of the composition of Latin verse , drawing on previous grammarians work . It was based on Donatus ' De <unk> and Servius ' De <unk> , and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil . It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries . Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert , apparently a student , for he is named " beloved son " in the dedication , and Bede says " I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes " Another textbook of Bede 's is the De <unk> , a work on orthography , designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works . Although it could serve as a textbook , it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work . The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown . 
 Another educational work is De <unk> et <unk> sacrae <unk> , which discusses the Bible 's use of rhetoric . Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil , but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts , and in De <unk> ... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature . Similarly , his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples . 
 = = Vernacular poetry = = 
 According to his disciple Cuthbert , Bede was also <unk> in nostris carminibus ( " learned in our songs " ) . Cuthbert 's letter on Bede 's death , the Epistola <unk> de <unk> <unk> , moreover , commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as Bede 's Death Song 
 And he used to repeat that sentence from St. Paul " It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God , " and many other verses of Scripture , urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour . And in our own language , — for he was familiar with English poetry , — speaking of the soul 's dread departure from the body : 
 As <unk> notes , however , it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede : most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede 's presentation of the song , and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo @-@ Latin literature . The fact that Cuthbert 's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture , indeed , might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts . On the other hand , the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert 's Latin letter , the observation that Bede " was learned in our song , " and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it . By citing the poem directly , Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important , either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment or because it is a direct quotation of Bede 's last original composition . 
 = = Veneration = = 
 There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century . One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of Augustine of Canterbury . Later , when he was venerated in England , he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May , or his feast was moved to 27 May . However , he was venerated outside England , mainly through the efforts of Boniface and Alcuin , both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent . Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts , requesting copies of Bede 's theological works . Alcuin , who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede 's pupil Egbert , praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede 's works to all of Alcuin 's friends . Bede 's cult became prominent in England during the 10th @-@ century revival of monasticism , and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England . Wulfstan , Bishop of Worcester ( c . 1008 – 1095 ) was a particular devotee of Bede 's , dedicating a church to him in 1062 , which was Wulfstan 's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop . 
 His body was ' translated ' ( the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics ) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020 , where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne . Later Bede 's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370 . The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation , but the bones were reburied in the chapel . In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb , which is still there . Other relics were claimed by York , Glastonbury and Fulda . 
 His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a Doctor of the Church . He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church . He is also the only Englishman in Dante 's Paradise ( Paradiso <unk> ) , mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as Isidore of Seville and the Scot Richard of St. Victor . 
 His feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar in 1899 , for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death , 26 May , which was then the feast day of Pope Saint Gregory VII . He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church , with a feast day of 25 May , and in the Eastern Orthodox Church , with a feast day on 27 May . 
 Bede became known as Venerable Bede ( Lat . : Beda <unk> ) by the 9th century because of his holiness , but this was not linked to consideration for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church . According to a legend the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels , thus completing his unfinished epitaph . It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century , where Bede was grouped with others who were called " venerable " at two ecclesiastical councils held at Aachen in 816 and 836 . Paul the Deacon then referred to him as venerable consistently . By the 11th and 12th century , it had become commonplace . However , there are no descriptions of Bede by that term right after his death .

 Bede 's reputation as a historian , based mostly on the Historia Ecclesiastica , remains strong ; historian Walter Goffart says of Bede that he " holds a privileged and unrivalled place among first historians of Christian Europe " . His life and work have been celebrated with the annual Jarrow Lecture , held at St. Paul 's Church , Jarrow , since 1958 .

 This episode originally encountered trouble when the color version came back from Korea . With only six weeks to the airdate the writers made almost 100 line changes , a very rare occurrence . It was decided to completely overhaul the episode after a poorly received screening with the writing staff . The tombstones that appeared at the start of and during the episode were abandoned in later episodes because it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of ideas . A subtle tombstone joke in this episode is in the scene where two zombies are crawling out of their graves . The names Jay Kogen and Wolodarsky ( two of The Simpsons writers who worked on the episode ) are written on the tombstones , but both are misspelled . The " King Homer " segment is one of Matt Groening 's all @-@ time favorite stories from the Treehouse of Horror series . Al Jean was also quite worried about this segment because it was the longest running black @-@ and @-@ white segment they had ever aired , and he thought that some people might be concerned that their televisions were broken . The " He ( Flanders ) was a zombie ? " line , created by Mike Reiss , is , in the opinions of the writers , one of the all @-@ time classic lines from the series .

 The opening sequence where Homer walks into Alfred Hitchcock 's silhouette is a parody of Alfred Hitchcock Presents . It was meant to show Homer 's stomach bigger than that of the outline , but it was so subtle that not many people realised the joke . In the episode 's wraparounds , Bart is dressed as Alex from the film A Clockwork Orange . The " Clown Without Pity " segment is based on the Twilight Zone episode " Living Doll " and the film Trilogy of Terror . The title itself is a play on the song " Town Without Pity " by Gene Pitney . The man that gives Homer the Krusty doll is based on Mr. Wing from the film Gremlins . The Krusty doll riding under Homer 's car is a reference to the 1991 film Cape Fear . The " King Homer " segment is a parody of the 1933 film King Kong . In " King Homer " , the tribal leader is heard saying ' Mosi Tatupu , Mosi Tatupu ' , which means they will sacrifice the blue @-@ haired lady . The title " Dial " Z " for Zombies " is a play on the title of the 1954 Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder . Some aspects of " Dial " Z " for Zombies " are from the film Night of the Living Dead . In the pet cemetery , there are tombstones that read Fish Police , Capitol Critters and Family Dog , each a short @-@ lived animated series intended to capitalize on The Simpsons ' success . 
 When raising the dead from their graves , Bart wears Michael Jackson 's record album cover Thriller on his head . This is both a reference to Jackson 's famous music video , in which he dances with zombies .

" In 2006 , IGN voted " Dial Z For Zombies " as the second best segment of the Treehouse of Horror episodes . " Clown Without Pity " was also rated sixth . 
 In the film 28 Days Later , there is a scene where Sgt. Ferrell mentions that his favorite joke from The Simpsons was the line " Women and seamen ( semen ) don 't mix " , said by Smithers during the " King Homer " segment . The episode 's reference to Night of the Living Dead was named the 16th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . 
 = Slipknot ( album ) = 
 Slipknot is the self titled debut studio album by American heavy metal band Slipknot . It was released on 29 June 1999 through Roadrunner Records , following a demo containing a few of the songs which had been released in 1998 , and was reissued in December 1999 with a slightly altered track listing and mastering as the result of a lawsuit . It was the first release by the band to be produced by Ross Robinson , who sought to refine Slipknot 's sound rather than alter the group 's musical direction . 
 The album spans several genres , but is generally noted for its extensive percussion and overall heavy sound . It was well received by fans and critics alike and was responsible for bringing Slipknot a large increase in popularity . The album peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200 , and has gone on to become certified double platinum in the United States , making it the band 's best selling album . It was voted the best debut album of the last 25 years by readers of Metal Hammer magazine . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 In 1997 , following the band 's demo release Mate . Feed . Kill . Repeat . , the members of Slipknot continued to write new material and work in SR Audio , a local studio , with new vocalist Corey Taylor . The band had started work on a follow @-@ up but never got further than pre @-@ production . Songs written and recorded in this period include " Slipknot " , " Gently " , " Do Nothing " , " Tattered and Torn " , " Heartache and a Pair of Scissors " , " Me Inside " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " Windows " and " May 17th " . In 1998 , Slipknot was receiving growing attention from record labels including Epic and Hollywood Records . 
 On September 29 , 1998 , Slipknot left Des Moines , Iowa for Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu , California , anxious to record an album after a long wait to be signed . They released this demo to prospective labels and producers ; the track " Spit It Out " was the main focus of the demo and , with help from their manager Sophia John , they were able to get a copy of the eponymous demo to Ross Robinson . The band wanted him to work with them on their debut album and after meeting with the band Robinson signed them to his own label , I Am , but later helped sign them to Roadrunner Records . 
 The album 's recording process was " very aggressive and chaotic " , as producer Robinson strove to capture the intensity that the band created when performing live . Within three days all the drums were recorded , which contributed to the raw , live sound on the album that the band considers integral to its musical direction . By November 11 , 1998 , the recording of the album seemed complete and the band returned to Des Moines . During the Christmas period , guitarist Josh Brainard , who recorded on all the tracks to that point , decided to leave the band . The reasons for his departure are unclear ; it was widely thought to have been because of family constraints , however , Brainard dispels these rumours , explaining that " some decisions were made that I wasn 't particularly happy with . " His replacement was Jim Root , with whom the band returned to the studio in February 1999 . Slipknot finished recording during this period , with two extra songs : a re @-@ recording of " Me Inside " , and a new track called " Purity " . The mixing stages were very challenging , as drummer Joey Jordison and producer Robinson mastered the entire album with analog equipment , instead of the then more common method of using digital formats . " Wait and Bleed " and " Spit It Out " , which had appeared on the demo prior to the album , were released on the album , also ; the demo songs " <unk> " and " <unk> " are available on the digipak version of the same album . " Snap " was featured on the soundtrack for the film Freddy vs. Jason and " Eyeless " appeared on an episode of The Sopranos . 
 = = Musical and lyrical themes = = 
 The musical style of Slipknot is a constantly contested issue and the genres that the band are categorized in vary depending on the source , however , this album is generally regarded as nu metal , while showing influences of many different genres . The influence of death metal on the album is clear , and on the subject Jordison stated ; " the roots are death metal , thrash , speed metal , and I could go on and on about all those bands . " The album also shows influences from alternative metal and even rap metal . Critics have also noted an industrial influence . Due to the band 's large line @-@ up consisting of additional percussionists and electronics , the album has a very dense , layered sound . Alternative Press stated that the album used " inventive sampling , creative guitar work and an absolute percussive overload " , while Q magazine described the album as " a terrifying racket " . Slipknot also includes melody , most notably in the single " Wait and Bleed " . 
 " <unk> " is the intro track to the album . It contains some guitar scratches and abstract sound samples from the sampler Craig Jones . Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary . The dialogue is " The whole thing , I think it 's sick . " In an interview shortly after the album was released , Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor 's , sped up . <unk> was the barcode number on their 1996 self @-@ released album Mate . Feed . Kill . Repeat . All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits . 
 The album features Corey Taylor as lead vocalist ; he had previously appeared on their second demo , which , in turn , resulted in them signing to Roadrunner Records . Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted that on " Scissors " , Taylor " actually sounds like he 's about to burst into tears . Taylor 's aggressive , expletive @-@ filled lyrics were noted by AllMusic ; " [ the ] lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website ; suffice it to say that the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers , their hometown or most anything else . " " Eeyore " , a hidden track placed at the end of " Scissors " , begins after dialogue shared among the band members that was recorded while they were viewing a scene in a pornographic film that involved coprophilia , is heard . It has been played live many times and appears on both the DVD Disasterpieces and the live album 9 @.@ 0 : Live . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Slipknot was well received by critics and fans ; following its release the band gained popularity beyond their own expectations . Reviewing for AllMusic , Rick Anderson awarded the album four out of five stars , calling it " an auspicious debut " and proclaimed , " You thought Limp Bizkit was hard ? They 're The <unk> . These guys are something else entirely . And it 's pretty impressive . " The album 's aggression and heavy sound was widely praised ; Rolling Stone stated Slipknot is " metal with a capital m " , Kerrang ! added " raw and wholly uncompromising , each track delivered a powerful blow to the senses " , and in 2001 , Q magazine included the album in their list " 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time " . CMJ ranked the album as the twelfth highest " Editorial Pick " for 1999 . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert Dimery . 
 A single from the album , " Wait and Bleed " , was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards , but lost to Deftones ' " Elite " . The song was also named the 36th greatest metal song of all time by VH1 . The release of the album and the touring which followed greatly increased the band 's popularity . The album became the " biggest selling extreme metal album at the time . " It was ranked by American Soundscan as the fastest @-@ selling metal debut in Soundscan 's history . On May 2 , 2000 , the album was certified platinum in the United States , a first for any album released by Roadrunner Records . On February 5 , 2005 , the RIAA certified it Double Platinum . In Canada , the Canadian Recording Industry Association certified the album as Platinum on October 10 , 2000 . The British Phonographic Industry certified the album as Platinum on October 17 , 2008 in the UK . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 After the release of the album , the band was accused of copyright infringement regarding the concept of the song " Purity " . Corey Taylor , during a Q & A , claimed that the song 's lyrics had been written five years prior to the song 's release and that only the song 's name had been inspired by the Purity Knight story , which was claimed by the authoring website as being fictional . Taylor , to his defense , said the song 's inspiration came from films such as Boxing Helena and The Collector , and not the story itself . The short track , " Frail Limb Nursery " , which serves as a prelude to " Purity " , contains audio samples of the imprisoned Purity Knight as recorded by a young boy , posted as evidence on the authoring website . Slipknot , in an effort to prevent the entire album from being pulled , removed " Purity " and " Frail Limb Nursery " from the album until the case could be settled . As a result , the band released slightly remastered standard and digipak versions of the album in December 1999 , replacing both tracks with " Me Inside " . The band later won their case , and was subsequently able to still play the song during live performances . It is included in the band 's second DVD Disasterpieces ( the studio version appears here as well ) as well as the live album 9 @.@ 0 : Live and Antennas to Hell , and the 10th anniversary edition of the self @-@ titled album .

 On September 9 , 2009 , Slipknot released a Special Edition version of the album to commemorate the tenth anniversary of its release . It was released in two forms , a digipak and a box set . The release date ( 09 / 09 / 09 ) is a reference to the fact that the band had nine band members and have sustained the same lineup since the original release of the album . The Special Edition box set includes : a CD and DVD set featuring all new digipak packaging , with a total of 25 songs , including the original album plus several previously unreleased cuts , demo tracks and " Purity " . The DVD , which was directed by percussionist Shawn Crahan , features footage of the band in 1999 and 2000 , titled Of the Sic : Your Nightmares , Our Dreams . The DVD also features all three music videos released in support of the album , an entire live concert recorded at the Dynamo Open Air , 2000 and " other surprises " .

It is the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar and is a prequel to 2001 's Monsters , Inc . , marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film . 
 Disney , as the rights holder , had plans for a sequel to Monsters , Inc. since 2005 . Following disagreements with Pixar , Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the film . An early draft of the film was developed ; however , Disney 's purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7 's version of the film . A Pixar @-@ made sequel was confirmed in 2010 , and in 2011 , it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled Monsters University . 
 Monsters University tells the story of two monsters , Mike and Sulley , and their time studying at college , where they start off as rivals , but slowly become best friends . John Goodman , Billy Crystal , Steve Buscemi , Bob Peterson , and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan , Mike Wazowski , Randall Boggs , Roz , and the Abominable Snowman , respectively .

It was accompanied in theaters by a short film , The Blue Umbrella , directed by <unk> Unseld . The film grossed $ 743 million against its estimated budget of $ 200 million . An animated short film titled Party Central , which takes place shortly after the events of Monsters University , premiered in Fall 2013 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Michael " Mike " Wazowski , a young monster , gets inspired to become a scarer ( a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy ) when he grows up after visiting Monsters Inc . , Monstropolis ' most profitable scaring company , on a school field trip . Eleven years later , Mike is a first @-@ year scare major at Monsters University , where he meets fellow monster James P. " Sulley " Sullivan . Mike studies hard , while the privileged Sulley , coming from a family of talented scarers , relies only on his natural ability and begins to falter . As the semester progresses , Mike and Sulley attempt to join a fraternity , but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar , the strongest fraternity on campus . At the semester 's final exam , a fight between the two causes them to accidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble 's cherished Scream Can . Hardscrabble promptly fails both of them immediately , stating that Sulley does not study enough , and Mike is not scary enough . 
 Wanting to prove himself , Mike enters the university 's " Scare Games " and makes a wager with Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win , but Mike must leave the university if they lose . He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa , the weakest fraternity on campus , but they are denied entry to the Games for being one team member short . Sulley subsequently joins them , seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program . Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge , but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating . Oozma Kappa subsequently improve gradually due to Mike 's training and intricate knowledge of scaring , and they advance through each following challenge , finishing just behind competition favourites Roar Omega Roar . In the final round , they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom . However , Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley secretly rigged the machine to improve his score . 
 Determined to prove he can become a scarer , Mike breaks into the school 's door lab and enters a door to the human world leading to a summer camp , but he is unable to scare a cabin full of children and runs off into the woods . Meanwhile , Roar Omega Roar offers to reinstate Sulley , but he refuses , instead confessing to Hardscrabble that he cheated , just as she is alerted of Mike 's break @-@ in . Realizing what happened , Sulley defies Hardscrabble and enters the same door to find Mike . After reconciling , they try to return , but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive . Pursued by camp rangers , Mike realizes that the only way to escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side . Working together , Sulley and Mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy to return to the lab seconds before the device overloads and explodes in front of Hardscrabble . 
 Mike and Sulley are led away by the CDA and are expelled from the university as a result of their actions , but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester , as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games . As Mike leaves on the bus , Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits . Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck , claiming they were the first students to have surprised her . The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters , Inc . , eventually working their way up to join the Scarer Team and setting the events of Monsters , Inc. in motion .

 Plans for a second Monsters , Inc. film existed since 2005 . Following disagreements between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs , Disney – which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar 's films up to Cars – announced that a sequel to Monsters , Inc. would be made by Circle 7 Animation , which was also working on an early draft of Toy Story 3 . Titled Monsters , Inc . 2 : Lost in <unk> , the film would have focused on Mike and Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present , only to find that she had moved . After getting trapped in the human world , Mike and Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do . Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film , and storyboarded an early draft of it . Disney 's change of management in late 2005 – in which Eisner was replaced by Robert Iger – led to renewed negotiations with Pixar , and in early 2006 Disney announced it had purchased the studio . The Disney @-@ owned sequel rights were then transferred to Pixar , leading to the cancellation of Muir and Hilgenberg 's version of the film and the subsequent closure of Circle 7 . 
 A Pixar @-@ made sequel was confirmed in 2010 . The film was originally planned for release on November 16 , 2012 , but the release was preponed to November 2 , 2012 to avoid competition with The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn – Part 2 . On March 29 , 2011 , it was confirmed that the film would be a prequel and the title Monsters University was announced . The next Month s release date June 21 , 2013 was announced . 
 The feature was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae . Billy Crystal , John Goodman , Steve Buscemi , Bob Peterson , and John Ratzenberger reprised their roles , and Bonnie Hunt voiced a new character . New voice cast included Dave Foley , Sean Hayes , Julia Sweeney , Helen Mirren , Alfred Molina , Peter Sohn , Charlie Day , Joel Murray , Nathan Fillion , Aubrey Plaza , Tyler Labine , John <unk> , Bill Hader , Bobby Moynihan , and Beth <unk> . 
 The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley 's first meeting , but this created a continuity error from the first film in which Mike tells Sulley " You 've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade . " Director Dan Scanlon said he had a dilemma with this line during pre @-@ production , but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because , " we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults . And we also felt like college is so much about self @-@ discovery and figuring out who you are . " He added , " It felt like the perfect place to do this , but we had that line . So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college . And we knew we didn 't want to make Monsters Elementary . " Scanlon said during pre @-@ production that , " Pete Docter , the original director , and John Lasseter ... finally said to me , ' it 's great that you 're honouring that , but you have to do what 's right for the story . ' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside . " Scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as " an old monster expression " , saying " That 's what monsters always say to each other . " 
 Monsters University is the first Pixar film that used global illumination , a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first Toy Story film . In the planning stage of the film , director of photography , Jean @-@ Claude <unk> , asked " What if we made these lights just work ? " Before the new system , artists had to build reflections and shadows manually , which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced . The new lighting system uses path tracing , a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world ; this <unk> the process , delivered more realism , produced soft shadows , and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes – some of which contained thousands of light sources . 
 For research , the filmmakers visited several colleges in the U.S. , including Harvard University , Stanford University , and the University of Alabama , observing college architecture , student life , Greek organizations , and the teaching methods of professors and faculty . To research fraternity life , which is central to the film , many of the film 's producers spent several weeks at a fraternity house .

 Matt Zoller Seitz of Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film four stars out of four , saying it " is true to the spirit of [ Monsters , Inc . ] and matches its tone . But it never seems content to turn over old ground . " Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five , writing " It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy @-@ furred cuteness has melted away . For a mere prequel , that 's a result . " Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it " is cute , and funny , and the animation , though not exactly inspired , is certainly colorful . " Jake Coyle of Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four , saying it " might not be as gifted as some of its other movies , but sometimes it 's alright to be OK . " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four , and said " It 's all infectious fun , despite the lack of originality . In the art of tickling funny bones , Crystal and Goodman earn straight A 's . " Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review , saying " This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet . With Pixar , familiarity breeds content . " Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five and said it is " one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist , but once you 've seen it , you 're kind of glad it does . " Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review , saying " Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids . It 's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes : technically impressive but a job un @-@ anchored to anything more meaningful . " 
 Leonard Maltin of IndieWire praised the animation and art direction , but wrote that he wished " the movie was funnier and wasn 't so plot @-@ heavy " and that " Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that 's merely good , instead of great , they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise .

" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review , saying that it " never surprises , goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories . Nor does it come close to <unk> through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling . " Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four , and said it " may not be as inventive as Inc . , but it 's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar 's roster of animated coming @-@ of @-@ age stories .

 = HMS Neptune ( 1797 ) = 
 HMS Neptune was a 98 @-@ gun second rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy . She served on a number of stations during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . 
 Neptune was built during the early years of the war with Revolutionary France and was launched in 1797 . She almost immediately became caught up in the events of the mutiny at the Nore , and was one of a few loyal ships tasked with attacking mutinous vessels if they could not be brought to order . The mutiny died out before this became necessary and Neptune joined the Channel Fleet . She moved to the Mediterranean in 1799 , spending the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in operations with Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Keith 's fleet . After refitting , and spending time on blockades , she formed part of Lord Nelson 's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar , and was heavily involved in the fighting , sustaining casualties of 10 killed and 34 wounded . 
 She was not fully repaired and returned to service until 1807 , when she went out to the Caribbean . In 1809 she participated in the successful invasion of Martinique , and the subsequent battle with Troude 's squadron . Returning to Britain towards the end of the wars , she was laid up in ordinary , and in 1813 became a temporary prison ship . She was finally broken up in 1818 . 
 = = Construction and commissioning = = 
 Neptune was ordered from Deptford Dockyard on 15 February 1790 , to a design developed by Surveyor of the Navy Sir John Henslow . She was one of three ships of the Neptune class , alongside her sisters HMS Temeraire and HMS Dreadnought . Neptune was laid down at Deptford in April 1791 , receiving her name on 24 July 1790 . The initial stages of her construction were overseen by Master Shipwright Martin Ware , though he was succeeded by Thomas Pollard in June 1795 , and Pollard oversaw her completion . Neptune was launched on 28 January 1797 and sailed to Woolwich to be fitted for sea . Arriving at Woolwich on 12 February , she was immediately docked to have her copper sheathing fitted , a process that was completed by 1 March . Launched again , she finished fitting out , and received her masts and yards . Her final costs came to £ 77 @,@ 053 , and included £ 61 @,@ 172 spent on the hull , masts and yards , and a further £ 15 @,@ 881 on rigging and stores . 
 She was commissioned on 25 March 1797 under Captain Henry Stanhope , becoming the third ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Neptune . Her predecessors had been two 90 @-@ gun ships , the first launched in 1683 , renamed HMS Torbay in 1750 and sold in 1784 . The second had been launched in 1757 , was used as a sheer hulk from 1784 , and was broken up in 1816 . Stanhope sailed from Woolwich on 11 June 1797 , flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir Erasmus Gower , and made for the Nore . 
 = = Mutiny at the Nore = = 
 Shortly after her arrival at the Nore , Neptune became caught up in the mutiny that had broken out there . While lying at Gravesend , Neptune and the 64 @-@ gun ships HMS Agincourt and HMS Lancaster , together with a fleet of gunboats , were ordered to intercept and attack the mutinous ships at the Nore . Before they could proceed word came that the mutineers had entered negotiations with the Earl of <unk> , captain of the 64 @-@ gun HMS Monmouth , and by 9 June the mutiny was on the verge of collapse . The attack was called off , and on 21 September Stanhope was superseded by Gower as captain of Neptune . The crisis over , Neptune joined the Channel Fleet . 
 = = Mediterranean = = 
 Gower remained in command of Neptune until his promotion to rear @-@ admiral of the white , at which point Herbert Sawyer became her acting @-@ captain . Sawyer was in command until 22 January 1799 , and Gower left her on 28 February 1799 . Command of the ship formally passed to Captain James Vashon on 5 March 1799 . The first half of 1799 was spent with the Channel Fleet , and in June Neptune was one of 15 ships of the line assigned to join Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Keith 's fleet in the Mediterranean . The squadron , commanded by Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Charles Cotton , rendezvoused with Keith 's force at Minorca on 7 July , bringing the British fleet in the Mediterranean up to 31 ships . Keith intended to intercept a large Franco @-@ Spanish force of 42 ships under Admirals Étienne Eustache Bruix and Jose <unk> , and set out to sea on 10 July . Bruix ' expedition evaded Keith , and reached the safety of Brest on 9 August . Neptune went on to spend the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in the Mediterranean . 
 Vashon was superseded on 26 March 1801 , and the following day Captain Edward Brace arrived to take command . Neptune became the flagship of Vice @-@ Admiral James Gambier during this period . Brace 's period of command was brief , he was superseded by Captain Francis Austen on 12 September . With the draw down in hostilities prior to the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 , Neptune was one of the many ships of the Mediterranean fleet to be ordered home , arriving at Portsmouth on 24 February . Austen paid her off on 29 April , but recommissioned her the next day . Neptune then underwent a brief refit , during which £ 5 @,@ 728 was expended , £ 2 @,@ 895 of which was spent on her hull , masts and yards . Austen was superseded on 30 September 1802 and the following day Captain William O 'Bryen Drury took command . With Neptune fully refitted and stored , she sailed from the dockyard and joined the Channel Fleet at Spithead on 29 October . 
 = = Blockade , and approach to Trafalgar = = 
 Drury commanded Neptune for the next two years , until his promotion to rear @-@ admiral in 1804 . He departed the ship on 13 May 1804 , and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over . Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet , blockading the French Atlantic ports . During this time Captain Williams ' health progressively worsened , and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805 . He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May , and was sent to join Robert Calder 's force blockading Ferrol , after the Franco @-@ Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre . Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve 's fleet were it to come out of harbour , and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis 's fleet off Brest . Shortly afterwards Nelson 's fleet returned from the West Indies , bringing 12 more ships , and Calder was given 18 ships , including Neptune , and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve . By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder 's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood , that was blockading the Franco @-@ Spanish fleet at Cadiz . As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptune 's sailing qualities . She had the reputation of being slow , and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in ' a large ship that don 't sail and must continually be late in action . ' During the battle however , Midshipman William <unk> commented that ' The old Neptune , which never was a good sailer , took it into her head that morning to sail better than I ever remember to have seen her do before . ' Neptune went into the battle 18 men short of her complement . 
 = = Trafalgar = = 
 Neptune formed part of the weather column in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October , and was the third ship from the lead , situated between her sister HMS Temeraire , and the 74 @-@ gun HMS Leviathan . Fremantle had been promised a position second to Nelson aboard HMS Victory , and by 10 o 'clock was sailing fast enough to threaten to overtake her . Fremantle hoped to pass her , and lead the line into battle , but Nelson ordered ' Neptune , take in your studding @-@ sails and drop astern . I shall break the line myself . ' Neptune went into action with her band playing , and everyone except the officers and the band lying down on the deck to protect them from enemy fire . Ahead of her Fremantle saw Eliab Harvey 's Temeraire turn to pass astern of the French Redoutable , but resolved to follow Nelson and HMS Victory to pass astern of the French flagship Bucentaure . As she passed under Bucentaure 's stern , Neptune discharged a double @-@ shotted broadside from her larboard ( port ) guns , with devastating consequences on Villeneuve 's already disabled flagship . Fremantle then had the helm swung hard to starboard , bringing his ship abeam of the Bucentaure . He fired two more triple @-@ shotted broadsides from nearly 50 guns at a range of less than 100 yards into the beleaguered French ship . 
 Fremantle then spotted the towering mass of the Spanish four @-@ decker Santísima Trinidad sailing away from him , and steered towards her starboard quarter in the hope of raking her stern . Opening fire with his larboard battery , he positioned Neptune off the Spanish vessel 's starboard beam and the two exchanged heavy fire for the next hour as more British ships poured through the gap astern of Neptune . Neptune took fire from other ships of the combined fleet as they sailed past . Santísima Trinidad , heavily battered by Neptune 's guns , as well as those from the 74 @-@ gun ships HMS Leviathan and HMS Conqueror , became completely dismasted and covered in debris . She fought on until 5 @.@ 30 pm , when she struck her colours , having sustained casualties of 205 dead and 103 wounded . Neptune left the 98 @-@ gun HMS Prince to take possession and headed north to cut off the remains of the enemy fleet , briefly becoming engaged with the French 74 @-@ gun Intrépide . During the battle Neptune suffered considerable damage to her masts , although they did not fall . Most of her rigging was cut to pieces and she sustained nine shot holes in her hull . She sustained casualties of ten killed and 34 wounded . A remarkably small proportion of her officers became casualties , with only the captain 's clerk , Richard Hurrell , being wounded . 
 After the battle Collingwood transferred his flag from the damaged HMS Royal Sovereign to the frigate HMS Euryalus , and on 22 October Neptune took the Royal Sovereign in tow . On 23 October , as the Franco @-@ Spanish forces that had escaped into Cadiz sortied under Commodore Julien <unk> , Neptune cast off the tow , surrendering the duty to HMS Mars , and took on board Villeneuve and several captured flag captains , who had originally been aboard Mars . As the weather continued to deteriorate Neptune sent her boats to assist in the evacuation of the Santísima Trinidad before she foundered . After riding out the storm she took the battered Victory , carrying Lord Nelson 's body , in tow on 26 October and brought her into Gibraltar on 28 October . 
 = = West Indies = = 
 After undergoing some repairs at Gibraltar Neptune sailed to Britain , arriving at Portsmouth on 6 December 1805 , where she was paid off . She was moved to Spithead in 1806 , but was back in Portsmouth on 23 November , and was moved into a dock on 24 March 1807 to undergo a refit . The refit lasted until November 1807 and involved having her copper sheathing removed and her hull refitted . She was then <unk> , having had a sum of £ 29 @,@ 053 expended on her . She was recommissioned on 18 August 1807 under her old commander , Captain Sir Thomas Williams , and was relaunched three days later on 21 August to complete her refit . She was initially assigned to serve in the English Channel , but was moved to the West Indies in 1808 . On 9 November Williams was superseded by Captain Thomas Pinto , who only spent six weeks in command before being succeeded by Captain Charles Dilkes on 20 December . 
 In January 1809 an attack on the French colony of Martinique , governed by Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse , was planned . Neptune became the flagship of the expedition 's commander , Rear @-@ Admiral Alexander Cochrane , and the invasion force , consisting of 44 vessels and transports for 10 @,@ 000 troops under Lieutenant @-@ General George Beckwith , sailed on 28 January . The force arrived at Martinique on 30 January , and 3 @,@ 000 troops were landed under Major @-@ General Frederick Maitland without resistance . 600 troops were put ashore at Cape Solomon under Major Henderson , both landings supervised by Captain William Charles Fahie aboard the 74 @-@ gun HMS Belleisle . An additional force of 6 @,@ 500 men were landed in the north of the island under Major @-@ General Sir George Prévost , and the French were driven into several fortified positions , the last of which surrendered on 24 February 1809 . 
 = = Battle with Troude = = 
 Cochrane 's squadron remained in the area blockading the island , and in March a French squadron consisting of three 74 @-@ gun ships , Hautpoult , Courageux and Polonais , and two frigates , Félicité and Furieuse , under the overall command of Commodore Amable Troude , arrived in the Caribbean . Finding Martinique in British hands , Troude anchored near Îles des Saintes . 
 There they were blockaded until 14 April , when Cochrane removed this threat . A British force under Major @-@ General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in Acasta , landed troops on the islands capturing them . The British then installed heavy guns on vantage points . 
 Threatened , Troude put to sea , chased by Cochrane 's squadron . After a running battle over several days the Hautpoult was brought to action and captured . Neptune 's captain , Charles Dilkes , was given command of her , while Captain James Athol Wood succeeded him in command of Neptune on 2 August . 
 Neptune was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Dilkes resumed command of Neptune on 2 March 1810 , while Wood was exchanged into HMS Pompee . Dilkes had apparently been suffering poor health , and Captain N Ballard took command in an acting capacity on 22 July . Neptune returned to Plymouth on 26 October and entered the dock on 9 November to be fitted for the ordinary . The process cost £ 713 , and after undocking on 8 December she was laid up in the Hamoaze until late autumn 1813 . Her hull appears to have quickly deteriorated , and after a survey she was deemed unfit for further service at sea . The Navy Board proposed that she be converted into a prison ship , a recommendation the Admiralty accepted , and she was taken in hand for fitting out on 22 November . On the completion of the work in December she was commissioned under Lieutenant George Lawrence . Neptune spent three years in this role , and was finally taken to pieces in October 1818 .

The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself ( except for Cartman , who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti @-@ Semitic remarks on television , which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the " no interruptions " rule ) . Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie 's child , " <unk> " , which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California . Later , Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son . 
 Meanwhile , at the summer camp , young bully Nathan and his lackey Mimsy plot to destroy Jimmy during the athletic competitions so Nathan can be declared the camp 's champion . This sub @-@ plot is also narrated in the same style as " Intervention " . Nathan uses Mimsy as a minion to carry out his plans to harm Jimmy , but is repeatedly foiled by Mimsy , who either misinterprets his instructions or takes them too literally and causes his plans to backfire . Nathan tries to plant a black mamba in Jimmy 's canoe during a race , but Mimsy instead leaves it in Nathan 's canoe ( when told to put it " in the canoe " ) . Subsequently , Nathan tries to lead Jimmy 's team into dangerous Indian territory during a scavenger hunt , but instead Mimsy switches the maps and switches them again ( Nathan demanded him to " Switch the maps ! Switch the maps ! " ) , and leads Nathan 's team there . When Nathan tries to use a whistle with a shark mating call against Jimmy , Mimsy , who was supposed to blow the whistle underwater , instead swims in the water briefly then blows the whistle on land and a shark jumps out of the water and anally rapes Nathan with its nine @-@ inch long penis , according to the Colorado National Wildlife Association . During the talent show , Nathan rigs Jimmy 's ukulele with C @-@ 4 , hoping it will explode during a solo , but when Jimmy cannot perform the solo correctly , Mimsy starts to show Jimmy the correct notes . Nathan interrupts and confronts Mimsy about his failure to follow orders . With a lapse of judgment , Nathan plays the correct notes and causes the ukulele to explode , knocking him away before being further injured by his past plans attacking him again . The ukulele solo is spoofing the Looney Tunes repeated use of the Xylophone gag , where the last note of Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms , is booby trapped , but the protagonist always somehow manages to play it wrong . Nathan is subsequently escorted to an ambulance , but is given the champion 's crown by Jimmy . Nathan tells Jimmy he hates him anyway before he is sent away to the hospital . 
 The episode ends with a message encouraging people who know towels in need of drug rehabilitation to visit " Restore Stephen Baldwin " , a real @-@ life website seeking assistance for actor Stephen Baldwin . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Crippled Summer " was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 28 , 2010 and served as the mid @-@ season finale of the fourteenth season before a months @-@ long hiatus for the series . Parker and fellow series co @-@ creator Matt Stone originally planned for the tenth season episode " A Million Little Fibers " to be about Towelie 's struggle to overcome addiction in the style of the television series Intervention , with the children and residents of South Park coming together to help him , just as it was done in " Crippled Summer " . However , after writing portions of the story for the tenth season episode , they found they did not know where to bring the story or how to resolve it . As a result , they completely revamped the episode and focused it on talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the controversy surrounding the James Frey book A Million Little Pieces , rather than Towelie 's addiction . " Crippled Summer " also marked the first appearance by Towelie since the " A Million Little Fibers " , and the first appearance of Nathan , Jimmy 's handicapped nemesis , since the eighth season episode " Up the Down Steroid " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Crippled Summer " served as a parody of Intervention , the A & E Network documentary series about people struggling with various addictions . Throughout the episode , information about Towelie 's drug addiction is presented on completely black screens with white letters . This device is used frequently in Intervention . The interviews with Towelie 's friends and footage of their pleas to get help are also characteristic of the reality series . During one of Towelie 's interviews , he quotes " feels like I 'm walking on sunshine " after huffing air duster cans . Both the quote and his actions are from Season 5 , episode 9 of the TV reality series Intervention where they interview " Allison " . Many of the campers at Lake <unk> are parodies of characters from the cartoon series Looney Tunes . Nathan and Mimsy , in particular , are strongly influenced by Rocky and Mugsy , with Nathan taking on the role of the diminutive mastermind ( like Rocky ) who is constantly thwarted by his large but dim @-@ witted accomplice ( like Mugsy ) . Other characters from the summer camp in the episode resemble cartoon characters such as Elmer Fudd , Pete Puma , Droopy , Porky Pig , Taz , Foghorn Leghorn , and Beaky Buzzard . 
 The episode ends with a reference to " Restore Stephen Baldwin " , a real @-@ life website seeking to restore actor Stephen Baldwin 's career and solicit donations to repay his $ 2 @.@ 3 million debt . The joke compares Towelie 's addiction and rehabilitation to that of Baldwin , who had a history of drug abuse before becoming a born @-@ again Christian . A version of " Are You Ready for the Summer ? " , a camp theme song sung by children in the comedy film Meatballs , is featured . The episode makes reference to actress Kirstie Alley when a counselor says Towelie is the most troubled towel he had seen since Alley 's towel , who he said " has seen some nasty stuff " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast on April 29 , 2010 , " Crippled Summer " was watched by 3 @.@ 56 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , making it the most watched cable television show of the night . It received a 2 @.@ 2 rating / 4 share among overall viewers and a 2 @.@ 0 rating / 6 share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49 . This rating marked an improvement over the previous South Park episode , " 201 " , and outperformed those of several primetime network shows that evening , including Fox 's Lie to Me , ABC 's The Middle , NBC 's Minute to Win It , CBS 's The New Adventures of Old Christine and The CW Network 's America 's Next Top Model , most of which were in repeats that evening . " Crippled Summer " received a 4 @.@ 1 rating / 13 share among male viewers between ages 18 and 34 . The episode also ranked fourth for the week among cable viewers between ages 18 and 49 and , because it ranked only behind three NBA playoff games , it was the highest @-@ rated scripted cable show of the week . " Crippled Summer " was the highest @-@ rated cable show among the 18 – 34 viewer demographic . 
 " Crippled Summer " received mixed reviews . Ramsey Isler of IGN called " Crippled Summer " a brilliant episode , particularly praising the return of Towelie , who he said " has a slew of great moments in this story , making up for his long absence from the series " . Isler said after the controversy raised from the depictions of Muhammad in the previous two episodes , " 200 " and " 201 " , he appreciated that the show returned to a simpler plot and provided " a little comedy relief " . The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell also praised South Park for " not getting too caught up in the Muhammad thing " , and praised the jokes about Intervention , which he said " is one of those shows that 's really easy to parody " . He also praised several individual jokes , like Cartman 's theories about the Jews and Nathan getting raped by a shark , although he said the Mimsy jokes were " a little one @-@ note " . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said of the episode : " Not the kind of South Park episode that ’ s going to stir national @-@ news debate , but funny and vulgar enough to satisfy fans . " 
 Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine pointed out that although the episode mocked drug addicts and handicapped children , it did not face the kind of censorship " 200 " and " 201 " did , which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics . Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters " should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people have been going on for years " . Others criticized the episode . MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode " just wasn 't very funny " , and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in " 200 " and " 201 " . Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children " pointlessly mean " , and said the fact that they are allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored " makes a point about the absurdity of what is and isn 't TV @-@ acceptable " . The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son " <unk> " , but said the jokes about the handicapped children were unfunny and irritating . The site called it " by far the weakest of the season " and a disappointment following " 200 " and " 201 " .

 = Sweet Tooth ( novel ) = 
 Sweet Tooth is a novel by the English writer Ian McEwan , published on 21 August 2012 . It deals with the experiences of its protagonist , Serena Frome , during the early 1970s . After graduating from Cambridge she is recruited by MI5 , and becomes involved in a covert program to combat communism by infiltrating the intellectual world . When she becomes romantically involved with her mark , complications ensue . 
 McEwan wanted to write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s , and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life . The story explores the relationship between artistic integrity and government propaganda , and addresses competing approaches to literature ; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout . The novel is dedicated to McEwan 's late friend Christopher Hitchens . He is not referred to directly in the book , but he did play a part as the host of a real @-@ life literary event fictionalised in the book , involving McEwan and Martin Amis , who does appear in the story . Critical reception was mixed ; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant , while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan 's previous work . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The plot is set in early @-@ 1970s England . Serena Frome ( " rhymes with plume " ) , the daughter of an Anglican bishop , shows a talent for mathematics and is admitted to the University of Cambridge . But she struggles academically , and graduates with a third . While at Cambridge she becomes romantically involved with Tony Canning , a professor , who before abruptly ending the affair secures a position for Serena with MI5 . The job is low @-@ level , but a more exciting opportunity appears when Serena is offered a chance to take part in a new covert program codenamed " Sweet Tooth " . To counter Communist propaganda during the Cold War , the agency wants to offer financial assistance to young writers , academics and journalists with an anti @-@ Communist bent . Serena , who is an avid and quick reader of fiction , is given the task of vetting burgeoning writer Thomas Haley . 
 Serena is immediately taken by Haley 's published short fiction . She travels to the University of Sussex , where he works , to offer him a stipend from the fictional Freedom International Foundation . Soon the two begin a romantic affair , but things gradually start to unravel . Serena discovers that Professor Canning ( who , it turns out , broke off their affair only because he knew he was dying from cancer ) was in fact a Soviet spy , and she was recruited because the agency wanted to keep tabs on Canning . Then , when Haley 's first novel comes out , it is a great critical success , but its dystopian , anti @-@ capitalist theme is not well received by the agency . Finally , his affair with Serena is exposed by the press , and the whole Sweet Tooth program is threatened . 
 Serena fears that she has lost Haley 's love forever , now he knows she has deceived him . Haley , however , had known about the program for months , and instead of ending the affair , had decided to turn the story into a novel . The reader now discovers that the author of Sweet Tooth is in fact Haley , despite its being written from Serena 's first @-@ person perspective . As the novel ends , Haley asks Serena in a letter to marry him . 
 = = Autobiographical elements = = 
 Several reviewers have pointed out that the Thomas Haley character shares many traits and biographical details with the author . Like Haley , McEwan studied at the University of Sussex ( later also at the University of East Anglia ) , and not at one of the more prestigious Oxbridge universities . Haley 's stories , summarised briefly in the novel , are in several cases strikingly similar to some of McEwan 's earlier work . This goes particularly for Haley 's dystopian début novel , which closely follows the plot of " Two Fragments " , a short story from McEwan 's 1978 In Between the Sheets . The novel wins Haley the fictional Jane Austen Prize for Fiction , just as McEwan 's debut First Love , Last Rites was rewarded with the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976 . Several of McEwan 's acquaintances from this period also make cameo appearances in the novel , including his friend Martin Amis , his first publisher Tom Maschler , and his mentor Ian Hamilton . 
 McEwan has been open about the autobiographical elements in the book , and has called it " a muted and distorted autobiography " and " a muted , or transmuted , memoir of myself as a young writer . " There are , however , significant differences between author and character . Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction , while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career . The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional ; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5 . As McEwan says himself , " unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend . " 
 = = Genre and style = = 
 Sweet Tooth is a love story , a spy novel , and a book about literature itself . Serena and her boyfriend Haley – she a well @-@ read but uncritical lover of literature , he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar – have different attitudes towards literature . Serena prefers a realist approach , where life in the book reflects real life . Haley on the other hand is of a more modernist school , and enjoys experimentation in his work . McEwan plays with these differences , firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character , and secondly by writing what appears to be a straight first @-@ person narrative , only to distort this perception at the very end . 
 = = Themes = = 
 McEwan had long wanted to write a novel about the 1970s , a formative period in his life he refers to as " the time of my life . " For the United Kingdom it was a turbulent period , with striking miners , energy crisis , escalation of the conflict over Northern Ireland , repeated states of emergency and several shifts of government . It was also the period of the Cold War , when Western governments were trying to win the war of ideas against a highly radicalised intelligentsia . Operation Sweet Tooth is entirely fictional , but the story is inspired by the actual scandal affecting the conservative literary magazine Encounter , which in 1967 was revealed to have received covert funding from the CIA . McEwan uses this back @-@ story to explore the relationship between artist and government , and the need for literature to remain independent . According to McEwan , the problem was not the anti @-@ Communist crusade itself , but the secrecy with which it was conducted . " All that 's really required is that anything the state does in relation to the arts is laid on the table where we can see it . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Lydia of The Observer enjoyed the " Russian doll " of the novel 's multiple layers , and its " keen emotional pull . " Though she had certain misgivings along the way , she felt that the last few pages answered all her questions and " moved [ her ] almost to tears . " Lucy Kellaway of the Financial Times was taken by the stories within the story , and though they tended to " suck vivacity from the main narrative " , she saw this as a device to illuminate the " different crafts of writing short stories and novels . " Benjamin Errett , writing for the National Post , pointed out how McEwan had blended spy fiction and literary criticism to a combination that was both exciting and intellectually stimulating . In reference to Serena and Tom 's different literary preferences , he concluded that " [ t ] his novel is juicy enough to satisfy them both . " 
 Other reviewers were less enthusiastic . The Daily Telegraph 's Catherine Taylor found the protagonist " a little too credulous . " She also found McEwan 's " wilful narrative sadism " sadly missing from the work . The review in The Economist was even more scathing : referring to Sweet Tooth as " not Mr McEwan 's finest book " , the reviewer concluded that by the end , " it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes , who are all notions and no depth . " James Lasdun of The Guardian found that there were " momentous political questions " raised in the earlier parts of the novel , which were not fully addressed by the end . Stylistically , Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked , but , asked Lasdun , " to what end ? " Particularly the ending of the book was polarising . Kellaway saw it as " a good excuse to go back to the beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again " , while another reviewer confessed that , though the ending " might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it ... it made me want to throw the book out the window . " 
 The statistical journal " Significance " analyses McEwan 's representation of the famous mathematical conundrum : the Monty Hall Problem . 
 = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder = 
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type . It is characterized by problems paying attention , excessive activity , or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person 's age . These symptoms begin by age six to twelve , are present for more than six months , and cause problems in at least two settings ( such as school , home , or recreational activities ) . In children , problems paying attention may result in poor school performance . Although it causes impairment , particularly in modern society , many children have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting . 
 Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents , the cause is unknown in the majority of cases . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that it affected about 39 million people as of 2013 . It affects about 5 – 7 % of children when diagnosed via the DSM @-@ IV criteria and 1 – 2 % when diagnosed via the ICD @-@ 10 criteria . Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed . ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more in boys than in girls . About 30 – 50 % of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2 – 5 % of adults have the condition . The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other disorders as well as to distinguish from high levels of activity that are still within the normal @-@ range . 
 ADHD management recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of counseling , lifestyle changes , and medications . The British guideline only recommends medications as a first @-@ line treatment in children who have severe symptoms and for medication to be considered in those with moderate symptoms who either refuse or fail to improve with counseling . Canadian and American guidelines recommend that medications and behavioral therapy be used together as a first @-@ line therapy , except in preschool @-@ aged children . Stimulant therapy is not recommended as a first @-@ line therapy in preschool @-@ aged children in either guideline . Treatment with stimulants is effective for up to 14 months ; however , its long term effectiveness is unclear . Adolescents and adults tend to develop coping skills which make up for some or all of their impairments . 
 The medical literature has described symptoms similar to ADHD since the 19th century . ADHD , its diagnosis , and its treatment have been considered controversial since the 1970s . The controversies have involved clinicians , teachers , policymakers , parents , and the media . Topics include ADHD 's causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment . Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder , and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated . The condition was officially known as attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) from 1980 to 1987 while before this it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 <unk> , hyperactivity ( restlessness in adults ) , disruptive behavior , and impulsivity are common in ADHD . Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships . The symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention , hyperactivity , and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin . 
 According to the DSM @-@ 5 , symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age and they must cause significant problems functioning in at least two settings ( e.g. , social , school / work , or home ) . The full criteria must have been met prior to age 12 in order to receive a diagnosis of ADHD . 
 ADHD is divided into three subtypes : predominantly inattentive , predominantly hyperactive @-@ impulsive , and combined type . 
 An individual with ADHD inattentive type has most or all of following symptoms , excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition : 
 Be easily distracted , miss details , forget things , and frequently switch from one activity to another 
 Have difficulty maintaining focus on one task 
 Become bored with a task after only a few minutes , unless doing something enjoyable 
 Have difficulty focusing attention on organizing and completing a task or learning something new 
 Have trouble completing or turning in homework assignments , often losing things ( e.g. , pencils , toys , assignments ) needed to complete tasks or activities 
 Not seem to listen when spoken to 
 Daydream , become easily confused , and move slowly 
 Have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others 
 Struggle to follow instructions 
 Have trouble understanding minute details 
 An individual with ADHD hyperactive / impulsive type has most or all of the following symptoms , excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition : 
 Fidget and squirm in their seats 
 Talk nonstop 
 Dash around , touching or playing with anything and everything in sight 
 Have trouble sitting still during dinner , school , doing homework , and story time 
 Be constantly in motion 
 Have difficulty doing quiet tasks or activities 
 Be very impatient 
 Blurt out inappropriate comments , show their emotions without restraint , and act without regard for consequences 
 Have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turns in games 
 Often interrupt conversations or others ' activities 
 Symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into " inner restlessness " in teens and adults with ADHD . 
 People with ADHD are more likely to have problems with social skills , such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships . This is true for all subtypes . About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10 – 15 % of non @-@ ADHD children and adolescents . People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction . They also may drift off during conversations , and miss social cues . 
 Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD as are poor handwriting and delays in speech , language and motor development . Although it causes significant impairment , particularly in modern society , many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting . 
 = = = Associated disorders = = = 
 In children , ADHD occurs with other disorders about ⅔ of the time . Some commonly associated conditions include : 
 Learning disabilities have been found to occur in about 20 – 30 % of children with ADHD . Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders . ADHD , however , is not considered a learning disability , but it very frequently causes academic difficulties . 
 Tourette syndrome has been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population . 
 Oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) and conduct disorder ( CD ) , which occur with ADHD in about 50 % and 20 % of cases respectively . They are characterized by antisocial behaviors such as stubbornness , aggression , frequent temper tantrums , deceitfulness , lying , and stealing . About half of those with hyperactivity and ODD or CD develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood . Brain imaging supports that conduct disorder and ADHD are separate conditions .
