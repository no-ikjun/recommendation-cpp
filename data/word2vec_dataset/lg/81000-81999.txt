 Pichilemu was inhabited by Promaucaes , a pre @-@ Columbian tribal group , until the Spanish conquest of Chile . They were hunter @-@ gatherers and fishermen who lived primarily along the Cachapoal and Maule rivers . The remaining Promaucaes were assimilated into Chilean society through a process of <unk> and <unk> after the conquest of Chile . 
 Aureliano <unk> , professor of pathology at University of Chile , investigated pre @-@ Ceramic middens from Pichilemu and Cahuil . His book <unk> de Pichilemu – Cáhuil ( Chronicles of Pichilemu – Cáhuil ) was published posthumously , in 1957 . Tomás Guevara published two volumes of Historia de Chile , Chile <unk> ( History of Chile , Pre @-@ Hispanic Chile ) in 1929 , which discusses the indigenous centre of <unk> , the Pichilemu middens , the <unk> petroglyphs , a stone cup from <unk> , and pottery finds in Peralillo . 
 José Toribio Medina ( 1852 – 1930 ) , who was a writer and historiographer , spent most of his life in Colchagua Province , and completed his first archeological investigations in Pichilemu . In 1908 , he published Los <unk> Indígenas de Pichilemu ( English : The Indigenous Remains of Pichilemu ) , in which he stated that the Indians that were inhabiting Pichilemu when the Spaniards arrived at Chile were Promaucaes , part of the Topocalma encomienda , given on 24 January 1544 , by Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro , therefore establishing Pichilemu . 
 During the colonial and Republican periods , agriculture was promoted by the government . Many Chilean haciendas ( estates ) were successful during this time , including the <unk> Hacienda San Antonio de Petrel . Part of the land where San Antonio de Petrel was created was given by the Captaincy General of Chile to Bartolomé de Rojas y Puebla in 1611 , who later acquired more lands in order to establish it . San Antonio de Petrel produced leather , jerky , soles , tallow , and <unk> , as well as other products which would later be exported to Peru , or sold in Santiago and Valparaíso . San Antonio de Petrel was bordered by properties of <unk> Gaete and Ninfa Vargas , and Pedro Pavez Polanco . 
 The area around Pichilemu was very densely populated , especially in Cáhuil , where there are salt deposits that were exploited by natives . Pichilemu has had censuses taken since the 17th century . 
 In 1872 , President of Chile Aníbal Pinto commissioned the corvette captain Francisco Vidal <unk> to perform a survey of the coast between <unk> Creek and Boca del <unk> . He concluded that Pichilemu was the best place to construct a ferry . The family of Daniel Ortúzar , inheritors of the hacienda San Antonio de Petrel , constructed a dock in 1875 , which served as a fishing port for a few years , and would be decreed as a " minor dock " by President José Manuel Balmaceda in 1887 . Homes were built along the dock on what currently is the Daniel Ortúzar Avenue ( Avenida Daniel Ortúzar ) . The name Pichilemu comes from the <unk> words pichi ( little ) and <unk> ( forest ) . 
 During the 1891 Chilean Civil War , Daniel Ortúzar and the priest of <unk> were transferred as prisoners from Pichilemu to Valparaíso via the dock , which was later burned . The dock was later reconstructed and used until 1912 , but it never reached " port " status . 
 The inheritors of <unk> Gaete and Ninfa Vargas , who were proprietors of the land which is currently Central Pichilemu , founded the town in late 1891 after conceiving the design of the city with engineer Emilio <unk> . By decree of President Jorge Montt and his Interior Minister , Manuel José Irarrázabal , the city was officially established as an " autonomous commune " on 22 December 1891 . José María Caro Martínez became the first mayor of the city in 1894 , and regularised and improved the design of the city the same year . Caro Martínez held the mayor office until 1905 . 
 Agustín Ross Edwards , a Chilean writer , Member of Parliament , minister , and politician , bought a 300 @-@ hectare ( 740 @-@ acre ) tract of land , and named it La Posada , in 1885 . At the time , it was merely a set of thick @-@ walled barracks . 
 Agustín Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for affluent people from Santiago . He designed an urban setting that included a park and a forest of over 10 hectares ( 25 acres ) . He transformed La Posada into a hotel , named Gran Hotel Pichilemu , which has since been renamed to Hotel Agustín Ross . He built the Ross Casino ( currently a cultural centre ) , several chalets , terraces , embankments , stone walls , a balcony facing the beach , and several large homes with building materials and furniture imported from France and England . However , Ross was not able to build the dock he had planned for the city . He died in 1926 in Viña del Mar. Agustín Ross ' inheritors donated all of his construction ( streets , avenues , squares , seven hectares of forests , the park in front of the hotel , the <unk> , the balcony , and the terraces ) to the Municipality of Pichilemu , on the condition that the municipality would hold them for recreation and public access . The Agustín Ross Casino , constructed in 1905 , and the Agustín Ross Park , constructed in 1885 , have since become an important part of the city , and have been declared <unk> Históricos ( Historic Monuments ) by the National Monuments Council . 
 After the creation of the Cardenal Caro Province , by decree of General Augusto Pinochet on 3 October 1979 , Pichilemu became its capital . The province is named after the first Chilean Catholic Cardinal , José María Caro Rodríguez , who was born in Pichilemu . 
 Pichilemu was severely affected by the 2010 Chile earthquake and its subsequent tsunami , which caused massive destruction in the coastal zone . On 11 March 2010 , at 11 : 39 : 41 ( 14 : 39 : 41 UTC ) , a magnitude 6 @.@ 9 earthquake occurred 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) northwest of Pichilemu , killing one person .

 = Amber Room = 
 The Amber Room ( Russian : <unk> <unk> , German : <unk> , Polish : <unk> <unk> ) is a world @-@ famous chamber decorated in amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors , located in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg . Originally constructed in the 18th century in Prussia , the Amber Room disappeared during World War II and was recreated in 2003 . Before the room was lost , it was considered an " Eighth Wonder of the World " . 
 Construction of the Amber Room first took place around 1701 in Prussia . The room was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schlüter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram . Schlüter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707 , when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried <unk> and Ernst Schacht from Danzig . The amber cabinet remained in the Berlin City Palace until 1716 when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his then ally , Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire . In Russia , the room was expanded and after several renovations , it covered more than 55 square metres ( 590 sq ft ) and contained over 6 tonnes ( 13 @,@ 000 lb ) of amber . 
 The Amber Room was looted during World War II by Army Group North of Nazi Germany and brought to Königsberg for reconstruction and display . Its current whereabouts remain a mystery . In 1979 , efforts were undertaken to rebuild the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo . In 2003 , after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany , the reconstructed Amber Room was inaugurated at the Catherine Palace near Saint Petersburg .

 = = = Creation = = = 
 The Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace , the residence of Frederick , the first King of Prussia , at the urging of his second wife , Sophie Charlotte . The concept and design of the room was drafted by Andreas Schlüter . It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram , master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark , with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried <unk> from Danzig . 
 Although originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace , the complete panels were eventually installed at Berlin City Palace . The Amber Room did not , however , remain at Berlin City Palace for long . Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716 , King Frederick I 's son Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift , which forged a Russo @-@ Prussian alliance against Sweden . 
 The original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in Russia in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen . It was Peter 's daughter Empress Elisabeth who decided the amber treasure should be installed at Catherine Palace , where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers . After several other 18th @-@ century renovations , the room covered more than 55 square metres ( 590 sq ft ) and contained over 6 tonnes ( 13 @,@ 000 lb ) of amber . The room took over ten years to construct .

 Shortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II , the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room . However , over the years the amber had dried out and became brittle , making it impossible to move the room without crumbling the amber . The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper , in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it . Predictably , the attempt to hide such a well @-@ known piece of art failed . 
 German soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts . On 14 October 1941 , the priceless room reached Königsberg in East Prussia , for storage and display in the town 's castle . On 13 November 1941 , a Konigsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at Königsberg Castle .

 Orders given by Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from Königsberg .

However , before the Amber Room could be moved , Erich Koch , who was in charge of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war , abandoned his post and fled from the city , leaving General Otto <unk> in command . 
 In August 1944 , Königsberg was heavily fire bombed by the Royal Air Force . It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945 .

 In 1979 , the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo , a process that was to last 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship . Using original drawings and old black @-@ and @-@ white photographs , every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room . This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room . Another major problem was the lack of skilled workers , since amber carving was considered a nearly lost art form . 
 The financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of $ 3 @.@ 5 million from the German company <unk> By 2003 , the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed . The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg . 
 In <unk> , near Berlin , there is a miniature Amber Room , fabricated after the original . The Berlin miniature collector Ulla <unk> had this copy made of original East Prussian amber . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Amber Room is a priceless piece of art , with extraordinary architectural features such as gilding , carvings , 450 kg ( 990 lb ) amber panels , gold leaf , gemstones , and mirrors , all highlighted with candle light . Additional architectural and design features include statues of angels and children . Because of its unique features and singular beauty , the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the " Eighth Wonder of the World " . Modern estimates of the room 's value range from $ 142 million ( 2007 ) to over $ 500 million ( 2016 ) . 
 = = Disappearance and mysteries = = 
 After the war , the Amber Room was never seen in public again , though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war . Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm <unk> , which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945 , and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine . 
 In 1997 , an Italian stone mosaic that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in Germany , in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber . The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction effort . 
 In 1998 , two separate teams , one German and one Lithuanian , announced they had located the Amber Room . The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon ; neither of the two suggestions turned out to hold the Amber Room . 
 In 2004 , a lengthy investigation by British investigative journalists Catherine Scott @-@ Clark and Adrian Levy concluded that Amber Room was most likely destroyed when Königsberg Castle was heavily damaged , first during the bombing of Königsberg by the Royal Air Force in 1944 , when the castle completely burned down , and later by the Soviet shelling of the remaining walls . Documents from the Russian National Archives revealed this as the assessment of a Soviet report , written by Alexander <unk> , head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war . The report stated : 
 These dates correspond with the end of the Battle of Konigsberg , which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison . A few years later , <unk> publicly voiced a contrary opinion ; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities , who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room . 
 Among other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle . Scott @-@ Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room , even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed , was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction . Scott @-@ Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool . Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions . <unk> <unk> , senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace , reportedly stated : " It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed " . 
 After the report was made public , Leonid <unk> , who was a Lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of Konigsberg , said : " I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room " . At the same time , he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments , but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose by saying : " What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay ? " 
 A variation of this theory by some present @-@ day residents of Kaliningrad ( formerly Königsberg ) , is that at least parts of the room were found in the Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army . The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition ; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis . To preserve this story , access to the ruins of the castle , which was allowed after World War II , was suddenly restricted to all , including historical and archaeological surveys . 
 Then in 1968 , despite academic protests worldwide , Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev ordered the destruction of Königsberg Castle , thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible . In more recent years , the search for the Amber Room has continued in different locations including near Wuppertal , Germany .

 = Lipid = 
 Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats , waxes , sterols , fat @-@ soluble vitamins ( such as vitamins A , D , E , and K ) , monoglycerides , <unk> , triglycerides , phospholipids , and others . The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy , signaling , and acting as structural components of cell membranes . Lipids have applications in the cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology . 
 Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules ; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles , multilamellar / <unk> liposomes , or membranes in an aqueous environment . Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or " building @-@ blocks " : ketoacyl and isoprene groups . Using this approach , lipids may be divided into eight categories : fatty acids , glycerolipids , glycerophospholipids , sphingolipids , saccharolipids , and polyketides ( derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits ) ; and sterol lipids and <unk> lipids ( derived from condensation of isoprene subunits ) . 
 Although the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fats , fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides . Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives ( including tri- , di- , monoglycerides , and phospholipids ) , as well as other sterol @-@ containing metabolites such as cholesterol . Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids , some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet . 
 = = Categories of lipids = = 
 = = = Fatty acids = = = 
 Fatty acids , or fatty acid residues when they are part of a lipid , are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain @-@ elongation of an acetyl @-@ CoA primer with malonyl @-@ CoA or <unk> @-@ CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis . They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group ; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar , hydrophilic end , and a nonpolar , hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water . The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids , and is commonly used as a building @-@ block of more structurally complex lipids . The carbon chain , typically between four and 24 carbons long , may be saturated or unsaturated , and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen , halogens , nitrogen , and sulfur . If a fatty acid contains a double bond , there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism , which significantly affects the molecule 's configuration . Cis @-@ double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend , an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain . Three double bonds in 18 @-@ carbon linolenic acid , the most abundant fatty @-@ acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes , render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low @-@ temperatures , and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13 @-@ C NMR spectra of chloroplasts . This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes . Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration , although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils . 
 Examples of biologically important fatty acids include the eicosanoids , derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid , that include prostaglandins , leukotrienes , and thromboxanes . <unk> acid is also important in biological systems , particularly with respect to sight . Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides . Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters , fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives , fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines . The fatty amides include N @-@ acyl <unk> , such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter <unk> . 
 = = = Glycerolipids = = = 
 Glycerolipids are composed of mono- , di- , and tri @-@ substituted <unk> , the best @-@ known being the fatty acid triesters of glycerol , called triglycerides . The word " <unk> " is sometimes used synonymously with " triglyceride " . In these compounds , the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are each esterified , typically by different fatty acids . Because they function as an energy store , these lipids comprise the bulk of storage fat in animal tissues . The hydrolysis of the ester bonds of triglycerides and the release of glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue are the initial steps in metabolizing fat . 
 Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are represented by <unk> , which are characterized by the presence of one or more sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage . Examples of structures in this category are the <unk> found in plant membranes and <unk> from mammalian sperm cells . 
 = = = Glycerophospholipids = = = 
 Glycerophospholipids , usually referred to as phospholipids , are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells , as well as being involved in metabolism and cell signaling . Neural tissue ( including the brain ) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids , and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders . Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes , based on the nature of the polar headgroup at the sn @-@ 3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and <unk> , or the sn @-@ 1 position in the case of archaebacteria . 
 Examples of glycerophospholipids found in biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine ( also known as PC , <unk> or <unk> ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE or <unk> ) and phosphatidylserine ( PS or <unk> ) . In addition to serving as a primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins , some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells , such as <unk> and <unk> acids are either precursors of or , themselves , membrane @-@ derived second messengers . Typically , one or both of these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long @-@ chain fatty acids , but there are also alkyl @-@ linked and 1Z @-@ alkenyl @-@ linked ( <unk> ) glycerophospholipids , as well as <unk> variants in archaebacteria . 
 = = = Sphingolipids = = = 
 Sphingolipids are a complicated family of compounds that share a common structural feature , a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized de novo from the amino acid serine and a long @-@ chain fatty acyl CoA , then converted into ceramides , phosphosphingolipids , glycosphingolipids and other compounds . The major sphingoid base of mammals is commonly referred to as sphingosine . <unk> ( N @-@ acyl @-@ sphingoid bases ) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide @-@ linked fatty acid . The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono @-@ unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms . 
 The major phosphosphingolipids of mammals are sphingomyelins ( ceramide <unk> ) , whereas insects contain mainly ceramide <unk> and fungi have <unk> <unk> and mannose @-@ containing headgroups . The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of molecules composed of one or more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base . Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as <unk> and gangliosides . 
 = = = Sterol lipids = = = 
 Sterol lipids , such as cholesterol and its derivatives , are an important component of membrane lipids , along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins . The steroids , all derived from the same fused four @-@ ring core structure , have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules . The eighteen @-@ carbon ( C18 ) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and <unk> . The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids . The <unk> , comprising various forms of vitamin D , are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure . Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates , which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver . The plant equivalents are the <unk> , such as β @-@ sitosterol , stigmasterol , and <unk> ; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth . The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol . 
 = = = Prenol lipids = = = 
 Prenol lipids are synthesized from the five @-@ carbon @-@ unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid ( MVA ) pathway . The simple isoprenoids ( linear alcohols , diphosphates , etc . ) are formed by the successive addition of C5 units , and are classified according to number of these terpene units . Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as <unk> . Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones , which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a <unk> core of non @-@ isoprenoid origin . Vitamin E and vitamin K , as well as the <unk> , are examples of this class . Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols ( called <unk> ) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated , whereas in animal polyprenols ( <unk> ) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced . 
 = = = Saccharolipids = = = 
 Saccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked directly to a sugar backbone , forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers . In the saccharolipids , a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids . The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the Lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram @-@ negative bacteria . Typical lipid A molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine , which are <unk> with as many as seven fatty @-@ acyl chains . The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is <unk> @-@ Lipid A , a hexa @-@ acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3 @-@ deoxy @-@ D @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> acid ( <unk> ) residues . 
 = = = Polyketides = = = 
 Polyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases . They comprise a large number of secondary metabolites and natural products from animal , plant , bacterial , fungal and marine sources , and have great structural diversity . Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation , methylation , hydroxylation , oxidation , and / or other processes . Many commonly used anti @-@ microbial , anti @-@ parasitic , and anti @-@ cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives , such as <unk> , tetracyclines , <unk> , and antitumor epothilones . 
 = = Biological functions = = 
 = = = Membranes = = = 
 Eukaryotic cells feature compartmentalized membrane @-@ bound organelles that carry out different biological functions . The glycerophospholipids are the main structural component of biological membranes , such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles ; in animal cells the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment . The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules ( containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions ) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid @-@ derived " tails " by ester linkages and to one " head " group by a phosphate ester linkage . While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes , other non @-@ <unk> lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols ( mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes ) are also found in biological membranes . In plants and algae , the <unk> , and <unk> , which lack a phosphate group , are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues , including those of higher plants , algae and certain bacteria . 
 Plant thylakoid membranes have the largest lipid component of a non @-@ bilayer forming <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , and little phospholipids ; despite this unique lipid composition , chloroplast thylakoid membranes have been shown to contain a dynamic lipid @-@ bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies . 
 A biological membrane is a form of lamellar phase lipid bilayer . The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment . This is known as the hydrophobic effect . In an aqueous system , the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar , aqueous environment , while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together , forming a vesicle ; depending on the concentration of the lipid , this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles , liposomes , or lipid bilayers . Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile ( lipid ) behavior . Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics and is the subject of current academic research . <unk> and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect . When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment , the polar molecules ( i.e. , water in an aqueous solution ) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance , since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile . So in an aqueous environment , the water molecules form an ordered " clathrate " cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule . 
 The formation of lipids into <unk> membranes represents a key step in models of abiogenesis , the origin of life . 
 = = = Energy storage = = = 
 <unk> , stored in adipose tissue , are a major form of energy storage both in animals and plants . The <unk> , or fat cell , is designed for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals , with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone @-@ sensitive enzyme lipase . The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content , about 9 kcal / g , compared with 4 kcal / g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins . Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights . 
 = = = Signaling = = = 
 In recent years , evidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling is a vital part of the cell signaling . Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein @-@ coupled or nuclear receptors , and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers . These include sphingosine @-@ 1 @-@ phosphate , a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization , cell growth , and apoptosis ; diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( <unk> ) , involved in calcium @-@ mediated activation of protein kinase C ; the prostaglandins , which are one type of fatty @-@ acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity ; the steroid hormones such as estrogen , testosterone and cortisol , which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction , metabolism and blood pressure ; and the <unk> such as 25 @-@ hydroxy @-@ cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists . Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and / or pieces of cells . They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases , which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids . After this occurs , other cells recognize the <unk> and <unk> the cells or cell fragments exposing them . 
 = = = Other functions = = = 
 The " fat @-@ soluble " vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) – which are isoprene @-@ based lipids – are essential nutrients stored in the liver and fatty tissues , with a diverse range of functions . Acyl @-@ carnitines are involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in and out of mitochondria , where they undergo beta oxidation . <unk> and their phosphorylated derivatives also play important transport roles , in this case the transport of oligosaccharides across membranes . <unk> phosphate sugars and polyprenol diphosphate sugars function in extra @-@ cytoplasmic glycosylation reactions , in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis ( for instance , peptidoglycan polymerization in bacteria ) , and in eukaryotic protein N @-@ glycosylation . <unk> are a subclass of glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups that are particularly abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane . They are believed to activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation . Lipids also form the basis of steroid hormones . 
 = = Metabolism = = 
 The major dietary lipids for humans and other animals are animal and plant triglycerides , sterols , and membrane phospholipids . The process of lipid metabolism synthesizes and degrades the lipid stores and produces the structural and functional lipids characteristic of individual tissues . 
 = = = Biosynthesis = = = 
 In animals , when there is an oversupply of dietary carbohydrate , the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides . This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl @-@ CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides , a process called <unk> . Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl @-@ CoA units . The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group , reduce it to an alcohol , dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group . The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups , in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein , while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway . The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver . 
 The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction , whereby a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain . For example , in humans , the desaturation of stearic acid by <unk> @-@ CoA <unk> @-@ 1 produces oleic acid . The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid as well as the <unk> unsaturated α @-@ linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues , and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet . 
 <unk> synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl @-@ <unk> are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol @-@ 3 @-@ phosphate and diacylglycerol . 
 Terpenes and isoprenoids , including the carotenoids , are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate . These precursors can be made in different ways . In animals and archaea , the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl @-@ CoA , while in plants and bacteria the non @-@ mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 @-@ phosphate as substrates . One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis . Here , the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol . Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol . 
 = = = Degradation = = = 
 Beta oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria and / or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl @-@ CoA . For the most part , fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to , but not identical with , a reversal of the process of fatty acid synthesis . That is , two @-@ carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation , hydration , and oxidation to form a beta @-@ keto acid , which is split by <unk> . The acetyl @-@ CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP , CO2 , and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain . Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl @-@ CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if there is little or no glucose available . The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP . <unk> and odd @-@ chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation . 
 = = Nutrition and health = = 
 Most of the fat found in food is in the form of triglycerides , cholesterol , and phospholipids . Some dietary fat is necessary to facilitate absorption of fat @-@ soluble vitamins ( A , D , E , and K ) and carotenoids . Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids , such as linoleic acid ( an omega @-@ 6 fatty acid ) and alpha @-@ linolenic acid ( an omega @-@ 3 fatty acid ) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet . Both of these fatty acids are 18 @-@ carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds . Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid ( safflower , sunflower , and corn oils ) . Alpha @-@ linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants , and in selected seeds , nuts , and legumes ( in particular flax , rapeseed , walnut , and soy ) . Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer @-@ chain omega @-@ 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega @-@ 3 fatty acids on infant development , cancer , cardiovascular diseases , and various mental illnesses , such as depression , attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder , and dementia . In contrast , it is now well @-@ established that consumption of trans fats , such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils , are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . 
 A few studies have suggested that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes . However , a number of very large studies , including the Women 's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial , an eight @-@ year study of 49 @,@ 000 women , the Nurses ' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow @-@ up Study , revealed no such links . None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer , heart disease , or weight gain . The Nutrition Source , a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health , summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat : " Detailed research — much of it done at Harvard — shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn 't really linked with weight or disease .

 The accompanying music video for " Don 't Wake Me Up " was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed in a desert on May 14 , 2012 . Several images from the shoot , showing Brown posing shirtless against a vintage car , and images of Brown posing with model Araya Nicks , who plays his love interest in the video , were posted on the Internet the following day . The video premiered online on June 11 , 2012 . Later that day , Brown made a guest appearance on 106 & Park and discussed the video 's concept : 
 With this video , we wanted to go completely into the dream world . A lot of my videos from ' Turn Up the Music ' and other videos I 'm doing now are in a dream state of believing what you want to believe . So that 's what Fortune kinda encompasses . So it 's basically dreaming and accomplishing your dreams . This video is me dreaming and being taken into this whole kind of maze . I keep waking up within a dream within a dream , almost on some Inception type ... but I don 't want to bite that .

 The video begins with Brown singing alone in a desert in front of a sunset backdrop . It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman ( played by Araya Nicks ) walking through the first of three doors behind him . Each door is labeled with hieroglyphics in gold . During the first chorus , Brown follows the woman through the door and enters a garden maze . This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing in the desert . He then returns to bed as the woman walks through the second door . Brown follows her again and appears in a city in the sky . This scene is also intercut with scenes of him in the desert . During the second chorus , Brown is hit by a tidal wave which sends him back to bed . He then enters the third door and appears driving a vintage car in the desert . Brown drives after the woman until he hits a sign that reads " Road Closed " , which causes him to drive off a cliff . The video then cuts to Brown and the woman lying in bed with electrodes attached to their heads .

 = Battle of Île Ronde = 
 The Battle of Île Ronde was a minor naval engagement between small French Navy and British Royal Navy squadrons off Île de France , now named Mauritius , in the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars . The battle was fought over control of the waters around Île de France , which was under blockade from the British squadron as French warships and privateers operating from the island posed a significant threat to vital British trade routes connected to British India and China . 
 In an attempt to neutralise the island , the British commander in the region , Peter Rainier ordered the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion and 44 @-@ gun HMS Diomede to institute a blockade , which began in October 1794 . Concerned by food shortages and a rebellious slave population the French naval commander Jean @-@ Marie Renaud led his small squadron comprising frigates Cybèle and Prudente and three smaller vessels to drive off the British squadron . On 22 October , the squadrons met off Île Ronde , an islet off northern Île de France . 
 The battle lasted two and a quarter hours , in which Centurion and Cybèle fought a close duel which left both ships badly damaged . Supported by the remainder of the squadron , Cybèle successfully withdrew under fire , but Centurion , without support from the distant Diomede was also forced to retire for repairs . Unable to continue the blockade the British force returned to India , allowing food supplies to reach Île de France . Due to the necessity for campaigns against Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies , the British blockade was not renewed , but the French were unable to take advantage due to increasing civil unrest among the island 's population . 
 = = Background = = 
 War between the French Republic and Great Britain began on 1 February 1793 , news arriving among the French and British East Indian colonies on 11 June 1793 . The strongest French positions in the Indian Ocean were the islands of Île de France and Réunion , which lay substantially to the west of the British bases at Bombay and Madras in British India . A small French frigate squadron , supported by smaller warships and privateers operated from the islands posing a considerable threat to British maritime trade in the Indian Ocean . 
 To counter the threat the British commander in the region , Captain Peter Rainier ordered two of his ships to blockade the island during the summer of 1794 . Rainer 's force comprised the 50 @-@ gun fourth rate ship 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion under Captain Samuel Osborne and the large 44 @-@ gun frigate HMS Diomede under Captain Matthew Smith . Together the ships sailed from Madras on 30 August 1794 , stopping at the allied port of Trincomalee in Dutch Ceylon and the undefended French @-@ controlled island of Rodrigues before arriving off Île de France in October . 
 Île de France had been in a state of turmoil since the French Revolution and in 1792 the republican party on the island seized control . In 1794 suspected royalists were arrested , including the naval commander Saint @-@ Félix , their executions forestalled by the arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery . Only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented unrest . The preoccupation of the naval authorities had prevented any offensive operations and the reduced squadron , now commanded by Captain Jean @-@ Marie Renaud , remained in Port Louis . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Despite the upheaval on shore , the arrival of the British blockade squadron provoked Renaud into taking action . Although the defences of Île de France were well prepared under Malartic 's orders , food supplies were running low , with only rice still available in quantity . The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede . The French squadron comprised the 40 @-@ gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart , the 36 @-@ gun Prudente under Renaud and the 14 @-@ gun brig Courier under Lieutenant Garreau . The force was accompanied by the 20 @-@ gun privateer corvettes Jean @-@ Bart and Rosalie was well as the aviso Sans @-@ <unk> . The ships ' crews were heavily augmented by volunteers , including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle , as well as a detachment of soldiers . 
 Renaud 's squadron sailed on 19 October , seeking the British to the north of the island . At 11 : 00 on 22 October , close to the uninhabited islet of Île Ronde northwest of Île de France the British ships were sighted . Osborne issued orders to advance on the French squadron , Renaud responding by forming his ships in a line of battle and advancing to meet Osborne . Prudente led the French line , closely followed by Cybèle , Jean @-@ Bart and Courier , Osborne focusing on the former and ordering Smith to engage the latter . Firing began at 15 : 29 when Prudente unleashed a close range broadside at Centurion , followed immediately by fire from the ships of both sides . Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16 : 00 had most of her sails and rigging torn . At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward out of range , each firing on Centurion as they passed . 
 As Cybèle came within range of Centurion the frigate 's fire brought down the British ship 's mizen topmast and fore topgallantmast . Return fire from Centurion managed however to sufficiently damage the French ship that she was unable to retreat in the light winds and the two largely immobilised ships began a close range duel . For more than an hour the exchange continued , Renaud unable to intervene from leeward and Smith repeatedly refusing Osborne 's orders to support his ship , Diomede remaining at long range and contributing an intermittent and inaccurate fire on the distant Cybèle . At 17 : 15 a light breeze enabled Tréhouart to slowly pull his ship towards Renaud 's force despite the loss of the main topgallantmast . At 17 : 45 , with Prudente close by , the main topmast fell on Cybèle , which had 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water in the hold , but Osborne , outnumbered and with his ship damaged reluctantly withdrew . The threat lifted , Renaud was able to take Cybèle under tow and retire in the direction of Île de France , followed distantly and ineffectually by Diomede until night fell .

 = = Aftermath = = 
 The immediate result of the battle was inconclusive , both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece . French losses had been heavy , with 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente , the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle . One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean @-@ Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier . By contrast , Centurion had only three men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none at all , but the damage to Osborne 's ship was more severe ; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby Port Louis , repairs to Centurion could only be affected in India , several thousand miles away . Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade and retire , Centurion to Bombay and Diomede to Madras . 
 The action brought repercussions for Smith , whose failure to support Osborne was noted ; although Smith claimed that he was simply maintaining the line of battle , it subsequently emerged that the captains had engaged in a personal dispute in result of which Smith had decided to refuse Osborne 's orders . After his behaviour had featured in Osborne 's initial dispatch , Smith challenged his account and Osborne demanded a court @-@ martial held to investigate . This panel decided that Smith 's behaviour was unacceptable and he was dismissed from the Navy , by which time he had lost Diomede , wrecked on a rock in Trincomalee Bay on 2 August 1795 during the invasion of Ceylon . Although Smith appealed his sentence and was restored to the captain 's list in 1798 he was never again called to service and retired in 1806 . 
 British historians have considered that Smith 's refusal to participate probably cost Osborne the battle . William James wrote that his behaviour was " the principle reason that Cybèle , at least , was not made a prize of by the British " . C. Northcote Parkinson considers the action " indecisive " but concurs with James ' assessment that Smith 's intervention could have resulted in a British victory but instead that " the first encounter of the war between the French and English in the East Indies had resulted in what was tantamount to defeat for the latter " . 
 On Île de France the relief of the blockade meant that shipping , particularly American vessels laden with food supplies from Tamatave on Madagascar , could reach the island and the threatened famine was averted . French privateers were also again free to operate against British trade , particularly in the Bay of Bengal . With Renaud 's squadron still at Port Louis , Rainier considered renewing the blockade , but was dissuaded by the dangers of the monsoon season and a false report that a squadron of French ships of the line was soon due to arrive on Île de France . In 1795 he was distracted by the sudden need to guard against the Dutch East India colonies following the French conquest of the Netherlands , and he supervised the invasion of Ceylon and operations against the Dutch East Indies . By the time his attention turned once more to Île de France , it had been heavily reinforced in early 1796 by a frigate squadron commanded by Contre @-@ amiral Sercey .

 The confiscation of the Prussian cavalry and draft stock required supervision to integrate the acquisitions into the Grande Armée . After completing several terms as an inspector general of cavalry , Defrance was appointed general of division in August 1811 and joined Joachim Murat 's Cavalry in February 1812 for Napoleon 's Invasion of Russia . At the Battle of Borodino , he commanded 4th Cuirassier Division , which included three brigades and two horse artillery units of 12 guns .

 During the Saxon campaign , Defrance was appointed Inspector General for the Grande Armée . He also commanded the 4th Heavy Cavalry Division at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813 , and one of his brigades remained at Lindenau to cover a possible retreat . 
 In January 1814 , for the last few months of Napoleon 's rule , Defrance commanded four regiments of Imperial Guard and fought in the action of 11 February at Montmirail , during the Six Days Campaign . On 7 March , with much smaller force than his opponent , he repulsed the Russian assault at Rheims , but on 12 March was forced to relinquish the city as more Coalition troops arrived .

 = California Southern Railroad = 
 The California Southern Railroad was a subsidiary railroad of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( Santa Fe ) in Southern California . It was organized July 10 , 1880 , and chartered on October 23 , 1880 , to build a rail connection between what has become the city of Barstow and San Diego , California . 
 Construction began in National City , just south of San Diego , in 1881 , and proceeded northward to the present day city of Oceanside . From there , the line turned to the northeast through Temecula Canyon , then on to the present cities of Lake Elsinore , Perris and Riverside before a connection to the Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ) in Colton . Following a frog war where the SP refused to let the California Southern cross its tracks , a dispute that was resolved by court order in favor of the California Southern , construction continued northward through Cajon Pass to the present day cities of Victorville and Barstow . The line , completed on November 9 , 1885 , formed the western end of Santa Fe 's transcontinental railroad connection to Chicago . Portions of the original line are still in use today as some of the busiest rail freight and passenger routes in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 The California Southern was organized on July 10 , 1880 , as a means to connect San Diego to a connection with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad at an as @-@ yet undetermined point . Among the organizers were Frank Kimball , a prominent landowner and rancher from San Diego who also represented the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of City Trustees of San Diego , Kidder , Peabody & Co . , one of the main financial investment companies involved in the Santa Fe , B.P. Cheney , L.G. Pratt , George B. Wilbur and Thomas Nickerson who was president of the Santa Fe . The organizers set a deadline of January 1 , 1884 , to complete the connection , a deadline that was later adjusted due to problems in the construction of the Atlantic and Pacific that forced it to stop at Needles , California . 
 The California Southern built its track northward from a point in National City , south of San Diego . The route , portions of which are still in use , connected the present day cities of National City , San Diego , Fallbrook , Temecula , Lake Elsinore , Perris , Riverside , San Bernardino , Colton , Cajon ( not to be confused with El Cajon ) , Victorville and Barstow . 
 In Barstow , then known as Waterman , the California Southern would connect to another Santa Fe subsidiary , the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad . The Atlantic and Pacific was chartered in 1866 to build a railroad connection westward from Springfield , Missouri , connecting Albuquerque , New Mexico , then along the 35th parallel to the Colorado River . From there , the railroad was to continue to the Pacific Ocean following whatever proved to be the best route . The route was scheduled to be completed by July 4 , 1878 . However , the Southern Pacific was able to get a clause favorable to their own interests inserted into the charter : 
 " ... the Southern Pacific Railroad ... is hereby authorized to connect with the said Atlantic and Pacific railroad formed under this act , at such point , near the boundary line of the State of California , as they shall deem most suitable for a railroad line to San Francisco . " 
 Southern Pacific had already established a connection to Mojave , so their crews built eastward from there through Barstow ( then called Waterman ) to Needles , California , completing the connection across the Colorado River on August 3 , 1883 . The California segment was leased to the Santa Fe in August 1884 , and fully acquired by the Santa Fe under foreclosure in 1897 . 
 = = = San Diego = = = 
 The California Southern began construction in National City on land originally acquired by Frank Kimball . The railroad 's main yards and locomotive maintenance shops were located here , and until the connection was made with Barstow , all tools and equipment ordered by the railroad arrived here by ship around Cape Horn from points in the eastern United States , while the wooden ties arrived by ship from Oregon . Surveys and construction between National City and San Diego were well underway by March 1881 . The railroad reached Fallbrook and opened between there and San Diego in January 1882 . 
 In 1881 and 1882 , the California Southern received ten locomotive shipments by sea at National City . The last three of these , delivered in November 1882 aboard the ship Anna Camp , have been identified as the last three locomotives ever delivered to the United States Pacific coast after traveling around Cape Horn . 
 = = = Temecula Canyon = = = 
 To connect to the Atlantic and Pacific line in the quickest way possible , surveyors and engineers for the California Southern pushed the route through Fallbrook and Temecula — bypassing what was , at the time , the pueblo of Los Angeles . The railroad , however , didn 't understand the nature of Southern California 's dry washes . Local inhabitants warned the railroad of the dangers of building through such an area , that it could become a raging torrent of water , but the railroad built through the canyon anyway . 
 Despite the warnings , track work through the canyon proceeded at a quick pace . They completed the line to Fallbrook on January 2 , 1882 , then to Temecula on March 27 , 1882 . 
 Many parts of the canyon had suffered storms . In February 1884 , a storm hit . The train was delayed and the canyon walls brought boulders crashing down on the rails . On February 3 , the train was unable to get through . A few days later , the wires were down . The train from Colton to San Diego could not get through . Disaster was averted because a local resident , Charlie Howell , hurried up the tracks from his family homestead near Willow Glen and managed to stop the train . A series of devastating washouts on the section through Temecula Canyon occurred amid heavy rain storms that flooded the area starting on February 16 , 1884 , just six months after the first trains operated the entire route between San Diego and San Bernardino . The storms brought more than 40 inches ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) of rain in a four @-@ week period . Two thirds of the mainline through the canyon were washed out with ties seen floating as far as 80 miles ( 129 km ) away in the ocean . Temporary track repairs were made after the first storms , but later in the month , additional rains and flooding washed out the entire route through the canyon . Repairs were estimated at nearly $ 320 @,@ 000 , a figure that could not be recouped effectively . 
 The canyon was finally bypassed completely with the completion of the Surf Line on August 12 , 1888 , and the line through the canyon was relegated to branch line status . By 1900 it had been abandoned by AT & SF . Finally , the 1928 construction of Railroad Canyon Dam submerged the section of track between Elsinore and Perris beneath Railroad Canyon Lake ( now known as Canyon Lake ) . 
 = = = The crossing at Colton = = = 
 Construction of the California Southern was repeatedly interrupted by Santa Fe 's rival , Southern Pacific Railroad ( SP ) . In one instance , the California Southern was set to build a level junction across the SP tracks in Colton , a move that would end Southern Pacific 's monopoly in Southern California . 
 The Colton Crossing was the site of one of the more notable frog wars in American railroad history . In the summer of 1882 , tensions reached their boiling point when construction of tracks for the California Southern reached Colton , California . In an attempt to forcibly prevent the California Southern Railroad crews from completing construction , the Southern Pacific ( SP ) parked and then slowly moved a locomotive and gondola along the SP track at the location of the planned crossing . In addition , the SP hired armed men , including the famous Virgil Earp , to guard the tracks . Before the violence could get out of hand , Governor Robert Waterman ordered San Bernardino County Sheriff J.B. Burkhart to enforce the state court order . Waterman personally ordered Earp and the crowd to comply with the court order . Earp backed down and told the SP engineer to move the locomotive . The crossing was built , ending the Southern Pacific 's monopoly in Southern California . 
 = = = Cajon Pass = = = 
 The first structure that the California Southern used as a depot in San Bernardino was a converted boxcar . Building north from San Bernardino , the California Southern was able to piggyback on the survey work done by the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad up to a point near Cajon . 
 The original grade of the line up the pass rose at a 2 @.@ 2 % slope between San Bernardino and Cajon , where the grade steepened to 3 % until reaching the summit 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) further . The route over Cajon Pass was completed with a " last spike " on November 9 , 1885 , and the first train to use the pass carried a load of rails southward from Barstow on November 12 to be installed near Riverside . The first through train from Chicago via Santa Fe lines arrived in San Diego on November 17 , 1885 . 
 Construction of the original route through Cajon Pass was overseen by Jacob Nash Victor , who by this time had become General Manager of the California Southern . He operated the first train through the pass in 1885 , proclaiming " No other railroad will ever have the nerve to build through these mountains . All who follow will prefer to rent trackage from us . " Victor 's assertion remained true for a while as the San Pedro , Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad ( which later became part of Union Pacific Railroad ) signed an agreement to operate over the California Southern track via trackage rights on April 26 , 1905 , but Victor was proven wrong eighty years later when SP built the Palmdale Cutoff in 1967 at a slightly higher elevation through the pass . In honor of his work through the pass , the city of Victorville was named after Victor . 
 = = = Consolidation = = = 
 To reach Los Angeles , the Santa Fe leased trackage rights over the Southern Pacific from San Bernardino on November 29 , 1885 , at $ 1 @,@ 200 per mile per year . Naturally , the Santa Fe sought ways to reduce the fees . On November 20 , 1886 , the Santa Fe incorporated the San Bernardino and Los Angeles Railway to build a rail connection between its namesake cities . California Southern track crews performed the construction work , and the first train on the new line arrived in Los Angeles on May 31 , 1887 . 
 During construction , Santa Fe officials worked to consolidate the many subsidiary railroads in Southern California to reduce costs . At a stockholder meeting on April 23 , the eight railroads and their prominent stockholders , minus the California Southern , voted in favor of consolidation , and the California Central Railway was formed as a result on May 20 , 1887 . After the consolidation , although the California Southern remained a separate subsidiary , the National City shops were downgraded and the services provided there were moved to the newly constructed shops in San Bernardino . One of the first official lists of stations on the California Southern and California Central railroads published on July 13 , 1887 , shows the California Southern divided operationally into two divisions : the San Diego division covered the territory between National City and Colton ; from there , the San Bernardino Division covered the route through Cajon Pass to Barstow . 
 The Santa Fe underwent a massive financial overhaul in 1889 . The major investors in Boston , Massachusetts , were mostly replaced by investors from New York and London at the annual meeting on May 9 . The investors replaced the company 's board of directors with a new board that included George C. Magoun ( who would later be linked with the company 's 1893 receivership ) . The new investors disliked the number of subsidiary companies and sought to further consolidate them . The California Southern , California Central and Redondo Beach Railway companies were consolidated into the Southern California Railway on November 7 , 1889 . The California Central had consolidated with the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad in 1887 , giving it ROW through the San Gabriel Valley . The Santa Fe finally purchased outright the holdings of the Southern California railroad on January 17 , 1906 , ending the railway 's subsidiary status and making it fully a part of the Santa Fe railroad .

 Much of the right @-@ of @-@ way graded and used by the California Southern is still in use . Several structures built for or by the railroad , or in some cases their remains , can still be seen . Some of the buildings that remain are still in use in their primary purposes . 
 The two ends of the former railroad are still in use as of 2013 . The section between Barstow and Riverside through Cajon Pass , which includes the disputed crossing in Colton , remains one of the busiest rail freight corridors in the United States , seeing trains of BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad as well as Amtrak 's daily Southwest Chief passenger train . At Cajon the concrete pads that served as the foundations for the railroad 's station facilities and water tanks there remain long after the buildings atop them were removed . The Santa Fe realigned the track at several places during the 20th century to straighten curves along Cajon Creek ( between Cajon and San Bernardino ) , lower grades for eastbound trains with the 1913 addition of a separate track through what has come to be known as Sullivan 's Curve , and to reduce some curvature and lower the pass 's summit elevation by 50 ft ( 15 m ) . 
 The maintenance shops in San Bernardino are still in use by BNSF Railway , although not to the extent that they were used in the 20th century . The San Bernardino station that was opened by the California Southern was destroyed by fire on November 16 , 1916 . It was replaced in 1918 by the Santa Fe with the current structure that now serves Metrolink 's San Bernardino Line commuter trains on runs that terminate at Los Angeles Union Station . Until the introduction of weekend service on the 91 Line in July 2014 , limited service from San Bernardino to Riverside was provided by some San Bernardino Line trains , and the Metrolink Riverside Line terminates at the Riverside station although it reaches the station via a more southerly route . South of Riverside the track is still in place to Perris , where the Orange Empire Railway Museum has a connection to the mainline . This section is being rehabilitated to the Perris Valley Line , an extension of Metrolink 91 Line service to stations at Hunter Park , March Air Reserve Base , Perris , and South Perris . 
 At the southern end the section between San Diego and Oceanside also sees heavy use by Amtrak California 's Pacific Surfliner trains as well as those of the San Diego Coaster . As part of the Santa Fe 's rail network , it was part of what has come to be known as the Surf Line . As of January 2006 , this line is the second busiest passenger rail line in the United States . 
 Although San Diego 's Union Station replaced the railroad 's original station there in 1915 , the California Southern 's station and office building in National City has been preserved and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 = Salt = 
 Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts ; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite . Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater , where it is the main mineral constituent . The open ocean has about 35 grams ( 1 @.@ 2 oz ) of solids per litre , a salinity of 3 @.@ 5 % . 
 Salt is essential for human life , and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes . The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues . Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings , and salting is an important method of food preservation . 
 Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8 @,@ 000 years ago , when people living in an area in what is now known as the country of Romania were boiling spring water to extract the salts ; a salt @-@ works in China dates to approximately the same period . Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites and the Egyptians . Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea , along specially built salt roads , and across the Sahara in camel caravans . The scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations to go to war over salt and use it to raise tax revenues . Salt is also used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance . 
 Salt is processed from salt mines , or by the evaporation of seawater ( sea salt ) or mineral @-@ rich spring water in shallow pools . Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine , and is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride , plastics , paper pulp and many other products . Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt , only about 6 % is used for human consumption . Other uses include water conditioning processes , deicing highways , and agricultural use . Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti @-@ caking agent and may be <unk> to prevent iodine deficiency . As well as its use in cooking and at the table , salt is present in many processed foods . 
 Sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute . Excessive salt consumption can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases , such as hypertension , in children and adults . Such health effects of salt have long been studied . Accordingly , numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods . The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2 @,@ 000 mg of sodium , equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day . 
 = = History = = 
 Humans have always tended to build communities either around sources of salt , or where they can trade for it . 
 All through history the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization . The word " salary " comes from the Latin word for salt because the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt , which was quite literally worth its weight in gold . In Britain , the suffix " <unk> " in a placename means it was once a source of salt , as in Sandwich and Norwich . The <unk> Valley was a key region that supported the Egyptian Empire to its north , because it supplied it with a kind of salt that came to be called by its name , natron . 
 Even before this , what is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is <unk> , in Bulgaria , which was a salt mine , providing the area now known as the Balkans with salt since 5400 BC . Even the name <unk> means " salt works " . 
 While people have used canning and artificial refrigeration to preserve food for the last hundred years or so , salt has been the best @-@ known food preservative , especially for meat , for many thousands of years . A very ancient salt @-@ works operation has been discovered at the <unk> <unk> archaeological site next to a salt spring in <unk> , Neamț County , Romania . Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the <unk> Culture were boiling the salt @-@ laden spring water through the process of <unk> to extract the salt as far back as <unk> BC . The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society 's population soon after its initial production began . The harvest of salt from the surface of <unk> Lake near <unk> in Shanxi , China , dates back to at least 6000 BC , making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks . 
 There is more salt in animal tissues such as meat , blood and milk , than there is in plant tissues . Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food , but agriculturalists , feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter , need to supplement their diet with salt . With the spread of civilization , salt became one of the world 's main trading commodities . It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity . In the Middle East , salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement , and the ancient Hebrews made a " covenant of salt " with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him . An ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth : scattering salt around in a defeated city in order to prevent plant growth . The Bible tells the story of King Abimelech who was ordered by God to do this at Shechem , and various texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War ( 146 BC ) . 
 Salt may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era . Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC . In the early years of the Roman Empire , roads such as the Via <unk> were built for the transportation of salt from the salt pans of Ostia to the capital . Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC , as were salted birds , and salt fish . From about 2800 BC , the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar , glass and the dye Tyrian purple ; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian salt fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire . 
 In Africa , salt was used as currency south of the Sahara , and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia . Moorish merchants in the 6th century traded salt for gold , weight for weight . The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by <unk> ( salt caravans ) . The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to <unk> , although much of the trade now takes place by truck . Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates . 
 Salzburg , Hallstatt , and <unk> lie within 17 km ( 11 mi ) of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits . Salzach literally means " salt river " and Salzburg " salt castle " , both taking their names from the German word Salz meaning salt and Hallstatt was the site of the world 's first salt mine . The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC . Around 400 BC , the townsfolk , who had previously used pickaxes and shovels , began open pan salt making . During the first millennium BC , Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries . The word salary originates from Latin : <unk> which referred to the money paid to the Roman Army 's soldiers for the purchase of salt . The word salad literally means " salted " , and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables . 
 Wars have been fought over salt . Venice fought and won a war with Genoa over the product , and it played an important part in the American Revolution . Cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying duties , and towns like Liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire . Various governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples . The voyages of Christopher Columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain , and the oppressive salt tax in France was one of the causes of the French Revolution . After being repealed , this tax was reimposed by Napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars , and was not finally abolished until 1945 . In 1930 , Mahatma Gandhi led at least 100 @,@ 000 people on the " Dandi March " or " Salt Satyagraha " , in which protesters made their own salt from the sea thus defying British rule and avoiding paying the salt tax . This civil disobedience inspired millions of common people , and elevated the Indian independence movement from an elitist movement to a national struggle . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 Salt is mostly sodium chloride , the ionic compound with the formula NaCl , representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine . Sea salt and freshly mined salt ( much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas ) also contain small amounts of trace elements ( which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health ) . Mined salt is often refined in the production of table salt ; it is dissolved in water , purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution , and re @-@ evaporated . During this same refining process it is often also iodized . Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape ; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge . The molar mass of salt is 58 @.@ 443 g / mol , its melting point is 801 ° C ( 1 @,@ 474 ° F ) and its boiling point 1 @,@ 465 ° C ( 2 @,@ 669 ° F ) . Its density is 2 @.@ 17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water . When dissolved in water it separates into Na + and Cl − ions and the solubility is 359 grams per litre . From cold solutions , salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl · 2H2O . Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water ; the freezing point is − 21 @.@ 12 ° C ( − 6 @.@ 02 ° F ) for 23 @.@ 31 wt % of salt , and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108 @.@ 7 ° C ( 227 @.@ 7 ° F ) . 
 = = Edible salt = = 
 Salt is essential to the health of humans and animals , and is one of the five basic taste sensations . 
 Salt is used in many cuisines around the world , and is often found in salt shakers on diners ' eating tables for their personal use on food . Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs . Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride . Usually , anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free @-@ flowing . Iodized salt , containing potassium iodide , is widely available . Some people put a desiccant , such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a <unk> cracker , in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form . 
 = = = Fortified table salt = = = 
 Some table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns , especially in the developing world . The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country . Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans , and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine ( hypothyroidism ) and enlargement of the thyroid gland ( endemic goitre ) in adults or cretinism in children . Iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide , sodium iodide or sodium iodate . A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine . Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation . Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used . 
 The amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country . In the United States , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommends [ 21 CFR 101 @.@ 9 ( c ) ( 8 ) ( iv ) ] 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women . US iodized salt contains 46 – 77 ppm ( parts per million ) , whereas in the UK the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10 – 22 ppm . 
 Sodium ferrocyanide , also known as yellow <unk> of soda , is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent . The additive is considered safe for human consumption . Such anti @-@ caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely . The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988 . Other anticaking agents sometimes used include <unk> phosphate , calcium or magnesium carbonates , fatty acid salts ( acid salts ) , magnesium oxide , silicon dioxide , calcium silicate , sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate . Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds . 
 In " doubly fortified salt " , both iodide and iron salts are added . The latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia , which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40 % of infants in the developing world . A typical iron source is ferrous fumarate . Another additive , especially important for pregnant women , is folic acid ( vitamin B9 ) , which gives the table salt a yellow color . <unk> acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia , which affect young mothers , especially in developing countries . 
 A lack of fluorine in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental caries . Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay , especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water . The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out . In France , 35 % of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride . 
 = = = Other kinds = = = 
 Unrefined sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates , traces of algal products , salt @-@ resistant bacteria and sediment particles . The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone , and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic ( i.e. , it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered ) . Algal products contribute a mildly " fishy " or " sea @-@ air " odour , the latter from organobromine compounds . Sediments , the proportion of which varies with the source , give the salt a dull grey appearance . Since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations , sea salt may have a more complex flavor than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food . When salt is added during cooking however , these flavors would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients . The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases . 
 Different natural salts have different <unk> depending on their source , giving each one a unique flavour . Fleur de sel , a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans , has a unique flavour varying with the region from which it is produced . In traditional Korean cuisine , so @-@ called " bamboo salt " is prepared by roasting salt in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends . This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud , and has been claimed to increase the <unk> and <unk> properties of <unk> ( a fermented bean paste ) . 
 Kosher salt , though refined , contains no iodine and has a much larger grain size than most refined salts . This can give it different properties when used in cooking , and can be useful for preparing kosher meat . Some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher , but this is not true for all products labelled as kosher salt . 
 Pickling salt is ultrafine to speed dissolving to make brine . Gourmet salts may be used for specific tastes . 
 = = = Salt in food = = = 
 Salt is present in most foods , but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats , vegetables and fruit , it is present in very small quantities . It is often added to processed foods ( such as canned foods and especially salted foods , pickled foods , and snack foods or other convenience foods ) , where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring . Dairy salt is used in the preparation of butter and cheese products . Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration , salting was one of the main methods of food preservation . Thus , herring contains 67 mg sodium per 100 g , while <unk> , its preserved form , contains 990 mg . Similarly , pork typically contains 63 mg while bacon contains 1 @,@ 480 mg , and potatoes contain 7 mg but potato crisps 800 mg per 100 g . The main sources of salt in the diet , apart from direct use of sodium chloride , are bread and cereal products , meat products and milk and dairy products . 
 In many East Asian cultures , salt is not traditionally used as a condiment . In its place , condiments such as soy sauce , fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures . They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments . 
 = = = Sodium consumption and health = = = 
 Table salt is made up of just under 40 % sodium by weight , so a 6 g serving ( 1 teaspoon ) contains about 2 @,@ 300 mg of sodium . Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body : via its role as an electrolyte , it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly , and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs ( fluid balance ) . Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt . The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day , and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia . The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed . In the United States , 75 % of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods , 11 % from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs . 
 Because consuming too much salt increases risk of cardiovascular diseases , health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt . High salt intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke , total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease . A reduction in sodium intake by 1 @,@ 000 mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent . In adults and children with no acute illness , a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure . A low salt diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension . 
 The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2 @,@ 000 mg of sodium ( which is contained in 5 g of salt ) per day . Guidelines by the United States recommend that people with hypertension , African Americans , and middle @-@ aged and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1 @,@ 500 mg of sodium per day and meet the potassium recommendation of 4 @,@ 700 mg / day with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables . 
 While reduction of salt intake to less than 2 @,@ 300 mg per day is recommended by developed countries , one review recommended that salt intake be no less than 1 @,@ 200 mg ( contained in 3 g ) per day , as it is an essential nutrient required from the diet . Another review indicated that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2 @,@ 300 mg per day may not be beneficial . 
 = = Non @-@ dietary uses = = 
 Only about 6 % of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food . Of the remainder , 12 % is used in water conditioning processes , 8 % goes for de @-@ icing highways and 6 % is used in agriculture . The rest ( 68 % ) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes , and sodium chloride is one of the largest inorganic raw materials used by volume . Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine , which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution . These are used in the manufacture of PVC , plastics , paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds . Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium . For this purpose , a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants . It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine , where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the <unk> products . As an <unk> , salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber , and another use is in the firing of pottery , when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material , forming a strong glaze . 
 When drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel , salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable " wall " to prevent the hole collapsing . There are many other processes in which salt is involved . These include its use as a mordant in textile dying , to regenerate resins in water softening , for the tanning of hides , the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and vegetables . 
 = = Production = = 
 Food grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries ( 7 % in Europe ) , although worldwide , food uses account for 17 @.@ 5 % of total production . 
 In 2013 , total world production of salt was 264 million tonnes , the top five producers being China ( 71 million ) , the United States ( 40 million ) , India ( 18 million ) , Germany ( 12 million ) and Canada ( 11 million ) . 
 The manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries . A major source of salt is seawater , which has a salinity of approximately 3 @.@ 5 % . This means that there are about 35 grams ( 1 @.@ 2 oz ) of dissolved salts , predominantly sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions , per kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lbs ) of water . The world 's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt , and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated . The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates . Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up . Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours , as some species of algae and other micro @-@ organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity . 
 Elsewhere , salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes . These are either mined directly , producing rock salt , or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit . In either case , the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine . Traditionally , this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation . More recently , the process is performed in pans under vacuum . The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics . This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities ( largely magnesium and calcium salts ) . Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals , which are kiln @-@ dried . Some salt is produced using the <unk> process , which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals , and produces a grainy @-@ type flake . The <unk> , an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco , obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree ( <unk> vitis @-@ <unk> ) and other trees . 
 One of the largest salt mining operations in the world is at the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan . The mine has nineteen storeys , eleven of which are underground , and 400 km ( 250 mi ) of passages . The salt is dug out by the room and pillar method , where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels . Extraction of Himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385 @,@ 000 tons per annum . 
 = = Usage in religion = = 
 Salt has long held an important place in religion and culture . At the time of Brahmanic sacrifices , in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks at the time of the new moon , salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises . The ancient Egyptians , Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith . In Aztec mythology , <unk> was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water . 
 Salt is considered to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house @-@ <unk> and weddings . In Jainism , devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person 's cremated remains before the ashes are buried . Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition , and when returning home from a funeral , a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house . In Shinto , salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people ( <unk> , specifically <unk> ) , and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two @-@ fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons . 
 In the Hebrew Bible , there are thirty @-@ five verses which mention salt . One of these is the story of Lot 's wife , who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah ( Genesis 19 : 26 ) as they were destroyed . When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem , he is said to have " sown salt on it , " probably as a curse on anyone who would re @-@ inhabit it ( Judges 9 : 45 ) . The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment . " Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ? " ( Job 6 : 6 ) . In the New Testament , six verses mention salt . In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus referred to his followers as the " salt of the earth " . The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to " let your conversation be always full of grace , seasoned with salt " ( Colossians 4 : 6 ) . Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass . Salt is used in the third item ( which includes an Exorcism ) of the Celtic Consecration ( cf . <unk> Rite ) that is employed in the consecration of a church . Salt may be added to the water " where it is customary " in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water . 
 In Judaism , it is recommended to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is <unk> when doing Kiddush for Shabbat . It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush . To preserve the covenant between their people and God , Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt . In Wicca , salt is symbolic of the element Earth . It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies . A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar , and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and ceremonies .

 = SMS Heimdall = 
 SMS Heimdall was the fourth vessel of the six @-@ member Siegfried class of coastal defense ships ( Küstenpanzerschiffe ) built for the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Siegfried , Beowulf , Frithjof , Hildebrand , and Hagen . Heimdall was built by the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven shipyard between 1891 and 1894 , and was armed with a main battery of three 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1900 – 1902 . She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , but saw no action . Heimdall was demobilized in 1915 and used as a barracks ship thereafter . She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Heimdall was 79 meters ( 259 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 @.@ 9 m ( 49 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 741 long tons ( 3 @,@ 801 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 14 @.@ 6 kn ( 27 @.@ 0 km / h ; 16 @.@ 8 mph ) and a range of approximately 1 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 760 km ; 1 @,@ 710 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Heimdall had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L / 35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets . Two were placed side by side forward , and the third was located aft of the main superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition . The ship was also equipped with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns in single mounts . Heimdall also carried four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all in swivel mounts on the deck . One was at the bow , another at the stern , and two amidships . The ship was protected by an armored belt that was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) amidships , and an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The conning tower had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides . Heimdall 's armor consisted of new Krupp steel , a more effective type of armor than the compound steel the other members of the class received . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Heimdall was laid down in 1891 at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven . She was launched on 27 July 1892 , and completed on 7 April 1894 . In 1897 , Heimdall participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the IV Division , along with Frithjof and Hagen . Her other three sisters were assigned to the III Division . Heimdall participated in the 1900 summer maneuvers , where she and Siegfried , Hildebrand , and Ägir simulated the hostile fleet . She served on active duty with the fleet until 1901 , when she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive reconstruction . The ship was lengthened to 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 @.@ 6 ft ) , which increased displacement to 4 @,@ 436 t ( 4 @,@ 366 long tons ; 4 @,@ 890 short tons ) . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers , and a second funnel was added . Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) tubes . Work was completed by 1902 . 
 After emerging from her modernization , she returned to service with the fleet , assigned to the II Squadron , alongside Hildebrand , Hagen , and Beowulf . She remained in the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense , along with her sister ships . On 31 August 1915 , the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized , and Heimdall 's crew was transferred to other warships . She was then used as a barracks ship in for U @-@ boat crews , along with crews for the coastal defense flotillas stationed on the Ems river . On 17 June 1919 , she was stricken from the naval register . The navy planned to convert Heimdall into a salvage ship , but the plan fell through and she was instead sold and broken up for scrap in 1921 in Rönnebeck . 
 = Thomas Bryan Martin = 
 Thomas Bryan Martin ( 1731 – 1798 ) was an 18th @-@ century English American land agent , justice , legislator , and planter in the colony ( and later U.S. state ) of Virginia and in present @-@ day West Virginia . Martin was the land agent of the Northern Neck Proprietary for his uncle Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( 1693 – 1781 ) and served two terms in the House of Burgesses . 
 Martin was born in Kent in 1731 , and was the grandson of Thomas Fairfax , 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( 1657 – 1710 ) through his mother , Frances Fairfax Martin . Raised in humble surroundings in England , Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle , Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( known as Lord Fairfax ) , in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary , which encompassed up to 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 km2 ) . Martin resided with his uncle on their frontier Greenway Court estate in present @-@ day Clarke County , Virginia . He earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature and loyalty , and through Martin 's growing influence Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary 's base of operations to Greenway Court in 1762 and made Martin steward and land agent of the proprietary . 
 Martin took an active role in political and civil affairs within the proprietary 's domain . He served as a vestryman for the Anglican Frederick Parish , and upon the creation of Hampshire County in 1754 , he presided as the county 's first justice and was further appointed the County Lieutenant . He later represented Hampshire County in the House of Burgesses from 1756 to 1758 and serving with George Washington , represented Fredrick County from 1758 until 1761 . Martin was appointed a trustee of the frontier towns of Winchester , Stephensburg ( present @-@ day Stephens City ) , and Bath ( present @-@ day Berkeley Springs ) . He was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia . Though not in the best of health , Martin was relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources in response to Native American attacks . Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War , Martin refused reappointment by Governor Patrick Henry as a justice of the Frederick County Commission of Peace . Afterward , Martin retreated from civil service entirely , and retired to Greenway Court . 
 He maintained a low profile during the war , and his uncle Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies . Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781 , Martin 's brother Reverend Denny Martin Fairfax inherited the Northern Neck Proprietary , and Martin was given the Greenway Court estate . He took his uncle 's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress and died unmarried in 1798 . Martin bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) to his housekeeper Betsy Powers . Martin 's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly maintain the proprietary and conveyed the remaining lands in 1797 , thus terminating the Fairfax and Martin families ' interests in the proprietary before it was formally dissolved in 1806 . The city of Martinsburg , West Virginia , was named for Martin by his friend Adam Stephen . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Thomas Bryan Martin was born in Kent , England , in 1731 and was the son of Denny Martin ( 1695 – 1762 ) of Salts Manor and his wife Frances Fairfax Martin ( 1703 – 1791 ) . His father and mother married in Loose , Kent . Martin 's mother was the daughter of Thomas Fairfax , 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( 1657 – 1710 ) and his wife Catherine Colepeper Fairfax , and thus a sister of Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( 1693 – 1781 ) and Robert Fairfax , 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( 1707 – 1793 ) . His grandmother Catherine Colepeper Fairfax was the daughter of Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper and his wife Margaretta van Hesse , who was from a Dutch noble family . Martin was named in honor of his uncle Thomas . He was baptized into the Anglican faith as " Thomas Brian " in Loose on April 11 , 1731 . Martin and his siblings were raised amid humble surroundings in England . He had seven siblings , including four brothers and three sisters : 
 Edward Martin ( 1723 – 1775 ) 
 John Martin ( 1724 – 1746 ) 
 Reverend Denny Martin ( later Fairfax , 1725 – 1800 ) 
 Frances Martin ( 1727 – 1813 )

 = = Northern Neck Proprietary administration = = 
 Martin 's uncle Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ( known as Lord Fairfax ) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant , which he had inherited from Martin 's great @-@ grandfather Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719 . The proprietary constituted up to 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 km2 ) of Virginia 's Northern Neck and a vast area spanning west to the North Branch Potomac River headwaters . The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649 , and again in 1688 by official patent . One of these seven supporters , Lord Colepeper , acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681 , and his grandson , Lord Fairfax , inherited the land grant upon his death . Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin William Fairfax ( 1691 – 1757 ) to replace Robert Carter I as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary , a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757 . In 1750 , Martin 's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation Greenway Court estate near present @-@ day White Post in Clarke County with the intention of administering the proprietary himself . Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747 , then known as " the Quarter " . With his cousin William Fairfax acting as land agent , Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would be up to the task . Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert , then his brother @-@ in @-@ law Denny Martin , and in 1751 , he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty @-@ year @-@ old nephew and Denny Martin 's son , Thomas Bryan Martin . 
 Lord Fairfax sent for Martin , who arrived in Virginia from England aboard the Hatley on May 24 , 1751 , accompanied by William Fairfax , who had been seeking an appointment to a position in England . Martin and Fairfax arrived in Williamsburg , where they dined with Fairfax 's fellow Virginia Governor 's Council member John Blair , Sr. , and visited the Governor 's Palace and the Capitol before beginning their journey toward the Northern Neck on May 31 . Following his arrival at the Northern Neck Proprietary , Martin settled at Greenway Court with his uncle that autumn . Due to his humble upbringing , Martin quickly adapted to frontier life at Greenway Court . He soon earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature , his loyalty , and his good eyesight , which greatly assisted his myopic uncle . On May 21 , 1752 , shortly after Martin had come of age on his twenty @-@ first birthday , Lord Fairfax granted Greenway Court to his nephew , along with 8 @,@ 840 acres ( 35 @.@ 8 km2 ) of limestone lands on the west bank of the Shenandoah River across from Leeds Manor , which were " to be known and called by the name of the Manor of Greenway Court " and subject to an annual quit @-@ rent fee of " a good buck and doe " due on the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel . Greenway Court had taken its name from the Culpeper family 's manor in Kent . 
 Desiring a larger role for himself in the proprietary 's administration , Martin sought to influence his uncle into reorganizing the management of the proprietary . At Martin 's suggestion , Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary 's base of operations 56 miles ( 90 km ) northwest from Belvoir to an expressly built land office depository and archive at Greenway Court in 1762 . Prior to this move , a small land office had been in operation at Greenway Court . Following William Fairfax 's death in 1757 , his son George William Fairfax ( 1729 – 1787 ) had succeeded him as steward and land agent of the proprietary . Martin succeeded Fairfax as the steward and land agent of the proprietary in 1762 . Fairfax 's replacement by Martin , the transfer of the land office and Martin 's increased influence over Lord Fairfax caused bitter feelings from George William Fairfax , as evidenced by his letters during this period . Fairfax and his wife Sally Cary Fairfax returned to England in 1773 prior to the American Revolutionary War and did not return afterward . 
 While residing at Greenway Court , Martin would have preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate , as their living situation there was originally supposed to have been only temporary until the construction of a grander estate . In 1767 , Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court " remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain , ... we are building castles , tho ' not on earth where one is greatly wanted , but castles in the air . " Martin 's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among " strange , brutish people ... past all conception " . For the next thirty years , until Lord Fairfax 's death in 1781 , Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his " self @-@ exiled " uncle . While established at Greenway Court , Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits . In 1768 , Martin described tobacco as the crop " which is our all " . Like many other planters and farmers in the Shenandoah Valley , Martin had transitioned to the farming of wheat by 1792 , at which time he wrote to his brother in England , " Are you all starving that you give such prices for our flour ; farming is now my object . " 
 = = Political and civic affairs = = 
 In addition to his management of the proprietary , Martin began taking an active role in political and civil affairs within his uncle 's domain . Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752 , the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish vestrymen before June 15 of that year . Martin was elected as a vestryman , alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and Gabriel Jones . Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish . 
 In 1754 , upon the creation of Hampshire County , Martin presided as the inaugural justice of the county 's court . Under the act establishing the county , the first county court was to have been held in June 1754 ; however , the first court was not held until December 1757 . The first court to be held was , in addition to Martin , composed of justices James Simpson , William Miller , Solomon Hedges , and Nathaniel Kuykendall with Gabriel Jones serving as the Clerk of Court . In 1755 , Martin was further appointed as the County Lieutenant of Hampshire County . Martin was then elected alongside Thomas Walker to the House of Burgesses representing Hampshire County from 1768 to 1758 . In 1758 , Martin and George Washington challenged the incumbents and ran for election to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses against Hugh West and Thomas Swearingen . Martin and Washington received considerable support from Lord Fairfax , and the leading Anglican cleric in Frederick County , William Meldrum . Washington received the most votes with 310 , followed by Martin with 240 votes , 199 votes for West , and 45 votes for Swearingen . Martin and Washington served alongside one another representing Frederick County until 1761 . Martin chose not to run for reelection and retired from legislative politics in 1761 . 
 In September 1758 , the Virginia General Assembly appointed Martin as one of the trustees of Winchester . Martin was further appointed as a trustee of the town of Stephensburg ( present @-@ day Stephens City ) . His uncle Lord Fairfax , John Hite , Gabriel Jones , Robert Rutherford , Lewis Stephens , and James Wood were also appointed trustees of the towns alongside Martin . When the town of Bath ( present @-@ day Berkeley Springs ) received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly in October 1776 , Martin was appointed as a trustee alongside Bryan Fairfax , Philip Pendleton , Robert Rutherford , Samuel Washington , Warner Washington , Alexander White , and others . 
 Martin was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia . While Martin was not in the best of health , he could be relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources to act promptly during an emergency , especially in response to attacks by Native Americans . 
 By the outbreak of the American Revolution , Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County . Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry , along with William Booth and Warner Washington , but all three men declined to serve another term . Martin did not swear in to the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime , initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort . The committee had also been actively arresting Loyalists , which may have influenced Martin 's decision to turn down his reappointment . Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely , and afterward retired to Greenway Court . Prior to his death , Martin became an active Freemason . 
 = = American Revolution and Lord Fairfax 's death = = 
 As a Loyalist , Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . By 1778 , the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit @-@ rents , but in recognition of Lord Fairfax 's loyalty , the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception . Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly , and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies , he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen . Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781 , his will was recorded on March 5 , 1782 , and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties , including the Northern Neck Proprietary , to Martin 's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin , who then assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax . Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the Parliament of Great Britain for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron . Martin was appointed by his uncle , along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog , as an executor of his will and estate . Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) . Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and " all the stock of cattle , sheep , hogs , implements of husbandry , household goods and furniture " there . Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax 's slaves . Martin 's uncle and Lord Fairfax 's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament , and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron . 
 On account of his residency in England , Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary . Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them . The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax , which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757 . In order to absolve himself of these back claims , Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones , and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax , 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21 , 1784 . 
 Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England , he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction ; thus , he and his British relatives were considered " alien enemies " and his landholdings were confiscated under escheat laws . In 1785 , the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records , books , and documents pertaining to the proprietary 's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar 's Office in Richmond . Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted , and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land . Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value , which Martin noted in a 1790 letter . The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier , which Martin commented : " The emigration of inhabitants is ... astonishing . " 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781 , Martin took his uncle 's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress , and fathered a daughter by her . Mrs. Crawford remained Martin 's mistress for several years until her death . Their daughter married British captain Francis <unk> ; however , she died without issue soon after their marriage , and Martin gave <unk> 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) of Greenway Court and a number of slaves . Following the death of his daughter , Martin employed housekeeper Betsy Powers at Greenway Court . Martin died unmarried in 1798 , and his will dated July 24 , 1794 , was proved on October 1 , 1798 . In it , he bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) to his housekeeper Betsy Powers . Powers also inherited " all houses thereon , household goods ( except plate and watch ) , one half of stock of horses , cattle , sheep and hogs and choice of ten slaves " . Martin 's living sisters Frances , Sybilla , and Anna Susanna Martin received " all moneys , and remainder of personal property " not bequeathed to Powers . Each of the executors of Martin 's will received ten guineas . Martin bequeathed the remainder of his property and the 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) of Greenway Court , should Powers have predeceased him , to his will executors Gabriel Jones , Robert Mackey , and John Sherman Woodcock to divide into parcels and sell , the profits from which were to be given to Martin 's sisters . Powers also received a chariot , harness , and 160 acres ( 0 @.@ 65 km2 ) in Stafford County near Falmouth . Following Martin 's death , Powers married W. <unk> . 
 Due to his advanced age and his inability to relocate to America , Martin 's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30 , 1797 , to James Markham Marshall " all and every of those divers tracts , pieces and parcels of land , being part and parcel of the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va . , with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be " . This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families ' interest in the proprietary . In 1799 , the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax 's remaining landholdings . The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its legal owner . 
 The legality of Virginia 's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands continued to be contested in state and federal courts long after Denny Martin Fairfax 's death in 1800 . The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state 's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary 's lands , arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary . In 1813 , the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court 's decision in Fairfax 's Devisee v. Hunter 's Lessee , 11 U.S. 603 , and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute , and remanded the case back to the state supreme court . The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts . The state supreme court 's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court 's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee , 14 U.S. 304 . The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court 's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law . Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Martin Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands .

 John F. " Johnny " Maulbetsch ( June 20 , 1890 – September 14 , 1950 ) was an All @-@ American football halfback at Adrian College in 1911 and for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1914 to 1916 . He is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame . 
 After playing with an independent football team in Ann Arbor and at Adrian College , Maulbetsch became one of the most famous American football players in 1914 while playing for the University of Michigan . Maulbetsch became known as the " Human Bullet " because of his unusual low , line @-@ plunging style of play , and was also known as the " Featherweight Fullback " because of his light weight and small size . After his performance against Harvard in 1914 , in which some reports indicated he gained more than 300 yards , eastern writers , including Damon <unk> , wrote articles touting Maulbetsch . Maulbetsch was also selected by Walter Camp to his All @-@ American team . 
 In 1915 , Maulbetsch underwent surgery for appendicitis and did not perform to the same level as he had in 1914 . He made a comeback as a senior in 1916 and was again one of the leading players in college football . 
 Between 1917 and 1920 , Maulbetsch was the head football coach at Phillips University . With Maulbetsch 's name recognition , he was able to recruit big name talent to Phillips , including future Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Owen , and future United States Olympic Committee President Doug Roby . Maulbetsch quickly turned Phillips into one of the top programs in the southwest , as his teams beat Oklahoma and Texas and lost only one game in the 1918 and 1919 seasons . Maulbetsch was later the football coach at Oklahoma A & M ( later known as Oklahoma State ) and Marshall College in the 1920s . He has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame , and the University of Michigan awards the John F. Maulbetsch Award each year to a freshman football player based on desire , character , and capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the football field .

 Maulbetsch was born and grew up in Ann Arbor , Michigan . He attended Ann Arbor High School where he led the football team to consecutive state championships in 1908 and 1909 . One account of the 1908 playoffs noted : " Ann Arbor 's smashing play in the first half was wholly due to Maulbetsch , Ann Arbor 's fullback , and his terrific line bucking . He clearly outshone his team mates . " 
 After graduating from high school , Maulbetsch joined the Ann Arbor Independents , a football team made up of Michigan " varsity <unk> " and " <unk> . " Maulbetsch was once reportedly called upon to drive across the goal line for the Independents in a game in which a large crowd , including a farmer with his plow @-@ horse , gathered in the end zone . " Head down and legs working like piston rods , Maulbetsch plowed ahead until head struck the plow horse amidships . Down went the horse Mauly on top of him . "

 Maulbetsch started his college football career at age 21 , leading Adrian College to an 8 – 0 record in 1911 , including a 15 – 0 win over the University of Michigan freshman team . Maulbetsch 's performance drew the attention of Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost . After watching Maulbetsch dominate Michigan 's freshman team , Yost concluded : " If I could get that kid into Michigan and keep him up in his studies I ’ d make an All @-@ American place for him his first year . " Yost persuaded Maulbetsch to transfer , and he played with " the scrubs " in 1912 . Yost told the press at the time he had " another ( Willie ) Heston " in Maulbetsch . 
 = = = 1914 season = = = 
 Maulbetsch did not play for the varsity team until the fall of 1914 when he was 24 years old . Before the season began , Maulbetsch was " touted as one of the fastest halfbacks who ever donned <unk> . He weighs 155 pounds , is built low , has a powerful pair of shoulders and his dashes are characterized by lightning speed . " Another pre @-@ season account said he was " a wonder as a line plunger and a wizard in the open field . " From the outset , considerable attention was paid to his unusual running style . Observers noted " the peculiar manner in which he runs . . . . He has a corkscrew style of dashing , and even when tackled squarely has such a sturdy pair of legs that his assailant is usually carried back several yards . " 
 Michigan opened the season with a 58 – 0 win over DePauw , followed by a 69 – 0 victory over Case Institute of Technology . Maulbetsch was the offensive star against Case , as he twice " carried several would @-@ be tackles across the goal . " Playing Vanderbilt the following week , Maulbetsch had runs of 25 and 35 yards , scored two touchdowns , " was worked overtime and probably advanced the pigskin more than any two other players . " After starting the season 5 – 0 , Michigan lost three of four games against top eastern schools : Syracuse , Harvard , Penn , and Cornell .

 Maulbetsch 's breakthrough came on October 31 , 1914 , in front of 30 @,@ 000 fans at Harvard . The game was one of the most anticipated matches of the year . A special train brought Michigan fans to Cambridge , Massachusetts , and hundreds of Michigan alumni from the East were on hand as " reinforcements . " Though Harvard prevailed , 7 – 0 , Maulbetsch was the big story in papers across the country . Writers from Ring Lardner to Damon Runyon told the story of Maulbetsch 's performance . Lardner said : " If anyone tells you the East plays the best brand of football , Maulbetsch shot that theory full of holes . " According to Runyon , the Wolverines used " the mighty Maulbetsch as their battering ram " , and he " gained enough ground against Harvard to bury a German army corps . " Football writer Frank G. Menke said : " No westerner ever created half the stir in the east as did this Michigander . . . His peculiar , baffling style of attack , backed by phenomenal strength almost always earned for him gains of 5 to 20 yards every time he was called upon to carry the ball . " Another writer noted Maulbetsch 's skill as a " line breaker " as he " carried the ball repeatedly through the Harvard line and into the secondary defense with bullet @-@ like rushes that upset tackler after tackler . " Maulbetsch was responsible for four @-@ fifths of Michigan 's ground gains , and on several occasions his dives reportedly " had so much power that he dove right through a double line of crimson players and went sprawling on the ground twelve to twenty feet clear of the double line . " 
 While every report indicates that Maulbetsch had a big day , the accounts vary dramatically as to exactly how many yards he gained . Frank Menke reported after the game that Maulbetsch gained 300 yards . A 1938 newspaper account said he " gained 350 yards from scrimmage . " Yet , his 1951 obituary indicated he gained 133 yards in 30 attempts . 
 Despite Maulbetsch 's efforts , Michigan was never able to punch the ball across the goal line . Many blamed Michigan 's quarterback who switched to another back every time after Maulbetsch " took the ball to the shadow of the Crimson goal posts . " In answer to the question why Michigan was unable to score , Frank Menke said : " Ask the fellow who quarterbacked for Michigan that day . His actions were too mystifying for the spectators to figure out . " 
 When Harvard reneged on an agreement to play a game in Ann Arbor in 1915 , sports writers concluded it was to avoid facing Maulbetsch again . Said one reporter : " When <unk> <unk> [ sic ] saw what Maulbetsch did in the first clash , it decided it cared to see no more of him . He was too rough . " 
 = = = " Human Bullet " = = = 
 Much of the attention on Maulbetsch focused on his diminutive size and unique running style . At 5 ft 7 in ( 1 @.@ 70 m ) , and 155 lb ( 70 kg ) , Maulbetsch was a small back , even by the standards of his day . And his running style saw him bend his torso and propel himself like a projectile into the opposing line . Indeed , he won several nicknames based on his size , running style , and fighting spirit , including the " Human Bullet , " " Mauly " , the " Human Shrapnel " , the " Featherweight Fullback " , the " Michigan Cannon Ball , " and the " German bullet . " Comparisons of Maulbetsch to military armaments were common . In addition to the " bullet " , " shrapnel " , and " cannonball " nicknames , the Syracuse Herald observed : " Standing up in front of a Krupp gun has its dangers , but it is not to be compared with the dangers of standing in front of Maulbetsch when he is going full speed ahead . " 
 Maulbetsch 's style was described as " line @-@ plunging . " A New York newspaper noted : " When the ball is snapped to him he almost doubles himself up , and , with his head aimed at the knees of the opposing line , he dives head first . Those who have seen Maulbetsch in action marvel at the great momentum he can get up in two or three steps . " Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said : " Mauly is a little fellow , being built close to the ground . They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops – that he hits so low that it 's well nigh impossible to stop him . " An Iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible " for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with the force that Maulbetsch does and come out of the game without a broken neck . " 
 Maulbetsch was said to run " so low that he could dash under an ordinary table without losing his feet . " At a coaching conference in the 1920s , a coach doubted the table @-@ ducking story and challenged Maulbetsch . The doubter later recalled : " I began ribbing him about this table @-@ ducking stuff and finally offered to bet him he couldn ’ t do it . Well , we got a table up in a room , Johnny tucked a water pitcher under his arm and backed against the wall . Darned if he didn ’ t do it , the only thing , that water pitcher broke in a million pieces . " Asked about the incident , Maulbetsch said it was true , except one part . Maulbetsch insisted there wasn ’ t a nick on the pitcher .

 After the loss to Harvard in 1914 , Michigan rebounded with a 34 – 3 win over Penn . Walter Eckersall reported that the Wolverines were " led by the redoubtable Johnny Maulbetsch . " Despite being " a marked man " by the Penn defense , he was not thrown for a loss in the entire game , and he scored three touchdowns . Before Michigan lost to Cornell in the final game of the season , a scandal arose when it was revealed that the owner of an Ann Arbor pool room , Joe Reinger , had written a letter intimating that he could buy Maulbetsch and Michigan 's quarterback to throw the Cornell game , and win US $ 50 @,@ 000 from students willing to bet on Michigan . The letter was turned in to the Michigan athletic officials , and Reinger went to the athletic office " to try to hush the matter up . " Reinger became abusive and was thrown out of the office by Coach Yost . The incident caused " the biggest stir of the season on the campus , " as students demolished Reinger 's pool room , and police had to guard Reinger 's residence against threatening demonstrations that continued to " a late hour . " Although Michigan did lose to Cornell , Maulbetsch was said to be " practically the only successful ground gainer for Michigan . " Over the course of the 1914 season , Maulbetsch was said to have scored about half of Michigan 's 252 points . A Wisconsin newspaper noted that , " when it comes time to write a resume of the 1914 football season " , Maulbetsch 's play " will live in the minds of men . . . for years to come . " As a reward for his efforts , Maulbetsch was named a first @-@ team All @-@ American at the end of the 1914 season .

 As public attention focused on Maulbetsch as " the greatest line @-@ plunger of a decade , " the press could not get enough of Maulbetsch , even interviewing his family . His sister revealed that Maulbetsch had a fondness for home cooking and received permission from the team trainer to eat at his family 's Ann Arbor home . " Now , Johnny 's sister explains that each day his mother baked two pies for the athlete 's supper , and that in addition he had everything else his appetite craved , including coffee . " Confronted by reporters about the revelation , Maulbetsch replied : " The story was slightly exaggerated . I rarely ate more than one and one half pies for dinner . " Joking references to Maulbetsch 's diet continued when it was reported in 1915 that he was suffering from " acute indigestion . " One reporter quipped , " Those much advertised pies of his maw 's evidently aren ’ t as great training dope as they were cracked up to be . " It turned out that the indigestion was appendicitis , and Maulbetsch was hospitalized at St. Joseph 's Sanitarium in Ann Arbor in April 1915 , where he underwent an operation .

 As the 1915 season was set to get underway , Coach Yost reported , " Johnny told me he was feeling fine when I saw him recently , although he doesn ’ t weigh as much as he used to . " Despite Yost 's hopes , Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year 's performance in 1915 . He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery , and it was noted that " a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch 's weight . " In the opening game against Lawrence , Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns , but he was " woefully weak on interference . " Playing against Mount Union , Maulbetsch made several big gains , including a 50 @-@ yard touchdown run in the third quarter . His difficulties returned in the season 's third game against Marietta , as " Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass , all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line . " 
 After The Michigan Daily criticized his performance following the Marietta game , Maulbetsch " threatened to desert the Michigan squad and give up football for good . " It reportedly took Yost several hours to coax Maulbetsch to report for practice again , and in the next game against Case , Maulbetsch did not play until the third quarter . In the season 's first big game , Michigan was soundly beaten by Michigan Agricultural College , 24 – 0 , and most of Maulbetsch 's runs " didn ’ t even get as far as his own line . " In the final four games of the season , matters got worse for Michigan and Maulbetsch , as the team went 0 – 3 – 1 , scoring only 14 points in four games . 
 In Maulbetsch 's defense , some writers noted the weakness of the Michigan line , often allowing rushers into the backfield before Maulbetsch even had the ball . But some of those same observers noted that " Mauly " was not carrying the ball " at his usual pace . " Sports writer Frank Menke described Maulbetsch 's 1915 performance this way : " [ The ] Wolverine halfback skidded from the heights of greatness to the level of mediocre . . . . The lines that he had crumpled like eggshells a year before stood up under his charges , often dumping him back for losses . The once ' unstoppable ' Maulbetsch not only was stopped but forced to retract . " Despite the subpar performance in 1915 , Michigan 's varsity letter @-@ winners elected him captain of the team for 1916 . 
 = = = 1916 comeback = = = 
 Maulbetsch made a strong comeback in 1916 . Instead of spending the summer recovering from appendicitis , he spent the summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between Chicago and St. Joseph , Michigan . Maulbetsch spent his afternoons swimming and running sprints up and down the beach . On one trip , a giant coal passer claimed to be the strongest man in the world , and Maulbetsch agreed to a wrestling match on the boat . " The coal passer rushed the stripling , who ducked , caught his opponent about the waist and crushed him to the deck . When the giant woke , he wanted to know if the boat hit a rock . " As the season started , The New York Times wrote : " Michigan 's come @-@ back football team , headed by Bullet Maulbetsch , is going to be an eleven to be reckoned with on the gridiron this Fall . " Maulbetsch returned to his prior form , and one of the writers who had criticized him in 1915 said " the great Michigander using the same method of attack , has repeatedly broken in fragments this year the lines that he couldn ’ t dent in 1915 . " 
 = = Professional football = = 
 After the 1916 football season ended , Maulbetsch considered his options . There was a report that he had been engaged as a high school football coach ( and math instructor ) in Toledo , Ohio . Even more prevalent were reports that he had signed to play for a professional football team . Professional football was still in its infancy in 1917 , and landing a well @-@ known star would have been a boost to any of the budding franchises . In January 1917 newspapers reported that Maulbetsch had signed a contract to play professional football for Detroit Tigers owner , Frank Navin . Navin was supporting efforts to organize a professional football league in all the important Midwestern cities , including a Detroit franchise to play at Navin Field . As late as November 1917 , newspapers reported Maulbetsch had played professional football after graduating and was offered " a handsome fee " to play with the Akron <unk> in November 1917 . Although professional football records prior to 1920 are scarce , it appears unlikely that Maulbetsch played professional football , as press accounts show he was working as a college football coach starting in 1917 .

 = = = Building Phillips University into a football power ( 1917 – 1920 ) = = = 
 In June 1917 , Maulbetsch announced that he had accepted a position as the football coach ( and professor of chemistry ) at Phillips University in Enid , Oklahoma . Phillips was a small , private school without a well @-@ known athletic program . In the fall , Enid residents were " leaving their work every afternoon to watch [ Maulbetsch ] and his husky young Oklahoma youths work out on campus . " Within a year , Maulbetsch turned Phillips into one of the strongest teams in the southwest . 
 Maulbetsch landed his first big recruit before leaving Ann Arbor . While playing at Michigan , Maulbetsch became friends with Doug Roby , a football player at the Michigan Military Academy , and one of the state 's top recruits . Roby followed Maulbetsch to Phillips and later went on to become a member of the International Olympic Committee in the 1950s and 1960s and president of the United States Olympic Committee from 1965 to 1968 . Maulbetsch 's next find was future Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Owen , who later spent 23 years with the New York Giants . Maulbetsch saw Owen watching football practice from under a tree and told him : " A fellow your size ought to be out for the squad . " Owen showed up the next day and , when Maulbetsch used him to illustrate blocking fundamentals , Owen threw a block into Maulbetsch that threw him five yards through the air . Maulbetsch was satisfied , and Owen had a spot on the team . Because Phillips was not part of a conference , it was not subject to any eligibility limitations , an advantage Maulbetsch was accused of exploiting . A third key player recruited by Maulbetsch was an Native American halfback named Levi , and dubbed " Big Chief " by Phillips fans . 
 Having recruited top talent to Enid , Maulbetsch 's teams lost only one game in 1918 and 1919 , including a 10 – 0 – 1 record in 1919 . In 1917 and 1918 , Phillips came into the limelight when they beat the Oklahoma Sooners and the Henry Kendricks College team that had swept the west without allowing another team to score . Maulbetsch arranged a game against the Texas Longhorns in 1919 , the first meeting between the schools . When the game was announced The San Antonio Light reported : " Phillips University has one of the strongest teams in the Southwest . The only team to beat them in the past two years is Oklahoma and last year Phillips beat the Sooners 13 – 7 . " The report credited Maulbetsch for securing success at an institution little known in athletics before he arrived . The University of Texas had not lost a game since 1917 when the Phillips " Haymakers " arrived in Austin , Texas on October 11 , 1919 . Maulbetsch 's team shocked the Longhorns , holding them scoreless and winning the contest , 10 – 0 . One Texas newspaper reported that Phillips had " whitewashed the Longhorns in their own corral . " 
 Others in Texas concluded that Phillips ’ success was the result of lax or non @-@ existent eligibility policies . The lack of eligibility rules almost certainly did play a part in Phillips ’ success . When Phillips joined the Southwest Conference in 1920 , it became bound by the conference 's eligibility rules , and the team was outscored 97 – 0 in conference play against Texas A & M ( 47 – 0 ) , Texas ( 27 – 0 ) , Arkansas ( 20 – 0 ) , and Texas Christian ( 3 – 0 ) . The Galveston Daily News noted that Maulbetsch 's 1920 team could not " compare with the strong team " he surprised Texas with in 1919 . At the end of the 1920 season , Phillips withdrew from the Southwest Conference , and Maulbetsch accepted a new position at Oklahoma A & M. 
 = = = Head coach at Oklahoma A & M ( 1921 – 1928 ) = = = 
 In January 1921 , Maulbetsch was hired as the head coach at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College ( now Oklahoma State ) in Stillwater , Oklahoma . He served as the coach at Oklahoma A & M from 1921 to 1928 , where his teams posted a 28 – 37 – 6 ( .437 ) record . In 1924 , his team went 6 – 1 – 2 and shut out Oklahoma ( 6 – 0 ) , Arkansas ( 20 – 0 ) and Kansas ( 3 – 0 ) . Maulbetsch 's Aggies also shut out Phillips that year , 13 – 0 . After the season , attempts were made to lure him to Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , but Maulbetsch said he was satisfied with his position in Stillwater . 
 Maulbetsch arranged a game in Ann Arbor against his alma mater to start the 1926 season . Michigan beat the Aggies , 42 – 3 . Despite an overall record of 3 – 4 – 1 , Oklahoma A & M won its first conference football championship by going 3 – 0 – 1 in games against Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents . Maulbetsch also drew attention in 1926 for his disciplinary methods . When the team lost two games due to fumbles , he ordered eight of his backfield players to carry footballs with them to classes throughout the week and instructed other team members to try knocking the balls from under their arms . The penalty for losing a ball was " a hard run around the stadium . " He also ordered one of his ends to wear boxing gloves after he poked an opposing player in the eye . 
 The Aggies won only one game against seven defeats in 1928 . In late November , the day after a 46 – 0 loss to Oklahoma , newspapers reported that " reliable sources " had said Maulbetsch intended to resign . Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor , saying : " I have not resigned . I am aware that a faction here is trying to get me out , but I do not intend to throw up the sponge . " In December , pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew , and one Oklahoma newspaper observed : " Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season . They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role . Regardless of his past record , those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever , are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who , by fair means or foul , will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game . " Ultimately , Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A & M 's coach in football , baseball , and basketball . It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay . 
 = = = Head coach at Marshall College ( 1929 – 1930 ) = = = 
 In July 1929 , Maulbetsch was hired by Marshall College in Huntington , West Virginia to become head coach in charge of football and track . When Marshall 's " Thundering Herd " got off to a 4 – 1 start , Maulbetsch won praise in the West Virginia press , but Marshall finished the season 1 – 2 – 1 in the second half . And in 1930 , the Marshall team went 3 – 5 – 1 , including a 65 – 0 loss to Penn State . Maulbetsch resigned as Marshall 's coach in January 1931 ; his only comment at the time was that he had " other plans . " 
 = = Later years and legacy = = 
 After retiring from football , Maulbetsch bought a drug store in Huntington , West Virginia . During World War II , Maulbetsch took a job building B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers at Ford Motor Company 's famed Willow Run Plant near Ypsilanti , Michigan . From 1946 until his death , he owned an automobile sales company in Adrian , Michigan . Maulbetsch died of cancer in 1950 at his home in Ann Arbor . He was survived by his widow , Ida , a son John Maulbetsch , and a daughter Barbara . Maulbetsch had been married to Ida ( maiden name Ida Elizabeth Cappon ) since May 27 , 1917 . 
 Maulbetsch was inducted posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973 . Since 1956 , the John F. Maulbetsch Award has been given at the University of Michigan after spring practice to a freshman football candidate on the basis of desire , character , capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the football field . The award was established by Frederick C. Matthaei – a former classmate of Maulbetsch who went on to become a Regent of the University . The award has been a good indicator of future success , as past recipients include Jim <unk> ( 1967 ) , Rick Leach ( 1976 ) , Charles Woodson ( 1996 ) , Marlin Jackson ( 2002 ) , and Jake Long ( 2004 ) . Maulbetsch Avenue in Ypsilanti Township is presumably named after Maulbetsch .

 = Order of Canada = 
 The Order of Canada ( French : Ordre du Canada ) is a Canadian national order , admission into which is the second highest honour for merit in the system of orders , decorations , and medals of Canada . It comes second only to membership in the Order of Merit , which is the personal gift of Canada 's monarch . 
 To coincide with the centennial of Canadian Confederation , the three @-@ tiered order was established in 1967 as a fellowship that recognizes the outstanding merit or distinguished service of Canadians who make a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour , as well as the efforts by non @-@ Canadians who have made the world better by their actions . Membership is accorded to those who exemplify the order 's Latin motto , <unk> meliorem patriam , meaning " they desire a better country " , a phrase taken from Hebrews 11 : 16 . The three tiers of the order are Companion , Officer , and Member ; specific individuals may be given extraordinary membership and deserving non @-@ Canadians may receive honorary appointment into each grade . 
 The monarch — at present Elizabeth II — is Sovereign of the order and the serving governor general , currently David Lloyd Johnston , is its Chancellor and Principal Companion and administers the order on behalf of the reigning king or queen . Appointees to the order are recommended by an advisory board and formally inducted by the governor general or the sovereign . As of October 2015 , 6 @,@ 531 people have been appointed to the Order of Canada , including scientists , musicians , politicians , artists , athletes , business people , and film stars , benefactors , and others . Some have resigned or have been removed from the order , while other appointments have been controversial . Appointees are presented with insignia and receive the right to armorial bearings . 
 = = Creation = = 
 The process of founding the Order of Canada began in early 1966 and came to a conclusion on 17 April 1967 , when the organization was instituted by Queen Elizabeth II , on the advice of the Canadian prime minister , Lester B. Pearson , who was assisted with the establishment of the order by John Matheson . The association was officially launched on 1 July 1967 , the 100th anniversary of Canadian Confederation , with Governor General Roland Michener being the first inductee to the order — to the level of Companion — and on 7 July of the same year , 90 more people were appointed , including Vincent Massey , Louis St. Laurent , Hugh MacLennan , David Bauer , Gabrielle Roy , Donald Creighton , Thérèse <unk> , Wilder Penfield , Arthur Lismer , M. J. Coldwell , Edwin Baker , Alex Colville , and Maurice Richard . During a visit to London , United Kingdom , later in 1967 , Michener presented the Queen with her Sovereign 's badge for the Order of Canada , which she first wore during a banquet in Yellowknife in July 1970 . 
 From the Order of Canada grew a Canadian honours system , thereby reducing the use of British honours ( i.e. those administered by the Queen in her British privy council ) . Among the civilian awards of the Canadian honours system , the Order of Canada comes third , after the Cross of Valour and membership in the Order of Merit , which is within the personal gift of Canada 's monarch . By the 1980s , Canada 's provinces began to develop their own distinct honours and decorations . 
 = = Grades = = 
 The Canadian monarch , seen as the fount of honour , is at the apex of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign , followed by the governor general , who serves as the fellowship 's Chancellor . Thereafter follow three grades , which are , in order of precedence : Companion , Officer , and Member , each having <unk> post @-@ nominal letters that members are entitled to use ; each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post . Additionally , any governor general , viceregal consort , former governor general , former viceregal consort , or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion , Officer , or Member . Promotions in grade are possible , though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment , and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may be made by the governor general each year . As of March 2016 , there have been twenty one honorary appointments . 
 There were originally , in effect , only two ranks to the Order of Canada : Companion and the Medal of Service . There was , however , also a third award , the Medal of Courage , meant to recognize acts of gallantry . This latter decoration fell in rank between the other two levels , but was anomalous within the Order of Canada , being a separate award of a different nature rather than a middle grade of the order . Without ever having been awarded , the Medal of Courage was on 1 July 1972 replaced by the autonomous Cross of Valour and , at the same time , the levels of Officer and Member were introduced , with all existing holders of the Medal of Service created as Officers . Lester Pearson 's vision of a three @-@ tiered structure to the order was thus fulfilled . 
 Companions of the Order of Canada ( post @-@ nominals : CC , in French : <unk> de l 'ordre du Canada ) have demonstrated the highest degree of merit to Canada and humanity , on either the national or international scene . Up to 15 Companions are appointed annually , with an imposed limit of 165 living Companions at any given time , not including those appointed as extraordinary Companions or in an honorary capacity . As of October 2015 , there are 143 living Companions , none being honorary . Since 1994 , substantive members are the only regular citizens who are empowered to administer the Canadian Oath of Citizenship . 
 Officers of the Order of Canada ( post @-@ nominals : OC , in French : Officier de l 'ordre du Canada ) have demonstrated an outstanding level of talent and service to Canadians , and up to 64 may be appointed each year , not including those inducted as extraordinary Officers or in an honorary capacity , with no limit to how many may be living at one time . As of October 2015 , there were 1 @,@ 123 living Officers , none being honorary . 
 Members of the Order of Canada ( post @-@ nominals : CM , in French : <unk> de l 'ordre du Canada ) have made an exceptional contribution to Canada or Canadians at a local or regional level , group , field or activity . As many as 136 Members may be appointed annually , not including extraordinary Members and those inducted on an honorary basis , and there is no limit on how many Members may be living at one time . As of October 2015 , there were 2 @,@ 225 living Members , none being honorary . 
 = = Insignia = = 
 Upon admission into the Order of Canada , members are given various insignia of the organization , all designed by Bruce W. Beatty , who " broke new ground in the design of insignia of Orders within The Queen 's realms " and was himself made a member of the order in 1990 ; Beatty attended every investiture ceremony between 1967 and early 2010 . The badge belonging to the Sovereign consists of a jewelled , 18 @-@ carat gold crown of rubies , emeralds , and sapphires , from which is suspended a white , enamelled , hexagonal snowflake design , with six equal leaves and diamonds between each . At the centre is a disc bearing a maple leaf in pavé @-@ laid rubies on a white enamel background , surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring ( annulus ) bearing the motto of the order . The Chancellor wears the badge of a Companion and is , upon installation as governor general , granted a livery collar for wear at Order of Canada investiture ceremonies . 
 The badges for inductees are of a similar design to the sovereign 's badge , though without precious stones , and slight differences for each grade . For Companions , the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the central disk ; for Officers , it is gilt with a gold maple leaf ; and for Members , both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver . All are topped by a St. Edward 's Crown , symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign , and the reverse is plain except for the word CANADA . 
 The ribbon is white and bordered in red stripes , similar to the Canadian national flag ; the chest ribbon is the same for each grade , save for a metallic maple leaf in the centre , the colour of which matches that on the badge of the grade that the wearer was appointed to . For civilian wear , a lapel pin is worn on the jacket , which is designed as a miniature of the medallion . 
 Wear of the insignia is according to guidelines issued by the Chancellery of Honours , which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders — that is , at the end of an individual 's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer 's neck — with only the Victoria Cross , the Cross of Valour , and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada . Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon , while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest . Protocol originally followed the British tradition , wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder . These regulations were altered in 1997 , and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men . 
 With the patriation in 1988 of oversight of arms to Canada through the Canadian Heraldic Authority , the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended to include the entitlement of all inductees to petition the Chief Herald of Canada for personal armorial bearings , should they not already possess any . Companions may receive supporters , and all members may have the escutcheon ( shield ) of their arms encircled with a red ribbon bearing the order 's motto in gold , and from which is suspended a rendition of the holder 's Order of Canada badge . The Queen , Sovereign of the Order of Canada , approved the augmentation of her royal arms for Canada with the order 's ribbon in 1987 . 
 = = = Possession and sale = = = 
 The constitution of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown , and requires any member of the order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank . Thus , while badges may be passed down as family heirlooms , or loaned or donated for display in museums , they cannot be sold by any individual other than the monarch with the proper advice and consent of her ministers . Over the decades , however , a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale , the first being the Companion 's badge of Major Coldwell , who was appointed in 1967 ; his badge was sold at auction in 1981 , an act that received criticism from government officials . 
 In 2007 , it was revealed that one of the first ever issued insignia of the Order of Canada , a Medal of Service awarded originally to Quebec historian Gustave Lanctot , was put up for sale via e @-@ mail . Originally , the anonymous auctioneer , who had purchased the decoration for $ 45 at an estate sale in Montreal , attempted to sell the insignia on eBay ; however , after the bidding reached $ 15 @,@ 000 , eBay removed the item , citing its policy against the sale of government property , including " any die , seal or stamp provided by , belonging to , or used by a government department , diplomatic or military authority appointed by or acting under the authority of Her Majesty . " Rideau Hall stated that selling medals was " highly discouraged " , however the owner continued efforts to sell the insignia via the internet . Five years later , a miniature insignia presented to Tommy Douglas was put on auction in Ontario as part of a larger collection of Douglas artifacts . Douglas 's daughter , Shirley Douglas , purchased the set for $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Eligibility and appointment = = 
 Any of the three levels of the Order of Canada are open to all living Canadian citizens , except all federal and provincial politicians and judges while they hold office . The order recognizes the achievement of outstanding merit or distinguished service by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour , as well as the efforts made by non @-@ Canadians who have made the world better by their actions . Membership is thus accorded to those who exemplify the order 's Latin motto , taken from Hebrews 11 : 16 of the Bible , <unk> meliorem patriam , meaning " they desire a better country . " Each of the six to eight hundred nominations submitted each year , by any person or organization , is received by the order 's Advisory Council , which , along with the governor general , makes the final choice of new inductees , typically by consensus rather than a vote ; a process that , when conceived , was the first of its kind in the world . Appointees are then accepted into the organization at an investiture ceremony typically conducted by the governor general at Rideau Hall , although the Queen or a provincial viceroy may perform the task , and the ceremony may take place in other locations . Since the 1991 investiture of Ted Rogers , Order of Canada instalment ceremonies have been broadcast on various television channels and the Internet ; recipients are given a complimentary video recording of their investiture ceremony from Rogers Cable . 
 = = = Advisory Council = = = 
 The task of the Advisory Council is to evaluate the nominations of potential inductees , decide if the candidates are worthy enough to be accepted into the order , and make recommendations to the governor general , who appoints the new members . The council is chaired by the Chief Justice of Canada , and includes the Clerk of the Queen 's Privy Council , the Deputy Minister of Canadian Heritage , the Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts , the President of the Royal Society of Canada , the Chair of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada , and five members of the order who sit on the council for a three @-@ year period . If a nomination involves a non @-@ Canadian citizen , the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs is invited by the Advisory Council to offer evaluation . Decisions of the council and new appointments to and dismissals from the Order of Canada are announced to the Canada Gazette . 
 As of October 2015 , the members of the Advisory Council are : 
 The Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin PC – Chief Justice of Canada ( Chair ) 
 Kim Baird CM

 = = = Refusal = = = 
 Few have declined entry into the Order of Canada ; as of 1997 , 1 @.@ 5 percent of offered appointments to the order had been refused . The identities of those individuals who have declined induction since the 1970s are kept confidential , so the full list is not publicly known . Some , however , have spoken openly about their decisions , including Robert Weaver , who stated that he was critical of the " three @-@ tier " nature of the order ; Claude Ryan and Morley Callaghan , who both declined the honour in 1967 ; Mordecai Richler , who twice declined ; and Marcel Dubé , Roger Lemelin , and Glenn Gould , who all declined in 1970 . However , all the above individuals , save for Gould and Weaver , later did accept appointment into the order . Others have rejected appointment on the basis of being supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement — such as Luc @-@ André Godbout , Rina <unk> , and Geneviève Bujold — while Alice Parizeau , another supporter of Quebec sovereignty , was criticized for accepting entry into the order despite her beliefs . 
 Victoria Cross recipient Cecil <unk> cited the fact that he already held Canada 's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada . Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion ; however , he refused on the grounds that , as the consort of the Queen , he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment . In 1993 , the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada , making the sovereign 's spouse automatically a Companion , but Prince Philip again refused , stating that if he was to be appointed , it should be on his merits . <unk> with these arguments , he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia . In 2013 , the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013 . Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that , as a self @-@ proclaimed Father of Confederation , he deserved a knighthood . Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion . 
 = = = Resignation and removal = = = 
 Resignations from the order can take place only through the prescribed channels , which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery of his or her desire to terminate their membership , and only with the governor general 's approval can the resignation take effect . On 1 June 2009 , the governor general accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor René Racine , pianist Jacqueline Richard , and Cardinal Jean @-@ Claude Turcotte ; on 11 January 2010 , did the same for Renato Giuseppe Bosisio , an engineering professor , and Father Lucien <unk> ; and on 19 April 2010 for Frank Chauvin . It was also reported that other constituents of the Order of Canada had , in reaction to Henry Morgentaler 's induction into their ranks , indicated that they would return or had returned their emblems in protest , including organizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House <unk> doing so on behalf of deceased former members . 
 Members may be removed from the order if the Advisory Council feels their actions have brought the society into disrepute . In order for this to be done , the council must agree to take action and then send a letter to the person both telling of the group 's decision and requesting a response . Anyone removed from the order is required to return their insignia . As of October 2015 , six people have been removed from the Order of Canada : Alan Eagleson , who was dismissed after being jailed for fraud in 1998 ; David <unk> , who faced calls for his removal due to anti @-@ Semitic comments he made in 2002 ; T. Sher Singh , after the Law Society of Upper Canada found him guilty of professional misconduct and revoked his license to practice law ; Steve Fonyo , due to " his multiple criminal convictions , for which there are no outstanding appeals " ; Garth <unk> , who was found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario and has been a fugitive from American law for related crimes ; and Lord Black of <unk> , who was convicted in the United States in 2007 of fraud and obstruction of justice . In 2013 , Norman Barwin resigned from the order as a result of the Advisory Council moving forward with his pending removal due to his being found guilty of professional misconduct .

 The advisory board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in its approach to selecting new members of the Order of Canada , generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown ; political interference has occurred only once , when in 1978 Paul <unk> 's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . However , some of the committee 's selections have caused controversy . For instance , the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson , host of the long @-@ running Sunday Night Sex Show , as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada 's Christian organizations , as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of safe sex alongside abstinence . Similarly , the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate . 
 Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler 's appointment to the order on 1 July 2008 not only marked the first time the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision , but also proved to be one of the most controversial appointments in the order 's history , drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the ire of Members of Parliament , groups opposing abortion , and religious leaders . The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July , while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador , the official residence of that province 's lieutenant governor . Several members of the order resigned or returned their insignia . 
 One former police detective , Frank Chauvin , along with a Catholic anti @-@ abortion activist , filed suit against the Order of Canada Advisory Council , demanding that the minutes of the meeting relating to Morgentaler be made public . The appointment of Morgentaler prompted former Liberal Member of Parliament Clifford Lincoln to write that the workings of the Advisory Council were " mysterious " , citing what he theorized to be inbuilt partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why Margaret Somerville , whom Lincoln had twice nominated to the Advisory Council , was turned down for appointment , yet Morgentaler was accepted . Journalist Henry Aubin in the Montreal Gazette opined that the council 's rejection of Somerville , her personal opposition to same @-@ sex marriage , and the acceptance of Brent Hawkes , Jane Rule , and Jean Chrétien , all regarded as supporting same @-@ sex unions , as well as the appointment of a controversial figure such as Morgentaler , were all signs that the Advisory Council operated with partisan bias . Aubin also pointed to the presence on the council of members of the Royal Society of Canada , an organization into which Somerville was received .

 At a 2006 conference on Commonwealth honours , Christopher McCreery , an expert on Canada 's honours , raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were insufficient to recognize the nation 's very best ; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order , equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders . The order of precedence also came under scrutiny , particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders ( except the Order of Merit ) , contrary to international practice . 
 In June 2010 , McCreery suggested reforms to the Order of Canada that would avert the awkwardness around appointing those in Canada 's royal family as full members of the order : He theorized that the Queen , as the order 's Sovereign , could simply appoint , on ministerial advice , anyone as an extra member , or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved . Similarly , McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general , their spouses , and members of the Royal Family , a version of which was adopted in 2013 . 
 = = Additional honours = = 
 At certain periods , holders of the order were presented with other awards , usually commemorative medals . Thus far , two commemoratives have been given automatically to every living member of the Order of Canada : the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 .

 King 's Highway 403 ( pronounced " four @-@ oh @-@ three " ) , or simply Highway 403 , is a 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that travels between Woodstock and Mississauga , branching off from and reuniting with Highway 401 at both ends and travelling south of it through Hamilton and Mississauga . It is concurrent with the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) for 22 km ( 14 mi ) from Burlington to Oakville . Highway 403 is also known as the Chedoke Expressway within Hamilton . Although the Highway 403 designation was first applied in 1963 to a short stub of freeway branching off of the QEW , the entire route was not completed until August 15 , 1997 , when the Brantford to the then @-@ still independent Town of Ancaster section was opened to traffic . The section of Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April 27 , 2016 . 
 The majority of Highway 403 is surrounded by suburban land use , except west of Ancaster , where it passes through agricultural land ; Brantford is the only urban area through this section . In Hamilton , Highway 403 descends the Niagara Escarpment . It wraps around the northern side of Burlington Bay to encounter the QEW . From there , it travels straight through Burlington and Oakville with the QEW , departing to the north at the Mississauga – Oakville boundary . The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east – west direction , serving its city centre , before turning north . It continues north of Highway 401 as Highway 410 .

 = = = Woodstock to Burlington = = = 
 Highway 403 begins at a junction with Highway 401 on the outskirts of Woodstock . The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401 , whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401 . It travels along the back lot lines of the second concession south of former Highway 2 . It passes beneath Oxford County Road 55 ( formerly Highway 53 ) and curves southeast . After crossing into the third concession , it curves back to the east . The highway travels straight for several kilometres , meeting with the southern leg of Highway 24 , which travels south to Simcoe . 
 The highway crosses the Grand River to the south of Paris , then passes over former Highway 2 as it enters into Brantford . As it passes through Brantford , the highway angles southeast and passes beneath the northern leg of Highway 24 and then the Wayne Gretzky Parkway . The route exits the small city to the east and curves northeast shortly thereafter . It travels between <unk> Road and former Highway 2 to Ancaster , jogging to avoid cutting through <unk> Lake . As the freeway enters Ancaster , it once again crosses former Highway 2 and dips through the southern side of the town . 
 East of Ancaster , the freeway passes through a short greenbelt , with Hamilton Golf and Country Club lying to the north . A divided segment of Highway 6 meets the freeway and continues concurrently with it through Hamilton ; to the south , Highway 6 travels to John C. Munro International Airport , Caledonia and Jarvis at Highway 3 . Continuing east , Highway 403 and Highway 6 curve north into Hamilton and meet the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway before abruptly curving to the east and descending the Niagara Escarpment . Scenic views of Hamilton , its harbour , and Lower Princess Falls are located along this steep descent . At the bottom of the escarpment the highway travels through a narrow , heavily developed corridor alongside former Highway 8 . It passes beneath multiple bridges in a depressed trench , eventually curving north at a sharp corner and passing beneath more bridges . This section features a reduced speed limit of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) as opposed to 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The highway returns to ground level alongside the Chedoke Creek , a now @-@ channelized river from which the freeway may take its name . 
 As the freeway continues north , it crosses an isthmus between Hamilton Harbour and Cootes Paradise alongside several roads which it has served to replace . It circles around the northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation . The concurrency with Highway 6 ends at an interchange where Highway 403 continues east and Highway 6 travels north towards Guelph . The freeway continues straight for several kilometres and meets the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 407 at the Freeman Interchange . 
 = = = Oakville to Mississauga = = = 
 Highway 403 travels concurrently with the QEW for 22 @.@ 6 km ( 14 @.@ 0 mi ) between Freeman and Oakville , a straight section surrounded almost entirely by commercial units and warehouses . At the Ford Assembly Plant near the Halton – Peel regional boundary , Highway 403 branches off from the QEW and heads north for 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) along the western edge of Mississauga . At that point it again meets Highway 407 . Both freeways interchange , but curve to avoid each other . Highway 407 continues to the north and west , while Highway 403 curves east to follow alongside a hydro corridor through the centre of Mississauga . From this interchange to Highway 401 , high @-@ occupancy vehicle ( HOV ) lanes are present in the shoulder lanes for vehicles with at least one passenger . Sandwiched between residential subdivisions on both sides , the freeway passes beneath Erin Mills Parkway and crosses the Credit River . 
 On the other side of the river , the freeway skirts to the north of downtown Mississauga , as well as the Square One Shopping Centre . It passes beneath Hurontario Street ( once a section of Highway 10 ) and begins to widen before abruptly curving to the north as it approaches Cawthra Road . As the curve ends , the freeway widens further into ten lanes . This short section of highway passes beneath Eglinton Avenue and begins to diverge into a sprawling interchange approaching Highway 401 . Access to Highway 410 , which continues northward to Brampton , is provided from the collector lanes .

 Highway 403 , although one of the first divided highways conceived for Ontario , is one of the most recently completed freeways in the province ; the multiple segments of the route did not become continuous until 2002 . Planning for the route was underway by 1958 , with the completion of the Freeman Bypass along the QEW providing a three @-@ legged junction for the new freeway . Sections of Highway 403 through Hamilton opened between December 1963 and September 1969 . An isolated section known as the Brantford Bypass was opened in October 1966 , and would remain unconnected to other freeways for over 20 years . Plans for a third segment through Mississauga were contemplated throughout the 1960s , but were not finalized until late 1977 , after which construction began . Portions opened at both ends in 1980 and 1981 , while the central gap , crossing the Credit River , was completed in December 1982 . 
 Construction to bridge the gaps in Highway 403 between Ancaster and Woodstock was carried out over three major phases . The first phase was a short extension of the Brantford Bypass beginning in 1975 . Later , work began to connect that extension with Highway 401 near Woodstock , opening in 1988 . The last phase , between Ancaster and Brantford , was opened in 1997 . The final discontinuity , between Burlington and Oakville , was signed as a concurrency with the QEW in 2002 . Originally , this section was to have travelled along the corridor occupied by Highway 407 , until budget shortfalls in 1995 resulted in a change of plans .

 The corridor that connects London and Hamilton has always been considered important to Ontario . In late October 1793 , Captain Smith and 100 Queen 's Rangers returned from carving The Governor 's Road 32 km ( 20 mi ) through the thick forests between Dundas and the present location of Paris . John Graves Simcoe was tasked with defending Upper Canada from America following the revolution and with opening the virgin territory to settlement . After establishing a " temporary " capital at York , Simcoe ordered an inland route constructed between Cootes Paradise at the tip of Lake Ontario and his proposed capital of London . By the spring of 1794 , the road was extended as far as La Tranche , now the Thames River . Today , most of this route forms part of former Highway 2 and former Highway 5 . 
 The paving of the divided four @-@ lane Middle Road , with gentle curves , a grass median and grade @-@ separated interchanges , would set the stage for the freeway concept . It was the first intercity freeway in North America when it opened in June 1939 . Thomas McQueston , the new minister of the Department of Highways and the man most responsible for the Middle Road , decided to apply the concept to sections of Highway 2 plagued with congestion . A portion east of Woodstock was rebuilt in this fashion , but World War II would put an end to the ambitions of McQueston , at least temporarily . 
 = = = Initial construction = = = 
 The end of the Korean War heralded the resuming of freeway construction in Ontario ; the advances in machinery more than made up for lost time . The construction of Highway 401 across the province took first priority . However , the opening of the section from Highway 4 near London to Highway 2 east of Woodstock on May 31 , 1957 would complete part of the route required between London and Hamilton . By 1958 , planning on the Chedoke Expressway , or Controlled Access Highway 403 was well underway , though plans for a four lane freeway between Woodstock and Hamilton were around as early as 1954 . The opening of the Freeman Bypass of the QEW in August 1958 provided a connection point for a new freeway , and construction began the same day that the Burlington Bay Skyway opened : October 31 , 1958 . Highway 403 between Longwood Road ( Highway 2 ) and the QEW was opened to traffic on December 1 , 1963 at a length of 9 @.@ 0 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) . Work was already underway on the next section of the route that would extend it to Aberdeen Avenue . That section opened on July 9 , 1965 , extending the freeway by 3 @.@ 7 km ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) . 
 Meanwhile , to the west , work had begun on a bypass of Brantford . The new freeway passed north of the city between Paris Road in the west and the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 53 in the east , a distance of 10 @.@ 3 km ( 6 @.@ 4 mi ) ; it opened October 31 , 1966 . A portion of the Brantford Bypass was itself bypassed in 1997 when the final section of Highway 403 was completed and is known as Garden Avenue . However , the Brantford Bypass would remain an isolated section of Highway 403 for over 20 years . 
 In Hamilton , work was underway on an extension of the Chedoke Expressway to Mohawk Road , crossing the Niagara Escarpment . This tedious project , which required extensive rock blasting , was soon accompanied by further construction from Mohawk Road to Highway 2 near Ancaster . Both projects were completed together and originally scheduled to be opened with a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony on August 22 , 1969 . However , local residents complained that the new section lacked any barriers preventing children from wandering onto the highway , postponing the ceremony until August 27 as temporary snow fencing was erected . This proved inadequate and protests grew more vocal over the following week . Several petitions were presented to Deputy Highway Minister H. Howden on August 26 , and the ceremonies were promptly cancelled . Over the following week , the Minister of Highways George Gomme met with residents and reached a compromise whereby a 24 – hour patrol was established to watch for children until a proper fence could be constructed . The route was subsequently opened on September 3 , without any ceremony . This completed the Hamilton section of Highway 403 . 
 = = = Mississauga = = = 
 Planning for the segment of Highway 403 through Mississauga dates back to the late 1950s when the Hamilton Expressway appeared on the Metropolitan Toronto 's regional transportation plan . It was to be a continuation of the Richview Expressway , which was ultimately never built , continuing from Toronto to Hamilton . The plan featured the expressway 's eastern terminus at the Highway 401 and Highway 427 interchange . As Toronto 's anti @-@ expressway movement gained momentum , provincial plans shifted the Hamilton Expressway to the west near Etobicoke Creek . In 1962 , the right @-@ of @-@ way alongside the hydro corridor between Burlington and Etobicoke Creek was protected after traffic studies indicated the need for a future freeway . On May 25 , 1965 , the Department of Highways unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study . The plan designated Highway 403 north from Burlington and then parallel with the QEW to Highway 401 near Highway 27 . 
 By the time construction was actually underway , plans had been completely modified to connect the overburdened QEW at Oakville with Highway 401 at the new Highway 410 interchange . This interchange was a better connection point for Highway 403 , but would also require the widening of Highway 401 from six lanes to twelve . Plans were submitted and approved in December 1977 by Mississauga city council , and construction began . 
 The new freeway opened in sections during the early 1980s . The first section between Cawthra Road and Highway 401 was opened August 18 , 1980 . This was followed by a short section from Highway 5 ( Dundas Street ) south to the QEW at Ford Drive , which opened in mid @-@ 1981 . Later that year , an extension to Erin Mills Parkway was opened on November 17 , 1981 . The final section to be opened took the longest to complete , involving construction of two bridges over the Credit River valley ; it opened on December 2 , 1982 . The cost of the entire 22 km ( 13 @.@ 7 mi ) Mississauga segment was $ 87 million . 
 Around the same period , the Ministry of Transportation began to study upgrading Highway 401 to a collector – express system between Renforth Drive and Highway 403 , and along Highway 403 between Highway 401 and Highway 10 . This took place between late 1982 and the summer of 1985 ; the existing outermost ramps from Highway 403 to Highway 401 eastbound were re @-@ designated to serve collector traffic , as a pair of flyover ramps were added inside the interchange to serve motorists in the express lanes . 
 The right @-@ of @-@ way originally intended for Highway 403 between Cawthra Road and Etobicoke Creek was eventually used for a controlled access arterial extension called Eastgate Parkway , which was planned beginning in 1982 . The extension was built between 1988 and 1994 , incorporating a portion of Fieldgate Drive at the eastern end . The first section , between Cawthra Road and Dixie Road , opened in early 1991 . This was followed several years later by the section from Dixie Road to Eglinton Avenue that opened in late 1994 . 
 In the fall of 1991 , alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway , construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410 , which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic , while new overpasses were constructed in the centre for Highway 401 express lanes . The loop ramp from Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound was replaced by a semi @-@ directional high @-@ speed flyover , while a new directional ramp and semi @-@ direction flyover were added to serve westbound Highway 401 commuters . Prior to the opening of this link , traffic from both freeways was forced onto eastbound Highway 401 . The 2 @.@ 2 km ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) link opened on November 2 , 1992 at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 3 million . 
 = = = Bridging the gaps = = = 
 In 1975 , construction began on a westward extension of the Brantford Bypass , from Highway 2 ( Paris Road ) to Rest Acres Road , which would become Highway 24 . This work consisted of the twin bridges over the Grand River and an interchange at Rest Acres Road . The Canadian National Railway underpass west of Highway 2 was built by the railway . By the beginning of 1978 , this work was completed . Work resumed west of Highway 24 during the spring of 1982 to connect with Highway 401 near Woodstock in order to relieve the high traffic volumes along Highway 2 . This included interchanges at Brant County Road 25 and Highway 53 . A section from Highway 24 to County Road 25 was opened in November 1984 , followed by the section west of there to Highway 53 one year later . Construction of the gap between Highway 53 and Highway 401 began in late 1985 , followed by the Highway 401 overpass for the westbound lanes , which began in 1987 . Transportation minister Ed Fulton ceremoniously opened the new freeway connection on September 26 , 1988 , completing the Woodstock to Brantford link . 
 Highway 403 was briefly left with three discontinuous sections : Woodstock – Brantford , Ancaster – Burlington , and Oakville – Mississauga . Between Brantford and Ancaster , traffic was defaulted onto Highway 2 , a four @-@ lane road with numerous private driveways and at @-@ grade intersections . On March 24 , 1987 , Chris Ward , MPP for Wentworth North officially announced that construction of the missing link between Brantford and Ancaster would begin in 1989 . Construction did not actually begin until the summer of 1990 . It included interchanges at Garden Avenue , Highway 52 and Highway 2 . A continuous construction program was carried out over the next seven years , with the link opening on August 15 , 1997 . Highway 2 , which was the only parallel route before the completion of Highway 403 , was subsequently downloaded to regional jurisdiction . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Though some officials considered Highway 403 to be a perfect example of a freeway construction process , it was not built without its share of controversy . In addition to the previously mentioned issues that occurred in 1969 , portions of the freeway through Mississauga were built alongside established communities , leading to angry homeowners associations pressuring the province for noise mitigation measures and compensation . 
 In the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Mississauga section of Highway 403 was the site of more than two dozen fatal accidents over a five @-@ year period , one of the highest rates in North America at the time , despite being up to modern road standards . This led Peel Regional Police and the media to nickname it the ' Death Highway ' . In particular , the stretch from Mavis Road to Erin Mills Parkway has been the site of numerous accidents . Highway 403 features a downward slope as motorists head eastbound towards the Mavis Road interchange ; drivers complain of having to slam the brakes when traffic comes to a standstill , leading to rear @-@ end collisions . There is also glare from the sun that causes vision problems throughout the day . 
 = = = Recent construction = = = 
 The Hamilton @-@ Brantford and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 were initially planned to be linked up along the corridor that is now occupied by Highway 407 . However , these plans were altered by the Bob Rae government in 1995 , due to budgetary constraints . It was also announced that the Mississauga section of Highway 403 would be renumbered as Highway 410 . Ultimately , this never came to pass . Consequently , Highway 403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002 , remedying the discontinuity . 
 In early 2001 , high @-@ mast lighting was scheduled to be added to the previously unlit Mississauga section between Highway 407 and Eastgate Parkway . In 2003 , the right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road were widened for GO Transit and Mississauga Transit to run express bus services . These projects preceded the widening of Highway 403 between Highway 407 and Highway 401 / 410 , through which a high @-@ occupancy vehicle ( HOV ) lane was added in each direction ; the project started in summer of 2004 and these opened on December 13 , 2005 . The HOV lanes and the dividing Ontario Tall Wall concrete barrier were constructed using the existing right @-@ of @-@ way provided by the grass median . Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April 27 , 2016 . 
 Sufficient right @-@ of @-@ way exists at the Highway 401 / 403 / 410 junction for a loop ramp from Highway 403 eastbound to Highway 401 westbound , and a directional ramp for the opposite movement . This would give Highway 401 eastbound traffic direct access to Cawthra Road , making it a full four @-@ way interchange . These links are to be completed as Highway 401 is widened to a 12 @-@ lane collector @-@ express system west of the interchange .

 Gabe compares the Scranton Strangler to the Waco siege ; Erin incorrectly believes he is mispronouncing " wacko " . Jim notes that the Scranton Strangler car chase , witnessed in the episode 's cold opening , is on the same level as " Balloon Boy " and Michael Jackson 's funeral . The Glee episode viewed during the party was the season two episode " Duets " . When turning up the volume at the party , he comments , " Turn it up to eleven . Spinal Cord " , an obvious mis @-@ reference to This Is Spinal Tap . Michael comments that his favorite character on Glee is " the invalid " , a reference to character Artie Abrams .

 " Viewing Party " aired on NBC on November 11 , 2010 . In its original American broadcast , it was viewed by an estimated 7 @.@ 15 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 6 rating / 10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that 3 @.@ 6 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old households watched the episode , and ten percent of that demographic had their televisions tuned to the channel at any point . The Baltimore NBC affiliate carried the Ravens / Falcons NFL game , so ratings for the regular Thursday NBC programming were lower than usual . 
 Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B " . He compared it to the earlier seventh season episode " Sex Ed " , writing that both featured " a Michael story wherein a large collection of unfortunate behaviors is capped off with a moment of sincerity " ; however , McNutt criticized this narrative structure , calling it " a bit cheap " . Despite this , he felt that Dwight 's subplot " was successful in that it strayed true to the office dynamic " , and that the actual viewing of the Glee episode was a " highlight " because it showcased the characters " fall [ ing ] into some really fun ( and familiar tropes . " Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine awarded the episode an 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 , and called it " a solid episode " . She argued that " it left me wanting to tune in next week and see what ’ ll happen next " , largely because of the " surprising " amount of character development . 
 Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars . He was complimentary towards the main plot , and he felt empathy towards Michael because he felt that " Gabe is the absolute worst " . In addition , Forcella wrote that Pam and Jim 's subplot " had its moments , as well " , and called the scene featuring Jim feeding Dwight pizza " fantastic " . Not all reviews were glowing , however . Alan Sepinwall gave the episode a critical review , calling it " dreadful " . Although he said it was better than " Christening " , he felt that " so , so much of the episode didn 't work " . Sepinwall felt that the major problem with the episode was that it was " lifeless " and " light on jokes " , and only featured " Michael being petulant and crabby for a whole episode " , rather than featuring him in a character study . He concluded that " Ellie Kemper and Steve Carell almost were able to save the episode in the closing moments with Erin 's reaction to Michael declaring that he 's not her father , [ but ] it came far too late in an episode that was more concerned with Andy vomit humor .

 Bart presents a book report at Springfield Elementary School on Treasure Island , but it is blatantly obvious he did not read the book .

The next day at school , Bart feigns illness and that night , Lisa warns Bart he cannot evade his responsibilities forever , but Bart calls Milhouse for the test answers . After school the next day , an overconfident Bart hands in his test , only to get a poor score that is even worse than Milhouse 's substandard test and have Mrs. Krabappel take remedial action . 
 Homer and Marge are called in to meet with Mrs. Krabappel and school psychiatrist Dr. J. Loren Pryor . Dr. Pryor says that Bart is an underachiever and recommends that he should repeat the fourth @-@ grade . Homer and Marge consider that holding Bart back might not be such a bad idea . However , Bart is against this idea , and vows that he will start to do better and will pass . Left with little time to study on his own , Bart prays to God and asks that something miraculous happen to make him miss school the next day so he can have more time to study .

 " Bart Gets an " F " " was the first episode of The Simpsons to be written by David M. Stern . It was directed by David Silverman . Over the summer of 1990 , Bart 's rebellious nature was characterized by some parents and conservatives as a poor role model for children while several American public schools banned T @-@ shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as " I 'm Bart Simpson . Who the hell are you ? " and " Underachiever ( ' And proud of it , man ! ' ) " Several critics thought that the episode was a response to these controversies . However , executive producer James L. Brooks responded that it was not , but added , " we 're mindful of it . I do think it 's important for us that Bart does badly in school . There are students like that . Besides , I 'm very wary of television where everybody is supposed to be a role model . You don 't run across that many role models in real life . Why should television be full of them ? " Sam Simon commented that " there are themes to the shows we did last year , important themes , I think it 's a tribute to how well we executed them that nobody realized we had a point . Bart says " Cowabunga " for the second time ( the first time being in " The Telltale Head " ) , which was commonly associated with Bart through its use as a T @-@ shirt slogan . Mayor Quimby makes his first appearance in this episode , without his trademark sash that says " Mayor " . The sash was later added because the writers feared that viewers would not recognize him . 
 The episode was the first to feature a new opening sequence , which was shortened by fifteen seconds from its original length of roughly 1 minute , 30 seconds . The opening sequence for the first season showed Bart stealing a " Bus Stop " sign ; whilst the new sequence featured him skateboarding past several characters who had been introduced during the previous season . Starting with this season , there were three versions of the opening : a full roughly 1 minute 15 second long version , a 45 @-@ second version and a 25 @-@ second version . This gave the show 's editors more leeway . David Silverman believes that the animators began to " come into their own " as they had gotten used to the characters and were able to achieve more with character acting . During the scene where Bart delivers a speech where he states he is " dumb as a post " , Silverman wanted to cut from several angles very quickly to give a sense of anxiety . Martin Prince 's design was changed several times during the episode . There was a different model that had larger eyes and wilder hair designed for the scene where Martin betrays Bart and runs off . Silverman describes the " Snow Day " sequence as one of the hardest things he ever had to animate . It features several long pans which shows many different characters engaging in various activities and was difficult to time correctly . Bart 's fantasy where he sees the founding fathers of the United States uses muted colors and variations of red , white and blue . Silverman also had to work hard to make Bart cry without making his design look too off @-@ putting , and this is the reason why he was shown covering his face with a piece of paper .

 The first season of The Simpsons had finished as high as 4th in the weekly ratings and was the Fox network 's first series to rank among a season 's top 30 highest @-@ rated shows and Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed " Bartmania " . Due to the success of the first season of the show , the Fox Network decided to switch The Simpsons ' timeslot in hopes that it would steal ratings from NBC 's " powerhouse " line up , generate more advertising revenue , and result in higher ratings for Beverly Hills , 90210 and Babes , which would follow the show . The show was moved from its from 8 : 00 p.m. EST Sunday night slot to the same time on Thursday , where it would compete with NBC 's The Cosby Show , the number one show at the time . Many of the producers of The Simpsons , including James L. Brooks , were against the move . The show had been in the top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings . He commented that " Suddenly a show that was a hit is fighting for its survival , [ ... ] We 're not fighting ' Cosby , ' we just want to get healthy ratings . There have been two weeks in my life when a show I was associated with was number one in the ratings , and on Sunday night , we had a chance to be the number one show in the country . I don 't think we have a chance on Thursday night . " 
 " Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish " was the first episode produced for the season , but " Bart Gets an " F " " aired first because Bart was popular at the time and the producers had wanted to premiere with an episode involving him . It aired opposite the fourth episode of the seventh season of The Cosby Show titled " Period of Adjustment " , which saw the addition of Erika Alexander to the cast . The first 13 episodes of The Simpsons had been rerun several times through the summer , and Fox heavily promoted the first new episode since May , and news outlets published stories about the supposed " Bill vs. Bart " rivalry .

 Reruns of The Simpsons which aired in the Thursday time slot against new episodes of The Cosby Show were ranked as low as 73rd in the weekly ratings ( compared with third place for The Cosby Show ) . Several critics predicted that " Bart Gets an " F " " would do considerably worse in the ratings than The Cosby Show . Greg Dawson of the Orlando Sentinel wrote that he would " bet dollars to plain @-@ cake doughnuts ( a Homer pet peeve ) that even a fresh Simpsons won 't come within five rating points of Cosby , which could get a 30 share in a power blackout . " Fox executive Peter Chernin said that they were hoping to establish a foothold on Thursday night and that " if we 're really lucky and very fortunate , we 're going to come in second place . " 
 Early overnight ratings figures for the original broadcast of the episode in 24 cities projected that The Simpsons had a 19 @.@ 9 Nielsen Rating and 30 % share of the audience while The Cosby Show had a 19 @.@ 3 Nielsen Rating and 29 % share . However , the final rating for " Bart Gets an " F " " was an 18 @.@ 4 and a 29 % share of the audience , finishing second in its time slot behind The Cosby Show , which had an 18 @.@ 5 rating and 29 % share . At the time , NBC had 208 television stations , while Fox only had 133 . It finished eighth in the weekly ratings , tied with Who 's the Boss ? , while The Cosby Show finished seventh . The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show , but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33 @.@ 6 million viewers watched the episode , making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week ( The Cosby Show was watched by 28 @.@ 5 million , finished seventh ) . It became the highest rated and most watched program in the history of the Fox Network . It remained in that position until January 1 , 1995 , when a National Football League playoff game between the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears achieved a Nielsen Rating of 21 @.@ 0 . As of 2016 it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons .

 The episode has received positive reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote , " A cracking opener to the second season - especially memorable for the sequence in which Bart prays for school to be cancelled the following day only to find himself exiled from the ensuing winter wonderland . " Virginia Mann of The Record felt that it was " not as wildly funny as last season 's best episodes , [ but still ] well @-@ done , humorous , and , at times , poignant . " The episode was praised for its emotional scenes . Tom Shales wrote that the episode is " not only funny , it 's touching " and praised it for its scenes where Bart prays , writing " There are few if any other entertainment shows on television that get into philosophical matters even this deeply . The Simpsons can be as thoughtful as a furrow @-@ browed Bill Moyers <unk> - yet infinitely more amusing . " Hal Boedeker of The Miami Herald felt that it " pulls off a finale that 's thoughtful without being preachy , tender without being sappy . Despite the tears , the show keeps its edge . And the way TV usually smears on the schmaltz , that 's quite an achievement . " Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution wrote " The episode does a good job of emphasizing the importance of studying without getting <unk> . For all the talk about the anarchy of " The Simpsons , " the show sometimes has smuggled in an occasional message , as it does again . " In his book The Gospel According to the Simpsons , Mark I.

Internet comedian , Doug Walker , considers the episode to be the best of the entire series because he found it to be the most dramatic , funny , realistic , and relatable . 
 The episode was ranked 31st on Entertainment Weekly 's list of " The 100 Greatest Moments in Television " , writing that it " stands as classic irreverent family TV " . In 2007 , Larina Adamson , a supervising producer on The Simpsons , named " Bart Gets an ' F ' " as her favorite episode of the series .

 = MediEvil : Resurrection = 
 MediEvil : Resurrection is a 2005 Gothic action @-@ adventure video game developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable . It is a re @-@ imagining of the first instalment in the series , MediEvil . It was first released as a launch title on 1 September 2005 in Europe and 13 September 2005 in North America . It was also re @-@ released for the PlayStation Network in 2008 . The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist , Sir Daniel Fortesque , as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok 's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself . The game also features a variety of voice talents , including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper . 
 Development of the game began in 2003 with the original intention of releasing the game for the PlayStation 2 . Sony Computer Entertainment Europe commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to develop a launch title for the PlayStation Portable . Due to time constraints , the Cambridge studio was given only a year to develop the game , thus they decided to remake the original MediEvil . The game was met with mixed reviews upon release , with critics mainly praising the game 's humour , voice talent and graphics but was criticised for lack of innovation and cumbersome camera controls . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gameplay is similar to that of the original game in which players control Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through Gallowmere to stop the evil Zarok . Dan can utilise a variety of weapons , including close range weapons such as swords and axes to long ranged weapons such as throwing knives and crossbows . If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level , he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes , where a legendary hero rewards him by giving him a new weapon or other helpful items . Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game , which can be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains . The remastered version also includes some exclusive arcade @-@ style minigames which can also be played over online multiplayer . 
 MediEvil : Resurrection features many alterations to the original structure and content , such as the addition of the " Anubis Stone " sub @-@ plot which has never appeared in the original . Various levels and characters designs are altered drastically from the original , with some levels removed altogether . Resurrection 's altered plot is given a much more humorous and light @-@ hearted setting as opposed to the Gothic horror @-@ comedy of the first instalment . Unlike the original , there is no alternate ending ; Dan still enters eternal slumber regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the year 1286 , an evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army . It is told in legend that the King of Gallowmere 's champion , Sir Daniel Fortesque , led his army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before succumbing to his mortal wounds . In reality however , Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle , with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the " Hero of Gallowmere " . Zarok , meanwhile , was forced into hiding and was presumed dead . 100 years later , in 1386 , Zarok reappears , casting a spell over Gallowmere to awake his undead army and steal the souls of the living . However , in the process , he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan , who has over time become a skeletal corpse , missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere . Shortly after waking up , Dan is accompanied by Al @-@ Zalam , a genie whose powers were robbed by Zarok . Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes due to his failures in life , Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok , save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero . 
 As Dan travels across Gallowmere , collecting pieces of an artefact called the ' Anubis Stone ' along the way , fighting his way through Zarok 's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts , he soon arrives at Zarok 's lair , fighting off Zarok 's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices . After also managing to defeat Zarok 's champion , Lord <unk> , Zarok turns into a powerful monster , but Dan manages to defeat him . As Zarok sets his lair to self @-@ destruct , Dan is rescued by Al @-@ Zalam and the two escape , leaving Zarok 's magical influence over the land thwarted . With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result , Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of MediEvil : Resurrection began in 2003 at SCE Cambridge Studio . The senior management team of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable console and ordered the studio to develop the game in time for the console 's release . Due to the short notice , the studio was given only a year to develop a game , thus it was decided that a remake of the original MediEvil would be suitable as developing an original title would take more time to develop . 
 Despite the success of the previous games in the MediEvil series , only three original team members were involved in the making of MediEvil : Resurrection . Chris Sorrell , the creator of MediEvil , stressed in a retrospective interview that he would have preferred to direct Resurrection if he was not at the time instructed to direct the video @-@ game adaptation of 24 . Since the release of Resurrection , Sorrell expressed disappointment with the changes made to the game and the fact that his superiors did not allow him to direct it , but praised the team 's ability for working under a time constraint . Piers Jackson was instead appointed as the producer for Resurrection . He directed the overall development of the title , working closely with a new design team led by Dominic <unk> . Mitch Phillips , who was the character animator for the previous two instalments , was appointed as lead artist for the game . Phillips , along with Paul Arnold and Andrew Barnabas , the musical duo more commonly known as " Bob & Barn " , who composed the original soundtrack for MediEvil , were the only people from the original team to return . 
 According to Piers Jackson , the thrust of the design was to produce a title that could showcase the full abilities of the PlayStation Portable , including its built @-@ in Wi @-@ Fi capabilities . Jackson also asserted that Resurrection was an entirely different game from the original ; whilst the studio had taken the basic story and some of the locations from the original game , all the code , graphics and voice actors were changed . New additions to Resurrection included an expanded plot , added mini @-@ games , multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function . During late stages of development , the studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in the original , though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original . The addition of the ' Anubis Stone ' sub @-@ plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al @-@ Zalam was to act as Dan 's internal monologue as well as the player 's guide . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack in Resurrection is orchestrated , unlike the first instalment . Approximately half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels . The music is split into two halves ; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game with the addition of extra thematic elements to strengthen them . The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection . The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic . The orchestra , headed by Nic Raine , consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir , also recorded in the same venue . This follows the tradition of SCE Cambridge Studio 's previous orchestral game Primal , which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers . 
 = = Reception = = 
 MediEvil : Resurrection received mixed reviews upon release . It received an aggregate score of 69 % from GameRankings and a score of 66 from Metacritic . General criticisms from reviewers were directed at the camera controls , which was cited as being particularly poor during combat sequences , and occasionally being the cause for frame rate drops . Jason Allen of IGN noted that the camera angles were " not as bad " during open areas of the game , but became " rather clumsy in the middle of a heated battle " . Kristan Reed of Eurogamer expressed similar concerns with the camera work , stating that the camera was " sloppy " and that it proved particularly difficult during combat , when enemies were to suddenly appear off screen . 
 The combat was also criticised for its poor hit detection . Greg Mueller of GameSpot noted that the poor collision detection turned most of the combat sequences to a " frustrating and tedious " experience . Reed similarly criticised the combat system , citing that the system is " unremarkable on the basic level " and was disappointed with the lack of technical additions to the game . Allen also expressed concern with the fighting mechanics , stating that every melee attack was inaccurate and " clumsy " , combined with cumbersome camera work . 
 The graphics and voice talent were the most praised aspects of the game , especially Tom Baker 's role as the narrator and Grim Reaper . Mueller praised the soundtrack and dialogue , stating that the best part of the game " is easily the sound " , and that the voice of any character fits their role " perfectly " , making them more interesting than " the average voice @-@ over " . Reed also praised Baker 's role in the game , stating that voice @-@ overs and audio were the most enjoyable experiences in Resurrection , also citing that Baker 's voice performance was " majestic " and " eccentric " . Chris <unk> of GameSpy felt that the overall dialogue was heavy on the stereotypical accent , but was assured that players would enjoy the " electric atmosphere " of MediEvil , which he often compared to that of Tim Burton 's The Nightmare Before Christmas . 
 Chris Sorrell and Jason Wilson , co @-@ creators of MediEvil , had also expressed disappointment with the game . Neither of them had any involvement with MediEvil : Resurrection , and when they were asked about the game during a retrospective interview with <unk> , Wilson felt disheartened with having to watch something he " cherished " to be altered with decisions he thought were " questionable " . Sorrell felt similar disappointment in the redesign of the game and there were a number of aspects of it that he disagreed with . He did , however , praise the development team of Resurrection , stating that they did " an awesome job " considering the time constraints they were up against . 
 = Infamous Second Son = 
 Infamous Second Son ( stylized as inFAMOUS Second Son ) is an open world action @-@ adventure video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 . The game was released worldwide on March 21 , 2014 . Like in previous Infamous games , the player @-@ controlled protagonist possesses superpower abilities that players use in combat and when traveling across the city . The story follows protagonist Delsin Rowe fighting the Department of Unified Protection ( D.U.P. ) in a fictionalized Seattle . Over the course of the game , Delsin acquires new powers and becomes either good or evil as player choices influence his morality . 
 Sucker Punch began planning the game as early as 2010 , when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto a new generation of hardware . They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions they would like to see on the PlayStation 4 system . Second Son was considered a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist . Delsin Rowe 's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design . 
 Infamous Second Son was met with generally positive reviews ; critics praised its gameplay , dynamic combat , visuals and design , while criticism was aimed at the game 's morality system , which some found to be dated and binary , as well as the game 's repetitive side missions . The story was met with a mixed response , with some critics finding the narrative and characters to be a step backwards from previous installments in the series , while others viewing the writing as an improvement over its predecessors . Infamous Second Son was a commercial success , and sold over a million copies within nine days , making it the fastest @-@ selling entry within the Infamous franchise . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Infamous Second Son , players control the main character Delsin Rowe from a third @-@ person perspective and freely roam open world Seattle . Players parkour @-@ style climb vertical surfaces like high @-@ rise buildings . Delsin is a Conduit , which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke , neon , video , and concrete . These materials can be weaponized ( such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips ) or used to deftly navigate the game world ( such as using neon to dash up buildings ) . Using powers depletes a meter in the head @-@ up display ( HUD ) , which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles . Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story , which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection ( D.U.P. ) during missions . Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy mobile D.U.P. command centers to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it . Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected , they are scattered throughout Seattle . Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin 's suite of abilities . 
 Players may choose to act in either a good or evil way . Examples including healing civilians , doing drug busts , and stopping suspect brutality for good , or killing civilians , obliterating enemies and completing missions with evil karma for bad . Several times throughout the story , Delsin finds himself in a scenario where he must make a good or evil choice , such as whether to encourage Conduit vigilante Abigail " Fetch " Walker to stop slaying drug dealers , or to train her to become a more prolific killer . Player choices influence outcomes in some later missions . In combat , Delsin may use his abilities to incapacitate foes or obliterate them with headshots . He may choose to open fire on innocent civilians . Delsin 's choices manifest in a logo displayed on his jacket and the HUD , which features a blue ( good ) and red ( evil ) bird . Performing actions that are villainous gradually change the logo so that the red bird dominates the other , with the opposite happening with heroism . This is a visual representation of Delsin 's Karma level , that increases as good or evil depending on his choices . As his Karma level increases , Delsin can acquire new powers that correspond to his play @-@ style ( e.g. very destructive powers with high levels of evil Karma ) and his jacket also changes . If you have good karma , the jacket completely changes white whereas if evil the jacket turns red . A continual streak of either good or evil actions fills up a bar in the HUD , which then lets Delsin perform a powerful finishing move called a Karma Bomb . 
 When not completing story missions , players can explore the city and complete activities such as tagging graffiti spots or assassinating D.U.P. secret agents . The city is split into districts that are all initially controlled by the D.U.P. , but Delsin gradually liberates each district by completing activities . When D.U.P. control of a district falls below 30 percent , Delsin can enter a District Showdown that requires him to eliminate a wave of D.U.P. forces , eradicating D.U.P. presence there .

 Second Son takes place in 2016 , seven years after Infamous 2 's Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure humanity of a plague and destroy The Beast . Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon , which kills him and most of the other Conduits . The United States government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world 's remaining Conduits , dubbing Conduits with the pejorative " Bio @-@ Terrorists " . The protagonist is Delsin Rowe ( Troy Baker ) , a graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation . Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Absorption , allowing him to use other Conduits ' powers . His brother , Reggie ( Travis Willingham ) , is the local sheriff , and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism . Both are Akomish Native Americans , whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay , Washington . The antagonist is Brooke Augustine ( Christine Dunford ) , the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete . Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle , now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces . Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits : Henry " Hank " Daughtry ( David <unk> ) , a convict with control over Smoke ; Abigail " Fetch " Walker ( Laura Bailey ) , an ex @-@ junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down the illegal drug dealers in Seattle ; and Eugene Sims ( Alex Walsh ) , a reclusive video gamer who uses his Video ( digital materialization ) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.

 After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard , their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation . Two of the Conduits escape . Delsin pulls the third , Hank , out of the wreckage , and inadvertently absorbs his smoke powers . Shocked and frightened , Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers . However , they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine . She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin , suspecting him of hiding something . Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing . Regardless , Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members . 
 Delsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information . However , she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies , including their leader Betty ( Karen Austin ) . Reggie , who was spared from the torture , learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine 's power on them . Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine 's powers and save the tribe . Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him . They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits . With Reggie 's help , Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers . He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits , Fetch and Eugene , and absorbs their powers . After both confrontations , Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie , who initially views them as " freaks " , and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them . 
 Now possessing three powers , Delsin encounters Hank , who has escaped again . Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been captured by the D.U.P. , and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound . However , the situation turns out to be a trap set by Augustine . Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher . While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene , Augustine encases Reggie 's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform . As they dangle above the ocean , Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them , tells him that he is proud of him , and lets Delsin 's hand go and falls to his death . Distraught and enraged , Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine , destroying the entire island . 
 Augustine flees back to the D.U.P. headquarters . Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks , where he is fleeing from D.U.P. forces . Hank begs for forgiveness , saying that he only worked with Augustine because she threatened to hurt his daughter . Delsin can choose to either kill Hank , or let him escape Seattle with his daughter . Aided by Fetch and Eugene , Delsin rallies an assault on the D.U.P. headquarters . After breaking through the building 's defenses , Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime . Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers , and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population . Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers . 
 If Delsin has good Karma , he spares Augustine and exposes her crimes to the world . She is arrested and the D.U.P. disbands . Delsin , Fetch and Eugene convince the humans that they can peacefully coexist with the Conduits . All of the imprisoned Conduits are freed . Delsin returns to the reservation and heals the tribe members , then paints a mural dedicated to Reggie . 
 If Delsin has evil Karma , he kills Augustine and , together with Fetch and Eugene , takes control of Seattle . He releases all of the imprisoned Conduits and absorbs their powers . Upon returning to the reservation , Delsin is met by a wheelchair @-@ bound Betty who banishes him from the tribe for the killings in Seattle . Shocked and angered , Delsin destroys the entire reservation .

 Sucker Punch Productions began to develop Second Son while the PlayStation 4 was still being designed . Having finished work on Infamous : Festival of Blood , they began to plan a new entry in the Infamous series under the working title Infamous 3 . As early as 2010 , they discussed with Sony their desire to bring Infamous to a new PlayStation platform . 
 Sucker Punch were in close connection with the PS4 's lead system architect Mark Cerny , who visited the studio several times . They gave Cerny feedback about how much power a new PlayStation system would require to render their ideal open world , how fast it would be capable of doing so and to what degree of texture detail . " We had some experience there that was useful for that team when they were planning some aspects of the hardware design " , producer Brian Fleming explained . He found that during the PS4 's development , there was a great level of interactivity between the system 's designers and game developers such as Sucker Punch . 
 Sucker Punch made suggested improvements they would like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad . Second Son 's designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony 's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements . The developers found they were able to adopt the DualShock 4 's touchpad into Second Son 's gameplay ( for example , players emulate the in @-@ game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad ) . 
 The game was envisioned to take full advantage of the hardware , without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3 . The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin 's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world . The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity . They found the PS4 's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new . 
 Over 110 developers worked on the game , a number that director Nate Fox considered small . He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset , " to answer those first questions about what you want your game to be " . Sometimes , ideas came about during development that would have to be thrown out for not fitting with the game 's original vision . " We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch . It 's not easy ; it 's necessary " , Fox explained . Second Son displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second .

 Sucker Punch elected to set Second Son in their hometown of Seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences in the open world 's design . During early development when team members debated where Second Son would be set , Seattle rated high on a list of possibilities . Fleming considered that the city had not been featured in many games prior to Second Son and so would not be " overblown " , and felt that Seattle 's weather and mixture of " old and new " architecture would make it an interesting setting . The team conducted fieldwork in Seattle 's nearby forests with audio and video equipment , which was used to reproduce local flora and the chirping sounds of local American robins . Seattle landmarks such as Pioneer Square , the Space Needle and Elephant Car Washes feature in the game . The developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses . Griesemer called the game world an " abstraction " of Seattle rather than a re @-@ creation since its layout did not suit Second Son 's gameplay and required the team to make necessary changes . The team wanted to thematically explore Seattle 's heritage of Pacific Northwest , Native American tribes in the game . 
 The designers used graphic sliders in the game engine to determine the amount of water covering the streets . Like Seattle , rain is frequent in the game . The lighting effects ( such as neon light from Delsin 's powers ) coupled with reflections help bring color into Seattle 's dark and rainy atmosphere . Because of the move to the PS4 , Sucker Punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous Infamous games . " You get a better feel of the city when you can see more of it " , said Griesemer . 
 After deciding on Seattle for the setting , the developers began to think about the superpowers that Delsin would possess . They added neon lighting to the city to amplify the " beautiful reflective streets " , and subsequently decided to make neon a source of power for Delsin because of its prevalence . Animation director Billy Harper considered Delsin 's smoke powers challenging to design , as the team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous Infamous games . They removed Cole 's " contorted hand poses " to improve the connection between Delsin and his powers . Fox felt that smoke helps Delsin deftly navigate the game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies . Griesemer ( who previously worked with Bungie on the Halo series ) wanted to bring the fluidity of first @-@ person shooters to Second Son 's combat . The team reviewed the control scheme of previous Infamous games and " removed some of the complexity that was preventing people from interacting with the game " . 
 Griesemer said that a recurring theme throughout Infamous games that they wanted to continue with Second Son was the idea of " modern elemental powers " , variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world . Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses . " This is a game about super powers , so for us , the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you 're playing the game " , he explained . Fox considered that the game world 's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic . " Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility , you buy into the super @-@ powered element " , he explained .

 Second Son 's premise is built from the ending of Infamous 2 that sees protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifice himself to save humanity . They looked at Trophy data and found the majority ( 78 % ) of Infamous 2 players chose this ending , and concurred with the popular choice . This allowed them to create the new protagonist , Delsin , from scratch . " Moving forward onto [ Second Son ] , we said ' Alright , Cole 's dead . People have voted for this . Let 's make a new hero ' " , Fox explained . Griesemer felt that taking the Infamous series to the PS4 signified a new era , and that departing from the story of previous games would help them reach new audiences . " We needed a new entry point , and Delsin was the first step for that " , he explained . The idea to move away from Cole 's story came about during pre @-@ production staff meetings , and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with Sony Computer Entertainment . Griesemer described the contemporaneous sentiment as " It 's going to be new hardware , a new platform and we 're going to have a new audience " . 
 Delsin 's Native American heritage came from the game 's setting in the Pacific Northwest , which features a large Native American population . Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio ( Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where four of the six team members were wearing hats ) . Delsin 's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy , as the development team appreciated Banksy 's clandestine , satirical work . Developing Delsin 's personality , the team posited the hypothetical : " What if Johnny Knoxville had powers ? What would he do with it ? " . Harper considered Delsin " full of reckless abandon " , the kind of character that would , upon gaining superpowers , jump off a cliff to see what happens . Fox considered Delsin " flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to " , trying to live up to his successful brother Reggie . He called the game 's story a " hero 's journey " . 
 Digital Domain were brought on board for the motion capture work . Fox helped direct the actors ' performances , but found that they did not need much guidance for their roles . " You need to let them understand what you need from a scene , but the actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me " , he explained . Fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to the characters . " The ability to capture [ Delsin 's ] facial reaction when he 's like ' Oh , shit ' , but doesn 't say ' Oh shit ' — that 's a big deal " , he explained . 
 Most of the non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) that inhabit the open world were motion captured . The developers contacted casting agencies , and asked their friends and families if they would like to appear as extras in the game . Over 75 people were scanned in a three @-@ day period . They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile , and a high @-@ definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces . The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face . A 360 @-@ degree setup captured the actors ' moving bodies , but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles . Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models , each composed of roughly 1 @.@ 4 million polygons — any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers . To render the models in the game , the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count .

 The game received generally positive reviews with a normalized rating of 80 out of 100 based on 90 reviews on Metacritic . GameRankings assigned a rating of 81 % based on 61 reviews . The game sold over one million copies within nine days of its release , making it the fastest @-@ selling installment in the series . 
 Vince Ingenito of IGN recalled being left " staring slack @-@ jawed " at the visuals , and called the open world " beautifully and diversely realized " with impressive lighting effects . Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot called the visuals " incredible " . Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised Seattle 's art direction , and found the draw distances and frame rate consistent . David Meikleham of PlayStation Official Magazine ( OPM ) was very impressed with the graphics and 1080p definition , but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat . He enjoyed playing in Seattle and using his powers to level the destructible environments . <unk> Hussain of Computer and Video Games ( CVG ) praised graphical details like the particle and lighting systems . " [ The game is ] colorful , rich in detail and has some of the best effects we 've seen on console " , he wrote . 
 GameSpot 's Mc Shea considered the combat well @-@ balanced between Infamous 's slower pace and Infamous 2 's frenetic action , and enjoyed Delsin 's agility and power . Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the combat 's simplicity its strength , finding Delsin easy to control and navigate the world . Edge were underwhelmed with the game 's opening because of its " skittish " parkour , but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle , the game became very fun . They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge , and called the main missions " for the most part well designed and generously proportioned " . IGN 's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin 's powers in combat , and called each set " strong enough to hang an entire game on " . He found upgrading Delsin 's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good replay value . Philip Kollar of Polygon favored using neon power , but praised the balance and variety between all of them . He called the combat " a hell of a lot of fun " . Eurogamer 's Welsh found the combat imperfect yet fun , but did not think that upgrading Delsin 's skills made enough of a difference to his power . 
 Destructoid 's Carter thought that Delsin was a more interesting protagonist than " wooden " Cole , which helped his investment into the story . IGN 's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character , especially because of the chemistry with Reggie . He found Troy Baker 's performance of Delsin " [ imbued ] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling <unk> [ sic ] or overwrought " . However , he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward . Although calling the characters clichéd , Edge felt that they were written and acted well . GameSpot 's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature , and found the gameplay more interesting than the " tired " story . Eurogamer 's Welsh considered the plot driven by " inconsequential MacGuffins " and thought the ending rushed , but praised the story for not stretching on too long . Polygon 's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security @-@ over @-@ freedom well enough , such that its impact was diminished . He was overall disappointed with the narrative , despite finding the main characters written better than in previous Infamous games . OPM 's Meikleham was put off by Delsin 's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story , but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances . 
 Edge and Eurogamer 's Welsh faulted the morality system because they did not think it had enough influence on the story . IGN 's Ingenito called it " woefully outdated " , and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin 's character . He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play @-@ style , rather than crossing in @-@ between . GameSpot 's Mc Shea felt that the morality system was too binary because there was no " moral gray area " between playing good and evil . Polygon 's Kollar reflected Mc Shea 's opinion that the morality choices were too binary , and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil . OPM 's Meikleham felt that the morality system had " little to no impact on gameplay " . Danny Cowan of Joystiq thought that the morality system was well @-@ balanced , with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin 's choices . 
 GameSpot 's Mc Shea found Second Son 's open world beholden to a dated formula . He described Seattle as " a playground for you to go nuts in " instead of " a living , breathing world " , with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players . CVG 's Hussain called Seattle " hauntingly empty " , with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving <unk> . He felt that the open world 's lifelessness was the game 's biggest detractor , and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V , Sleeping Dogs and Assassin 's Creed IV : Black Flag , which he felt featured better open worlds . Eurogamer 's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre 's tropes . Polygon 's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities , as " virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs " . Edge found the amount of content in the game thin , finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side @-@ missions . " Approach [ Second Son ] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense " , they wrote . Destructoid 's Carter found the amount of content ample , and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards .
