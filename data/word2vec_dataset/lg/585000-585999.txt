 The AV @-@ 8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack aircraft of metal and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier , with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder @-@ mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral ( downward slope ) . The aircraft is powered by a single Rolls @-@ Royce Pegasus turbofan engine , which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine . Two of these nozzles are located near the forward , cold end of the engine and two are near the rear , hot end of the engine . This arrangement contrasts with most fixed @-@ wing aircraft , which have engine nozzles only at the rear . The Harrier II also has smaller valve @-@ controlled nozzles in the nose , tail , and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds . 
 The AV @-@ 8B is equipped with one centerline fuselage and six wing hardpoints ( compared to four wing hardpoints on the original Harrier ) , along with two fuselage stations for a 25 mm GAU @-@ 12 cannon and ammunition pack . These hardpoints give it the ability to carry a total of 9 @,@ 200 lb ( 4 @,@ 200 kg ) of weapons , including air @-@ to @-@ air , air @-@ to @-@ surface , and anti @-@ ship missiles , as well as unguided and guided bombs . The aircraft 's internal fuel capacity is 7 @,@ 500 lb ( 3 @,@ 400 kg ) , up 50 percent compared to its predecessor . Fuel capacity can be carried in hardpoint @-@ compatible external drop tanks , which give the aircraft a maximum ferry range of 2 @,@ 100 mi ( 3 @,@ 300 km ) and a combat radius of 300 mi ( 556 km ) . The AV @-@ 8B can also receive additional fuel via aerial refueling using the probe @-@ and @-@ drogue system . The British Aerospace Harrier II , a variant tailored to the RAF , uses different avionics , and has one additional missile pylon on each wing . 
 The Harrier II retains the tandem landing gear layout of the first @-@ generation Harriers , although each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid @-@ span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing . The engine intakes are larger than those of the first @-@ generation Harrier , and have a revised inlet . On the underside of the fuselage , McDonnell Douglas added lift @-@ improvement devices , which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground , giving the equivalent of up to 1 @,@ 200 lb ( 544 kg ) of extra lift . 
 The technological advances incorporated into the Harrier II , compared with the original Harrier , significantly reduce the workload on the pilot . The supercritical wing , hands @-@ on @-@ throttle @-@ and @-@ stick ( HOTAS ) control principle , and increased engineered lateral stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly . Ed Harper , general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program , summarized : " The AV @-@ 8B looks a lot like the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals . It just uses them a lot better " . A large cathode @-@ ray tube multi @-@ purpose display , taken from the F / A @-@ 18 , makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit . It has a wide range of functions , including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist . The pilots sit on UPC / <unk> 10B zero @-@ zero ejection seats , meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude . 
 = = = Airframe = = = 
 For the AV @-@ 8B , McDonnell Douglas redesigned the entire airframe of the Harrier , incorporating numerous structural and aerodynamic changes . To improve visibility and better accommodate the crew and avionics hardware , McDonnell Douglas elevated the cockpit by 10 @.@ 5 in ( 27 cm ) and redesigned the canopy . This improved the forward ( 17 ° down ) , side ( 60 ° ) , and rear visibility . The front fuselage is composed of a molded skin with an epoxy @-@ based core sandwiched between two carbon @-@ fiber sheets . To compensate for the changes in the front fuselage , the rear fuselage was extended by 18 in ( 46 cm ) , and the taller vertical stabilizer of the Sea Harrier was used . The tail assembly is made up of composites to reduce weight . 
 Perhaps the most thorough redesign was of the wing , the objective being to match the performance of the cancelled AV @-@ 16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV @-@ 8A . Engineers designed a new , one @-@ piece supercritical wing , which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift @-@ to @-@ drag ratio . Made of composites , the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV @-@ 8A . Compared to the AV @-@ 8A 's wing , it has a higher aspect ratio , reduced sweep ( from 40 ° to 37 ° ) , and an area increased from 200 sq ft ( 18 @.@ 6 m2 ) to 230 sq ft ( 21 @.@ 4 m2 ) . The wing has a high @-@ lift configuration , employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering , and drooped ailerons . Using the leading edge root extensions , the new wing allows for a 6 @,@ 700 lb ( 3 @,@ 035 kg ) increase in payload compared with the first @-@ generation Harriers after a 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) takeoff roll . Because the wing is almost exclusively composite , it is 330 lb ( 150 kg ) lighter than the AV @-@ 8A 's smaller wing . 
 The Harrier II was the first combat aircraft to extensively employ carbon @-@ fiber composite materials , exploiting their light weight and high strength ; they are used in the wings , rudder , flaps , nose , forward fuselage , and tail . Twenty @-@ six percent of the aircraft 's structure is made of composites , reducing its weight by 480 lb ( 217 kg ) compared to a conventional metal structure . 
 = = = Differences between versions = = = 
 Most of the first " day attack " AV @-@ 8B Harrier IIs were upgraded to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards , with the remainder being withdrawn from service . The AV @-@ 8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of Direct Voice Input ( DVI ) , which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft , using a system developed by Smiths Industries . The main attack avionics system in original aircraft was the nose @-@ mounted Hughes AN / ASB @-@ 19 angle @-@ rate bombing system . The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability . Defensive equipment include several AN / ALE @-@ 39 chaff @-@ flare dispensers , an AN / ALR @-@ 67 radar warning receiver , and an AN / ALQ @-@ 126C jammer pod . 
 The trainer version of the AV @-@ 8B is the TAV @-@ 8B , seating two pilots in tandem . Among other changes , the forward fuselage features a 3 ft 11 in ( 1 @.@ 19 m ) extension to accommodate the second cockpit . To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability , the vertical stabilizer 's area was enlarged through increases in chord ( length of the stabilizer 's root ) and height . USMC TAV @-@ 8Bs feature the AV @-@ 8B 's digital cockpit and new systems , but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable . Initial TAV @-@ 8Bs were powered by a 21 @,@ 450 lbf ( 95 @.@ 4 kN ) F402 @-@ RR @-@ <unk> engine , while later examples were fitted with the 23 @,@ 000 lbf ( 105 @.@ 8 kN ) F402 @-@ RR @-@ 408A . In the early 2000s , 17 TAV @-@ 8Bs were upgraded to include a night @-@ attack capability , the F402 @-@ RR @-@ 408 engine , and software and structural changes . 
 <unk> in 1991 , the Night Attack Harrier was the first upgrade of the AV @-@ 8B . It differed from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared ( FLIR ) camera added to the top of the nose cone , a wide Smiths Industries head @-@ up display ( HUD ) , provisions for night vision goggles , and a Honeywell digital moving map system . The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures . The variant was powered by the F402 @-@ RR @-@ 408 engine , which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable . The flare and chaff dispensers were moved , and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin 's base . Initially known as the AV @-@ 8D , the night @-@ attack variant was designated the AV @-@ 8B ( NA ) . 
 The Harrier II Plus is very similar to the Night Attack variant , with the addition of an APG @-@ 65 multi @-@ mode pulse @-@ Doppler radar in an extended nose , allowing it to launch advanced beyond @-@ visual @-@ range missiles such as the AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAM . To make additional space for the radar , the angle @-@ rate bombing system was removed . The radars used were taken from early F / A @-@ 18 aircraft , which had been upgraded with the related APG @-@ 73 . In addition to the AIM @-@ 120 , the AV @-@ 8B Plus can also carry AGM @-@ 65 Maverick and AGM @-@ 84 Harpoon missiles . According to aviation author Lon Nordeen , the changes " had a slight increase in drag and a bit of additional weight , but there really was not much difference in performance between the [ – 408 @-@ powered ] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft " .

 The AV @-@ 8B underwent standard evaluation to prepare for its USMC service . In the operational evaluation ( OPEVAL ) , lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985 , four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions . The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating , acquiring targets , delivering weapons , and evading and surviving enemy actions , all at the specified range and payload limits . The first phase of OPEVAL , running until 1 February 1985 , required the AV @-@ 8B to fly both deep and close air support missions ( deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces ) in concert with other close @-@ support aircraft , as well as flying battlefield interdiction and armed reconnaissance missions . The aircraft flew from military installations at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California , Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake in Canada , and MCAS Yuma in Arizona . 
 The second phase of OPEVAL , which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March , required the AV @-@ 8B to perform fighter escort , combat air patrol , and deck @-@ launched intercept missions . Although the evaluation identified shortfalls in the design ( subsequently rectified ) , OPEVAL was deemed successful . The AV @-@ 8B Harrier II reached initial operating capability ( IOC ) in January 1985 with USMC squadron VMA @-@ 331 . 
 The AV @-@ 8B saw extensive action in the Gulf War of 1990 – 91 . Aircraft based on USS Nassau and Tarawa , and at on @-@ shore bases , initially flew training and support sorties , as well as practicing with coalition forces . The AV @-@ 8Bs were to be held in reserve during the initial phase of the preparatory air assault of Operation Desert Storm . The AV @-@ 8B was first used in the war on the morning of 17 January 1991 , when a call for air support from an OV @-@ 10 Bronco forward air controller against Iraqi artillery that was shelling Khafji and an adjacent oil refinery , brought the AV @-@ 8B into combat . The following day , USMC AV @-@ 8Bs attacked Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait . Throughout the war , AV @-@ 8Bs performed armed reconnaissance and worked in concert with coalition forces to destroy targets . 
 During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm , 86 AV @-@ 8Bs amassed 3 @,@ 380 flights and about 4 @,@ 100 flight hours , with a mission availability rate of over 90 percent . Five AV @-@ 8Bs were lost to enemy surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles , and two USMC pilots were killed . The AV @-@ 8B had an attrition rate of 1 @.@ 5 aircraft for every 1 @,@ 000 sorties flown . US Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV @-@ 8B among the seven weapons — along with the F @-@ 117 Nighthawk and AH @-@ 64 Apache — that played a crucial role during the war . In the aftermath of the war , from 27 August 1992 , until 2003 , USMC AV @-@ 8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch . The AV @-@ 8Bs launched from amphibious assault ships in the Persian Gulf , and from forward operating bases such as Ali Al Salem Air Base , Kuwait . 
 In 1999 , the AV @-@ 8B participated in NATO 's bombing of Yugoslavia during Operation Allied Force . Twelve Harriers were split evenly between the 24th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units ( MEU ) . AV @-@ 8Bs of the 24th MEU were introduced into combat on 14 April , and over the next 14 days flew 34 combat air support missions over Kosovo . During their six @-@ month deployment aboard USS Nassau , 24th MEU Harriers averaged a high mission @-@ capable rate of 91 @.@ 8 percent . On 28 April , the 24th MEU was relieved by the 26th MEU , based on USS Kearsarge . The first combat sorties of the unit 's AV @-@ 8Bs occurred two days later , one aircraft being lost . The 26th MEU remained in the theater of operations until 28 May , when it was relocated to Brindisi , Italy . 
 USMC AV @-@ 8Bs took part in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001 . The USMC 15th MEU arrived off the coast of Pakistan in October 2001 . Operating from the unit 's ships , four AV @-@ 8Bs began attack missions into Afghanistan on 3 November 2001 . The 26th MEU and its AV @-@ 8Bs joined 15th MEU later that month . In December 2001 , AV @-@ 8Bs began moving into Afghanistan to a forward base at Kandahar . More AV @-@ 8Bs were deployed with other USMC units to the region in 2002 . The VMA @-@ 513 squadron deployed six Night Attack AV @-@ 8Bs to Bagram in October 2002 . These aircraft each carried a LITENING targeting pod to perform reconnaissance missions along with attack and other missions , primarily at night . 
 The aircraft participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 , acting primarily in support of USMC ground units . During the initial action , 60 AV @-@ 8Bs were deployed on ships such as the USS Bonhomme Richard and Bataan , from which over 1 @,@ 000 sorties were flown throughout the war . When possible , land @-@ based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations . USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B. <unk> said that the Harriers were able to provide 24 @-@ hour support for ground forces , and noted that " The airplane ... became the envy of pilots even from my background ... there 's an awful lot of things on the Harrier that I 've found the Hornet pilots asking me [ for ] ... We couldn 't have asked for a better record " . 
 USMC sources documented the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft availability record in the Iraq War ; in just under a month of combat , the aircraft flew over 2 @,@ 000 sorties . When used , the LITENING II targeting pod achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets . In a single sortie from USS Bonhomme Richard , a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a Republican Guard tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on Al Kut . Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks , one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod . Despite the Harrier 's high marks , the limited amount of time that each aircraft could remain on station , around 15 – 20 minutes , led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of AC @-@ 130 gunships , which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV @-@ 8B . AV @-@ 8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah . The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes . 
 On 20 March 2011 , USMC AV @-@ 8Bs were launched from USS Kearsarge in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn , enforcing the UN no @-@ fly zone over Libya . They carried out airstrikes on Sirte on 5 April 2011 . Multiple AV @-@ 8Bs were involved in the defense of a downed F @-@ 15E pilot , attacking approaching Libyans prior to the pilot 's extraction by a MV @-@ 22 Osprey . 
 In addition to major conflicts , USMC AV @-@ 8Bs have been deployed in support of contingency and humanitarian operations , providing fixed @-@ wing air cover and armed reconnaissance . The aircraft served in Somalia throughout the 1990s , Liberia ( 1990 , 1996 , and 2003 ) , Rwanda ( 1994 ) , Central African Republic ( 1996 ) , Albania ( 1997 ) , Zaire ( 1997 ) , and Sierra Leone ( 1997 ) . 
 The AV @-@ 8B is to be replaced by the F @-@ 35B version of the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II , which had been slated to enter service in 2012 . The USMC had sought a replacement since the 1980s , and has argued strongly in favor of the development of the F @-@ 35B . The Harrier 's performance in Iraq , including its ability to use forward operating bases , reinforced the need for a V / STOL aircraft in the USMC arsenal . 
 In November 2011 , the USN purchased the UK 's fleet of 72 retired BAe Harrier IIs ( 63 single @-@ seat <unk> / 9 / <unk> plus 9 twin @-@ seat <unk> / <unk> ) and replacement engines to provide spares for the existing USMC Harrier II fleet . Although the March 2012 issue of the magazine <unk> Monthly stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex @-@ British Harrier IIs , instead of using them just for spare parts , the Naval Air Systems Command ( NAVAIR ) has since stated that the USMC has never had any plans to operate those Harriers . 
 On 14 September 2012 , a Taliban raid destroyed six AV @-@ 8Bs and severely damaged two others while they were parked on the tarmac at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan 's Helmand Province . All of the aircraft belonged to VMA @-@ 211 . The two damaged AV @-@ 8Bs were flown out of Afghanistan in the hours after the attack . The attack was described as " the worst loss of U.S. airpower in a single incident since the Vietnam War . " The lost aircraft were quickly replaced by those from VMA @-@ 231 . 
 On 27 July 2014 , the USS Bataan began deploying USMC AV @-@ 8Bs over Iraq to provide surveillance of Islamic State ( IS ) forces . Surveillance operations continued after the start of Operation Inherent Resolve against IS militants . In early September 2014 , a USMC Harrier from the 22nd MEU struck an IS target near the Haditha Dam in Iraq , marking the first time a USMC unit dropped ordnance in the operation .

 In the late 1960s , following a demonstration of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier on the Italian Navy ( Marina Militare ) helicopter carrier Andrea Doria , the country began investigating the possibility of acquiring the Harrier . Early efforts were hindered by a 1937 Italian law that prohibited the navy from operating fixed @-@ wing aircraft because they were the domain of the air force . In early 1989 , the law was changed to allow the navy to operate any fixed @-@ wing aircraft with a maximum weight of over 3 @,@ 300 lb ( 1 @,@ 500 kg ) . Following a lengthy evaluation of the Sea Harrier and AV @-@ 8B , an order was placed for two TAV @-@ 8Bs in May 1989 . Soon , a contract for a further 16 AV @-@ 8B Plus aircraft was signed . After the TAV @-@ 8Bs and the first three AV @-@ 8Bs , all subsequent Italian Navy Harriers were locally assembled by Alenia Aeronautica from kits delivered from the U.S. The two @-@ seaters , the first to be delivered , arrived at Grottaglie in August 1991 . They were used for proving flights with the navy 's helicopter carriers and on the light aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi . 
 In early 1994 , the initial batch of US @-@ built aircraft arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training . The first Italian @-@ assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year . In mid @-@ January 1995 , Giuseppe Garibaldi set off from Taranto to Somalia , with three Harriers on board , to maintain stability following the withdrawal of UN forces . The Harriers , flown by five Italian pilots , accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three @-@ month deployment , performing reconnaissance and other missions . The squadron returned to port on 22 March . 
 In 1999 , Italian AV @-@ 8Bs were used for the first time in combat missions when they were deployed aboard Giuseppe Garibaldi , which was participating in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo . Italian pilots conducted more than 60 sorties alongside other NATO aircraft , attacking the Yugoslav army and paramilitary forces and bombing the country 's infrastructure with conventional and laser @-@ guided bombs ( LGB ) . 
 In 2000 , the Italian Navy was looking to acquire a further seven remanufactured aircraft to equip Giuseppe Garibaldi and a new carrier , Cavour . Existing aircraft , meanwhile , were updated to allow them to carry AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAMs and JDAM guided bombs . From November 2001 to March 2002 , eight AV @-@ 8Bs were embarked aboard Giuseppe Garibaldi and were deployed to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom . The aircraft , equipped with LGBs , operated throughout January and February 2002 , during which 131 missions were logged for a total of 647 flight hours . 
 In 2011 , Italian Harriers , operating from Giuseppe Garibaldi , worked alongside Italian <unk> and aircraft of other nations during Operation Unified Protector , as part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya . They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over Libya , using the LITENING targeting pods while armed with AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAMs and AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinders . In total , Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties : Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles , while the eight Italian Navy AV @-@ 8Bs flying from Giuseppe Garibaldi dropped 160 guided bombs during 1 @,@ 221 flight hours . 
 Italian Navy AV @-@ 8Bs are slated to be replaced by 15 ( originally 22 ) F @-@ 35Bs , which will form the air wing of Cavour . 
 = = = Spanish Navy = = = 
 Spain , already using the AV @-@ 8S Matador , became the first international operator of the AV @-@ 8B by signing an order for 12 aircraft in March 1983 . Designated VA @-@ 2 Matador II by the Spanish Navy ( Armada Española ) , this variant is known as EAV @-@ 8B by McDonnell Douglas . Pilot conversion took place in the US . On 6 October 1987 , the first three Matador IIs were delivered to Naval Station Rota . The new aircraft were painted in a two @-@ tone matt grey finish , similar to US Navy aircraft , and deliveries were complete by 1988 . 
 BAe test pilots cleared the aircraft carrier Príncipe de Asturias ' for Harrier operations in July 1989 . The carrier , which replaced the World War II @-@ era <unk> , has a 12 ° ski @-@ jump ramp . It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the 8a Escuadrilla . This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986 , following the sales of AV @-@ 8S Matadors to Thailand . Instead , 9a Escuadrilla was formed on 29 September 1987 , to become part of the Alpha Carrier Air Group and operate the EAV @-@ 8B . 
 In March 1993 , under the September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S. , Italy , and Spain , eight EAV @-@ 8B Plus Matadors were ordered , along with a twin @-@ seat TAV @-@ 8B . Deliveries of the Plus @-@ standard aircraft started in 1996 . On 11 May 2000 , Boeing and the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV @-@ 8Bs to bring them up to Plus standard . Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV @-@ 8Bs , with an option for another seven aircraft ; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft . The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAMs , enhanced the pilot 's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics , and provided a new engine . Eventually , five aircraft were modified , the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003 . 
 Spanish EAV @-@ 8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight , enforcing the UN 's no @-@ fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina . Spain did not send its aircraft carrier to participate in the Iraq War in 2003 , instead deploying F / A @-@ 18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks . Starting in 2007 , Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs – with the likely option being the F @-@ 35B . The Spanish government , in May 2014 however , announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft 's service life to beyond 2025 due to a lack of funds for a replacement aircraft . 
 Following the decommissioning of the Príncipe de Asturias in February 2013 , the sole naval platform from which Spanish Harrier IIs can operate is the Juan Carlos amphibious assault ship .

 During its service with the USMC , the Harrier has had an accident rate three times that of the Corps ' F / A @-@ 18s . As of July 2013 , approximately 110 aircraft have been damaged beyond repair since the type entered service in 1985 , the first accident occurring in March that year . The AV @-@ 8 was dubbed a " widow maker " by some in the military . The Los Angeles Times reported in 2003 that the Harrier family had the highest rate of major accidents among military aircraft in service at that time , with 148 accidents and 45 people killed . However , Lon Nordeen notes that several other USMC single @-@ engine strike aircraft , like the A @-@ 4 Skyhawk and A @-@ 7 Corsair II , had worse accident rates . 
 Accidents have in particular been connected to the proportionate amount of time the aircraft spends taking off and landing , which are the most critical phases in flight . Further analysis shows that US Marine senior officers never understood the uniqueness of the aircraft , that the Harrier design was more complex , like that of helicopters . Cutbacks in senior maintenance personnel and pilot mistakes had a disastrous effect on the safety of the American @-@ operated AV @-@ 8B , which gained it a negative reputation in the US press that was not deserved .

 = Tiger II = 
 Tiger II is the common name of a German heavy tank of the Second World War . The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf . B , often shortened to Tiger B. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 182 . It is also known under the informal name <unk> ( the German name for the Bengal tiger ) , often translated literally as Royal Tiger , or somewhat incorrectly as King Tiger by Allied soldiers , especially by American forces . 
 The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I , combining the latter 's thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank . The tank weighed almost 70 tonnes , and was protected by 100 to 185 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 3 in ) of armour to the front . It was armed with the long barrelled 8 @.@ 8 cm KwK 43 L / 71 anti @-@ tank cannon . The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless tank destroyer . 
 The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen @-@ SS . It was first used in combat with 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied Invasion of Normandy on 11 July 1944 ; on the Eastern Front , the first unit to be outfitted with Tiger IIs was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion , which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of a heavy tank design had been initiated in 1937 ; the initial design contract was awarded to Henschel . Another design contract followed in 1939 , and was given to Porsche . Both prototype series used the same turret design from Krupp ; the main differences were in the hull , transmission , suspension and automotive features . 
 The Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank . It had a rear mounted engine and used nine steel @-@ tired , eighty centimeter diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing , mounted on transverse torsion bars , in a similar manner to the original Henschel @-@ designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance , however , as when the same steel @-@ tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls , the wheels were only overlapping without being interleaved — the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber @-@ rimmed roadwheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half @-@ tracks used the interleaved design , later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger I and Panther . 
 The Porsche hull designs included a rear @-@ mounted turret and a mid @-@ mounted engine . The suspension was the same as on the Elefant tank destroyer . This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair ; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs . One Porsche version had a gasoline @-@ electric drive ( fundamentally identical to a Diesel @-@ electric transmission , only using a gasoline @-@ fueled engine as the prime mover ) , similar to a gasoline @-@ electric hybrid but without a storage battery ; two separate drive trains in parallel , one per side of the tank , each consisting of a hybrid drive train ; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket . This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger ( P ) ( later Elefant prototypes ) and in some US designs , but had never been put into production . The Porsche suspension were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers . Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives . Dr. Porsche 's unorthodox designs gathered little favour . 
 = = Design = = 
 Henschel won the design contract , and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm . Two turret designs were used in production vehicles . The initial design is often misleadingly called the " Porsche " turret due to the belief that it was designed by Porsche for their prototype ; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes . This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides , with a difficult @-@ to @-@ manufacture curved bulge on the turret 's left side to accommodate the commander 's cupola . Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel 's hull and used in action . The more common " production " turret , sometimes called the " Henschel " turret , was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face , no shot trap ( created by the curved face of the earlier turret ) , and less @-@ steeply sloped sides , which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander 's cupola , and added additional room for ammunition storage . 
 The turrets were designed to mount the 8 @.@ 8 cm KwK 43 L / 71 gun . Combined with the <unk> 9d ( German " turret telescopic sight " ) monocular sight by Leitz , which all but a few early Tiger IIs used , it was a very accurate and deadly weapon . During practice , the estimated probability of a first round hit on a 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) high , 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) wide target only dropped below 100 percent at ranges beyond 1 @,@ 000 m ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , to 95 – 97 percent at 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) and 85 – 87 percent at 2 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , depending on ammunition type . Recorded combat performance was lower , but still over 80 percent at 1 @,@ 000 m , in the 60s at 1 @,@ 500 m and the 40s at 2 @,@ 000 m . Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was 202 and 132 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 and 5 @.@ 2 in ) at 100 m ( 110 yd ) and 2 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) respectively for the <unk> 39 / 43 projectile ( PzGr — armour @-@ piercing shell ) , and 238 and 153 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 and 6 @.@ 0 in ) for the PzGr . 40 / 43 projectile between the same ranges . The <unk> 43 ( <unk> ) high @-@ explosive round was available for soft targets , or the <unk> or <unk> 39 ( <unk> — HEAT or High @-@ explosive anti @-@ tank warhead ) round , which had 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) penetration at any range , could be used as a dual @-@ purpose munition against soft or armoured targets . 
 Powered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer @-@ Sturm <unk> hydraulic motor , which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft . A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right . The turret could be rotated 360 degrees in 60 seconds in low gear independent of engine rpm , in 19 seconds with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm , and within 10 seconds at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm . The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through pedals , or a control lever near his left arm . If power was lost , such as when the tank ran out of fuel , the turret could be slowly traversed by hand , assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel . Two full turns of the wheel were necessary for a one degree turn of the turret , with a total of 720 turns for a full circle . The hydraulic system was not precise and gunners preferred to use the manual system to aim . 
 Like all German tanks , it had a petrol engine ; in this case the same 700 PS ( 690 hp , 515 kW ) V @-@ 12 Maybach HL 230 P30 which powered the much lighter Panther and Tiger I tanks . The Tiger II was under @-@ powered , like many other heavy tanks of World War II , and consumed a lot of fuel , which was in short supply for the Germans . The transmission was the Maybach <unk> EG 40 12 16 Model B , giving eight forward gears and four reverse , which drove the steering gear . This was the Henschel L 801 , a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure . Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side . <unk> 800 mm ( 31 in ) diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks . 
 Like the Tiger I , each tank was issued with two sets of tracks : a normal " battle track " and a narrower " transport " version used during rail movement . The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground . The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded . Ground pressure was 0 @.@ 76 kg / cm2 ( 10 @.@ 8 psi ) . 
 = = = Command variant = = = 
 The command variant of the Tiger II was designated Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf . B. It had two versions , Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268 . These carried only 63 rounds of 8 @.@ 8 cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment , and had additional armour on the engine compartment . The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets , with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a <unk> D ( " Star antenna D " ) , mounted on an insulated base ( the 105mm <unk> Nr. 1 ) , which was protected by a large armoured cylinder . This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep @-@ wading equipment . The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two @-@ metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1 @.@ 4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers . Orders were placed for 1 @,@ 500 Tiger IIs — slightly more than the 1 @,@ 347 Tiger I tanks produced — but Tiger II production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing . Among others , five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant . It is estimated that this caused the loss in production of some 657 Tiger IIs . Only 492 units were produced : one in 1943 , 379 in 1944 , and 112 in 1945 . Full production ran from mid @-@ 1944 to the end of the war . 
 The Tiger II served as the basis for one production variant , the Jagdtiger casemated tank destroyer , and a proposed Grille 17 / 21 / 30 / 42 self @-@ propelled mount for heavy guns that never reached production . 
 = = Proposed upgrades = = 
 The <unk> , an engine born from the developments initiated by attempting to convert the Maybach <unk> to fuel injection , would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS ( hp ) . The <unk> Panzer unanimously decided that <unk> be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program . The AK @-@ 7 @-@ 200 was also explored as an alternative to the <unk> @-@ B drive train , but <unk> research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the <unk> @-@ B was retained . Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon , the 10 @.@ 5 cm KwK L / 68 . Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself . Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights , a stabilised main gun , an automatic ammunition feed , a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder , heated crew compartment , stowage for an additional 12 rounds , and an overpressure and air filtration system to protect against poison gas , but these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended .

 = = = Reliability and mobility = = = 
 Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle . The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure . Lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front . 
 The Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung 501 ( s.H.Pz.Abt. 501 ) arrived on the Eastern Front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational ; these faults were mostly due to drive @-@ train failures . The first five Tiger IIs delivered to the Panzer Lehr Division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture . 
 The introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability . Statistics from 15 March 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the Tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the Panzer IV and better than the 48 percent of the Panther were operational by this period . 
 Not withstanding its initial reliability problems , the Tiger II was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle . Contemporary German records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most German or Allied tanks . 
 = = = Combat history = = = 
 The first combat use of the Tiger II was by the 1st Company of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion ( s.H.Pz.Abt. 503 ) during the Battle of Normandy , opposing Operation Atlantic between Troarn and <unk> on 18 July 1944 . Losses were : two from combat , plus the company commander 's tank , which became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during Operation Goodwood . 
 On the Eastern Front , it was first used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion ( s.H.Pz.Abt. 501 ) resisting the Lvov – Sandomierz Offensive . It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near <unk> <unk> . On the road to <unk> , three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T @-@ 34 @-@ 85s . Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions , which caused many crew fatalities , main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret , reducing capacity to 68 . Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st were lost in the area between 12 and 13 August to ambushes and flank attacks by Soviet T @-@ 34 @-@ 85 and IS @-@ 2 tanks , and ISU @-@ 122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain . 
 On 15 October 1944 , Tiger IIs of 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion played a crucial role during Operation <unk> , supporting Otto Skorzeny 's troops in taking the Hungarian capital of Budapest , which ensured that the country remained with the Axis until the end of the war . The 503rd then took part in the Battle of Debrecen . The 503rd remained in the Hungarian theater of operations for 166 days , during which it accounted for at least 121 Soviet tanks , 244 anti @-@ tank guns and artillery pieces , five aircraft and a train . This was set against the loss of 25 Tiger IIs ; ten were knocked out by Soviet troops and burned out , two were sent back to Vienna for a factory overhaul , while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons , usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands . Kurt <unk> , the highest scoring tank ace of all time ( 162 enemy AFVs destroyed ) , also served with the 503rd , and was killed in action on 29 April 1945 in his Tiger II . 
 The Tiger II was also present in the four heavy panzer battalions during the Ardennes Offensive of December 1944 , the Soviet Vistula – Oder and East Prussian Offensives in January 1945 , the German Lake Balaton Offensive in Hungary in March 1945 , the Battle of the Seelow Heights in April 1945 , and the Battle of Berlin at the end of the war . 
 The 103rd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion ( s.SS Pz.Abt. 503 ) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from January to April 1945 on the Eastern Front for the loss of 45 Tiger IIs ( most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel ) . 
 = = = Gun and armour performance = = = 
 The heavy armour and powerful long @-@ range gun gave the Tiger II an advantage against all opposing Western Allied and Soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on . This was especially true on the Western Front where , until the arrival of the few M26 <unk> in 1945 , neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service . A Wa Prüf 1 report estimated that the Tiger II 's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122 mm D @-@ 25T , the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side . On the other hand , an <unk> <unk> document of February 1945 estimated that the British QF 17 @-@ pounder ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) gun , using armour @-@ piercing discarding sabot shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II 's turret and nose ( lower front hull ) at 1 @,@ 100 and 1 @,@ 200 yd ( 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 100 m ) respectively although , given the lack of a stated angle , this is presumably at the ideal 90 degrees angle . As a result of its thick frontal armour , flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour , giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements . Moreover , the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns . 
 = = = Soviet wartime testing = = = 
 During August 1944 , two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near Sandomierz , and were soon moved to the testing grounds at Kubinka . During the transfer , the two tanks suffered from various mechanical break downs ; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot climatic conditions , where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox . The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced , and its full functionality could not be re @-@ established . The tank broke down again every 10 – 15 km . The 8 @.@ 8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy , which were on par with the 122 mm D @-@ 25T . It proved capable of passing completely through its " colleague " , a Tiger Ausf B 's turret at a range of 400 m . The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152 mm calibre . The welding was , despite careful workmanship , significantly worse than on similar designs . As a result , even when shells did not penetrate the armour , there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates , which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable . Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks , such as the Tiger I and Panther . Analysis of the Tiger Ausf B armour plate showed an absence of molybdenum ( ascribed to a loss of supply , being replaced by vanadium ) , giving the armour low malleability . 
 The expanded firing test states that the <unk> projectiles from the 100 mm BS @-@ 3 and 122 mm A @-@ 19 gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B 's turret at ranges of 1000 – 1500 metres , which suggests a quality factor of 0 @.@ 86 for the Tiger Ausf B 's turret . The firing test against the Tiger B turret front , however , was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet , and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings , such as vision slits and gun location . The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100 mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage . The tank 's hull and turret side plates were penetrated by <unk> shot from domestic 85 mm and American 76 mm guns at ranges of 800 – 2 @,@ 000 m ( 2 @,@ 600 – 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . The 100 mm BS @-@ 3 and 122 mm A @-@ 19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500 – 600 metres after 3 – 4 shots . 
 Despite the wartime testing , there is no reliable evidence that the front armour of the King Tiger had ever been penetrated in combat .

 = Ambrose Dudley , 3rd Earl of Warwick = 
 Ambrose Dudley , 3rd Earl of Warwick , KG ( c . 1530 – 21 February 1590 ) was an English nobleman and general , and an elder brother of Queen Elizabeth I 's favourite , Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester . Their father was John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland , who led the English government from 1550 – 1553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King 's death in July 1553 . For his participation in this venture Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death . <unk> , his rehabilitation came after he fought for Philip II of Spain ( then England 's co @-@ monarch ) in the Battle of St. Quentin . 
 On Queen Elizabeth 's accession in November 1558 Dudley was appointed Master of the Ordnance , in which capacity he was to unofficially assist William the Silent in his struggle against Spain by delivering English weaponry . As the senior member of his family , Dudley was created Earl of Warwick in December 1561 . In 1562 – 1563 he commanded the army Elizabeth sent to Le Havre to garrison the town and assist the Huguenots in the First French War of Religion . This campaign ended in failure when the French belligerents agreed on a peace and the English surrendered because of the plague which was decimating their ranks . Dudley , who had acted honorably throughout , returned with a severe leg wound which was to hinder his further career and ultimately led to his death 27 years later . His last military engagement was against the Northern rebels in 1569 . From 1573 he served as a privy councillor . 
 Despite three marriages , Ambrose Dudley remained childless after the death of an infant daughter in 1552 . This had serious repercussions for the survival of his dynasty , since his only surviving brother Robert equally died without legitimate issue . With him , Ambrose Dudley had a very close relationship , and in business and personal life they did many things together . Like Robert Dudley , Ambrose was a major patron of the Elizabethan Puritan movement and supported non @-@ conforming preachers in their struggle with the Church authorities . Due to his homely way of life — and in contrast to the colourful Earl of Leicester — Ambrose Dudley became known to posterity as the " Good Earl of Warwick " . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Ambrose Dudley was the fourth son of Sir John Dudley , later Viscount Lisle , Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland , and his wife Jane Guildford . The Dudleys had 13 children in all and were known for their Protestant leanings as well as for their happy family life . Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by , among others , the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson . In August 1549 Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett . Back in London , Dudley was knighted and married Anne <unk> , daughter of William <unk> , deceased Attorney @-@ General . In 1552 they had a daughter who died soon . Anne also died in 1552 of the sweating sickness . Dudley soon married for the second time : Elizabeth Lady Tailboys ( or <unk> , 1520 – 1563 ) , who was a baroness in her own right with large possessions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire . 
 After the death of King Edward VI on 6 July 1553 , John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland , who had led the young King 's government for the last three and a half years , tried to install his daughter @-@ in @-@ law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne ; she was the King 's Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown , bypassing his half @-@ sisters Mary and Elizabeth . When Mary Tudor asserted her right to the throne , an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable . Northumberland marched on 14 July , accompanied by his eldest sons , John and Ambrose . Five days later the Privy Council changed sides ; on hearing this on 20 July , Northumberland , who had been staying at Cambridge , gave up and was arrested with his party the next day . 
 Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London with his father and his four brothers . All were attainted and condemned to death , but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley , the second youngest brother , were executed . After the natural death of John , the eldest brother , in October 1554 , Ambrose Dudley was the family 's heir ; he remained longest in the Tower , being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife , Lady Tailboys . On the whole , the brothers ' release was brought about by their mother and their brother @-@ in @-@ law Henry Sidney , who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England 's new co @-@ ruler and king consort , Philip of Spain . Out of prison , in December 1554 or January 1555 , Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo @-@ Spanish friendship . 
 Also in January 1555 , Dudley 's mother died , leaving him her lands , which Queen Mary allowed him to inherit despite his attainder . However , the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there ; later in 1555 they were even ordered out of London and the next year , in the wake of a conspiracy by their distant cousin Henry Sutton Dudley , the French ambassador Antoine de Noailles reported that the government was seeking to apprehend " the children of the Duke of Northumberland " , who were said to be on the run . By January 1557 , the brothers were raising personal contingents in order to fight for Philip II , now also King of Spain . Ambrose , Robert , and Henry Dudley joined the Spanish forces in France and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin , where Henry Dudley was killed . For these services the two surviving brothers were restored in blood by Act of Parliament in 1558 . The cost of the campaign almost bankrupted Ambrose Dudley and his wife , however , so that they had to reduce their household significantly .

 With the accession of Elizabeth I in November 1558 , Robert Dudley came into great favour and was made Master of the Horse . Ambrose Dudley received the post of Master of the Ordnance , though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat , so that he could not be held accountable for his predecessor 's embezzlement of funds . When their attainder had been lifted in 1558 , the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father 's possessions or titles . Yet on 25 and 26 December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick , and the next year received a large portion of the lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland . Warwick Castle — which the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progress — became his seat , while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley . Like their father , Ambrose and Robert Dudley adopted the bear and ragged staff , the heraldic device of the medieval Earls of Warwick . 
 In 1562 the First War of Religion started in France , and Elizabeth was under pressure from her Protestant councillors to help the Huguenots . These were in possession of Le Havre , which was besieged by the Catholic Duke of Guise , and offered it to the English in return for military help — later , they promised , they would exchange it for Calais , which England had lost to France only in 1558 . Elizabeth agreed to send 6 @,@ 000 men to garrison Le Havre . Ambrose Dudley was chosen to lead the expedition in place of Robert Dudley , whom Elizabeth would not let go despite his strong desire to do so . 
 Warwick arrived at Le Havre in late October 1562 . He was sceptical from the start as to the chances to hold Le Havre , writing : " I fear [ you ] are too much abused in the good opinion you have in the strength of this town " . Elizabeth soon made it clear that she did not wish his army to engage in any active support for the Huguenot side , the purpose of the English contribution remaining somewhat obscure . In March 1563 the warring French agreed to a peace , while Elizabeth decided to hold on to Le Havre until Calais was returned to the English , as had been agreed with the Huguenot party . The reconciled French , however , turned jointly against the English garrison . Le Havre 's fortifications would have needed major expansion and repair to withstand a prolonged siege . Still , Dudley tried his best until the town 's walls were crumbling under French bombardment and the Queen permitted him to surrender honourably in July 1563 on account of the plague that was decimating his troops . Ambrose Dudley himself had been shot in the leg when parleying with the French and returned to England seriously ill . He wrote to his brother that he was happy " rather to end my life upon the breach than in any sickness . ... Farewell my dear and loving brother , a thousand times . " Robert Dudley went to welcome him at Portsmouth despite the plague and much to Elizabeth 's annoyance . 
 Politically the expedition had been a disaster , yet Warwick gained recognition for his leadership since morale had been high and the civilian population had been treated with unusual respect . The Earl 's rewards were the Welsh lordship of Ruthin and the Order of the Garter , which was awarded to him while still in France in April 1563 . His war injury — which never properly healed — made him ineligible for posts like Lord President of the Council of the North or Lord Deputy of Ireland when they were suggested for him in the future . Elizabeth Lady Tailboys had also died while her husband was in France , and on 11 November 1565 Ambrose Dudley married for the third time . His bride was the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Anne Russell , daughter of Francis Russell , 2nd Earl of Bedford . Robert Dudley , meanwhile Earl of Leicester , had arranged the match . It was an extraordinary court event . In between tournaments and banquets , the bride was given away by the Earl of Leicester in the presence of the Queen ; she later became one of Elizabeth 's closest friends . 
 In November 1569 the Northern Rebellion broke out with the aim to install Mary , Queen of Scots ( who was in English captivity ) on the English throne . The Earl of Warwick was one of the commanders appointed to march against the revolt , which was disintegrating rapidly , though . Due to his bad health Warwick was soon allowed to return to his Midlands estates . In January 1570 Robert , Earl of Leicester saw his <unk> brother at Kenilworth and reported to Elizabeth : " all this hard weather [ he ] hath every day travelled on horse , Your Majesty 's service hath made him forget his pain ... assuredly he is marvellous weary , though in my judgment it hath done his body much good " . 
 As Master of the Ordnance Warwick presided over an increasingly important government department , which centrally managed the storage and commissioning of the state 's artillery , munitions , and small arms . Prince William of Orange valued English cannons , and Warwick — who fervently believed in the international Protestant cause — seems willingly to have supplied him with what he wanted . The Spanish ambassador officially protested against this practice in 1576 , since the weapons would have been used against Spanish rule in the Netherlands . In 1573 Warwick was admitted to the Privy Council . His attendance to business was quite regular until it declined sharply due to his deteriorating health in the 1580s . At the 1587 trial of Mary Stuart he acted as a commissioner and was asked by the Scottish Queen to plead for her with his brother , the absent Earl of Leicester . The day sentence was pronounced on her , Warwick did not attend . 
 = = Private nobleman = = 
 Ambrose Dudley became one of the leading patrons of moderate Puritanism , the principal concern of which was the furtherance of preaching . Discouraged by the official Church , this was largely dependent on private initiatives by influential noblemen . In 1567 the two Dudley earls , together with local gentry , founded a consortium which provided for " the preachers of the Gospel in the county of Warwick . " Ambrose Dudley also helped the preacher John Field when he got into trouble over a subversive book he had published in 1565 ; and when he was imprisoned in 1572 , Leicester and Warwick worked his transfer into comfortable confinement in a London alderman 's house before he was released altogether by his patrons ' means . Like his brother , Ambrose Dudley invested in exploration and privateering voyages ; in Martin Frobisher 's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage he was the principal patron , although he contributed only the relatively modest sum of £ 50 . 
 The two Dudley brothers were on the closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert : " there is no man [ that ] knoweth his doings better than I myself " , while Robert 's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was : " him I love as myself " . Elizabeth , who liked Warwick , loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brother — and stouter as well . Lacking a grand London residence of his own , Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House : " the Lord of Warwick 's bedchamber , the Lord of Warwick 's closet , the Lord of Warwick 's dining parlour " . In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers , while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families . Privately , they were " almost inseparable " , passing time together whenever possible . When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen 's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor @-@ General in 1586 , Ambrose wrote to him : " if I were you ... I would go to the furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again . ... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do , for that I mean to take such part as you do . " 
 After his first marriage Ambrose Dudley remained childless . His second wife , Elizabeth Tailboys , suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555 . Anne Russell , though nearly 20 years her husband 's junior , turned out to be a congenial partner . Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls , John Talbot , 1st Earl of Shrewsbury , and Richard Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick . The Beauchamp descent especially — which was represented by the earldom of Warwick — filled them with pride . Ambrose 's childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley , who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen 's displeasure , and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588 . Most of Leicester 's estate — and debts — passed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime . He also took care of his deceased brother 's illegitimate teenage son Robert , who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick 's death . 
 From the 1570s the Earl of Warwick often resided at North Hall , his house in <unk> , Hertfordshire . He travelled little as he was often unable to move about , having " no use of his legs " . At the end of January 1590 he finally had his gangrenous leg amputated ; as a consequence he died at Bedford House in the Strand , London , on 21 February . Two days before , the diplomat Sir Edward Stafford visited him and described his spasms and pain " which lasted him unto his death " . He also saw the Countess sitting " by the fire so full of tears that she could not speak " . The Earl of Warwick was buried in the Beauchamp Chapel of Collegiate Church of St Mary , Warwick , in the vicinity of his ancestor Richard Beauchamp , his brother Robert , and his little nephew Robert Dudley , Lord Denbigh , Leicester 's son who during his short life had been heir to both Dudley earldoms . Ambrose Dudley 's widow commissioned his monument , but on her request was buried with her ancestors in <unk> , Buckinghamshire , when she died in 1604 . Ambrose Dudley entered tradition as the " Good Earl of Warwick " ; this probably came about through his quiet life style , which contrasted with the colourful persona of his brother , the Queen 's favourite .

 = 2005 North Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 2005 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was destructive and deadly to southern India , although most storms were weak . The basin covers the Indian Ocean north of the equator as well as inland areas , sub @-@ divided by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal . Although the season began early with two systems in January , the bulk of activity was confined from September to December . The official India Meteorological Department tracked 12 depressions in the basin , and the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) monitored two additional storms . Three systems intensified into a cyclonic storm , which have sustained winds of at least 63 km / h ( 39 mph ) , at which point the IMD named them . 
 The first official storm of the season was Cyclonic Storm Hibaru , which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January . After nearly five months of inactivity , two depressions formed toward the end of June on opposite sides of India . The depression in the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year , the other of which formed in September and killed 13 people . The other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26 people in Madhya Pradesh , followed by another depression in July that killed one person . A series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September ; a depression killed six people in Madhya Pradesh , Cyclonic Storm Pyarr killed 80 people , an unclassified tropical storm killed 16 people in nearby Bangladesh , and a deep depression in October killed 100 people in Andhra Pradesh . December was active , with cyclonic storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India , resulting in 11 fatalities , and a deep depression remaining over waters in the middle of the month . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 During the season , the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) tracked cyclonic disturbances in the region , as part of them being the designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center , covering the waters north of the Indian Ocean north of the equator from 45 ° E to 100 ° E. The activity was separated between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea , although there were no cyclonic storms in the latter region . The tropical systems were tracked using satellite imagery and the Dvorak technique , while forecasts were based on cyclone models . There were a total of 12 depressions during the year , three less than normal , although the highest since 1992 . The IMD named four cyclonic storms , a process they initiated in 2004 , which was also below normal . No systems strengthened beyond cyclonic storm status . 
 The season was the sixth in a row with below normal activity , based on the seasonal accumulated cyclone energy . Storms generally develop when the monsoon trough is located over tropical waters , with a peak from May to June and another peak in November . The monsoon developed 11 distinct low pressure areas by the end of September , including five monsoon depressions , and the monsoon season was more active than usual .

 = = = Cyclonic Storm Hibaru = = = 
 An area of convection formed at a low latitude to the southeast of Sri Lanka on January 10 , located within a broad trough and in an area of low wind shear . Over the next few days , the convection consolidated as an elongated circulation became evident . On January 13 , the IMD designated the system as a depression . The system organized further and developed rainbands . A ridge to the north caused the depression to move erratically and remain generally stationary . The IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression on January 14 , the same day that the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 02B . On the next day , the IMD upgraded it further to Cyclonic Storm Hibaru , estimating winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , marking an unusual occasion for such a low @-@ latitude storm in January . Drifting southward , the circulation gradually became exposed from the convection , indicative of the weakening . Hibaru degenerated into a remnant low on January 17 . 
 = = = Land Depression 01 = = = 
 Early on June 27 , a low pressure area formed over the extreme northwestern portion of the Bay of Bengal . Soon after it moved ashore near Kolkata , and the system organized into a depression over West Bengal with winds of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . For several days the system maintained its intensity while moving northwestward , stalling on July 1 for three days over Madhya Pradesh . It later turned to the northeast and dissipated over Uttar Pradesh on July 6 . 
 The depression produced widespread rainfall across eastern India . Sagar , Madhya Pradesh recorded 480 mm ( 19 in ) in 24 hours , the highest daily total . The rains helped cut India 's rainfall deficit by enhancing the monsoon . Rains first affected Odisha , where rivers overflowed and inundated adjacent crop fields . As the storm stalled over Madhya Pradesh , it produced widespread flooding that isolated 129 villages , killing 26 people . Over a four @-@ day period , nearly 900 mm ( 35 in ) of rain fell across parts of the <unk> district . The floods cut off communications , washed away a bridge , and damaged many roads . 
 = = = Cyclonic Storm Pyarr = = = 
 A tropical depression developed in the South China Sea on September 12 and moved westward into central Vietnam on the next day . Continuing through Laos and Thailand , the system emerged into the northern Andaman Sea on September 15 . Tracked continuously as a depression by the Thai Meteorological Department , it was classified as a depression by the IMD on September 17 west of Myanmar . On the next day , the system intensified into a deep depression and later cyclonic storm , whereupon the IMD named it Pyarr . It was the first cyclonic storm in the month in seven years . Attaining peak winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , the storm took an unusual track to the southwest . On September 19 , Pyarr made landfall just northeast of Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh . It turned westward and weakened over land , deteriorating into a remnant low on September 22 over Madhya Pradesh . 
 As a depression , the system produced damaging swells along coastal Bangladesh , forcing 12 @,@ 000 people to evacuate . Offshore , an estimated 9 @,@ 000 fishermen in roughly 600 vessels were caught in the storm ; 15 – 20 of these ships capsized with 85 people collectively aboard . At least 16 were known to have died . Torrential rainfall affected eastern coastal India , with a daily peak of 490 mm ( 19 in ) in <unk> . The rains caused rivers to rise , forcing 36 @,@ 000 people to evacuate after 315 villages were affected . The floods killed 10 @,@ 000 cattle and killed four people in <unk> . Pyarr also wrecked 482 @,@ 188 ha ( 1 @,@ 191 @,@ 510 acres ) of crop fields . In Andhra Pradesh , the storm damaged or destroyed 12 @,@ 041 houses , with overall damage estimated at ₹ 503 million ( 2005 Indian rupees , $ 11 @.@ 4 million United States dollars ) . More than 140 @,@ 000 people were forced to relocate after the Godavari and Krishna rivers burst their banks and caused tremendous flooding . At least 64 people died across Andhra and Odisha <unk> .

 A low pressure area formed in the western Bay of Bengal on October 25 . It had a well @-@ defined circulation , helped by low wind shear and good outflow . The IMD classified it as a depression on October 26 , and later that day upgraded it to a deep depression . Moving northwestward , the system moved ashore near <unk> , Andhra Pradesh early on October 28 . The depression rapidly weakened over land , degenerating into a remnant low the next day . 
 Heavy rainfall affected coastal Andhra Pradesh , with a daily peak of 350 mm ( 14 in ) in Kavali . In Tamil Nadu to the south , Chennai recorded 420 mm ( 17 in ) of rainfall . The storm brought several days of heavy rainfall to southern India , forcing 50 @,@ 000 people to evacuate . Low @-@ lying areas of Chennai were inundated , disrupting travel by road , rail , and air , and causing schools to close . A car was washed away , killing three people in the city . Two people in Chennai were electrocuted , and the provincial electric board shut off power in heavily flooded areas . The rains flooded 194 @,@ 423 ha ( 480 @,@ 430 acres ) of crop fields and inundated many rail lines . Across Andhra Pradesh , 1 @,@ 045 houses collapsed , and the rains killed at least 100 people . 
 = = = Cyclonic Storm Baaz = = = 
 An area of convection formed on November 26 in the eastern Bay of Bengal within an area of moderate wind shear . As the shear decreased , the convection organized about a developing circulation . On November 27 , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 07B , and the next day , the IMD classified it as a depression . That day , the agency quickly upgraded it to Cyclonic Storm Baaz . By that time , the storm was moving steadily westward due to a ridge to the north . On November 29 , the IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Increasing wind shear weakened Baaz on December 1 , in conjunction with the storm turning to the west @-@ northwest . The storm quickly deteriorated , and the IMD downgraded it to a remnant low on December 2 , the same day that the JTWC issued their final advisory . The remnants continued to the west , eventually crossing the Indian coast north of Pondicherry on December 3 . 
 The precursor to the storm brought heavy rainfall to southern Thailand , reaching 417 mm ( 16 @.@ 4 in ) in Ko Samui . The rains killed 11 people in the country and caused ฿ 400 million ( Thai baht , $ 10 million USD ) in damage . The remnants also dropped heavy rainfall in southern India , with a daily peak of 310 mm ( 12 in ) in Tambaram . The rains flooded several villages in Tamil Nadu , killing 11 people . 
 = = = Cyclonic Storm Fanoos = = = 
 A low pressure area developed on December 4 in the south Andaman Sea . It consisted of a circulation with increasingly organized convection . The system moved west @-@ southwestward through the Bay of Bengal due to a ridge to the north , organizing into a depression two days later . That day , the JTWC also classified it as Tropical Cyclone 06B . Moderate wind shear allowed the system to strengthen further , and the IMD classified it as Cyclonic Storm Fanoos early on December 7 . Later that day , the agency estimated peak 3 minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Two days later , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) as the storm bypassed northern Sri Lanka . Wind shear and proximity to land weakened Fanoos into a deep depression on December 10 , and shortly after it made landfall on eastern Tamil Nadu near Vedaranyam . The IMD downgraded the storm to a remnant low pressure area later that day , although the JTWC tracked the storm across southern India into the Arabian Sea ; the agency stopped following Fanoos on December 12 . 
 The threat of the storm necessitated fishermen to remain at port , while 25 @,@ 000 people evacuated to shelters . The final landfalling storm of the season , Fanoos brought heavy rainfall to Tamil Nadu , with a daily peak of 350 mm ( 14 in ) in Ramanathapuram . The rains heavily damaged crops across Tamil Nadu , although damage was less than expected . It was the fifth storm to affect southern India in six weeks . 
 = = = Deep Depression BOB 08 = = = 
 An area of convection formed on December 14 over the Bay of Bengal with a broad circulation . It was in an area of low wind shear , which allowed for slow development , and it became a depression on December 15 . A ridge to the north steered the system to the northwest and later to the west . On December 17 , the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 07B , the same day that the IMD upgraded it to a deep depression with peak 3 minute winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . On the next day , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Increasing wind shear prevented further development as the storm turned to the north , keeping it east of Sri Lanka . An approaching trough turned the weakening system to the northeast on December 21 , and the next day the IMD downgraded it to a remnant low in the central Bay of Bengal . The outskirts of the system brushed Chennai , with the city receiving 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) of rainfall , although there was no reported damage .

 The JTWC tracked a short @-@ lived depression in early January . The system formed southeast of Sri Lanka on January 7 , days before Hibaru formed . It remained weak as it drifted northward with peak winds of only 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . The depression dissipated on January 10 . In the middle of June , an area of convection formed along the monsoon offshore the Saurashtra region of western India . On June 21 , a depression developed with winds of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . Moving to the west @-@ northwest , it dissipated on June 22 , bringing light rainfall up to 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in Gujarat . In late July , a low pressure area formed in the northwest Bay of Bengal , organizing into a depression on July 29 . The system remained nearly stationary just offshore West Bengal . On July 30 , the depression intensified into a deep depression . Shortly thereafter , the system moved ashore near Balasore , Odisha . It moved west @-@ northwestward over land , dissipating on July 31 . The depression dropped widespread rainfall , peaking at 490 mm ( 19 in ) in Chandabali . The rains swelled rivers and flooded fields , affecting many roadways . One person died after a wall collapsed . 
 On September 10 , a low pressure area formed in the northwestern Bay of Bengal . Moving to the northwest , it organized into a depression on September 12 , and soon after made landfall near Paradip , Odisha with winds of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . It continued through northeastern India , weakening into a remnant low over Uttar Pradesh on September 17 . The depression brought heavy rainfall to eastern India , with a daily peak of 300 mm ( 12 in ) in <unk> . Across Odisha , the rains inundated 75 @,@ 943 ha ( 187 @,@ 660 acres ) of crop fields , and later killed six people after flooding villages in Madhya Pradesh . Another low pressure area formed south of Gujarat on September 13 , developing into a depression the next day . It moved slowly to the northwest at first before turning to the east , never attaining wind speeds higher than 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . Late on September 16 , the depression struck Gujarat just north of Porbandar and rapidly weakened over land . The system brought rainfall and gusty winds that killed 13 people . 
 An area of convection formed on October 1 southeast of India . It was located in an area of moderate wind shear . The system moved to the northeast , developing more convection over the circulation . On October 2 , the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 03B , although the IMD never issued warnings on the system . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Early on October 3 , the storm moved ashore just south of Kolkata , and dissipated soon after . Heavy rains swamped portions of northern Bangladesh causing tremendous flooding that destroyed more than 100 @,@ 000 mud @-@ built homes . Government officials estimated that 1 @.@ 5 million people were rendered homeless . Floods also damaged 200 @,@ 000 hectares ( 500 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops and 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) of roads . At least 16 people were killed while waterborne diseases in the aftermath threatened to kill dozens more . 
 A low pressure area formed in the western Bay of Bengal on November 19 . Moving to the west @-@ northwest , it concentrated into a depression on the next day . On November 22 , it crossed over Sri Lanka and later degenerated into a remnant low over the Gulf of Mannar , never reaching winds beyond 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) .

 = Murder of Huang Na = 
 Huang Na ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Huáng Nà , 26 September 1996 – 10 October 2004 ) was an eight @-@ year @-@ old Chinese national living at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre in Singapore , who disappeared on 10 October 2004 . Her mother , the police and the community conducted a three @-@ week @-@ long nationwide search for her . After her body was found , many Singaporeans attended her wake and funeral , giving bai jin ( contributions towards funeral expenses ) and gifts . In a high @-@ profile 14 @-@ day trial , Malaysian @-@ born Took Leng How ( <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ) , a vegetable packer at the wholesale centre , was found guilty of murdering her and hanged after an appeal and a request for presidential clemency failed . 
 = = Background = = 
 Huang Na 's father , Huang <unk> , and mother , Huang Shuying ( <unk> ) , were both born in 1973 to farming families in Putian city in Fujian , China . They met in 1995 and married soon after , as Shuying was pregnant with Huang Na . In 1996 , <unk> left China to seek his fortune in Singapore and worked illegally as a vegetable packer at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre . When Shuying found out that he was having affairs in Singapore , she divorced him and was given custody of Huang Na . She later married Zheng <unk> ( <unk> ) , a Fujian businessman with whom she had lived for four years , and became pregnant with his child in early 2003 . 
 In May 2003 , Shuying immigrated to Singapore as a <unk> mama accompanying Huang Na , who was enrolled in Jin Tai Primary School . They lived at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre , where Shuying worked . People from the wholesale centre and Jin Tai Primary School described Huang Na as an intelligent , independent , sociable and active child . Huang Na became friends with Took Leng How , a vegetable packer at the wholesale centre . Born in Malaysia in 1981 as the second child of a close @-@ knit family of four , Took came to Singapore when he was 18 , seeking better @-@ paying jobs . At the wholesale centre , he often played with Huang Na , bought her food and gave her rides on his motorcycle . 
 = = Disappearance and reaction = = 
 Huang Na went missing on 10 October 2004 ; she was last seen at a food court near the wholesale centre , barefoot and wearing a blue denim jacket and <unk> shorts . From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks , Shuying looked across the island for her daughter . The police , including a Criminal Investigation Department team , conducted an intensive search for the girl , and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds . Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library , a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons , distributed over 70 @,@ 000 leaflets appealing for information . Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S $ 10 @,@ 000 and S $ 5 @,@ 000 for finding Huang Na , while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip @-@ offs . The search even extended to Malaysia , with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur . 
 On 19 and 20 October , Singaporean police questioned Took as part of their investigations ; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl . After questioning Took , police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test . On the way , they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal . While eating , Took said he needed to go to the toilet , escaped , took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia . Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October , confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide @-@ and @-@ seek in a storeroom . The following day , Huang Na 's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park , and Took was charged with her murder . Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free . Thousands attended Huang Na 's wake and funeral ; some gave bai jin and gifts , such as sweets , flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise . However , some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl 's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her . Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations . 
 = = Trial of Took = = 
 The 14 @-@ day trial of Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court . The prosecution relied on 76 witnesses , a video in which Took re @-@ enacted the murder , forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na 's head . Based on the evidence , the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom , then stripped and sexually assaulted her . After smothering and stomping on her to ensure her death , he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box . The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility . Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic , as some of his behaviour , such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits , was inappropriate and he had no motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took 's story about the three Chinese men a delusion . 
 On 27 August 2005 , Justice Lai ruled that Took was guilty of murder and sentenced him to death . In his judgement , Justice Lai noted that Took had no history of mental abnormality , the behaviour the defence cited was " not necessarily abnormal " and the murder was " clearly the product of a cold and calculating mind " .

 = Martin Bormann = 
 Martin Bormann ( 17 June 1900 – 2 May 1945 ) was a prominent official in Nazi Germany as head of the Parteikanzlei ( Nazi Party Chancellery ) . He gained immense power within the Third Reich by using his position as Adolf Hitler 's private secretary to control the flow of information and access to Hitler . 
 Bormann joined a paramilitary Freikorps organisation in 1922 while working as manager of a large estate . He served nearly a year in prison as an accomplice to his friend Rudolf Höss ( later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp ) in the murder of Walther Kadow . Bormann joined the Nazi Party in 1927 and the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) in 1937 . He initially worked in the party 's insurance service , and transferred in July 1933 to the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess , where he served as chief of staff . 
 Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself as much as possible in the decision making . He gained acceptance into Hitler 's inner circle , and accompanied him everywhere , providing briefings and summaries of events and requests . He began acting as Hitler 's personal secretary in 1935 , a post to which he was officially appointed in 1943 . After Hess ' solo flight to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government , Bormann assumed Hess ' former duties , with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei ( Party Chancellery ) . He had final approval over civil service appointments , reviewed and approved legislation , and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters . Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II . 
 Bormann returned with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city . After Hitler committed suicide , Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets . Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station . The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945 , but was not found and confirmed as genuine until 1972 . Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946 . He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in <unk> ( now in Saxony @-@ Anhalt ) in the Kingdom of Prussia in the German Empire , Bormann was the son of Theodor Bormann ( 1862 – 1903 ) , a post office employee , and his second wife , Antonie <unk> <unk> . The family was Lutheran . He had two half @-@ siblings ( Else and Walter Bormann ) from his father 's earlier marriage to Louise Grobler , who died in 1898 . Antonie Bormann gave birth to three sons , one of whom died in infancy . Martin ( born 1900 ) and Albert ( born 1902 ) survived to adulthood . Theodor died when Bormann was three , and his mother soon remarried . 
 Bormann 's studies at an agricultural trade high school were interrupted when he joined the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918 , in the last days of World War I. He never saw action , but served garrison duty until February 1919 . After working a short time in a cattle feed mill , Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg . Shortly after starting work at the estate , Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association . While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless , foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable . Many estates , including Bormann 's , had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging . Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard <unk> in 1922 , acting as section leader and treasurer . 
 On 17 March 1924 Bormann was sentenced to a year in <unk> Prison as an accomplice to his friend Rudolf Höss in the murder of Walther Kadow . The perpetrators believed Kadow had tipped off the French occupation authorities in the Ruhr District that fellow Freikorps member Albert Leo Schlageter was carrying out sabotage operations against French industries . Schlageter was arrested and was executed on 23 May 1923 . On the night of 31 May , Höss , Bormann and several others took Kadow into a meadow out of town , where he was beaten and his throat cut . After one of the perpetrators confessed , police dug up the body and laid charges in July . Bormann was released from prison in February 1925 . He joined the <unk> , a short @-@ lived NSDAP paramilitary organisation created to replace the Sturmabteilung ( SA ; storm detachment or assault division ) , which had been banned in the aftermath of the failed Munich Putsch . Bormann returned to his job at Mecklenburg and remained there until May 1926 , when he moved in with his mother in <unk> . 
 = = Career in the Nazi Party = = 
 In 1927 , Bormann joined the National Socialist German Workers Party ( Nazi Party ; NSDAP ) . His membership number was 60 @,@ 508 . He joined the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) on 1 January 1937 with number 278 @,@ 267 . By special order of Heinrich Himmler in 1938 , Bormann was granted SS number 555 to reflect his Alter Kämpfer ( Old Fighter ) status . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Bormann took a job with Der <unk> , a weekly paper edited by NSDAP member Hans Severus Ziegler , who was deputy Gauleiter ( party leader ) for Thuringia . After joining the NSDAP in 1927 , Bormann began duties as regional press officer , but his lack of public @-@ speaking skills made him ill @-@ suited to this position . He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the Gau ( region ) . He moved to Munich in October 1928 , where he worked in the SA insurance office . Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were hurt or killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties . As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities , in 1930 Bormann set up the <unk> der NSDAP ( NSDAP Auxiliary Fund ) , a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party . Each party member was required to pay premiums and might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business . Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormann 's discretion . He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert , and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund . In addition to its stated purpose , the fund was used as a last @-@ resort source of funding for the NSDAP , which was chronically short of money at the time . After the NSDAP 's success in the 1930 general election , where they won 107 seats , party membership grew dramatically . By 1932 the fund was collecting 3 million Reichsmarks per year . 
 Bormann also worked on the staff of the SA from 1928 to 1930 , and while there he founded the National Socialist Automobile Corps , precursor to the National Socialist Motor Corps . The organisation was responsible for co @-@ ordinating the donated use of motor vehicles belonging to party members , and later expanded to training members in automotive skills . 
 = = = Reichsleiter and head of the party chancellery = = = 
 After the Machtergreifung ( NSDAP seizure of power ) in January 1933 , the relief fund was repurposed to provide general accident and property insurance , so Bormann resigned from its administration . He applied for a transfer and was accepted as chief of staff in the office of Rudolf Hess , the Deputy Führer , on 1 July 1933 . Bormann also served as personal secretary to Hess from 4 July 1933 until May 1941 . Hess ' department was responsible for settling disputes within the party and acted as an intermediary between the party and the state regarding policy decisions and legislation . Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself in as much of the decision @-@ making as possible . On 10 October 1933 Hitler named Bormann Reichsleiter ( national leader – the highest party rank ) of the NSDAP , and in November he was named Reichstag deputy . By June 1934 , Bormann was gaining acceptance into Hitler 's inner circle and accompanied him everywhere , providing briefings and summaries of events and requests . 
 In 1935 , Bormann was appointed as overseer of renovations at the Berghof , Hitler 's property at Obersalzberg . In the early 1930s , Hitler bought the property , which he had been renting since 1925 as a vacation retreat . After he became chancellor , Hitler drew up plans for expansion and remodelling of the main house and put Bormann in charge of construction . Bormann also commissioned the construction of barracks for the SS guards , roads and footpaths , garages for motor vehicles , a guesthouse , accommodation for staff , and other amenities . Retaining title in his own name , Bormann bought up adjacent farms until the entire complex covered 10 square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) . Members of the inner circle built houses within the perimeter , beginning with Hermann Göring , Albert Speer , and Bormann himself . Bormann commissioned the building of the <unk> ( Eagle 's Nest ) , a tea house high above the Berghof , as a gift to Hitler on his fiftieth birthday ( 20 April 1939 ) . Hitler seldom used the building , but Bormann liked to impress guests by taking them there . 
 While Hitler was in residence at the Berghof , Bormann was constantly in attendance and acted as Hitler 's personal secretary . In this capacity , he began to control the flow of information and access to Hitler . During this period , Hitler gave Bormann control of his personal finances . In addition to salaries as chancellor and president , Hitler 's income included money raised through royalties collected on his book Mein Kampf and the use of his image on postage stamps . Bormann set up the Adolf Hitler Fund of German Trade and Industry , which collected money from German industrialists on Hitler 's behalf . Some of the funds received through this programme were disbursed to various party leaders , but Bormann retained most of it for Hitler 's personal use . Bormann and others took notes of Hitler 's thoughts expressed over dinner and in monologues late into the night and preserved them . The material was published after the war as Hitler 's Table Talk . 
 The office of the Deputy Führer had final approval over civil service appointments , and Bormann reviewed the personnel files and made the decisions regarding appointments . This power impinged on the purview of Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick , and was an example of the overlapping responsibilities typical of the Nazi regime . Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler , including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss ( the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany ) , and to the Sudetenland after the signing of the Munich Agreement later that year . Bormann was placed in charge of organising the 1938 Nuremberg Rally , a major annual party event . 
 Hitler intentionally played top party members off against each other and the NSDAP against the civil service . In this way , he fostered distrust , competition , and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power . He typically did not give written orders ; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann . Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off . Bormann proved to be a master of intricate political infighting . Along with his ability to control access to Hitler , this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels , Göring , Himmler , Alfred Rosenberg , Robert Ley , Hans Frank , Speer , and other high @-@ ranking officials , many of whom became his enemies . This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power , influence , and Hitler 's favour came to characterise the inner workings of the Third Reich . 
 As World War II progressed , Hitler 's attention became focused on foreign affairs and the conduct of the war to the exclusion of all else . Hess , not directly engaged in either of these endeavours , became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler 's attention ; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler 's side . Hess was concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place later that year . He flew solo to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government . He was arrested on arrival and spent the rest of the war as a British prisoner , eventually receiving a life sentence for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 . Speer later said Hitler described Hess ' departure as one of the worst blows of his life , as he considered it a personal betrayal . Hitler ordered Hess to be shot should he return to Germany and abolished the post of Deputy Führer on 12 May 1941 , assigning Hess ' former duties to Bormann , with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei ( Party Chancellery ) . In this position he was responsible for all NSDAP appointments , and was answerable only to Hitler . Associates began to refer to him as the " Brown Eminence " , but never to his face . 
 Bormann 's power and effective reach broadened considerably during the war . By early 1943 , the war produced a labour crisis for the regime . Hitler created a three @-@ man committee with representatives of the State , the army , and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy . The committee members were Hans Lammers ( head of the Reich Chancellery ) , Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel , chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( Armed Forces High Command ; OKW ) , and Bormann , who controlled the Party . The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries , with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself . The committee , soon known as the <unk> ( Committee of Three ) , met eleven times between January and August 1943 . However , they ran up against resistance from Hitler 's cabinet ministers , who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee . Seeing it as a threat to their power , Goebbels , Göring , and Speer worked together to bring it down . The result was that nothing changed , and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance . 
 = = = Anti @-@ church campaign = = = 
 While Article 24 of the NSDAP party platform called for conditional toleration of Christian denominations and a Reichskonkordat ( Reich Concordat ) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933 , purporting to guarantee religious freedom for Catholics , Hitler believed that religion was fundamentally incompatible with National Socialism . Bormann , who was strongly anti @-@ Christian , agreed ; he stated publicly in 1941 that " National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable . " Out of political expediency , Hitler intended to postpone the elimination of the Christian churches until after the war . However , his repeated hostile statements against the church indicated to his subordinates that a continuation of the <unk> ( church struggle ) would be tolerated and even encouraged . 
 Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches . In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP . The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed , and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership . While Bormann 's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful , he was able to reduce the amount of religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms . Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania , the planned rebuilding of Berlin , he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites . 
 As part of the campaign against the Catholic Church , hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled . In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster , August von Galen , publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4 , the Nazi non @-@ voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill , physically deformed , and incurably sick were to be killed . In a series of sermons that received international attention , he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral . His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders , the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point . Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged , but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen 's death would only be viewed as a martyrdom and lead to further unrest . Hitler decided to deal with the issue when the war was over . 
 = = = Personal Secretary to the Führer = = = 
 Preoccupied with military matters and spending most of his time at his military headquarters on the eastern front , Hitler came to rely more and more on Bormann to handle the domestic policies of the country . On 12 April 1943 , Hitler officially appointed Bormann as Personal Secretary to the Führer . By this time Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters , and this new appointment gave him the power to act in an official capacity in any matter . 
 Bormann was invariably the advocate of extremely harsh , radical measures when it came to the treatment of Jews , the conquered eastern peoples , and prisoners of war . He signed the decree of 31 May 1941 extending the 1935 Nuremberg Laws to the annexed territories of the East . Thereafter , he signed the decree of 9 October 1942 prescribing that the permanent Final Solution in Greater Germany could no longer be solved by emigration , but only by the use of " ruthless force in the special camps of the East " , that is , extermination in Nazi death camps . A further decree , signed by Bormann on 1 July 1943 , gave Adolf Eichmann absolute powers over Jews , who now came under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Gestapo . Historian Richard J. Evans estimates that 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million Jews , representing two @-@ thirds of the Jewish population of Europe , were exterminated by the Nazi regime . 
 Knowing Hitler viewed Slavic people as inferior , Bormann opposed the introduction of German criminal law into the conquered eastern territories . He lobbied for and eventually achieved a strict separate penal code that implemented martial law for the Polish and Jewish inhabitants of these areas . The " Edict on Criminal Law Practices against Poles and Jews in the Incorporated Eastern Territories " , promulgated 4 December 1941 , permitted corporal punishment and death sentences for even the most trivial of offences . 
 Bormann supported the hard @-@ line approach of Erich Koch , Reichskommissar in Reichskommissariat Ukraine , in his brutal treatment of Slavic people . Alfred Rosenberg , serving as head of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories , favoured a more moderate policy . After touring collective farms around Vinnytsia , Ukraine , Bormann was concerned about the health and good physical constitution of the population , as he was concerned that they could constitute a danger to the regime . After discussion with Hitler , he issued a policy directive to Rosenberg that read in part : 
 The Slavs are to work for us . In so far as we don 't need them , they may die . The fertility of the Slavs is undesirable . As to food , they are to not get more than necessary . We are the masters ; we come first . 
 Bormann and Himmler shared responsibility for the Volkssturm ( people 's militia ) , which drafted all remaining able @-@ bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last @-@ ditch militia founded on 18 October 1944 . Poorly equipped and trained , the men were sent to fight on the eastern front , where nearly 175 @,@ 000 of them were killed without having any discernible impact on the Soviet advance . 
 = = = Last days in Berlin = = = 
 Hitler transferred his headquarters to the Führerbunker ( " Führer 's shelter " ) in Berlin on 16 January 1945 , where he ( along with Bormann , his secretary Else Krüger , and others ) remained until the end of April . The Führerbunker was located under the Reich Chancellery garden in the government district in the centre of the city . The Battle of Berlin , the final major Soviet offensive of the war , began on 16 April 1945 . By 19 April the Red Army started to encircle the city . On 20 April , his 56th birthday , Hitler made his last trip to the surface . In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery , he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth . That afternoon , Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time . On 23 April , Albert Bormann left the bunker complex and flew to the Obersalzberg . He and several others had been ordered by Hitler to leave Berlin . 
 In the early morning hours of 29 April 1945 , Wilhelm Burgdorf , Goebbels , Hans Krebs , and Bormann witnessed and signed Hitler 's last will and testament . Bormann was named executor of the estate . That same night , Hitler married Eva Braun in a civil ceremony . 
 As Soviet forces continued to fight their way into the centre of Berlin , Hitler and Braun committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April . Braun took cyanide and Hitler shot himself . As per Hitler 's instructions , their bodies were carried up to the Reich Chancellery garden and burned . In accordance with Hitler 's last wishes , Bormann was named as Party Minister , thus officially confirming his position as de facto General Secretary of the Party . Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was appointed as the new Reichspräsident ( president of Germany ) and Goebbels became head of government and Chancellor of Germany . Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide later that day . 
 On 2 May , the Battle in Berlin ended when General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling , the commander of the Berlin Defence Area , unconditionally surrendered the city to General Vasily Chuikov , the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army .

 At around 11 : 00 pm on 1 May , Bormann left the Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger , Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann , and Hitler 's pilot Hans Baur as members of one of the groups attempting to break out of the Soviet encirclement . Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler 's last will and testament . The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U @-@ Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station , where they surfaced . Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the <unk> Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank . The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed , and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground . Bormann , Stumpfegger , and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt . Bormann , Stumpfegger , and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station , where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction . When he encountered a Red Army patrol , Axmann doubled back . He saw two bodies , which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger , on a bridge near the railway switching yard . He did not have time to check thoroughly , so he did not know how they died . Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann 's body , his fate remained in doubt for many years . 
 = = = Tried at Nuremberg in absentia = = = 
 During the chaotic days after the war , contradictory reports arose as to Bormann 's whereabouts . Sightings were reported in Argentina , Spain , and elsewhere . Bormann 's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her . Jakob Glas , Bormann 's long @-@ time chauffeur , insisted that he saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946 . In case Bormann was still alive , multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on the radio in October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him . 
 The trial got underway on 20 November 1945 . Lacking evidence confirming Bormann 's death , the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia , as permitted under article 12 of their charter . He was charged with three counts : conspiracy to wage a war of aggression , war crimes , and crimes against humanity . His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold . The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co @-@ signed virtually all of the antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime . Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead . Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann 's activities , Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution 's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making . Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression . On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging , with the provision that if he were later found alive , any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it . 
 = = = Discovery of remains = = = 
 Over the coming years , several organisations , including the CIA and the West German Government , attempted to locate Bormann without success . The West German government in 1964 offered a reward of 100 @,@ 000 Deutsche Marks for information leading to Bormann 's capture . Sightings were reported at points all over the world , including Australia , Denmark , Italy , and South America . In his autobiography , Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy , and that he had escaped to Moscow . Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America . The West German government declared that its hunt for Bormann was over in 1971 . 
 In 1963 , a retired postal worker named Albert Krumnow told police that around 8 May 1945 the Soviets had ordered him and his colleagues to bury two bodies found near the railway bridge near Lehrter station . One was dressed in a Wehrmacht uniform and the other was clad only in his underwear . Krumnow 's colleague <unk> found an SS doctor 's paybook on the second body identifying him as Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger . He gave the paybook to his boss , postal chief Berndt , who turned it over to the Soviets . They in turn destroyed it . He wrote to Stumpfegger 's wife on 14 August 1945 and told her that her husband 's body was " ... interred with the bodies of several other dead soldiers in the grounds of the <unk> in Berlin NW 40 , <unk> 63 . " 
 Excavations on 20 – 21 July 1965 at the site specified by Axmann and Krumnow failed to locate the bodies . However , on 7 December 1972 , construction workers uncovered human remains near Lehrter station in West Berlin just 12 m ( 39 ft ) from the spot where Krumnow claimed he had buried them . Upon autopsy , fragments of glass were found in the jaws of both skeletons , suggesting that the men had committed suicide by biting cyanide capsules to avoid capture . Dental records — reconstructed from memory in 1945 by Dr. Hugo Blaschke — identified one skeleton as Bormann 's , and damage to the collarbone was consistent with injuries that Bormann 's sons reported he had sustained in a riding accident in 1939 . Forensic examiners determined that the size of the skeleton and the shape of the skull were identical to Bormann 's . Likewise , the second skeleton was deemed to be Stumpfegger 's , since it was of similar height to his last known proportions . Composite photographs , where images of the skulls were overlaid on photographs of the men 's faces , were completely congruent . Facial reconstruction was undertaken in early 1973 on both skulls to confirm the identities of the bodies . Soon afterward , the West German government declared Bormann dead . The family was not permitted to cremate the body , in case further forensic examination later proved necessary . 
 The remains were conclusively identified as Bormann 's in 1998 when German authorities ordered genetic testing on fragments of the skull . The testing was led by Wolfgang <unk> , Professor of Forensic Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich . Tests using DNA from one of his relatives identified the skull as that of Bormann . Bormann 's remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered in the Baltic Sea on 16 August 1999 .

 = James McCudden = 
 James Thomas Byford McCudden VC , DSO & Bar , MC & Bar , MM ( 28 March 1895 – 9 July 1918 ) was an English flying ace of the First World War and among the most highly decorated airmen in British military history . 
 Born in 1895 to a middle class family with military traditions , McCudden joined the Royal Engineers in 1910 . Having an interest in mechanics he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) in 1913 at which time he first came into regular contact with aircraft . At the outbreak of war in 1914 he flew as an observer before training as a fighter pilot in 1916 . 
 McCudden claimed his first victory in September 1916 . He claimed his fifth victory — making him an ace — on 15 February 1917 . For the next six months he served as an instructor and flew defensive patrols over London . He returned to the frontline in summer 1917 . That same year he dispatched a further 31 enemy aircraft while claiming multiple victories in one day on 11 occasions . 
 With his six British medals and one French , McCudden received more awards for gallantry than any other airman of British nationality serving in the First World War . He was also one of the longest serving . By 1918 , in part due to a campaign by the Daily Mail newspaper , McCudden became one of the most famous airmen in the British Isles . 
 At his death he had achieved 57 aerial victories , placing him seventh on the list of the war 's most successful aces . Just under two @-@ thirds of his victims can be identified by name . This is possible since , unlike other Allied aces , a substantial proportion of McCudden 's claims were made over Allied @-@ held territory . The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the <unk> 
 On 9 July 1918 McCudden was killed in a flying accident when his aircraft crashed following an engine fault . His rank at the time of his death was major , a significant achievement for a man who had begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic . McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir @-@ Wavans .

He joined the Royal Engineers as a teenager and served in No. 24 Company . He fought in the Anglo @-@ Egyptian War at the Battle of Tel el @-@ Kebir in 1882 . During combat he rescued a wounded soldier while under fire and was recommended for an award . However , when it emerged he was acting against orders he was denied any honours . Nevertheless , his father had a long career in the Engineers and eventually became an instructor at the School of Military Engineering as a non @-@ commissioned officer . His mother 's family also had a military background ; her grandfather served as a Master @-@ at @-@ arms in the Royal Marines aboard HMS <unk> . 
 In 1890 William H. McCudden and Amelia Byford ( 1869 – 1955 ) married . They had six children ; William Thomas James ( 3 April 1891 – 1 May 1915 ) , Mary Amelia ( 23 January 1893 ) , James Thomas Byford ( 28 March 1895 – 9 July 1918 ) , Kathleen Annie ( 1 December 1899 ) , John Anthony ( 14 June 1897 – 18 March 1918 ) and Maurice Vincent ( 31 October 1901 – 13 December 1934 ) . John and William McCudden became fighter pilots but both were killed whilst flying — John would be killed in action during the war . 
 His father William H. McCudden took a post at the Air Ministry at the rank of warrant officer after the Great War , but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920 . When he stood up to offer a woman his seat the compartment door flew open , knocking him into the path of an oncoming train . Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) until he retired through illness in 1933 . He died of colitis the following year , leaving a widow and small daughter . 
 The <unk> moved to Sheerness in 1909 and James transferred to the garrison school . He learned to shoot at the rifle range , box and was a reasonably intelligent student . His father 's retirement soon placed a heavy strain on the family finances and as a consequence McCudden felt obliged to find a job before he could enlist in 1915 . He filled the time from the age of 14 to the age of enlistment by working as a Post Office messenger boy . It was at this time McCudden 's interest in flying began . In nearby <unk> , on the Isle of Sheppey , one of the first aviation centres was built . It was here John Moore @-@ Brabazon became the first Englishman to fly . McCudden and his brothers often went to see the pioneer aviators gather . McCudden expressed a desire to become a pilot after spending hours watching these early flying machines . 
 = = Royal Engineers and RFC = = 
 Unfortunately his desire to be a pilot was postponed . The family required further income after his father retired . Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910 , as No. <unk> . On 24 February 1911 he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain . McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912 . While in Gibraltar he read Flight manual magazine habitually , which explained the theory of flight , aircraft construction and aero engines . He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper . He also held the grade Air Mechanic 2nd Class , No. 892 , which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913 . Soon afterwards he became a member of the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) . On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic . 
 McCudden 's tenure at the aerodrome began ominously . The same day he was granted a request to travel as an observer in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 , disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career . Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A , and proceeded to turn over the engine . The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open . Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman <unk> McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer 's car which had been parked nearby . He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done . For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes , commanding the RFC Military Wing . Sykes was pleased with his overall progress , which likely saved him , but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident . Five years later Sykes again met McCudden — then at the height of his fame — and chaffed him on the episode , even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car . 
 On 15 June 1913 he was posted to No. 3 Squadron RFC . He managed a flight in a Blériot aircraft while there and gradually won a reputation as a first @-@ rate mechanic . By Christmas his frequent requests for trips in the aircraft had met with so much success that McCudden had logged nearly 30 hours , mostly in the Blériot monoplanes . On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to Air Mechanic First Class .

 = = = An observer airman = = = 
 In August 1914 he travelled to France as a mechanic with 3 Squadron after war was declared , which followed the German invasion of Belgium . It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer . After stopping at Amiens for several days , the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions . 3 Squadron offered support to the British Army at the Battle of Mons in Belgium . That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August . On 25 August the British began their retreat , south @-@ west , toward Paris . 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds , often delaying departure until the enemy was only a mile or two behind . Eventually they settled at Melun , south of Paris . In the autumn , McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions at the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the Marne and First Battle of the Aisne . McCudden flew these missions with a rifle since aircraft lacked any fixed armament . 
 McCudden performed well and took on more administrative responsibilities once he was promoted to Corporal on 20 November 1914 . During this period , the First Battle of Ypres was being fought and the Squadron re @-@ equipped with the higher performing Morane @-@ Saulnier L aircraft . Several months later , on 1 April 1915 , he was promoted to sergeant and made NCO in charge of all engines in his flight . McCudden 's delight at gaining a promotion was cut short by news that his brother William had been killed in an air crash while flying an elderly Blériot . Just a week later , his eldest sister Mary lost her husband in an explosion which destroyed the minelayer HMS Princess Irene on 27 May 1915 . 
 Undeterred , McCudden made a formal application to become a pilot and fly on operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing . His reputation as a mechanic had spread since his supervision in the unit had led to a record @-@ low number of engine failures . He continued to fly as an observer despite the recommendation of his rejection letter . 
 On 8 June he made his first official observer qualifying sortie which he passed . At this time the German Luftstreitkräfte ( Air Service ) introduced the Fokker Eindecker fighter equipped with Synchronization gear . Firing through the propeller , the Germans had a machine that soon became a serious threat to McCudden 's unit . The enemy succeeded establishing a period of air superiority at this time . McCudden still flew regularly as an observer with the new commanding Officer , Edgar Ludlow @-@ Hewitt , who had taken over command on 20 November 1915 . He recorded a flight of 2 hours 40 minutes on the 27 November which included an abortive chase after a Albatros <unk> reconnaissance aircraft . On 16 December 1915 he acted as aerial gunner , when he drove off an attack on his flight by the German ace Max Immelmann . While firing at the Fokker , McCudden witnessed a piece of paper or fabric fall off the German machine . Although the ground was diligently searched , no trace of it was found . On 19 January 1916 , McCudden exchanged fire with another German observer without result . 
 At this time , McCudden 's Squadron was also experimenting with wireless technology . Captain <unk> Lewis who commanded the headquarters Flight fitted his <unk> with a set to help direct artillery fire . In April 1915 he commanded 3 Squadron and became McCudden 's commanding officer . He was killed a year later when he was shot down by ground @-@ fire . It is unknown whether McCudden participated in these pioneering ventures . 
 On 21 January 1916 McCudden was awarded the Croix de guerre for gallantry . He travelled to Lillers to receive his award from General Joseph Joffre , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the French Army . His award aroused interest in McCudden , for on 23 January he was promoted to flight sergeant and twenty @-@ fours hours later he was ordered home to England to begin pilot training . 
 = = = Pilot training = = = 
 McCudden was based at Farnborough and began his training on 22 February 1916 . He started with a 20 @-@ minute flight in a Henry Farman pusher . McCudden had already flown 100 hours as a passenger with 25 different pilots including 46 hours as a regular observer since November 1915 and had much experience with his surroundings . His instructor was impressed with his grasp of the mechanics and theory . He practiced six landings and progressed to the more powerful Avro 504 as the last the Farman had been written off by another student . 
 On 9 April he was sent to Gosport and assigned to No. 41 Squadron RFC and made his first solo flight on 16 April in a Farman <unk> Later that day he was awarded his Royal Aero Club certificate after completing four figure @-@ of @-@ eight turns , a glide from 1 @,@ 200 feet and a landing within forty yards of a selected mark . He completed 22 flights at Gosport , the longest a 50 @-@ minute flight to 7 @,@ 000 feet . On 29 April he was posted to the Central Flying School ( CFS ) at Upavon , near Salisbury Plain for advanced training , arriving on 1 May . 
 On 7 May he became the 107th non @-@ commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate . He passed as Second Class Flier . He was good enough to be selected as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself . Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock . Soon afterwards , while teaching a student in the Airco <unk> in which they were flying , the aircraft entered a dangerous spin . McCudden narrowly avoided a crash , pulling up feet above the ground . An impact would certainly have killed them both . 
 On 30 May he was graded First Class Flier . The grade was based upon his achievements ; he had achieved a dead @-@ stick landing within a fifty @-@ yard marker , a 15 @-@ minute flight at 6 @,@ 000 feet , a 60 @-@ mile cross @-@ country flight and 15 hours solo flying . On 24 May he passed his final test with a two @-@ hour flight from Salisbury , to Southampton and onto Basingstoke . His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum . By the time he left for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours , given 177 lessons as instructor , and had personally tutored 40 student pilots .

 McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916 . The unit was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory <unk> and flew from <unk> , near Saint @-@ Omer . He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged . The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft . He patrolled the Ypres and Roulers region . He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but did come into contact with a single Fokker near Lille . Flying in formation , the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen . This particular German would climb above the British , make a diving attack at the rear @-@ most aircraft and dive away if he did not score a decisive hit . Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district . <unk> because of heavy mist , he force @-@ landed in Allied territory , crashing and coming to halt in the garden of a French farmhouse . Little damage was done to the machine . On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels . The flight was unmolested , though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking . 
 That same evening McCudden was told to pack his belongings since he was to be reassigned to 29 Squadron RFC flying Airco DH.2 scouts . McCudden was pleased to be flying scouts , finding it " light after flying the F.E. " McCudden soon found from pilots that the machine was not popular and had to be handled with care . Nevertheless , while on patrol between Armentières and Ypres on 6 September 1916 he scored his first victory . He engaged an all @-@ white Albatros <unk> , and shot it down . He then chased another but it escaped through superior speed . Confirmation of his victory was given three days later by an I ANZAC Corps unit . It had crashed on the <unk> @-@ <unk> road at the time and place of his claim . McCudden nearly added to this score the following day . He engaged a Fokker monoplane but his gun jammed . Switching off his engine , he rectified the damage but the Fokker pilot took the opportunity to pursue him . <unk> his engine as the German closed , McCudden outmanoeuvred him and was presented with a close @-@ astern shot , but once again his gun jammed and the battle ended inconclusively when the faster Fokker dived away . 
 McCudden did not score again during the year but had a remarkable escape on 27 December 1916 . Flying from Arras to Monchy on patrol , his flight of six <unk> engaged an enemy formation of Albatros <unk> McCudden rushed to the aid of Alexander James , a member of his flight , who had been attacked by a German fighter . He attacked the Albatros head @-@ on but his gun jammed after 20 shots . As he fought to clear the jam he found himself amid a number of German fighters . 
 One soon latched onto him and began firing . McCudden dived steeply but the enemy pilot remained behind him . At 800 feet McCudden began a spinning dive until the German , now some distance behind , abruptly turned away . The enemy aircraft was fired at by British ground forces and McCudden , who by now had <unk> his Lewis machine gun , turned to give pursuit . The enemy pilot , apparently unaware of this , was already too high and McCudden watched as he re @-@ joined his flight and departed the area . 
 McCudden returned to base ; in spite of his narrow escape his machine had not been hit . His squadron mates were surprised to see him ; they had witnessed his dive , assumed the spin to be terminal , and were in the process of posting him missing in action . It has been suggested that the enemy pilot was none other than Manfred von Richthofen , " The Red Baron " , in which case McCudden had narrowly avoided becoming the rising star 's 15th victim . Richthofen was credited with a " two seat Vickers biplane " that afternoon , which has usually been listed as the <unk> of Captain Quested and Lieutenant <unk> , but recent research indicates that the action with McCudden may fit the time frame . 
 1916 ended on a personal high for McCudden . He received his commission on 28 December which came into effect on 1 January 1917 . He was granted two weeks leave and returned to England . As a second lieutenant , McCudden returned to France on 21 January . He was determined to build up his personal tally despite the limitations of his <unk> The very same day he was forced down for the first and only time . He attacked a Albatros D.III and damaged its engine which stopped . Unfortunately another attacked and he was forced to break off a certain kill when one of his propeller blades was partly shot off . Another DH.2 intervened and McCudden landed near Arras , ordered a new propeller , and flew back to base . Since no member witnessed the fate of the Albatros no claim was made . 
 McCudden 's fortunes changed in the new year . He dispatched a two @-@ seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917 . On 5 February he attacked a Albatros <unk> returning from a photo @-@ reconnaissance mission . Diving out of the sun to blind the gunner , he shot it down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery . Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a <unk> Roland <unk> After a brief dogfight and pursuit , the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy . Twenty @-@ four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory . His award was eventually Gazetted on 12 March . 
 = = = Return to England = = = 
 He returned to England on 23 February and was appointed an instructor once more . He was slightly aggrieved as he felt he was now getting into his stride as a fighter pilot . He had also been hopeful that his squadron was about to receive the French @-@ designed Nieuports , which were a better match for the Albatros and Halberstadt " D " class fighters than the obsolescent <unk> His posting was not surprising to him . The beginning of 1917 witnessed an enormous expansion of the RFC and experienced tutors were required to train the mass of new students . 
 McCudden was posted to the 6th Training Wing at Maidstone until transferred to Dover on 15 April where he learned to fly the Bristol Scout . One of his aircraft was adorned with the name " Teddie " , which his fellow officers suspected was the name of a girlfriend — a blonde dancer , Ms Teddie O 'Neil . McCudden was notoriously private about this aspect of his life but it was suspected that he took her on unauthorised flights in the Scout since his log book recorded such escapades in April . He praised the qualities of his Scout even though he managed to survive two accidents in this aircraft on 29 April and 2 June . Concurrent with his tenure at Dover , his brother John also enrolled as a pilot pupil there . To avoid accusations of favouritism , he remained aloof from his brother which amused his senior officers who had guessed his intentions . 
 In late May and June he collected and experimented on a number of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January . He was impressed with the aircraft 's agility and flew it often . During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft . Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target , in the blind spot of the observer , and angle his guns directly above then fire . McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft . It is not clear if , or how often , McCudden implemented Ball 's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way . McCudden 's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk . 
 It is known McCudden proved remarkably good at stalking tactics , which enabled him to get up underneath an opponent , pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine . The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through the bottom of the fuselage of the aircraft , often causing death or injury , holing petrol tanks and crippling engines . The gun , being fed by a drum of ammunition , could also be reloaded in its pulled @-@ down position , the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit . 
 This conversation coincided with the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London . He attempted interceptions against the high @-@ flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one . He fired but it swerved and resumed course . He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet . On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin <unk> and Walter <unk> ( of bomber unit <unk> 3 ) . He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by . On one raid a Gotha gunner 's bullet struck his windshield . The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain more than a handful of successes against the Gothas . 
 McCudden 's last activity worthy of note before his return to France was his meeting with Frank Barnwell and Harold Barnwell , chief engineers at Vickers Limited . McCudden and the brothers exchanged information on aircraft design and operations . McCudden understood more of the technique of flying and flight while the brothers gained a greater appreciation of the pilot 's perspective . After watching him fly the <unk> , the brothers were convinced of his skill and consequently McCudden was invited to fly a number of their products . Among these machines was the Vickers <unk> McCudden claimed to have reached 136 miles per hour ( mph ) in the aircraft describing it as a " nice bus " . Other pilots noted it was faster than the French SPAD and the S.E.5. On the strength of this evaluation Vickers approached the War Office for its use on the frontline . It was not selected for production . McCudden believed the inaccessibility of the engine was a main factor in its rejection . 
 = = = With 56 Squadron = = = 
 In June he joined No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire , equipped with the Sopwith Pup . He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was unremarkable . He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols . He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols . He encountered the enemy six times but could not score . Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros <unk> fighter for his 6 – 7th aerial victories . 
 He flew 13 different Pups while with the unit which meant he returned across the English Channel to collect new aircraft frequently . While collecting one from Rochester , England on 12 August 1917 a Gotha raid occurred and within 30 minutes he was flying at 17 @,@ 000 feet over Herne Bay in an attempt to intercept them . Once more , he returned without success against the high @-@ flying and ever elusive Gothas . After landing from the sortie he was informed he was to be transferred to the recently formed No. 56 Squadron which was winning a reputation as a very successful unit over the Western Front . The unit was equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 ( S.E.5a ) fighters which were among the most effective combat aircraft of the war and arguably the best designed British fighter of the conflict . It was heavily armed and very fast for its time . 
 Along with the new fighter McCudden was eager to fly was the company he would be flying with . Albert Ball ( 44 victories ) , rising star Arthur Rhys @-@ Davids ( 27 ) and McCudden 's former pupil Geoffrey Hilton Bowman ( 32 ) were just some of the fighter aces who flew with the unit . Though Ball was killed in May 1917 , he would fly and fight alongside Rhys @-@ Davids , Bowman , Richard <unk> , Reginald <unk> and Keith Muspratt . 
 This competitive group would spur McCudden to increase his score . 56 's commanding officer , Major Richard Bloomfield noticed McCudden 's leadership qualities and had hoped he could help turn the unit into an effective fighting team . At present the pilots , though talented , performed more as individuals . After flying for the first time with them Bloomfield promised to have him allocated to a position of Flight Commander . He formally took command of B flight on 14 August . 
 McCudden brought his substantial technical knowledge to 56 Squadron . He frequently inspected his flight 's aircraft , expecting a high standard of mechanical refinement . He believed the finer the aircraft could be tuned the less likelihood there would be of losing pilots to structural or mechanical failures , which at that time were the cause of many fatalities among aircrew . Force @-@ landings were rarely fatal owing to the low @-@ landing speeds but the prospect of coming down behind enemy lines — especially since the RFC was adopting an offensive stance — was an undesirable prospect . Alex J. Gray , Air Mechanic First Class , 56 Squadron : 
 When McCudden came to No. 56 he certainly kept us on our toes to begin with . In the first few weeks he tried out just about every fitter in the flight , and none of them seemed to please him . Finally Corporal Tom Rogers and myself were detailed as his fitters and Corporal Bert Card as the rigger , and from that day on we formed a great friendship with him . 
 = = = Victories 8 – 57 = = = 
 On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres began and the unit was heavily involved . 56 was tasked with air superiority operations to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units to operate with relative freedom . The Germans had adopted a defensive stratagem of massing their aircraft , now increasingly outnumbered , at critical points of the front . Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces . The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer . 
 On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored his first victory as an official member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros <unk> Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories . He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun @-@ stoppages . Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun @-@ jams . He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed . It had to be sent for major repairs . He received a new fighter , <unk> , which then became his regular mount . 
 McCudden was determined his machine would remain in first @-@ class fighting order . He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers , stripping down the Vickers gun 's synchronising gear , firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets . His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore them out on the ground . He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917 — Ernst Wiegand — was able to escape and crash @-@ land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage . Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited . 
 On 19 September he attacked a Rumpler <unk> which he drove down to 1 @,@ 000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent evasive action . He abandoned the chase and spotted another . This time he attacked from the sun and from behind and below . His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed behind enemy lines . Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill . A DFW C.V followed on 23 September — his 13th victory . 
 After this victory his flight engaged a Fokker Dr.I flown by the 48 @-@ victory ace Werner Voss and an Albatros piloted by Carl <unk> . Voss , aided by the frequent jams of his opponents ' guns , avoided being hit and drove two S.E.5 's out of the fight before being fatally hit by Rhys @-@ Davids . McCudden 's account of this fight has become famous : 
 He was very low ... still being engaged by an SE ... the pilot being Rhys @-@ Davids . I noticed the triplane 's movements were very erratic ... I saw him go into a steep dive ... and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments . 
 As long as I live I shall never forget my admiration for that German pilot , who single @-@ handed fought seven of us for ten minutes and also put some bullets through all our machines . His flying was wonderful , his courage magnificent , and in my opinion he was the bravest German airman whom it has been my privilege to see fight . 
 Over the course of September and October McCudden added five victories including a LVG C.V on 26 September , raising his tally from 13 to 18 . On 6 October he was awarded the Bar to his Military Cross . Another five in November brought his tally to 23 . His method of diving behind and under the enemy machines before firing was working particularly well . 
 In December he downed another 14 enemies for victory numbers 24 – 37 including several during the Battle of Cambrai . His successes included four on 23 December , three on 28th and two on the 29th . In December 1917 he received the Distinguished Service Order and a Bar He received two congratulatory messages from AOC RFC Hugh Trenchard on 6 and 12 December : 
 Well done . You are splendid . Your work lately has been of the finest . 
 McCudden had hardened to the realities of aerial combat by this time and reveled in his own success . He appeared to have limited empathy for his opponents , most of whom did not survive his attacks . On 24 January , after claiming his 43rd air victory , he remarked : 
 This <unk> crew deserved to die , because they had no notion whatever of how to defend themselves , which showed that during their training they must have been slack , and lazy , and probably liked going to Berlin too often instead of sticking to their training and learning as much as they could while they had the opportunity . I had no sympathy for those fellows , and that it the mental estimate which I formed of them while flying back to my aerodrome to report the destruction of my 43rd aerial victory . 
 McCudden was now closing in on the tally of Albert Ball who was credited with 44 enemy aircraft . A further nine in January 1918 elevated his tally from 37 to 46 . In February , 11 aircraft brought his tally to 57 — four fell on the 16th . After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th — a Hannover <unk> — but it went down over enemy lines under control as McCudden 's guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim . 
 By this stage McCudden was suffering from combat fatigue . It manifested itself in his decisions , of late , to seek a victory at any price , which was alien to his normal , calculated approach to combat . Knowing he was to soon be sent home , he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen 's score . His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive ; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured . As Flight Commander , B Flight , McCudden 's pilots had shot down 77 – 52 of which were his — while losing four pilots . To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier general John Frederick Andrews Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng , commanding officer of the British Third Army to be personally congratulated . 
 McCudden was soon rotated home on 5 March . Over 50 Officers gathered for a formal farewell dinner and they presented him with a silver model of his <unk> on 4 March . McCudden would not see action again . In the remaining eight months of the war , only British pilots Billy Bishop ( 72 ) and Mick Mannock ( 61 ) and Raymond Collishaw ( 60 ) would surpass his total while serving with the RFC ( and later the Royal Air Force — RAF ) . Ernst Udet ( 62 ) René <unk> ( 75 ) and Manfred von Richthofen ( 80 ) were the only foreign pilots to beat McCudden 's total . 
 = = = Modified S.E.5a = = = 
 McCudden 's long @-@ term interest in mechanics prompted him to modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance . He made a series of modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time . Performance , a generic term , required improvements in all @-@ round capability . McCudden 's changes were made with one main objective in mind : high @-@ altitude performance . He had achieved some success without these personal experiments . On 23 December 1917 , for example , he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18 @,@ 000 feet and drove it down to 8 @,@ 000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory . Incidentally , he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft . 
 McCudden had always found it difficult to intercept high @-@ flying German reconnaissance aircraft . The latest Rumpler <unk> which had entered service proved particularly elusive . With a 240 horse power engine , it could reach 24 @,@ 000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary . The average S.E.5 , at that point , could reach only 17 @,@ 000 feet . While most pilots were prepared to accept this tactical @-@ technological situation , McCudden was not . 
 Through an as yet unspecified channel , he obtained high compression pistons used in the latest Hispano @-@ Suiza 8 or V8 engine and fitted them to his power plant . It delivered revolutions at a much faster rate on the test bench . He removed any excess weight by shortening the exhaust pipes by several feet . He also added a spinner from a captured enemy aircraft which he believed added an extra 3 mph to his speed while also reducing the wing dihedral to increase agility . 
 A final alteration was to fit a simpler shutter ( radiator vent ) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine . For McCudden this aspect was very important . At high altitude McCudden was to spend long periods of time in an extremely chilly environment . Operating the <unk> in 1916 , he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached terra firma . McCudden reported few general side @-@ effects from high flight . Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia . High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness . Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves . Only the high @-@ altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing . Despite his circulation difficulties , McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen . 
 The results of these personal modifications mostly went unrecorded . It is believed he achieved a height of 10 @,@ 000 feet in nine minutes , curtailing the standard time by some five minutes . It was perhaps on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did . He did note the maximum ground @-@ level speed as 135 mph in his log book . He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front @-@ line squadron and without any official assistance . 
 Eager to test the modifications , he began operations on 28 January 1918 . Until the 16 February when 8491 was submitted for repair , he claimed his 45 – 50th aerial victories , the last at 11 : 30 on that date . His last victory that day was scored in another machine .

 Unlike the German and French governments , the War Office had been reluctant to identify individual soldiers and aces for propaganda and public consumption , the most notable exception being Albert Ball . However , from December 1917 Viscount Northcliffe , the proprietor of the Daily Mail newspaper was appointed to the Ministry of Information . Northcliffe had a solid background in aviation . He campaigned for " air mindedness " , when aircraft began to make technological headway and the nation , now facing the existence and efficiency of airships which could circumvent the North Sea and English Channel , was now increasingly concerned about aerial bombardment . Northcliffe supported the creation of the Air League and the Aerial League of the British Empire , a pressure group designed to impress upon a lethargic government the promising and threatening nature of aerial vehicles . 
 As head of the Ministry and Daily Mail , he felt an opportunity was being missed , and so ran a campaign in his publications to name outstanding individual combatants . On 3 January 1918 he ran a story in the Daily Mail under the headline " Our Unknown Air Heroes " , which focused primarily on McCudden . In the front page segment it read : 
 What I want to know is why an Englishman whose hobby is bringing down sky Huns in braces and trios between luncheon and tea , who can already claim a bag of 30 enemy aircraft , should have to wait and be killed before a grateful nation waiting to acclaim him could even learn his name ? 
 I wonder if people in England realize that the German Air Service is the most popular and feted branch of the Kaiser 's war machine because German authorities have imagination enough to exploit its personal side ? How many people in these islands can name as many British airmen there are fingers on one hand ? 
 The campaign was an instant success . The Daily Chronicle echoed these sentiments with " Young Lionheart of the Air " . On 7 January the Daily Mail ran the story " Our Wonderful Airmen — Their names at Last . " The article was accompanied by a large photograph of McCudden and other pilots . Thereafter exploits of British airmen were routinely published . McCudden loathed the attention . In a letter to his father the following day he believed such " bosh " and hero worship would make him an unpopular figure in the RFC and with his comrades . 
 He was thankful to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland , where he flew the excellent performing Sopwith Snipe . It was in Scotland that he learned of the death of his brother , apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March . He wrote to his brother 's commanding officer , Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major 's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive . His death depressed McCudden greatly . 
 The same month he returned home , he was awarded the Victoria Cross , the highest award for gallantry . The letter from Trenchard confirming the King had bestowed this honour upon him was dated 30 March 1918 . The award was gazetted on 29 March and the details were published on 2 April 1918 . <unk> away from this publicity , McCudden did not even tell his family of his attendance at Buckingham Palace on 6 April to receive his Victoria Cross from King George V and promotion to Major . While on leave in London , he socialised a great deal with his friend Mick Mannock . He met C. G. Grey owner of The Aeroplane weeks later who offered to help McCudden finish his manuscript for his biography , Flying Fury , due for publication that year . McCudden accepted . Now famous , he also had his portrait painted by the known artist William Orpen .

 McCudden remained in England until July 1918 when he was given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF . He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers <unk> to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron . On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames , taking the aircraft to 17 @,@ 000 feet and circling London for an hour . When he landed he made his last entry into his log book . His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes . 
 On the morning of 9 July 1918 he travelled to the home of his fiancé , Miss Alex @-@ Tweedie in Whitehall Court . Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book . He had delivered the manuscript to Mr Grey two days earlier and was expecting its publication . While there , McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918 . In view of what happened to von Richthofen , and John McCudden , he promised that " I won 't bustle , or do anything foolish like my brother . " He then went next door and had breakfast with his sister Mary . Upon leaving , he fumbled around in his pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations . He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow where he climbed into his S.E.5a ( <unk> ) . He took off shortly after 13 : 00 . McCudden certainly stopped en route , as about six o 'clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing , Patrick Playfair , to announce his imminent arrival at <unk> , where No. 60 Squadron was stationed . 
 McCudden set out across the English Channel . Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the airfield he suspected to be <unk> but found it empty . Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to <unk> @-@ le @-@ Château , France , to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there . He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E <unk> of 52 Squadron . Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915 . Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear . They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine . Around 90 seconds after takeoff from <unk> @-@ le @-@ Château , the S.E.5a plunged into the ground . 8 Squadron 's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying next to one of the wings — he had not worn his safety belt . Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed . He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull . He did not regain consciousness and died at 20 : 00 . 
 Corporal Burdett later stated , " When McCudden took off he put the machine into a nearly vertical climb , seemed to do a half @-@ roll and then nosed dived into a wood ..... it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt ..... I think that is what he was doing . " Witness Lieutenant <unk> Fenton had a different view , " the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome by the side of the wood . The engine appeared to be running badly . The pilot rolled the machine , which failed to straighten out , at approximately 200 feet . It crashed nose down into the wood . " Lieutenant <unk> Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre : " I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet , when it did one complete roll to the right , then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees . " Lieutenant <unk> King believed a similar thing : [ It flew ] " ...... very low over the aerodrome , going east towards the wood on the south @-@ east side of the aerodrome . He had apparently been rolling . I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash . " Lieutenant <unk> Barry , though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine : " I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200 – 300 feet . The engine was firing irregularly . Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn . The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees . During this dive the noise of the engine ceased . " 
 Usually reports were issued on any incident with every aircraft . On the date McCudden died , 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s but the report pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained . It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor . However , there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit . The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low @-@ level stunts , manifesting in several turns and rolls . Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll , but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near @-@ vertical turn . 
 McCudden 's remains were subsequently buried at the nearby Wavans war cemetery in the Pas de Calais . McCudden 's death occurred only two months after the death of German ace Manfred von Richthofen , whom some commented had been honoured with a longer and more elaborate funeral by the British . McCudden 's wartime score was 57 victories included 19 captured , 27 and 1 shared destroyed , 8 and 2 shared " down out of control " — an official classification which still counted the claim as a victory .

 On the morning of 9 July , McCudden had handed his sister an envelope over breakfast , which was subsequently found to contain all of his medals . Today all of McCudden 's medals including his Victoria Cross are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham , Kent , alongside those of two of his brothers and his father . The original brass engraved grave plaque used , along with a wooden propeller , are also displayed . The shattered windscreen from McCudden 's crashed S.E.5a is preserved in the collection of the Imperial War Museum . The museum 's collections also include McCudden 's uniform ' maternity jacket ' and a half @-@ length portrait of McCudden by William Orpen .

 " Cry " is a song recorded by American recording artist Michael Jackson that features on his tenth and final studio album , Invincible ( 2001 ) . The song was written by R & B singer @-@ songwriter R. Kelly , who had previously written Jackson 's 1995 single " You Are Not Alone " . " Cry " was produced by Jackson and Kelly . It was released in December 2001 under Epic Records as the second single from Invincible . " Cry " is a R & B ballad , with lyrics that highlight problems with the planet . The lyrics also urge people to unite to make the world a better place . The track , thus , recalls previous Jackson songs that promote peace and environmentalism . 
 The song was released with two B @-@ side tracks ; " Shout " and " Streetwalker " . " Cry " received mixed reviews from music critics . The single had a moderate chart performance internationally , with its highest peak being number sixteen in Denmark , and its least successful charting country being Austria . The track was promoted with a music video , which was filmed by Nicholas Brandt . The video does not feature Jackson but shows people holding hands and standing side by side in a variety of settings , including a beach and a forest .

The single was released with two B @-@ side tracks , " Shout " and " Streetwalker " . " Shout " was a previously unreleased song that was originally intended for Invincible , but was replaced at the last moment by " You Are My Life " . " Streetwalker " had previously appeared as a track on the 2001 special edition of Jackson 's seventh studio album , Bad . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The themes of " Cry " are world issues such as isolation , war , and brotherhood . It also suggests if everyone pulls together as one , then they make a change to the world , with Jackson singing , " You can change the world / I can 't do it by myself " . Music critic Mark Brown of Rocky Mountain News felt that Jackson cries the lyrics " I can 't do it by myself " . The song 's lyrics and themes are similar to the ones in Jackson 's 1988 single " Man in the Mirror " and his 1991 single " Heal the World " . " Cry " is composed in the key of A major and the song 's time signature is common time . " Cry " has a moderate metronome of eighty four beats per minute . The single is built in the chord progression of A – G / A – A – A / G in the verses and A – A / G – D – A in the chorus . The sheet music indicates the vocal range spans A3 to G5 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Jason Elias of Allmusic thinks " Cry " is a moody and reflective piece of material reminiscent of Jackson 's Quincy Jones @-@ produced ballads for Bad , and indicates the song 's themes are those of alienation and sorrow rather than love . He believes the strength of the strings , the competent backing vocals , and the keyboard figures prevent the listener from convulsing with laughter at Jackson 's " oh @-@ so @-@ pained delivery " and interjections of " Hold on " or " Oh my ! " Jon Pareles of the New York Times called the track the " change @-@ the @-@ world @-@ song " and wrote that the single " applies its grand buildup to one of pop 's strangest utopian schemes , " which was asking everyone to cry at the same time , at which point Jackson may answer their prayers . Catherine Halaby of Yale Daily News felt that the song is a " less triumphant use of a contemporary 's input " on the album . 
 NME music critic Mark Beaumont believed that Jackson " starts banging creepily on about " the lyrics which pertain to saving the children . Frank Kogan of the Village Voice noted that while " Cry " and another song from Invincible ( " Speechless " ) are " very pretty " , they give the impression that Jackson 's " standing sideways , so as to let the beauty slide off him . " Los Angeles Times staff writer Robert Hilburn wrote that the track " fills the social commentary role " of Jackson 's " Man in the Mirror " ( 1988 ) , while Hartford Courant rock music critic Roger Catlin believed that the single is a redux to Jackson 's " Heal the World " ( 1991 ) . Newsday staff writer Glenn Gamboa said that the song was " equally average " to other tracks on Invincible . James Hunter of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that R. Kelly " more or less succeeds with the kind of life affirming number " on the single . 
 Jim Farber of New York 's Daily News wrote that in " Cry " , Jackson " goes into his healing @-@ the @-@ world shtick , though rarely has he been this condescending about his role as universal savior . " Chicago Tribune rock music critics Greg Kot believed that R. Kelly " reprises the formula of his big gospel @-@ stoked anthem " ( " I Believe I Can Fly " ) on the track . A journalist for The Wichita Eagle wrote that Jackson " shines on the sincere ballads " such as " Cry " , " Heartbreaker " and " Speechless " . Pop music critic Thor Christensen of the Dallas Morning News described the single as being the musician 's " latest batch of inspirational cotton candy . " Francisco <unk> of University Wire noted that the overall good songs from Invincible are " Heartbreaker , " " Cry " and " Speechless . " Pamela Davis and Gina <unk> of St. Petersburg Times called the song " <unk> filled " and said that it was full of Jackson 's " freaky messiah @-@ savior complex . "

 " Cry " was promoted by a music video , or " short film , " as Jackson would refer to it . The video was directed by Nicholas Brandt , who had previously directed " Earth Song " ( 1995 ) , " Childhood " ( 1995 ) and " Stranger in Moscow " ( 1996 ) , all of which were featured on Jackson 's HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I album . The video was filmed in six different locations , five of which were in California and another in Nevada . People featured in the video included members of a real life gospel group . The video begins with dozens of people of different ages , ethnicities and races holding hands . Long lines of people were stretched over mountains , across highways , in a forest and on the beach . Everyone stands in silence for a majority of the video . Following the bridge , everyone begins singing the chorus . Towards the final chorus , the group collectively clap their hands along with the song , taking hands once more as the song ends . 
 " Cry " is the only Michael Jackson video to be included on an enhanced CD of the single . 
 " Cry " was issued as a single against Jackson 's original intentions to release " Unbreakable . " ( The same situation applied with the release of " You Rock My World " months prior . ) Due to his dissatisfaction with the way Sony was handling the album 's promotion , he refused to appear in the music video for " Cry " . Craig Halstead and Chris Cadman , authors of the book Michael Jackson : The Solo Years , believe that Jackson 's absence from the video " did little to promote it . "

 = 1991 FA Charity Shield = 
 The 1991 FA Charity Shield ( also known as the Tennent 's Charity Shield for sponsorship reasons ) was the 69th FA Charity Shield , the annual football match contested by the reigning champions of the Football League First Division and the holders of the FA Cup . It was held at Wembley Stadium , on 10 August 1991 . The game was played between Arsenal , champions of the 1990 – 91 Football League and Tottenham Hotspur , who beat Nottingham Forest to win the 1991 FA Cup Final . This was Arsenal 's twelfth Charity Shield appearance and Tottenham Hotspur 's sixth . 
 Arsenal began the match the brighter of the two teams , dominating in possession and the number of chances created . Tottenham created their best chance to score in the first half , but struggled to find a breakthrough in the second half , hardly troubling the Arsenal defence . With neither team able to score after 90 minutes , the match ended in a draw , meaning each team held the trophy for six months each . 
 = = Background = = 
 Arsenal qualified for the 1991 FA Charity Shield , by virtue of winning the 1990 – 91 Football League First Division , having lost one match – away to Chelsea – in the entire campaign . This was the club 's eleventh Charity Shield appearance ; Arsenal won seven previous shields ( 1930 , 1931 , 1933 , 1934 , 1938 , 1948 , 1953 ) and lost four ( 1935 , 1936 , 1979 , 1989 ) previously . Tottenham Hotspur qualified as holders of the FA Cup , beating Nottingham Forest 2 – 1 in the 1991 FA Cup Final . They appeared in five previous shields , winning four outright ( 1921 , 1951 , 1961 , 1962 ) , sharing two ( 1967 , 1981 ) and losing two ( 1920 , 1982 ) . 
 The last meeting between both teams was in the FA Cup ; Tottenham Hotspur won 3 – 1 in the semi @-@ final at Wembley Stadium . Tottenham were the only league opponents to avoid defeat against Arsenal , with neither side scoring in the two matches played . Manager Peter <unk> noted the importance of the match , given this was a North London derby , but stressed there " will be more important objectives this season . " This was the first all @-@ London encounter in the 83 @-@ year history of the Shield . This would be the last time either team was to share the trophy , as new regulations were brought in a year later that allowed for extra time and subsequently a penalty shootout if a draw occurred in normal time .

 Anders Limpar was the main absentee for Arsenal , having sustained a knee injury , on duty for the Swedish national team . David O 'Leary started in place of the injured Steve Bould ; midfielder David Hillier was selected ahead of Michael Thomas in Limpar 's place on the left wing . Tottenham defender Terry Fenwick , recovered from a double leg break , replaced Justin Edinburgh in the first eleven . Without Paul Gascoigne , injured in the FA Cup final , Tottenham employed a five @-@ man midfield with Gary Lineker as the sole striker . 
 = = = Summary = = = 
 Arsenal began brightly in front of a crowd of 65 @,@ 483 , creating the first chance of the match in the 17th minute . Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell , who hooked the ball high over goal . Four minutes later , Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net , meeting a cross from Paul Merson ; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside . Tottenham improved shortly after , with Gary <unk> heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match . Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute . Vinny <unk> set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence . Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams , Lineker looked up , before making a cross for <unk> to head ; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman 's right foot . 
 Early in the second half , Tottenham 's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal 's David Rocastle , in spite Rocastle indicating that the player used an elbow – a bookable offence . Moments after , Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe , by tackling the player without intent . Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon . Arsenal dominated possession during the second half , with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent 's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal @-@ scoring chances . Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik <unk> , when the ball was back @-@ passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley .

 Despite the draw , <unk> was content with his team 's performance . He believed the new 4 – 5 – 1 formation deployed in the match was " the system which suits us best " , but admitted the midfield needed to do more to support Lineker upfront . Arsenal manager George Graham agreed that his team played below their usual standard in the first half , accepting that his team needed " to work on ... finishing " to make use of their territorial advantage . 
 = Mark Kellogg ( reporter ) = 
 Mark Kellogg ( March 31 , 1831 – June 25 , 1876 ) was a newspaper reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn . Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and was evidently one of the first men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne . His dispatches were the only press coverage of Custer and his men in the days leading up to the battle . As a newspaper stringer whose reports were picked up around the country , Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty . 
 = = Life = = 
 Born Marcus Henry Kellogg on March 31 , 1831 , in Brighton , Ontario , Canada , Kellogg was the third of ten children . Kellogg 's family moved a number of times in his youth before they eventually settled in La Crosse , Wisconsin . While there Kellogg learned to operate a telegraph and went to work for both the Northwestern Telegraph Company and the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company . 
 He married Martha J. Robinson in 1861 and they had two daughters . During the years of the American Civil War , Kellogg became the assistant editor for the La Crosse Democrat newspaper . He also unsuccessfully ran for the office of city clerk in 1867 and played shortstop on one of the town 's baseball teams . 
 In 1867 Kellogg 's wife died . Leaving his daughters to be raised by an aunt , Kellogg began drifting around the upper Midwest , working as a reporter and editorial assistant in places such as Council Bluffs , Iowa , and Brainerd , Minnesota . While living in Brainerd he ran for election to the Minnesota Legislature , but was defeated . He also worked as a string correspondent for the St. Paul Dispatch , with his articles often published under the pen name of " Frontier . " 
 In the early 1870s , he moved to Bismarck , North Dakota , where in 1873 he helped editor Clement A. Lounsberry found The Bismarck Tribune . Even though Kellogg was only an editorial assistant for the paper , he substituted for Lounsberry as editor of the Tribune 's second , third and fourth issues . 
 = = Battle of the Little Bighorn = = 
 When Lounsberry learned that a military column ( including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer ) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory , he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage . However , at the last minute Lounsberry 's wife fell ill , so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place . Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory . 
 Kellogg sent three dispatches back to Lounsberry , the last one four days before the battle when they were near the mouth of the Rosebud River . His last dispatch read , " By the time this reaches you we would have met and fought the red devils , with what result remains to be seen . I go with Custer and will be at the death . " Kellogg was not predicting his own death or Custer 's defeat ; instead , " at the death " is a phrase borrowed from fox hunting meaning " present at the kill " ( viz . , of the pursued ) . 
 Four days after that dispatch , the Battle of the Little Bighorn was fought , resulting in the deaths of Custer and the 208 soldiers , scouts , and civilians riding with him , including Kellogg . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Colonel John Gibbon , whose men arrived at the battle on Tuesday , June 27 , and also helped bury the dead , said he found Kellogg 's body in a ravine where a number of men from Company E died . Kellogg 's body was scalped and missing an ear ; he was identified by the boots he wore . 
 When Clement Lounsberry learned of the defeat of Custer 's force and Kellogg 's death , he " worked tirelessly throughout the night " to produce a special edition of The Bismarck Tribune . Published on July 6 , 1876 , the article was the battle 's first full account . Lounsberry also telegraphed the news , including Kellogg 's correspondence , to a number of eastern newspapers , including the New York Herald . Two letters written by Kellogg were published posthumously by the Herald on July 11 , 1876 . 
 As a newspaper stringer whose reports were picked up around the country , Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty . 
 Some of Kellogg 's diary and notes survived the battle and these , along with his news accounts , are one of the primary historical sources for information on the days preceding the battle . His notes are now in the possession of the State Historical Society of North Dakota . His satchel , pencil , and eyeglasses are on display in the Newseum in Washington , DC . 
 = Robert Abbott ( game designer ) = 
 Robert Abbott ( born March 2 , 1933 ) is an American game inventor , sometimes referred to by fans as " The Official Grand Old Man of Card Games " . Though early in his life he worked as a computer programmer with the IBM 360 assembly language , he has been designing games since the 1950s . 
 Two of his more popular creations include the chess variant Baroque chess ( also known as Ultima ) and Crossings , which later became Epaminondas . Eleusis was also successful , appearing in several card game collections , such as Hoyle 's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games , among others . In 1963 , Abbott himself released a publication , Abbott 's New Card Games , which included instructions for all of his card games , in addition to Baroque chess . Abbott also invented logic mazes , the first of which appeared in Martin Gardner 's Mathematical Games column in the October 1962 issue of Scientific American . One of the more prominent of these is Theseus and the Minotaur , which was originally published in the book Mad Mazes . His game Confusion was named " Best New Abstract Strategy Game " for 2012 by GAMES Magazine . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Abbott was born in St. Louis , Missouri , and attended St. Louis Country Day School . Abbott went to Yale for two years , then attended the University of Colorado for another two , but never graduated . Soon after , Abbott moved to New York , where he and his games were discovered by Martin Gardner . In 1963 , after Abbott 's book , Abbott 's New Card Games , received only moderate success , he " got tired of being poor " and moved back to St. Louis . There , he became a computer programmer at the Washington University Computer Research Laboratory . In 1965 , he moved back to New York , where he continued to work as a computer programmer , mostly with the IBM 360 assembly language . 
 Abbott created all of his card games during the 1950s , starting with Babel in 1951 , and ending with Auction in 1956 . Soon after , he moved to New York City , where the rules for his game Eleusis were first published by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column . Motivated by the article , Abbott self @-@ published the rules for four of his card games in the book Four New Card Games in 1962 , which Abbott sold by mail . In 1963 , the book Abbott 's New Card Games was published by Sol Stein of Stein and Day , containing the rules for all eight of his card games and the rules for his chess variant , Baroque chess . In 1968 , the publisher Funk & Wagnalls published a paperback edition of Abbott 's New Card Games , in which Abbott slightly modified the rules of Baroque chess , but these changes never became popular . Around the same time that Abbott 's New Card Games was published , Abbott sent his maze , Traffic Maze in Floyd 's Knob , to Martin Gardner . This was the first logic maze to be published , appearing in Gardner 's Mathematical Games column . 
 Since then , Abbott has created various mazes , most of which appeared in the books SuperMazes and Mad Mazes . In 2008 , <unk> Libros published a Spanish version of his book Abbott 's New Card Games , under the title Diez juegos que no se <unk> a nada , which translates to Ten games that do not resemble anything . This version was not just a Spanish translation of the original , however ; the most up @-@ to @-@ date rules for the various games were used ; in addition , the rules for Eleusis Express and Confusion were included . In 2010 , his Where are the Cows ? maze was published by the Oxford University Press in the book Cows in the Maze . In 2011 , his game Confusion was published by Stronghold Games . The game was named " Best New Abstract Strategy Game " for 2012 by GAMES Magazine . 
 = = Logic mazes = = 
 Abbott is the inventor of a style of maze called logic mazes . A logic maze has a set of rules , ranging from the basic ( such as " you cannot make left turns " ) to the extremely complicated . These mazes are also called " Multi @-@ State mazes " . The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before , but be traveling in a different direction . That change in direction can put you in a different state and open up different choices for you . One example , from the book SuperMazes , would be a rolling @-@ die maze . Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die . If you return to that same square , the die may be in a different state , with a different number on top . Thus , you would have different options than the first time . 
 = = = Traffic Maze in Floyd 's Knob = = = 
 The first logic maze ever published , Traffic Maze in Floyd 's Knob , appeared in the October 1962 issue of Scientific American in the Mathematical Games column . 
 The maze looks like a street grid , with arrows pointing down various roads at each intersection . When one comes to an intersection , only arrows leading from the road you are on to another road can be followed . One must continue in this fashion , following the arrows at the intersection , until the end is reached . When you come to an intersection from one direction , you have different options for which road to take than you would coming into the intersection from another direction ; therefore , this can be defined as a " multi @-@ state " or " logic " maze . 
 = = = Where Are the Cows ? = = = 
 Where are the Cows ? is one of Abbott 's most difficult mazes . It first appeared in his book SuperMazes . Abbott warns readers that it " may be too difficult for anyone to solve . " Since then , it has also appeared as the titular maze in the book Cows in the Maze . 
 The complexity in Where are the Cows ? includes self @-@ reference , changing rules , and flow charts . It is also worded so as to provoke confusion between an object ( such as red text ) , a reference to an object ( such as the word " red " ) , and even more subtle references ( the word " word " ) . The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult to work out the next move , let alone the end . In this maze , you have to use two hands , each starting at a different place . The instructions in one box might have to do with the box that the other hand is in , boxes you have already left , or complex combinations of the two . 
 = = = Theseus and the Minotaur = = = 
 Theseus and the Minotaur is another of Abbott 's better @-@ known mazes . It first appeared in his book Mad Mazes . Like Where are the Cows ? in SuperMazes , Abbott says that this " is the hardest maze in the book ; in fact , it is possible that no one will solve it . " Since then , several different versions of it have appeared , made by others , following the same theme , both on paper and in electronic forms . 
 = = Games = = 
 Abbott has created several games , including card games , board games , and one equipment game . As a whole , his games are not of particular fame , although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games . For instance , the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick @-@ taking game . As you play the game , the rules change three times , so it is as if you are playing four different games that are threaded together . 
 = = = Baroque chess = = = 
 Baroque chess , or Ultima , was the only board game in the book Abbott 's New Card Games . Abbott 's reasoning for including this non @-@ card game in a card game book was that chess pieces are as plentiful as playing cards , and in this book , he wanted to introduce new games that did not require special equipment . Abbott 's friends , once he started teaching it to them , began to call the game " Abbott 's Ultima , " which he did not like at all . However , the publisher , Sol Stein , preferred the name " Ultima , " so that is the title that was used in the book . 
 = = = Eleusis = = = 
 Eleusis is probably Abbott 's most prominent game , due to its metaphors and its suitability for use as a teaching tool . He invented it in 1956 , and it appeared in his self @-@ published book Four New Card Games . It was also published in the book Abbott 's New Card Games a year later . Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June 1959 issue of Scientific American . Basically , the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played , and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning . In 1973 , Abbott decided to improve Eleusis ; the result was considered to be far better than the original , with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a bit better . Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October 1977 issue of Scientific American . Abbott also self @-@ published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version , titled The New Eleusis . It has appeared in several card game collections , such as Hoyle 's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games , among others . 
 = = = Confusion = = = 
 Abbott initially created the game Confusion in the 1970s , and had it in finished form by 1980 . The game was published in Germany by <unk> in 1992 ; Abbott was not satisfied with this version , however , due to several flaws in it . The rules were published in the Spanish translation of his book Abbott 's New Card Games in 2008 , but the game did not get published in North America until 2011 . This Stronghold Games version was named " Best New Abstract Strategy Game " for 2012 by GAMES Magazine . The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do at the beginning of the game . His game Eleusis uses a similar idea , in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning ; George Brancaccio , someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York , commented on this , saying " In your game Eleusis , you don 't know what cards can be played . Why don 't you make a board game where you don 't know how pieces move ? " This is what gave Abbott the idea , and he began work on it soon after .

 = Randall Flagg = 
 Randall Flagg is a fictional character created by Stephen King . Flagg has appeared in at least nine of King 's novels , either as a major or very minor character . He has a variety of names , usually <unk> " R.F. " but with occasional exceptions , such as Walter o 'Dim ( originally envisioned by King as a separate character ) in The Dark Tower series . Flagg is described as " an accomplished sorcerer and a devoted servant of the Outer Dark " , with supernatural abilities involving necromancy , prophecy , and influence over animal and human behavior . His goals typically center on bringing down civilizations through destruction and conflict . 
 Flagg first appeared in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population . He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos . Flagg was a primary antagonist in King 's epic series , The Dark Tower , who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower ( the linchpin of existence ) so he can claim it for himself and become a god . The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg 's background and motivation , linking his previous appearances . Aside from King 's novels , Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand ( played by Jamey Sheridan ) and appeared in Marvel Comics ' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand . 
 King initially cited Donald DeFreeze , primary kidnapper of Patty Hearst , as his inspiration for Flagg . Later , he attributed Flagg to an image of a man walking the roads in cowboy boots , denim jeans , and a jacket , a notion which " came out of nowhere " when he was in college . Flagg 's character and the nature of his evil have been the subject of considerable critical attention .

 Randall Flagg makes his first appearance in King 's 1978 apocalyptic novel , The Stand , where he tries to construct a new civilization in the United States after a plague kills most of the population . Flagg is described as a " tall man of no age " in old blue jeans , denim jacket and old cowboy boots . He wears an old Boy Scout knapsack , and his jacket pockets are stuffed with pamphlets from dozens of fringe splinter groups . Flagg ’ s background is vague , even to him ; he says that at some point he just “ became ” , although he remembers being a Marine , a Klansman , a Viet Cong member and having a hand in the kidnapping of Patty Hearst . In Las Vegas Flagg attracts people drawn to destruction , power and draconian rule , using crucifixion , torture and other punishments on those disloyal to him . His followers reorganize society , rebuilding the city . Flagg plans to attack and destroy a rival emerging civilization ( Mother Abagail 's Free Zone in Boulder , Colorado ) to become the dominant society in the former United States . 
 After two of Flagg 's followers fail to kill the leaders of the Free Zone , the Boulder community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him . After being taken prisoner , the men are brought before the city for a public execution . Before Flagg can kill them , one of his most loyal and devout followers ( the <unk> Man ) arrives with a nuclear warhead . As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears , detonating the warhead ( which annihilates Flagg 's followers and the two remaining prisoners ) . The novel was re @-@ published in 1990 in an expanded edition , with text cut from its original edition . This edition has Flagg reappearing on a beach , with a new group of people to control . 
 = = = = The Eyes of the Dragon = = = = 
 Flagg later appears in The Eyes of the Dragon ( 1986 ) as an evil wizard wreaking havoc in the medieval country of Delain . He is described as a " thin and stern faced man of about 50 [ years of age ] " , despite being much older . He hides himself under a dark cloak , and most of his magic comes from spells , potions and poisons . He is described as a " sickness " which seems to reappear in Delain when there is something worth destroying . In this novel , Flagg schemes to throw the kingdom of Delain into chaos by poisoning the king and framing Prince Peter ( legitimate heir to the throne ) for the crime . Thomas ( Peter 's naive , resentful younger brother ) becomes king instead ; Flagg , whom he sees as his only friend , becomes his royal advisor . Due to his youth and inexperience , Thomas allows Flagg great power and is easily manipulated by the wizard . Flagg becomes the de facto ruler of Delain , plunging the kingdom into a dark age . Years later Thomas confronts Flagg about his father 's murder , which he witnessed as a child but suppressed the memory out of fear . Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye with an arrow , and Flagg disappears from the kingdom . Peter is given his rightful throne ; Thomas and his butler , Dennis , leave the kingdom in search of Flagg . In the novel Thomas and Dennis find Flagg , but the nature of their encounter is never revealed and Flagg survives to engender chaos in later stories . 
 = = = = Hearts in Atlantis = = = = 
 In Hearts in Atlantis ( 1999 ) , Raymond Fiegler is identified near the novel 's end as leader of an activist group when he prevents Carol Gerber from retrieving an unexploded bomb on a college campus . King never identifies Fiegler as Flagg , but Christopher Golden and Hank Wagner suggest in The Complete Stephen King Universe that there is little doubt Fiegler is Flagg . Golden and Wagner cite evidence such as Fiegler 's ability to make himself appear " dim " ( an ability shared by Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon ) , his manipulation of Carol Gerber and her activist friends and Flagg 's frequent use of aliases ( usually with the initials " R.F. " ) 
 = = = = The Dark Tower series = = = = 
 Flagg makes his next several appearances in King 's Dark Tower series , which follows gunslinger Roland Deschain as he travels in search of the Dark Tower . Flagg 's presence is felt in the opening sentence of the first book : " The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed " . In this series , Flagg assumes the guise of several individuals . He first appears as Walter o 'Dim , chased across the desert by Roland . In flashbacks Flagg assumes the identity of Marten Broadcloak , a wizard who conspires with the Crimson King to cause the fall of the Dark Tower . In the original Marten is a separate person from Walter , who is also not known to be Flagg , but Marten and Walter are ret @-@ conned into one character in later editions . In the original edition Walter speaks derisively of Marten , implying Marten would not be able to handle the vision that Walter showed Roland . 
 When Roland was young , Marten had an affair with Roland 's mother , Gabrielle , using the affair to provoke Roland to take the gunslinger test early . He hoped Roland would fail ( so he would be exiled ) but Roland passed the test . Eventually , Roland catches Walter ; they have a long discussion about Roland 's destiny and the Tower which causes him to slip into delirium . He awakens to find a pile of bones in Walter 's place . In the original edition Walter and Marten are separate characters , with Walter dying at the end of the novel . When King published an expanded edition of the novel Walter and Marten are portrayed as identical , and Walter fakes his own death . 
 Flagg appears briefly in a flashback in the second installment of the Dark Tower series , The Drawing of the Three . Roland recalls seeing two men named Thomas and Dennis pursuing a man named Flagg , who was almost certainly a demon . These are implied to be the same characters from The Eyes of the Dragon . This is the first example of the Dark Tower series crossing over with one of King 's other novels . 
 Flagg makes his next full appearance in the series ' third installment , The Waste Lands . In the city of Lud , Flagg saves Tick @-@ Tock Man Andrew Quick ( an enemy of Roland 's ka @-@ <unk> , left for dead in an earlier confrontation ) . Quick becomes Flagg 's devoted servant , and Flagg assumes the name of Richard Fannin . The character returns in the fourth book , Wizard and Glass , as Marten Broadcloak . Also identifying himself as Flagg , he warns Roland and his ka @-@ <unk> to abandon their quest for the Dark Tower . In flashbacks the reader learns that Flagg ( as Walter o 'Dim ) was an emissary for John Farson , one of those responsible for the destruction of Roland 's home Gilead . 
 The " Argument " ( a summary of the series thus far ) beginning Wolves of the <unk> — the fifth novel in the series — notes that Flagg is known as Broadcloak , Fannin and John Farson , depending on the world in which he lives . In Wolves of the <unk> , Flagg makes a brief appearance ( as Walter o 'Dim ) when Father Callahan arrives in Roland 's world . Flagg gives Callahan Black Thirteen , a dangerous crystal ball , hoping it will kill Roland on his way to the tower . In this encounter , Flagg is described with " the face of a human weasel " , and " the same welling red circle " on his forehead as the Can @-@ toi . His appearance in The Song of Susannah is via a flashback revealing that Flagg bargained with the succubus Mia ; this resulted in the birth of Mordred Deschain , son of both Roland and the Crimson King . 
 In The Dark Tower , Flagg indicates that he is not John Farson , but served under him until the latter 's downfall . Flagg reveals his plans to climb the Dark Tower , see the room at the top and become the god of all . His ultimate goal is to kill Roland Deschain : " ... most of all for the death of his mother , whom I once loved . " Flagg believes that he can only achieve these goals by killing Mordred and taking his birthmark @-@ stained foot . Although he tries to befriend Mordred and pledge allegiance to him , Mordred telepathically senses Flagg 's true motives and eats him , forcing him to rip out his eyes and tongue first . 
 The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg ’ s background , relating that he was born Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of <unk> ’ d Barony . At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road , but was raped by a fellow wanderer ( Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg 's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child ) . Resisting the temptation to crawl back home , Padick instead moves towards his destiny ; he learns various forms of magic , achieving a quasi @-@ immortality . After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts the attention of the Crimson King , who adopts him as his emissary . 
 In 2013 , King published a new story from The Dark Tower entitled The Wind Through the Keyhole . Here Flagg is depicted as the Covenant Man : central villain of the book 's story @-@ within @-@ a @-@ story , " The Wind Through the Keyhole " , a legend from Mid @-@ World set years before the series ' beginning . He is the Barony 's " tax collector " from Gilead , attempting to collect taxes from residents of the small town of Tree . The Covenant Man sends the story 's protagonist ( a young boy named Tim ) on a perilous quest through the Endless Forest to save his mother ; unbeknownst to Tim , the Covenant Man is supplying him with false prophecies and misinformation as part of a cruel practical joke . However , Tim succeeds in his journey ; he saves his mother after encountering the wizard Maerlyn , who has been imprisoned in the form of a " tyger " . While the Covenant Man is not explicitly identified as Flagg , with only the initials " RF / MB " in his signature as identification and at one point being referred to as ' the man in the black cloak ' , Stephen King confirmed in an interview with Bev Vincent for his book The Dark Tower Companion that the two are one and the same . 
 = = = Film and TV = = = 
 King was influential in deciding who would play Flagg in the television adaptation of The Stand . He felt Flagg was the best villain he had ever created , and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part . Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken , James Woods , Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum . King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel . Miguel Ferrer , who played Flagg 's henchman in the film , was interested in playing the villain . 
 King 's idea for the role was someone who " would make the ladies ' hearts go <unk> pat , that looked like the type of guy you would see on the cover of one of those sweet , savage love paperback romances " . He eventually persuaded the decision @-@ makers to cast a lesser @-@ known actor as Flagg , which turned out to be Jamey Sheridan . 
 Sheridan 's performance was generally well received . Entertainment Weekly ’ s Ken Tucker wrote that the best acting came from Sheridan , who gave the character a “ grim intensity ” . He commented that Sheridan had “ leading @-@ man looks ” with the hair of a “ dissolute heavy metal star ” , making him “ unsettling ” even when not wearing makeup that makes him look like a devil . Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan might have been a bit young and “ zany ” for the part , but gave a credible performance ; he said that Sheridan attacked the role “ with the swagger of Elvis , the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires ( and network TV allows ) " . 
 In February 2011 , Warner Bros. announced plans to produce a new feature film adaptation of The Stand . King commented that he would like to see Dutch actor Rutger Hauer in the role of Flagg , but said that he may be too old for the part . In August 2014 it was reported that Warner Bros. wanted actor Matthew McConaughey for the role . 
 It was confirmed in 2016 that Matthew McConaughey would be playing the role of Walter o 'Dim , Flagg 's alter @-@ ego , in the film adaptation of The Dark Tower . Nikolaj <unk> , the film 's director and co @-@ writer , said " Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything . That ’ s how I feel about [ Walter ] . He could do anything . " <unk> described Walter as having " a very interesting way of seeing the world . He sees it with a sort of delight , even though he is obviously on the wrong side of the light @-@ and @-@ dark spectrum . He ’ s someone I ’ ve been having a lot of fun with . " 
 The 2016 miniseries 11 @.@ 22 @.@ 63 , based on King 's novel 11 / 22 / 63 , incorporates numerous references to other King stories , including an appearance by Randall Flagg , who is seen cycling through the Dallas throngs just before the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the final episode . 
 = = = Comics = = = 
 Beginning in 2007 , Marvel Comics released a series of comics which were a prequel to the Dark Tower novels . Randall Flagg , appearing as Marten Broadcloak and Walter o 'Dim , plays a significant role in the series . 
 In April 2009 Marvel released a single @-@ issue comic written by Robin Furth and illustrated by Richard Isanove entitled The Dark Tower : Sorcerer , which focused on the character of Marten Broadcloak @-@ Walter o 'Dim . Sorcerer provides an origin for the character different from the one King initially wrote , explaining that Walter was the son of the wizard Maerlyn and Selena ( Goddess of the Black Moon ) . Walter was left at the home of a mill owner , Sam Padick , " to learn the ways of men " . At age 13 , Walter burns down his adoptive father 's mill before running away to find his true father ( Walter 's rape is not mentioned ) . Furth wrote in the afterword that the idea of Maerlyn being Walter 's father came from King . The comic also reveals that Marten had poisoned Roland 's infant brother . Furth introduced the idea that the Bends o ' the Rainbow , 13 magic spheres created by Maerlyn in the distant past , are sentient beings able to project personifications which can interact with other characters . Marten has a sexual relationship with the female personification of Maerlyn 's Grapefruit ( one of the spheres ) . This is described as incestuous , since the beings were given life by Maerlyn ( Walter 's biological father ) ; Marten and the Grapefruit repeatedly call each other as brother and sister . The siblings also refer to the Crimson King as their " cousin " , indicating that Maerlyn is related to him . In her afterword Furth says that although she conceived these ideas , King approved them . According to the comic , Marten 's romantic feelings for Roland 's mother trigger jealousy in the Grapefruit ( who influences Roland to unwittingly kill his mother ) . ( In Wizard and Glass , the witch known as Rhea of the <unk> orchestrate Roland 's matricide as revenge for his killing of her pet snake . ) Enraged , Marten imprisons his " sister " in the Grapefruit and vows revenge on Roland for his involvement in his beloved 's death . Addressing inconsistencies between the novels and the comics , Furth stated that the comics exist on another level of the Tower : " a spinoff world , one which is very similar to , but not exactly the same as the one where [ the Dark Tower novels ] take place " . 
 On the character of Marten , Furth noted that " [ he ] is one of the scariest characters that Stephen King has ever created . He moves from book to book , bringing chaos and anarchy with him ... He is quite a demonic figure , and as such he is one of the great anti @-@ heroes of contemporary popular fiction " and that " [ j ] <unk> into Walter 's mind is a pretty wild experience and at times a little frightening . You have to travel to very dark places " . To find Walter 's voice , Furth went to John Milton 's Paradise Lost , William Blake 's Proverbs of Hell , the Biblical Song of Solomon and the writings of Aleister Crowley for inspiration . 
 In his interview with Bev Vincent , Isanove opined that Walter was his favorite character to draw ; " Jae [ Lee , the original artist for the series ] established him as almost androgynous . He 's always got this bare chest , and he 's very feminine in the way he moves , with his hands raised . He 's always moving his hands around . He 's got this weird face , with a broken nose and greasy hair . He 's starting to bald , but he 's always got a very white separation in the middle of it . He 's just so greasy , he 's great to draw . And he still has to be seductive at the same time , so you can 't make him repulsive ... He 's such a great character . " 
 Marvel later released an comic book adaptation of The Stand , which began in September 2008 and ran for thirty issues . Writer Roberto Aguirre @-@ Sacasa described Flagg as " The man of nightmares . Or , put another way , our nightmares given human ( more or less ) form . The dark side of the American Dream ... King 's ' Walkin ' Dude ' may not be the Devil , himself , as Mother Abagail says , but he comes pretty damn close ... " Initially , artist Mike Perkins said he felt " Flagg needed to be designed less as a man — more as a force of nature . His hair will obscure his features , his face will be almost always in heavy shadow . This is the creature lurking under your bed , in your wardrobe , in your nightmares . Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying " . Roberto Aguirre @-@ Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg 's face : " ... the further into the book and the adaptation you go , the less feasible that becomes . Stephen spends so much time describing [ Flagg ] ' s features and smiles , you need to show those things " . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 King initially named Donald DeFreeze , lead kidnapper in the Patty Hearst case , as his inspiration for Randall Flagg . According to King , he remembered the Patty Hearst case when he began to write a description of DeFreeze : " Donald DeFreeze is a dark man " . He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible , hidden under a large hat . What he looked like was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him . This inspired King , who then wrote " A dark man with no face " . After reading " Once in every generation the plague will fall among them " , King began writing The Stand and developing the character of Randall Flagg . 
 In 2004 , King said that Flagg had been a presence in his writing since the beginning of his career , with the idea coming to him in college . He first wrote a poem , " The Dark Man " , about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape ; written on the back of a <unk> in a college restaurant , the one @-@ page poem was published in 1969 , but the character never left King 's mind . To the author , what made Flagg interesting was " the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on the outside looking in , and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends " . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 Characteristic of Randall Flagg is his embodiment of evil . When King created the character , he based him around what he believed evil represented . To King , Flagg is “ somebody who ’ s very charismatic , laughs a lot , [ is ] tremendously attractive to men and women both , and [ is ] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us ” . This idea carries over into The Stand , in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail ( the personification of good ) . Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will , referring to him as the demon Legion , while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep ( among other ancient names ) . King wanted Flagg to embody a " gigantic evil " , although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand . He said , " I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy . Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil , going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the ' 50s — he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people 's hates , fears , resentments , laughs . Flagg , Koresh , Jim Jones , Hitler — they 're all basically the same guy " . Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan , this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal . He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen ( Flagg appears differently to different individuals ) , his message is the same : " I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and all you have to do is give me your soul " . 
 Critics also note Flagg ’ s penchant for evil . Tony Magistrale sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain ( comparing him to Iago , Edmund and Richard III ) , contending that Flagg is an antihero . Magistrale believes that Flagg ’ s evil is based on his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction ; although he seeks power , it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction . Heidi <unk> finds Flagg “ an embodiment of pure evil ” , contending that King sees good and evil as “ real forces ” ; Flagg ’ s embodiment of evil is confirmed by the fact that “ he is a killer , a maker of mischief , a liar , and a <unk> ” . To <unk> , Flagg ’ s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “ evil ultimately leads nowhere ” . The author calls Flagg a “ generic hybrid ” of the archetypical “ Dark Man and the Trickster ” . To her , the combination of these two characteristics ( found in different cultural realms ) forces people to face their “ flawed humanity ” with the “ amorality ” Flagg represents . Jenifer Paquette writes that " Flagg 's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man , and his behavior is a mockery of humanity — a terrible insight into the human psyche . King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves . " 
 Douglas Winter believes that Flagg epitomizes the Gothic villain — an “ atavistic embodiment of evil ” — since his appearance is indistinct , malleable and a “ collection of masks ” . Flagg symbolizes “ the inexplicable fear of the return of bygone powers — both technological and , as his last name intimates , sociopolitical ” . Like other Gothic villains , Flagg ’ s plans seem to fail at every turn as he seems to need to convince others of his importance . Winter asserts that Flagg is a Miltonic superman who receives his strength from a dark , mysterious source . He compares him to J. R. R. Tolkien ’ s Sauron in The Lord of the Rings : both collapse when directly confronted . Alissa Stickler describes Flagg as a “ contemporary medievalist interpretation on the themes of evil , magic and the ( d ) evil figure ” . She likens Flagg to Merlin , whispering in the ear of Arthur . Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon ; he uses his power differently in each novel , challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times . She explains that there does not appear to be a higher power to which Flagg “ must appeal to his abilities ” ( as there is with traditional evil ) . Flagg is more of a “ <unk> evil ” , which works against him as much as it does for him . His supernatural knowledge is fallible , and the customary black @-@ and @-@ white depiction is replaced with an “ acceptance of a shadowy gray area ” . Stickler says that although Flagg appears “ terrifying and supernatural ” as depicted by King , there are no absolutes . She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future , which challenges ( yet supports ) the literary Middle Ages . 
 Flagg ’ s character has its detractors . In his essay " The Glass @-@ Eyed Dragon " , author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon , saying that he is one of the least @-@ believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible . According to de Camp , absolute evil is hard to envision ; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world , Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos . De Camp notes that Flagg fails to see that there is no advantage to his actions . 
 Flagg 's embodiment of evil is not the only characteristic seen by critics . Joseph Reino commented that the character 's presence in The Stand was " Stephen King 's version of a pestilential Big Brother " . Tony Magistrale revisits the character in a second book , this time comparing him to Norman Mailer . Here , Magistrale states that in The Stand Flagg gives the reader an “ illustration of King ’ s jaundiced perspective of modern America ” as he presents the consequences of technology @-@ worship and the sacrifice of “ moral integrity to the quest for synthetic productivity ” . 
 Flagg 's background as a rape victim and its impact on his character have also been explored . Patrick McAleer argues that Flagg 's situation is the most sympathetic of all of King 's characters , and his evil may be retribution : " [ I ] n suspending any disbelief in the possibility that reprisal is a reaction to rape , the life of Flagg becomes one that looks to strike a balance for the sexual crime committed against him . And although Flagg 's possible search for justice and balance is that which becomes imbalanced and even prejudiced , the mitigating factor here is that Flagg is not an originator of evil - he is just caught up in its web as another wronged individual seeking justice " . McAleer compares Flagg to Satan in Paradise Lost , suggesting that he may be another " fallen angel who has a valid case supporting his devilry " . While agreeing that Flagg can be seen " relishing in evil deeds at almost every juncture " , he contends that no judgement can be made without the full story and context for his actions . 
 = Pteranodon = 
 Pteranodon ( / <unk> / ; from Greek πτερόν ( " wing " ) and <unk> ( " toothless " ) is a genus of pterosaurs which included some of the largest known flying reptiles , with wingspans over 6 metres ( 20 ft ) . It existed during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America in present day Kansas , Alabama , Nebraska , Wyoming , and South Dakota . More fossil specimens of Pteranodon have been found than any other pterosaur , with about 1 @,@ 200 specimens known to science , many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons . It was an important part of the animal community in the Western Interior Seaway . 
 Pteranodon was not a dinosaur . By definition , all dinosaurs belong to either order within Dinosauria , either Saurischia or Ornithischia . As such , this excludes pterosaurs . Nonetheless , Pteranodon is frequently featured in dinosaur media and is strongly associated with dinosaurs by the general public . 
 = = Description = = 
 Pteranodon species are extremely well represented in the fossil record , allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history . Over 1 @,@ 000 specimens have been identified , though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal . Still , this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur , and it includes both male and female specimens of various age groups and , possibly , species . 
 = = = Size = = = 
 Adult Pteranodon specimens from the two major species can be divided into two distinct size classes . The smaller class of specimens have small , rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals , even wider than those of the much larger size class . The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs , indicating that these smaller adults are females . The larger size class , representing male individuals , have narrow hips and very large crests , which were probably for display . 
 Adult male Pteranodon were among the largest pterosaurs , and were the largest flying animals known until the late 20th century , when the giant azhdarchid pterosaurs were discovered . The wingspan of an average adult male Pteranodon was 5 @.@ 6 metres ( 18 ft ) . Adult females were much smaller , averaging 3 @.@ 8 metres ( 12 ft ) in wingspan . The largest specimen of Pteranodon longiceps from the Niobrara Formation measured 6 @.@ 25 metres ( 20 @.@ 5 ft ) from wingtip to wingtip . An even larger specimen is known from the Pierre Shale Formation , with a wingspan of 7 @.@ 25 metres ( 23 @.@ 8 ft ) , though this specimen may belong to the distinct genus and species Geosternbergia maysei . While most specimens are found crushed , enough fossils exist to put together a detailed description of the animal . 
 Methods used to estimate the mass of large male Pteranodon specimens ( those with wingspans of about 7 meters ) have been notoriously unreliable , producing a wide range of estimates from as low as 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) to as high as 93 kilograms ( 205 lb ) . In a review of pterosaur size estimates published in 2010 , researchers Mark Witton and Mike Habib demonstrated that the latter , largest estimates are almost certainly incorrect given the total volume of a Pteranodon body , and could only be correct if the animal " was principally comprised of aluminium . " Witton and Habib considered the methods used by researchers who obtained smaller mass estimates equally flawed . Most have been produced by scaling modern animals such as bats and birds up to Pteranodon size , despite the fact that pterosaurs have vastly different body proportions and soft tissue anatomy from any living animal . 
 = = = Skull and beak = = = 
 Unlike earlier pterosaurs such as Rhamphorhynchus and Pterodactylus , Pteranodon had toothless beaks , similar to those of birds . Pteranodon beaks were made of solid , bony margins that projected from the base of the jaws . The beaks were long , slender , and ended in thin , sharp points . The upper jaw was longer than the lower jaw . The upper jaw was curved upward ; while this normally has been attributed only to the upward @-@ curving beak , one specimen ( <unk> <unk> ) has a curvature corresponding with the beak widening towards the tip . While the tip of the beak is not known in this specimen , the level of curvature suggests it would have been extremely long . The unique form of the beak in this specimen led Alexander Kellner to assign it to a distinct genus , <unk> , in 2010 . 
 The most distinctive characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest . These crests consisted of skull bones ( frontals ) projecting upward and backward from the skull . The size and shape of these crests varied due to a number of factors , including age , sex , and species . Male Pteranodon sternbergi , the older species of the two described to date ( and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia ) , had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection , while their descendants , Pteranodon longiceps , evolved a narrower , more backward @-@ projecting crest . Females of both species were smaller and bore small , rounded crests . The crests were probably mainly display structures , though they may have had other functions as well . 
 = = = Skeleton = = = 
 Other distinguishing characteristics that set Pteranodon apart from other pterosaurs include narrow neural spines on the vertebrae , plate @-@ like bony ligaments strengthening the vertebrae above the hip , and a relatively short tail in which the last few vertebrae are fused into a long rod . The entire length of the tail was about 3 @.@ 5 % as long as the wingspan , or up to 25 centimetres ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) in the largest males . 
 = = <unk> and evolution = = 
 Pteranodon fossils are known primarily from the Niobrara Formation of the central United States . Broadly defined , Pteranodon existed for more than four million years , during the late <unk> to early Campanian stages of the Cretaceous period . The genus is present in most layers of the Niobrara Formation except for the upper two ; in 2003 , Kenneth Carpenter surveyed the distribution and dating of fossils in this formation , demonstrating that Pteranodon sternbergi existed there from 88 to 85 million years ago , while P. longiceps existed between 86 and 84 @.@ 5 million years ago . A possible third species , which Kellner named Geosternbergia maysei in 2010 , is known from the Sharon Springs member of the Pierre Shale Formation in Kansas , Wyoming , and South Dakota , dating to between 81 @.@ 5 and 80 @.@ 5 million years ago . 
 In the early 1990s , Bennett noted that the two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were precisely separated in time with little , if any , overlap . Due to this , and to their gross overall similarity , he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years . In other words , only one species of Pteranodon would have been present at any one time , and P. sternbergi ( or Geosternbergia ) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of P. longiceps . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 = = = Range and environment = = = 
 Specimens assigned to Pteranodon have been found in both the Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of the Niobrara Formation , and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the Pierre Shale Formation . When Pteranodon was alive , this area was covered by a large inland sea , known as the Western Interior Seaway . Famous for fossils collected since 1870 , these formations extend from as far south as Kansas in the United States to Manitoba in Canada . However , Pteranodon specimens ( or any pterosaur specimens ) have only been found in the southern half of the formation , in Kansas , Wyoming , and South Dakota . Despite the fact that numerous fossils have been found in the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada , no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there . This strongly suggests that the natural geographic range of Pteranodon covered only the southern part of the Niobrara , and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota . 
 Some very fragmentary fossils belonging to <unk> pterosaurs , and possibly Pteranodon itself , have also been found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States . For example , some bone fragments from the <unk> Formation of Alabama and the <unk> Formation of Delaware may have come from Pteranodon , though they are too incomplete to make a definite identification . Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon , but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely . 
 Pteranodon longiceps would have shared the sky with the giant @-@ crested pterosaur Nyctosaurus . Compared to P. longiceps , which was a very common species , Nyctosaurus was rare , making up only 3 % of pterosaur fossils from the formation . Also less common was the early toothed bird , Ichthyornis . 
 It is likely that , as in other polygynous animals ( in which males compete for association with harems of females ) , Pteranodon lived primarily on offshore rookeries , where they could nest away from land @-@ based predators and feed far from shore ; most Pteranodon fossils are found in locations which at the time , were hundreds of kilometres from the coastline . 
 Below the surface , the sea was populated primarily by invertebrates such as ammonites and squid . Vertebrate life , apart from basal fish , included sea turtles such as <unk> , the plesiosaur <unk> , and the flightless diving bird <unk> . <unk> were the most common marine reptiles , with genera including <unk> and <unk> . At least some of these marine reptiles are known to have fed on Pteranodon . Barnum Brown , in 1904 , reported plesiosaur stomach contents containing " pterodactyl " bones , most likely from Pteranodon . 
 Fossils from terrestrial dinosaurs also have been found in the Niobrara Chalk , suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea ( one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by a shark ) . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 The wing shape of Pteranodon suggests that it would have flown rather like a modern @-@ day albatross . This is based on the fact that Pteranodon had a high aspect ratio ( wingspan to chord length ) similar to that of the albatross — 9 : 1 for Pteranodon , compared to 8 : 1 for an albatross . Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing , and use a flight pattern called " dynamic soaring " which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping , and without the aid of thermals ( which do not occur over the open ocean the same way they do over land ) . While most of a Pteranodon flight would have depended on soaring , like long @-@ winged seabirds , it probably required an occasional active , rapid burst of flapping , and studies of Pteranodon wing loading ( the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body ) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight , contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide . 
 Like other pterosaurs , Pteranodon probably took off from a standing , quadrupedal position . Using their long forelimbs for leverage , they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap . Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs . The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down @-@ stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet of Pteranodon is known to have included fish ; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon , and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the jaws of another Pteranodon , specimen AMNH <unk> . Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso , indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of Pteranodon ( though they may also have taken invertebrates ) . 
 Traditionally , most researchers have suggested that Pteranodon would have taken fish by dipping their beaks into the water while in low , soaring flight . However , this was probably based on the assumption that the animals could not take off from the water surface . It is more likely that Pteranodon could take off from the water , and would have dipped for fish while swimming rather than while flying . Even a small , female Pteranodon could have reached a depth of at least 80 centimetres ( 31 in ) with its long bill and neck while floating on the surface , and they may have reached even greater depths by plunge @-@ diving into the water from the air like some modern long @-@ winged seabirds . In 1994 , Bennett noted that the head , neck , and shoulders of Pteranodon were as heavily built as diving birds , and suggested that they could dive by folding back their wings like the modern gannet . 
 = = = Crest function = = = 
 Pteranodon was notable for its skull crest , though the function of this crest has been a subject of debate . Most explanations have focused on the blade @-@ like , backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps , however , and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex . The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays . Therefore , display was probably the main function of the crest , and any other functions were secondary . 
 Scientific interpretations of the crest 's function began in 1910 , when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities : an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point . He suggested that the crest might have anchored large , long jaw muscles , but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests . Bennett ( 1992 ) agreed with Eaton 's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable to have been a muscle attachment site . Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak , reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head . Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree , but Bennett noted that again , the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps , not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females . Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect , and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would , by themselves , have a negative effect on the balance of the head . In fact , side to side movement of the crests would have required more , not less , neck musculature to control balance . 
 In 1943 , Dominik von <unk> suggested that the crest may have served as a rudder , an idea embraced by several later researchers . One researcher , Ross S. Stein , even suggested that the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward @-@ pointing crest to the neck and back , increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder . The rudder hypothesis again , does not take into account females nor P. sternbergi , which had an upward @-@ pointing , not backward @-@ pointing crest . Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder , the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings . The suggestion that the crest was an air brake , and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down , suffers from a similar problem . Additionally , the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults . 
 Alexander Kellner suggested that the large crests of the pterosaur <unk> , as well as other species , might be used for heat exchange , allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature , which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size . There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose , however , and the large , membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively . 
 With these hypotheses ruled out , the best @-@ supported hypothesis for crest function seems to be as a sexual display . This is consistent with the size variation seen in fossil specimens , where females and juveniles have small crests and males large , elaborate , variable crests . 
 = = = Sexual variation = = = 
 Adult Pteranodon specimens may be divided into two distinct size classes , small and large , with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class , and the small class being twice as common as the large class . Both size classes lived alongside each other , and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species , Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males , and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic . Skulls from the larger size class preserve large , upward and backward pointing crests , while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular . Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low , toward the tip of the beak , which is not seen in smaller specimens . 
 The sex of the different size classes was determined , not from the skulls , but from the pelvic bones . Contrary to what may be expected , the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide @-@ set pelvic bones . Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal , through which eggs would pass . He concluded that the small size class with small , triangular crests represent females , and the larger , large @-@ crested specimens represent males . 
 Note that the overall size and crest size also corresponds to age . Immature specimens are known from both females and males , and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females . Therefore , it seems that the large crests only developed in males when they reached their large , adult size , making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains . 
 The fact that females appear to have outnumbered males two to one suggests that , as with modern animals with size @-@ related sexual dimorphism , such as sea lions and other pinnipeds , Pteranodon might have been polygynous , with a few males competing for association with groups consisting of large numbers of females . Similar to modern pinnipeds , Pteranodon may have competed to establish territory on rocky , offshore rookeries , with the largest , and largest @-@ crested , males gaining the most territory and having more success mating with females . The crests of male Pteranodon would not have been used in competition , but rather as " visual dominance @-@ rank symbols " , with display rituals taking the place of physical competition with other males . If this hypothesis is correct , it also is likely that male Pteranodon played little to no part in rearing the young ; such a behavior is not found in the males of modern polygynous animals who father many offspring at the same time . 
 = = = Terrestrial locomotion = = = 
 Main article : Pterosaur : Ground movement 
 Historically , the terrestrial locomotion of Pteranodon , especially whether it was bipedal or quadrupedal , has been the subject of debate . Today , most pterosaur researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal , thanks largely to the discovery of pterosaur trackways . 
 The possibility of aquatic locomotion via swimming has been discussed briefly in several papers ( Bennett 2001 , 1994 , and Bramwell & Whitfield 1974 ) . 
 = = Discovery and history = = 
 Pteranodon was the first pterosaur found outside of Europe . Its fossils first were found by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1870 , in the Late Cretaceous Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of western Kansas . These chalk beds were deposited at the bottom of what was once the Western Interior Seaway , a large shallow sea over what now is the midsection of the North American continent . These first specimens , YPM 1160 and YPM 1161 , consisted of partial wing bones , as well as a tooth from the prehistoric fish <unk> , which Marsh mistakenly believed to belong to this new pterosaur ( all known pterosaurs up to that point had teeth ) . In 1871 , Marsh named the find Pterodactylus <unk> , assigning it to the well @-@ known ( but much smaller ) European genus Pterodactylus . Marsh also collected more wing bones of the large pterosaur in 1871 . Realizing that the name Pterodactylus oweni already had been used in 1864 for a specimen of the European Pterodactylus , Marsh re @-@ named his North American pterosaur Pterodactylus occidentalis , meaning " Western wing finger , " in his 1872 description of the new specimen . He also named two additional species , based on size differences : Pterodactylus ingens ( the largest specimen so far ) , and Pterodactylus velox ( the smallest ) . 
 Meanwhile , Marsh 's rival Edward Drinker Cope also had unearthed several specimens of the large North American pterosaur . Based on these specimens , Cope named two new species , Ornithochirus umbrosus and Ornithochirus <unk> , in an attempt to assign them to the large European genus <unk> . As he misspelled the name ( forgetting the ' e ' ) , however , he accidentally created an entirely new genus . Cope 's paper naming his ' ' Ornithochirus species was published in 1872 , just five days after Marsh 's paper . This resulted in a dispute , fought in the published literature , over whose names had priority in what obviously were the same species . Cope conceded in 1875 that Marsh 's names did have priority over his , but maintained that Pterodactylus umbrosus was a distinct species ( but not genus ) from any that Marsh had named previously . Re @-@ evaluation by later scientists has supported Marsh 's case , and found that Cope 's assertion that P. umbrosus was a larger , distinct species were incorrect . 
 While the first Pteranodon wing bones were collected by Marsh and Cope in the early 1870s , the first Pteranodon skull was found on May 2 , 1876 , along the Smoky Hill River in Wallace County ( now Logan County ) , Kansas , USA , by Samuel Wendell Williston , a fossil collector working for Marsh . A second , smaller skull soon was discovered as well . These skulls showed that the North American pterosaurs were different from any European species , in that they lacked teeth . Marsh recognized this major difference , describing the specimens as " distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth . " Marsh recognized that this characteristic warranted a new genus , and he coined the name Pteranodon ( " wing without tooth " ) in 1876 . Marsh also reclassified all the previously named North American species from Pterodactylus to Pteranodon , with the larger skull , YPM 1117 , referred to the new species Pteranodon longiceps . He also named an additional species , Pteranodon gracilis , based on a wing bone that he mistook for a pelvic bone . He soon realized his mistake , and re @-@ classified that specimen into a separate genus , which he named Nyctosaurus . 
 Some of the most influential studies of Pteranodon during the 20th century were published by George Francis Eaton , who conducted thorough re @-@ analysis of the known specimens and published some of the first good photographs and illustrations of the best specimens . During the early 1990s , S. Christopher Bennett also published several major papers reviewing the anatomy , taxonomy and life history of Pteranodon . 
 Fragmentary fossils assigned to Pteranodon have also been discovered in Skåne , Sweden . 
 = = Classification = = 
 = = = Valid species = = = 
 Many researchers consider there to be at least two species of Pteranodon . However , aside from the differences between males and females described above , the post @-@ cranial skeletons of Pteranodon show little to no variation between species or specimens , and the bodies and wings of all <unk> were essentially identical . 
 Two species of Pteranodon are traditionally recognized as valid : Pteranodon longiceps , the type species , and Pteranodon sternbergi . The species differ only in the shape of the crest in adult males ( described above ) , and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones . Because well @-@ preserved Pteranodon skull fossils are extremely rare , researchers use stratigraphy ( i.e. which rock layer of the geologic formation a fossil is found in ) to determine species identity in most cases . 
 Pteranodon sternbergi is the only known species of Pteranodon with an upright crest . The lower jaw of P. sternbergi was 1 @.@ 25 meters ( 4 @.@ 1 feet ) long . It was collected by George F. Sternberg in 1952 and described by John Christian <unk> in 1966 , from the lower portion of the Niobrara Formation . It was older than P. longiceps and is considered by Bennett to be the direct ancestor of the later species . 
 Because fossils identifiable as P. sternbergi are found exclusively in the lower layers of the Niobrara Formation , and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers , a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on its position in the geologic column ( though for many early fossil finds , precise data about its location was not recorded , rendering many fossils unidentifiable ) . 
 Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of this genus within <unk> from Andres and Myers ( 2013 ) . 
 = = = Alternate classifications = = = 
 Due to the subtle variations between specimens of <unk> from the Niobrara Formation , most researchers have assigned all of them to the single genus Pteranodon , in at least two species ( P. longiceps and P. sternbergi ) distinguished mainly by the shape of the crest . However , the classification of these two forms has varied from researcher to researcher . In 1972 , Halsey Wilkinson Miller published a paper arguing that the various forms of Pteranodon were different enough to be placed in distinct subgenera . He named these Pteranodon ( <unk> ) occidentalis ( for the now @-@ disused species P. occidentalis ) and Pteranodon ( Sternbergia ) sternbergi . However , the name Sternbergia was preoccupied , and in 1978 Miller re @-@ named the species Pteranodon ( Geosternbergia ) sternbergi , and named a third subgenus / species combination for P. longiceps , as Pteranodon ( <unk> ) longiceps . Most prominent pterosaur researchers of the late 20th century however , including S. Christopher Bennett and Peter Wellnhofer , did not adopt these subgeneric names , and continued to place all pteranodont species into the single genus Pteranodon . 
 In 2010 , pterosaur researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller 's classification . Kellner followed Miller 's opinion that the differences between the Pteranodon species were great enough to place them into different genera . He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller , Geosternbergia , along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male P. longiceps . Kellner argued that this specimen 's crest , though incompletely preserved , was most similar to Geosternbergia . Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia , he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei . Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period , and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei , but because they lack skulls , he could not confidently identify them . 
 = = = Disused species = = = 
 A number of additional species of Pteranodon have been named since the 1870s , although most now are considered to be junior synonyms of two or three valid species . The best @-@ supported is the type species , P. longiceps , based on the well @-@ preserved specimen including the first @-@ known skull found by S. W. Williston . This individual had a wingspan of 7 m ( 23 ft ) . Other valid species include the possibly larger P. sternbergi , with a wingspan originally estimated at 9 m ( 30 ft ) . P. occidentalis , P. velox , P. umbrosus , P. <unk> , and P. <unk> are considered to be nomina dubia by Bennett ( 1994 ) and others who question their validity . All probably are synonymous with the more well @-@ known species . 
 Because the key distinguishing characteristic Marsh noted for Pteranodon was its lack of teeth , any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment , wherever it was found in the world , tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion . The name became a wastebasket taxon , rather like the dinosaur Megalosaurus , to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth . Species ( often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters ) have been reclassified a number of times , and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations , further confusing the taxonomy ( subgenera include <unk> , <unk> , and Geosternbergia ) . Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett , Padian , Unwin , Kellner , and Wellnhofer . Two species , P. <unk> and P. orientalis , are not pteranodontids and have been renamed <unk> oregonensis and <unk> orientalis respectively .

 = Black Sabbath = 
 Black Sabbath are an English rock band , formed in Birmingham in 1968 , by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi , bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler , singer Ozzy Osbourne , and drummer Bill Ward . The band have since experienced multiple line @-@ up changes , with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years . Originally formed as a blues rock band , the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror @-@ inspired lyrics and tuned @-@ down guitars . Despite an association with these two themes , Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability , political corruption , the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war . 
 Osbourne 's regular abuse of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979 . He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio . Following two albums with Dio , Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan , Glenn Hughes , Ray Gillen and Tony Martin , as well as several drummers and bassists . In 1992 , Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer . The original line @-@ up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion . Black Sabbath 's 19th studio album , 13 , which features all of the original members but Ward , was released in June 2013 . 
 Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music . The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath ( 1970 ) , Paranoid ( 1970 ) and Master of Reality ( 1971 ) . They were ranked by MTV as the " Greatest Metal Band " of all time , and placed second in VH1 's " 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock " list . Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " . They have sold over 70 million records worldwide . Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 . They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance .

 Following the break @-@ up of their previous band Mythology in 1968 , guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston , Birmingham . They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne , who had played together in a band called Rare Breed , Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop : " Ozzy Zig Needs Gig – has own PA " . The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band , the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder or an Indian / Pakistani clothing shop ; the exact origin is confused . The Polka Tulk Blues Band featured slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips , a childhood friend of Osbourne 's , and saxophonist Alan " Aker " Clarke . After shortening the name to Polka Tulk , the band again changed their name to Earth ( which Osbourne hated ) and continued as a four @-@ piece without Phillips and Clarke . Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously . Rather than asking them to leave , they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four @-@ piece . While the band was performing under the Earth title , they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as " The Rebel " , " Song for Jim " , and " When I Came Down " . The demo titled " Song for Jim " was in reference to Jim Simpson . Jim Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony . Simpson was also a trumpet player for the group Locomotive . Simpson had recently opened a new pub named Henry 's Blues House and offered to let Earth play some gigs in his club . The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth . 
 In December 1968 , Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull . Although his stint with the band would be short @-@ lived , Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show . Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull , Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969 . " It just wasn 't right , so I left " , Iommi said . " At first I thought Tull were great , but I didn 't much go for having a leader in the band , which was Ian Anderson 's way . When I came back from Tull , I came back with a new attitude altogether . They taught me that to get on , you got to work for it . " 
 While playing shows in England in 1969 , the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth . They decided to change their name again . A cinema across the street from the band 's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava . While watching people line up to see the film , Butler noted that it was " strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies . " Following that , Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called " Black Sabbath " , which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure @-@ story writer Dennis Wheatley , along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed . Making use of the musical tritone , also known as " the Devil 's Interval " , the song 's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction , a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s , which was dominated by flower power , folk music , and hippie culture . Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track " probably the most evil song ever written " . Inspired by the new sound , the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969 , and made the decision to focus on writing similar material , in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films . 
 = = = Black Sabbath and Paranoid ( 1970 – 71 ) = = = 
 The band 's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969 , in Workington . They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969 , and released their first single , " Evil Woman " ( a cover of a song by the band Crow ) , recorded at Trident Studios , through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records in January 1970 . Later releases were handled by Philips ' newly formed progressive rock label , Vertigo Records . 
 Black Sabbath 's first major exposure came when the band appeared on John Peel 's Top Gear radio show in 1969 , performing " Black Sabbath " , " <unk> " , " Behind the Wall of Sleep " , and " Sleeping Village " to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced . Although the " Evil Woman " single failed to chart , the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain . Iommi recalls recording live : " We thought ' We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing . ' So we played live . Ozzy was singing at the same time , we just put him in a separate booth and off we went . We never had a second run of most of the stuff . " 
 Black Sabbath was released on Friday the 13th , February 1970 , and reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart . Following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records , the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200 , where it remained for over a year . The album was a commercial success but was widely panned by some critics . Lester Bangs dismissed it in a Rolling Stone review as " discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like <unk> <unk> all over each other 's musical perimeters , yet never quite finding synch " . It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned , giving the band their first mainstream exposure . It has since been certified platinum in both US by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . 
 To capitalise on their chart success in the US , the band returned to the studio in June 1970 , just four months after Black Sabbath was released . The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song " War Pigs " , which was critical of the Vietnam War ; however , Warner changed the title of the album to Paranoid . The album 's lead @-@ off single , " Paranoid " , was written in the studio at the last minute . Ward explains : " We didn 't have enough songs for the album , and Tony just played the [ Paranoid ] guitar lick and that was it . It took twenty , twenty @-@ five minutes from top to bottom . " The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts , remaining Black Sabbath 's only top ten hit . The album followed in the UK in October 1970 , where , pushed by the success of the " Paranoid " single , it made number one in the charts . 
 The US release was held off until January 1971 , as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of Paranoid 's UK release . Black Sabbath subsequently toured America for the first time and played their first US show at a club called Ungano 's at 210 West 70th Street in New York City . The album reached No. 12 in the US in March 1971 , and would go on to sell four million copies in the US , with virtually no radio airplay . Like Black Sabbath , the album was panned by rock critics of the era , but modern @-@ day reviewers such as AllMusic 's Steve Huey cite Paranoid as " one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time " , which " defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history " . The album was ranked at No. 131 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . Paranoid 's chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970 , which spawned the release of the album 's second single " Iron Man " . Although the single failed to reach the top 40 , " Iron Man " remains one of Black Sabbath 's most popular songs , as well as the band 's highest charting US single until 1998 's " Psycho Man " .

 In February 1971 , after a one off performance at the <unk> Pop Festival in Australia , Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album . Following the chart success of Paranoid , the band were afforded more studio time , along with a " briefcase full of cash " to buy drugs . " We were getting into coke , big time " , Ward explained . " Uppers , downers , Quaaludes , whatever you like . It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them , because you were just so out of it . " 
 Production completed in April 1971 , in July the band released Master of Reality , just six months after the US release of Paranoid . The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK , and was certified gold in less than two months , eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century . Master of Reality contained Black Sabbath 's first acoustic songs , alongside fan favourites such as " Children of the Grave " and " Sweet Leaf " . Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable , with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of Master of Reality in Rolling Stone , describing the closing song " Children of the Grave " as " naïve , simplistic , repetitive , absolute doggerel – but in the tradition [ of rock 'n'roll ] ... The only criterion is excitement , and Black Sabbath 's got it " . In 2003 , Rolling Stone would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list . 
 Following the Master of Reality world tour in 1972 , Black Sabbath took its first break in three years . As Ward explained : " The band started to become very fatigued and very tired . We 'd been on the road non @-@ stop , year in and year out , constantly touring and recording . I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era , the first three albums , and we decided to take our time with the next album . " 
 In June 1972 , the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant . The recording process was plagued with problems , many as a result of substance abuse issues . While struggling to record the song " Cornucopia " after " sitting in the middle of the room , just doing drugs " , Ward was nearly fired from the band . " I hated the song , there were some patterns that were just ... horrible " Ward said . " I nailed it in the end , but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody . It was like ' Well , just go home , you 're not being of any use right now . ' I felt like I 'd blown it , I was about to get fired " . The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name , which deals with cocaine abuse . The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol . 4 , with Ward stating " There was no Volume 1 , 2 or 3 , so it 's a pretty stupid title really " . 
 Black Sabbath Vol . 4 was released in September 1972 , and while critics were dismissive of the album upon release , it achieved gold status in less than a month , and was the band 's fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US . With more time in the studio , the album saw the band starting to experiment with new textures , such as strings , piano , orchestration and multi @-@ part songs . The song " Tomorrow 's Dream " was released as a single – the band 's first since " Paranoid " – but failed to chart . Following an extensive tour of the US , in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia , followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand , before moving onto mainland Europe .

 Following the Volume 4 world tour , Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release . Pleased with the Volume 4 album , the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere , and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles . With new musical innovations of the era , the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a " giant synthesiser " . The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973 , but in part because of substance issues and fatigue , they were unable to complete any songs . " Ideas weren 't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent " Iommi said . " Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something . I just couldn 't think of anything . And if I didn 't come up with anything , nobody would do anything . " 
 After a month in Los Angeles with no results , the band opted to return to England . They rented <unk> Castle in The Forest of Dean . " We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere , it conjured up things , and stuff started coming out again . " While working in the dungeon , Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " , which set the tone for the new material . Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on Volume 4 , new songs incorporated synthesisers , strings , and complex arrangements . Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player , appearing on " <unk> <unk> " . 
 In November 1973 , Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath , with Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone calling the album " an extraordinarily gripping affair " , and " nothing less than a complete success . " Later reviewers such as Allmusic 's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a " masterpiece , essential to any heavy metal collection " , while also displaying " a newfound sense of finesse and maturity . " The album marked the band 's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US , reaching number four on the UK charts , and number eleven in the US . 
 The band began a world tour in January 1974 , which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario , California on 6 April 1974 . Attracting over 200 @,@ 000 fans , Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands Deep Purple , Eagles , Emerson , Lake & Palmer , Rare Earth , Seals & Crofts , Black Oak Arkansas , and Earth , Wind & Fire . Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US , exposing the band to a wider American audience . In the same year , the band shifted management , signing with notorious English manager Don Arden . The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath 's former management , and while on stage in the US , Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation . 
 Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975 , again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden , this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath , Bloody Sabbath . " We could 've continued and gone on and on , getting more technical , using orchestras and everything else which we didn 't particularly want to . We took a look at ourselves , and we wanted to do a rock album – Sabbath , Bloody Sabbath wasn 't a rock album , really . " Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher , Sabotage was released in July 1975 . As with its precursor , the album initially saw favourable reviews , with Rolling Stone stating " Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath 's best record since Paranoid , it might be their best ever " , although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that " the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate " . 
 Sabotage reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK , but was the band 's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US , only achieving Gold certification . Although the album 's only single " Am I Going Insane ( Radio ) " failed to chart , Sabotage features fan favourites such as " Hole in the Sky " , and " Symptom of the Universe " . Black Sabbath toured in support of Sabotage with openers Kiss , but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975 , following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back . In December 1975 , the band 's record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band , titled We Sold Our Soul for Rock ' n ' Roll . The album charted throughout 1976 , eventually selling two million copies in the US . 
 = = = Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die ! ( 1976 – 79 ) = = = 
 Black Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami , Florida , in June 1976 . To expand their sound , the band added keyboard player Gerry <unk> , who also had appeared to a lesser extent on Sabotage . During the recording of Technical Ecstasy , Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians . Recording of Technical Ecstasy was difficult ; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain . It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews , and ( for the first time ) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews ; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars , and noted that the band was " unravelling at an alarming rate " . The album featured less of the doomy , ominous sound of previous efforts , and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs . Technical Ecstasy failed to reach the top 50 in the US , and was the band 's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status , although it was later certified gold in 1997 . The album included " Dirty Women " , which remains a live staple , as well as Ward 's first lead vocal on the song " It 's Alright " . Touring in support of Technical Ecstasy began in November 1976 , with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the US , and completed in Europe with AC / DC in April 1977 . 
 In late 1977 , while in rehearsal for their next album , and just days before the band was set to enter the studio , Osbourne abruptly quit the band . Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker , a longtime friend of the band , who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown , and informed him that Osbourne had left the band . Walker , who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress , flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath . On 8 January 1978 , Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals , playing an early version of the song " Junior 's Eyes " on the BBC Television program " Look ! Hear ! " . Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne wasn 't fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath . " The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me " , Osbourne said . " I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company , just to get fat on beer and put a record out . " Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used . If any recordings of this version of the band other than the " Look ! Hear ! " footage still exist , Walker says that he is not aware of them . 
 Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer @-@ Binnie , Terry <unk> , and Andy <unk> . As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978 , Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath . " Three days before we were due to go into the studio , Ozzy wanted to come back to the band " , Iommi explained . " He wouldn 't sing any of the stuff we 'd written with the other guy ( Walker ) , so it made it very difficult . We went into the studio with basically no songs . We 'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night . It was so difficult , like a conveyor belt , because you couldn 't get time to reflect on stuff . ' Is this right ? Is this working properly ? ' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick . " 
 The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto , Canada , writing and recording what would become Never Say Die ! . " It took quite a long time " , Iommi said . " We were getting really drugged out , doing a lot of dope . We 'd go down to the sessions , and have to pack up because we were too stoned , we 'd have to stop . Nobody could get anything right , we were all over the place , everybody 's playing a different thing . We 'd go back and sleep it off , and try again the next day . " The album was released in September 1978 , reaching number twelve in the UK , and number 69 in the US . Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album 's " unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band 's tense personnel problems and drug abuse . " The album featured the singles " Never Say Die " and " Hard Road " , both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK . The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops , performing " Never Say Die " . It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US . 
 Touring in support of Never Say Die ! began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen . Reviewers called Black Sabbath 's performance " tired and uninspired " , a stark contrast to the " youthful " performance of Van Halen , who were touring the world for the first time . The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978 , which was later released on DVD as Never Say Die . The final show of the tour , and Osbourne 's last appearance with the band ( until later reunions ) was in Albuquerque , New Mexico on 11 December . 
 Following the tour , Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air , where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album . The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs , but Iommi says Osbourne " was on a totally different level altogether " . The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them . Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne 's lack of input coming to a head , Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979 . Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely . " At that time , Ozzy had come to an end " , Iommi said . " We were all doing a lot of drugs , a lot of coke , a lot of everything , and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time . We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening . It was like ' <unk> today ? No , we 'll do it tomorrow . ' It really got so bad that we didn 't do anything . It just fizzled out . " Drummer Ward , who was close with Osbourne , was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979 . " I hope I was professional , I might not have been , actually . When I 'm drunk I am horrible , I am horrid " , Ward said . " Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath . We were destined to destroy each other . The band were toxic , very toxic . "

 Sharon Arden ( later Sharon Osbourne ) , daughter of Black Sabbath manager Don Arden , suggested former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 . Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band , as he viewed the original line @-@ up as the most profitable . Dio officially joined in June , and the band began writing their next album . With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne 's , Dio 's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath 's sound . " They were totally different altogether " , Iommi explains . " Not only voice @-@ wise , but attitude @-@ wise . Ozzy was a great showman , but when Dio came in , it was a different attitude , a different voice and a different musical approach , as far as vocals . Dio would sing across the riff , whereas Ozzy would follow the riff , like in " Iron Man " . Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing . " 
 Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons . According to Dio , the band initially hired Craig Gruber ( with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf ) on bass to assist with writing the new album . Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz . The new line @-@ up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work , with Butler returning to the band in January 1980 , and Nicholls moving to keyboards . Produced by Martin Birch , Heaven and Hell was released on 25 April 1980 , to critical acclaim . Over a decade after its release Allmusic said the album was " one of Sabbath 's finest records , the band sounds reborn and re @-@ energised throughout " . Heaven and Hell peaked at number 9 in the UK , and number 28 in the US , the band 's highest charting album since Sabotage . The album eventually sold a million copies in the US , and the band embarked on an extensive world tour , making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980 . 
 Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with Blue Öyster Cult on the " Black and Blue " tour , with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale , New York filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as Black and Blue . On 26 July 1980 , the band played to 75 @,@ 000 fans at a sold @-@ out Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Journey , Cheap Trick , and Molly Hatchet . The next day , the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum . While on tour , Black Sabbath 's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven @-@ year @-@ old performance , titled Live at Last without any input from the band . The album reached number five on the British charts , and saw the re @-@ release of " Paranoid " as a single , which reached the top 20 . 
 On 18 August 1980 , after a show in Minneapolis , Ward quit the band . " It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy . And I drank 24 hours a day , my alcoholism accelerated " . Geezer Butler stated that after the show , Ward came in drunk , talking about the things where " He might as well be a Martian " . Ward then got angry , and decided to pack his things , and get on a bus to leave . The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward . 
 The band completed the Heaven and Hell world tour in February 1981 , and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album . Black Sabbath 's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist Mob Rules was released in October 1981 , to be well received by fans , but less so by the critics . Rolling Stone reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star , claiming " Mob Rules finds the band as dull @-@ witted and flatulent as ever " . Like most of the band 's earlier work , time helped to improve the opinions of the music press , a decade after its release , Allmusic 's Eduardo Rivadavia called Mob Rules " a magnificent record " . The album was certified gold , and reached the top 20 on the UK charts . The album 's title track " The Mob Rules " , which was recorded at John Lennon 's old house in England , also featured in the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal , although the film version is an alternate take , and differs from the album version . 
 Unhappy with the quality of 1980 's Live at Last , the band recorded another live album — titled Live Evil — during the Mob Rules world tour , across the United States in Dallas , San Antonio , and Seattle , in 1982 . During the mixing process for the album , Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio . <unk> by their then @-@ current mixing engineer , Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals . In addition , Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork . Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album 's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath . " Ronnie wanted more say in things , " Iommi said . " And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in . Live Evil is when it all fell apart . Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing , and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn 't know what to do , because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another . At the end of the day , we just said , ' That 's it , the band is over ' " . " When it comes time for the vocal , nobody tells me what to do . Nobody ! Because they 're not as good as me , so I do what I want to do , " Dio later said . " I refuse to listen to Live Evil , because there are too many problems . If you look at the credits , the vocals and drums are listed off to the side . Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony , and how many there are of me and Vinny " . 
 Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band , and took drummer Vinny Appice with him . Live Evil was released in January 1983 , but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne 's platinum selling album Speak of the Devil .

 The remaining two original members , Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler , began auditioning new singers for the band 's next release . Samson 's Nicky Moore , and Lone Star 's John Sloman were considered . The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982 . While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath , pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name . The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton @-@ on @-@ Cherwell , Oxfordshire , in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums . Born Again was panned upon release by critics . Despite the negative reception of the album , it reached number four on the UK charts , and number 39 in the US . Even a decade after its release Allmusic 's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album " dreadful " , noting that " Gillan 's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom " . 
 Although he performed on the album , drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road , and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album . " I fell apart with the idea of touring " , Ward later said . " I got so much fear behind touring , I didn 't talk about the fear , I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake . " Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again ' 83 - ' 84 world tour , ( often unofficially referred to as the ' <unk> Death Sabbath ' 83 – ' 84 ' World Tour ) which began in Europe with Diamond Head , and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger . The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England , adding the Deep Purple song " Smoke on the Water " to their set list . 
 The tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument . In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap , the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece . As Geezer Butler later explained :
