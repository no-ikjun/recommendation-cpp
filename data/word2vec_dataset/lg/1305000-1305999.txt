 The music video for " The World Is Not Enough " was directed by Philipp Stölzl for Oil Factory Films and filmed on a London sound stage on September 23 – 24 , 1999 . Manson 's android shots ( the laboratory , kissing and driving scenes ) were filmed on the first day , with the pyrotechnic scenes shot on the second . For her " death " , Manson kissed a lookalike model . The University of London 's Senate House was the exterior for the fictional New Globe Theatre . Post @-@ production and editing were completed two weeks later . 
 In the video ( set in 1964 ) terrorists build an android replica of Shirley Manson , who can kill her targets with a kiss , on an unnamed Pacific island . The android is fitted with a bomb , primed before it leaves on its mission . The android makes its way to Chicago 's New Globe Theater and lets itself into Shirley Manson 's dressing room , killing Manson and assuming her identity to perform the coda of a song on a large steel globe . As the android and the band receive a standing ovation from the audience , the bomb counts down . Smiling , the android Manson thrusts its arms in the air ; the screen blacks out as the timer reaches zero , and an explosion is heard . 
 Stölzl ( chosen by Garbage ) drew up a treatment liked by the band , but MGM and Eon ( who commissioned the video ) did not consider it " Bond enough " . Stölzl 's reworked storyboard featured Manson as an android clone who kills her human counterpart , a concept the band also liked . He provided a special @-@ effects company with sketches of the android , and a replica was constructed with aircraft and missile parts , tubing , metal and plastic . The android was combined with Manson in post @-@ production to show its mechanical interior . " It reminds me of The Man Who Knew Too Much . Some of the shots look like Stanley Kubrick " , recalled Vig . " For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video . " " [ It 's ] like a mini @-@ Bond action @-@ packed film , where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a kamikaze warrior . That 's as close as we 'll ever get [ to being in a Bond movie ] , " Manson later said . 
 The video 's filming was documented by a Making the Video camera crew , and premiered on MTV after the program on October 20 , 1999 ; it debuted in the United Kingdom and on Total Request Live the following day . A version of the video featuring footage from the film was shown in some countries ; to preserve the video 's narrative , the film footage appeared on a split screen . " The World Is Not Enough " video was included on the film 's 2000 DVD release and Garbage 's 2007 greatest @-@ hits DVD compilation , Absolute Garbage .

 In North America , Radioactive distributed both versions of " The World Is Not Enough " to AAA , Alternative , Modern Adult and Modern Rock radio stations on October 4 , 1999 . Originally planned for introduction a week later , the radio date was moved up when a Los Angeles station broadcast a ripped , low @-@ quality MP3 of the Chilled Out remix circulated on file @-@ sharing networks early . The single 's release coincided with Garbage 's return to North America to headline an MTV @-@ sponsored Campus Invasion Tour . The band introduced " The World Is Not Enough " on October 20 during a concert at the University of Denver . On November 1 , Garbage performed the song live on the Late Show with David Letterman . 
 Radioactive released " The World Is Not Enough " in the United Kingdom on November 15 as a limited edition digipak CD single and a cassette single . Both formats were backed with " Ice Bandits " , an orchestral track from the David Arnold film score . The CD also included a remix produced by trip hop act Unkle . After one week , " The World Is Not Enough " debuted at No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart ; Garbage 's tenth top @-@ forty single , it remained on the UK charts for nine weeks . In Ireland , " The World Is Not Enough " peaked at # 30 . 
 The song 's music video was aired before the November 11 worldwide live broadcast of the MTV Europe Music Awards . MTV heavily promoted the film during the awards , giving away a BMW Z8 ( Bond 's car in the film and Shirley Manson 's in the video ) . Radioactive released the single in Europe from November 15 to December 6 as a three @-@ track CD digipak and a two @-@ track card @-@ sleeve single , backed with " Ice Bandits " . At the end of November , " The World Is Not Enough " debuted at No. 3 in Iceland before reaching No. 1 the following week . It debuted at No. 54 in Sweden at No. 7 in Norway , and No. 10 in Finland , where it peaked at No. 7 in its second week . In the Netherlands the single debuted at No. 74 , rising to No. 48 two weeks later . It debuted at # 55 in France and No. 12 in Wallonia . In December the song debuted at No. 40 in Austria , remaining there for four weeks . It debuted at No. 22 in Switzerland , rising to No. 16 four weeks later at the beginning of January 2000 . At the end of December , the song debuted at No. 18 in Italy before peaking at No. 6 in February 2000 . Also in December , " The World Is Not Enough " peaked at # 38 in Germany and No. 12 in Spain . 
 Radioactive followed the single with The World Is Not Enough 's soundtrack album , featuring " Ice Bandits " and " Only Myself to Blame " ( a second David Arnold @-@ Don Black composition , sung by Scott Walker during the end credits ) . The album was released in North America on November 9 , and then internationally . " The World Is Not Enough " was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of Garbage 's third album , Beautiful Garbage , and was remastered for Absolute Garbage . It was also included in three editions of the James Bond music compilation The Best of Bond ... James Bond : in 2002 , 2008 and 2012 .

 " The World Is Not Enough " received mainly positive reviews from music critics . Kerrang ! magazine noted that " Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme , and Garbage 's ever @-@ burgeoning celebrity will be done no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem . " A Radio Times reviewer wrote that the song " sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited " , while AllMusic 's Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage " expertly modernized the classic Bond sound , while turning in a strong melodic tune . A first class theme song " . PopMatters called the song a " top @-@ notch Bond theme " , following the Shirley Bassey template . In a Billboard review , Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song " rings of international intrigue , with the slinky gait , noir @-@ ish guitar line and grand chorus we have come to expect ... the song 's darkly sexy , electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage 's distinctive <unk> . [ It is ] not only the best 007 theme in eons , it is a great Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike " . IGN ranked " The World Is Not Enough " ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs : " Shirley Manson 's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold 's sweeping symphonics . " 
 Negative reviews revolved around the theme 's classic Bond sound . LAUNCHcast 's James Poletti called the song a " perfectly competent Bond theme " , but " the formula seems a little too easy . Perhaps they would have done better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different , something a little more knowingly tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek . " Melody Maker stated , " You know what this sounds like before you hear it . If the people in charge want Garbage , then why not let them do what Garbage do ? " In its review of Absolute Garbage , Pitchfork Media called the song a " predictable ' Goldfinger ' permutation signaling the band 's limitless affinity for big @-@ budget theatrics . " 
 The song appeared in two " best of 1999 " radio @-@ station polls : No. 87 in 89X 's Top 89 Songs of 1999 and No. 100 in <unk> 's Top 101 of 1999 . In 2012 Grantland ranked " The World Is Not Enough " the second @-@ best Bond song of all time , behind " Goldfinger " .

 = Eris ( dwarf planet ) = 
 Eris ( minor @-@ planet designation 136199 Eris ) is the most massive and second @-@ largest dwarf planet known in the Solar System . It is also the ninth @-@ most @-@ massive known body directly orbiting the Sun , and the largest known body in the Solar System not visited by a spacecraft . It is measured to be 2 @,@ 326 ± 12 kilometers ( 1 @,@ 445 @.@ 3 ± 7 @.@ 5 mi ) in diameter . Eris is 27 % more massive than dwarf planet Pluto , though Pluto is slightly larger by volume . Eris 's mass is about 0 @.@ 27 % of the Earth 's mass . 
 Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory – based team led by Mike Brown , and its identity was verified later that year . It is a trans @-@ Neptunian object ( TNO ) and a member of a high @-@ eccentricity population known as the scattered disk . It has one known moon , Dysnomia . As of February 2016 , its distance from the Sun is 96 @.@ 3 astronomical units ( 1 @.@ 441 × 1010 km ; 8 @.@ 95 × 109 mi ) , roughly three times that of Pluto . With the exception of some comets , Eris and Dysnomia are currently the second @-@ most @-@ distant known natural objects in the Solar System , the farthest object being <unk> discovered in November 2015 at 103 AU . 
 Because Eris appeared to be larger than Pluto , NASA initially described it as the Solar System 's tenth planet . This , along with the prospect of other objects of similar size being discovered in the future , motivated the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) to define the term planet for the first time . Under the IAU definition approved on August 24 , 2006 , Eris is a " dwarf planet " , along with objects such as Pluto , Ceres , Haumea and Makemake , thereby reducing the number of known planets in the Solar System to eight , the same as before Pluto 's discovery in 1930 . Observations of a stellar occultation by Eris in 2010 showed that its diameter was 2 @,@ 326 ± 12 kilometers ( 1 @,@ 445 @.@ 3 ± 7 @.@ 5 mi ) , not significantly different from that of Pluto . After New Horizons measured Pluto 's diameter as 2372 ± 4 km in July 2015 , it was determined that Eris is slightly smaller in diameter than Pluto . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Eris was discovered by the team of Mike Brown , Chad Trujillo , and David Rabinowitz on January 5 , 2005 , from images taken on October 21 , 2003 . The discovery was announced on July 29 , 2005 , the same day as Makemake and two days after Haumea , due in part to events that would later lead to controversy about Haumea . The search team had been systematically scanning for large outer Solar System bodies for several years , and had been involved in the discovery of several other large TNOs , including 50000 Quaoar , <unk> Orcus , and 90377 Sedna . 
 Routine observations were taken by the team on October 21 , 2003 , using the 1 @.@ 2 m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory , California , but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky : The team 's automatic image @-@ searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1 @.@ 5 arcseconds per hour to reduce the number of false positives returned . When Sedna was discovered , it was moving at 1 @.@ 75 arcsec / h , and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion , sorting through the previously excluded images by eye . In January 2005 , the re @-@ analysis revealed Eris 's slow motion against the background stars . 
 Follow @-@ up observations were then carried out to make a preliminary determination of Eris 's orbit , which allowed the object 's distance to be estimated . The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Eris and Makemake until further observations and calculations were complete , but announced them both on July 29 when the discovery of another large TNO they had been tracking , Haumea , was controversially announced on July 27 by a different team in Spain . 
 More observations released in October 2005 revealed that Eris has a moon , later named Dysnomia . Observations of Dysnomia 's orbit permitted scientists to determine the mass of Eris , which in June 2007 they calculated to be ( 1 @.@ 66 ± 0 @.@ 02 ) × 1022 kg , 27 % ± 2 % greater than Pluto 's . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Eris is named after the goddess Eris ( Greek <unk> ) , a personification of strife and discord . The name was assigned on September 13 , 2006 , following an unusually long period in which the object was known by the provisional designation 2003 UB313 , which was granted automatically by the IAU under their naming protocols for minor planets . The regular adjectival form of Eris is <unk> . 
 = = = = Xena = = = = 
 Due to uncertainty over whether the object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet , because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects , the decision on what to name the object had to wait until after the August 24 , 2006 , IAU ruling . As a result , for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena . 
 " Xena " was an informal name used internally by the discovery team . It was inspired by the title character of the television series Xena : Warrior Princess . The discovery team had reportedly saved the nickname " Xena " for the first body they discovered that was larger than Pluto . According to Brown , 
 We chose it since it started with an X ( planet " X " ) , it sounds mythological ( OK , so it 's TV mythology , but Pluto is named after a cartoon , right ? ) , and ( this part is actually true ) we 've been working to get more female deities out there ( e.g. Sedna ) . Also , at the time , the TV show was still on TV , which shows you how long we 've been searching ! 
 " We assumed [ that ] a real name would come out fairly quickly , [ but ] the process got stalled " , Mike Brown said in interview , 
 One reporter called me up from the New York Times who happened to have been a friend of mine from college , [ and ] I was a little less guarded with him than I am with the normal press . He asked me , " What 's the name you guys proposed ? " and I said , " Well , I 'm not going to tell . " And he said , " Well , what do you guys call it when you 're just talking amongst yourselves ? " ... As far as I remember this was the only time I told anybody this in the press , and then it got everywhere , which I only sorta felt bad about — I kinda like the name . 
 = = = = Choosing an official name = = = = 
 According to science writer Govert Schilling , Brown initially wanted to call the object " Lila " , after a concept in Hindu mythology that described the cosmos as the outcome of a game played by Brahma . The name was very similar to " Lilah " , the name of Brown 's newborn daughter . Brown was mindful of not making his name public before it had been officially accepted . He had done so with Sedna a year previously , and had been heavily criticized . However , no objection was raised to the Sedna name other than the breach of protocol , and no competing names were suggested for Sedna . 
 He listed the address of his personal web page announcing the discovery as / ~ <unk> / <unk> and in the chaos following the controversy over the discovery of Haumea , forgot to change it . Rather than needlessly anger more of his fellow astronomers , he simply said that the webpage had been named for his daughter and dropped " Lila " from consideration . 
 Brown had also speculated that Persephone , the wife of the god Pluto , would be a good name for the object . The name had been used several times in science fiction , and was popular with the public , having handily won a poll conducted by New Scientist magazine ( " Xena " , despite only being a nickname , came fourth ) . This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet , because there is already an asteroid with that name , 399 Persephone . 
 With the dispute resolved , the discovery team proposed Eris on September 6 , 2006 . On September 13 , 2006 this name was accepted as the official name by the IAU . Brown decided that , because the object had been considered a planet for so long , it deserved a name from Greek or Roman mythology , like the other planets . The asteroids had taken the vast majority of Graeco @-@ Roman names . Eris , whom Brown described as his favorite goddess , had fortunately escaped inclusion . The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by the debate over the object 's ( and Pluto 's ) classification . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Eris is a trans @-@ Neptunian dwarf planet ( plutoid ) . Its orbital characteristics more specifically categorize it as a scattered @-@ disk object ( SDO ) , or a TNO that has been " scattered " from the Kuiper belt into more @-@ distant and unusual orbits following gravitational interactions with Neptune as the Solar System was forming . Although its high orbital inclination is unusual among the known SDOs , theoretical models suggest that objects that were originally near the inner edge of the Kuiper belt were scattered into orbits with higher inclinations than objects from the outer belt . Inner @-@ belt objects are expected to be generally more massive than outer @-@ belt objects , and so astronomers expect to discover more large objects like Eris in high @-@ inclination orbits , which have traditionally been neglected . 
 Because Eris was initially thought to be larger than Pluto , it was described as the " tenth planet " by NASA and in media reports of its discovery . In response to the uncertainty over its status , and because of ongoing debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a planet , the IAU delegated a group of astronomers to develop a sufficiently precise definition of the term planet to decide the issue . This was announced as the IAU 's Definition of a Planet in the Solar System , adopted on August 24 , 2006 . At this time , both Eris and Pluto were classified as dwarf planets , a category distinct from the new definition of planet . Brown has since stated his approval of this classification . The IAU subsequently added Eris to its Minor Planet Catalogue , designating it ( 136199 ) Eris . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Eris has an orbital period of 558 years . Its maximum possible distance from the Sun ( aphelion ) is 97 @.@ 65 AU , and its closest ( perihelion ) is 37 @.@ 91 AU . It came to perihelion between 1698 and 1699 , to aphelion around 1977 , and will return to perihelion around <unk> to <unk> . Eris and its moon are currently the second most distant known objects in the Solar System , after <unk> , apart from long @-@ period comets and space probes . Approximately forty known TNOs , most notably 2006 <unk> , 2000 <unk> and Sedna , though currently closer to the Sun than Eris , have greater average orbital distances than Eris 's semimajor axis of 67 @.@ 7 AU . 
 Eris 's orbit is highly eccentric , and brings Eris to within 37 @.@ 9 AU of the Sun , a typical perihelion for scattered objects . This is within the orbit of Pluto , but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune ( 29 @.@ 8 – 30 @.@ 4 AU ) . Pluto , on the other hand , like other plutinos , follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and , protected by orbital resonance , can cross Neptune 's orbit . It is possible that Eris is in a 17 : 5 resonance with Neptune , though further observations will be required to check that hypothesis . Unlike the eight planets , whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth 's , Eris 's orbit is highly inclined : It is tilted at an angle of about 44 degrees to the ecliptic . In about 800 years , Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time ( see the graph at the right ) . 
 As of February 2016 , Eris has an apparent magnitude of 18 @.@ 7 , making it bright enough to be detectable to some amateur telescopes . A 200 @-@ millimetre ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) telescope with a CCD can detect Eris under favorable conditions . The reason it had not been noticed until now is its steep orbital inclination ; most searches for large outer Solar System objects concentrate on the ecliptic plane , where most bodies are found . 
 Because of the high inclination of its orbit , Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac ; it is now in the constellation Cetus . It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875 . In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065 , when it will enter Aries . It will then move into the northern sky , entering Perseus in <unk> and Camelopardalis ( where it will reach its northernmost declination ) in <unk> . 
 = = Size , mass and density = = 
 In 2005 , the diameter of Eris was measured to be <unk> ± 100 km , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) . The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude ( H ) and the albedo ( the amount of light it reflects ) . At a distance of 97 AU , an object with a diameter of 3 @,@ 000 km would have an angular size of 40 milliarcseconds , which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope . Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities , sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately . 
 This makes Eris around the same size as Pluto , which is 2372 ± 4 km across . It also indicates an albedo of 0 @.@ 96 , higher than that of any other large body in the Solar System except Enceladus . It is speculated that the high albedo is due to the surface ices being replenished because of temperature fluctuations as Eris 's eccentric orbit takes it closer and farther from the Sun . 
 In 2007 , a series of observations of the largest trans @-@ Neptunian objects with the Spitzer Space Telescope gave an estimate of Eris 's diameter of 2600 + 400 
 − 200 km . The Spitzer and Hubble estimates overlap in the range of 2 @,@ 400 – 2 @,@ 500 km , 4 – 8 % larger than Pluto . Astronomers now suspect that Eris 's spin axis is currently pointing toward the Sun , which would make the sunlit hemisphere warmer than average and skew any infrared measurements toward higher values . So the outcome from the 2010 Chile occultation is actually more in line with the Hubble result from 2005 . 
 In November 2010 , Eris was the subject of one of the most distant stellar occultations yet from Earth . Preliminary data from this event cast doubt on previous size estimates . The teams announced their final results from the occultation in October 2011 , with an estimated diameter of 2326 + 6 
 − 6 km . The mass of Eris can be calculated with much greater precision . Based on the currently accepted value for Dysnomia 's period — 15 @.@ 774 days — Eris is 27 percent more massive than Pluto . If the 2011 occultation results are used , then Eris has a density of 2 @.@ 52 ± 0 @.@ 07 g / cm3 , substantially denser than Pluto , and thus must be composed largely of rocky materials . 
 Models of internal heating via radioactive decay suggest that Eris could have an internal ocean of liquid water at the mantle – core boundary . 
 In July 2015 , after nearly ten years of Eris being considered the ninth @-@ largest object known to directly orbit the sun , close @-@ up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto 's volume to be slightly larger than Eris 's , rather than slightly smaller as previously thought . Eris is now the tenth @-@ largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume , though not by mass . 
 = = Surface and atmosphere = = 
 The discovery team followed up their initial identification of Eris with spectroscopic observations made at the 8 m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii on January 25 , 2005 . Infrared light from the object revealed the presence of methane ice , indicating that the surface may be similar to that of Pluto , which at the time was the only TNO known to have surface methane , and of Neptune 's moon Triton , which also has methane on its surface . No surface details can be resolved from Earth or its orbit with any instrument currently available . 
 Due to Eris 's distant eccentric orbit , its surface temperature is estimated to vary between about 30 and 56 K ( − 243 @.@ 2 and − 217 @.@ 2 ° C ) . 
 Unlike the somewhat reddish Pluto and Triton , Eris appears almost white . Pluto 's reddish color is thought to be due to deposits of tholins on its surface , and where these deposits darken the surface , the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits . In contrast , Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low . The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins . 
 Even though Eris can be up to three times farther from the Sun than Pluto , it approaches close enough that some of the ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime . Because methane is highly volatile , its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System , where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist , or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere . This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO , Haumea , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane . 
 = = Satellite = = 
 In 2005 , the adaptive optics team at the Keck telescopes in Hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest TNOs ( Pluto , Makemake , Haumea , and Eris ) , using the newly commissioned laser guide star adaptive optics system . Images taken on September 10 revealed a moon in orbit around Eris . In keeping with the " Xena " nickname already in use for Eris , Brown 's team nicknamed the moon " Gabrielle " , after the television warrior princess ' sidekick . When Eris received its official name from the IAU , the moon received the name Dysnomia , after the Greek goddess of lawlessness who was Eris 's daughter . Brown says he picked it for similarity to his wife 's name , Diane . The name also retains an oblique reference to Eris 's old informal name Xena , portrayed on TV by Lucy Lawless .

 It was calculated that a flyby mission to Eris could take 24 @.@ 66 years using a Jupiter gravity assist , based on launch dates of 3 April 2032 or 7 April 2044 . Eris would be 92 @.@ 03 or 90 @.@ 19 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives . 
 = Tyrannosauroidea = 
 Tyrannosauroidea ( meaning ' tyrant lizard forms ' ) is a superfamily ( or clade ) of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs that includes the family Tyrannosauridae as well as more basal relatives . Tyrannosauroids lived on the Laurasian supercontinent beginning in the Jurassic Period . By the end of the Cretaceous Period , tyrannosauroids were the dominant large predators in the Northern Hemisphere , culminating in the gigantic Tyrannosaurus itself . Fossils of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what are now the continents of North America , Europe , Asia , South America and Australia . 
 Tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores , as were most theropods , and were characterized by numerous skeletal features , especially of the skull and pelvis . Early in their existence , tyrannosauroids were small predators with long , three @-@ fingered forelimbs . Late Cretaceous genera became much larger , including some of the largest land @-@ based predators ever to exist , but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits . Primitive feathers have been identified in fossils of two species , and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well . Prominent bony crests in a variety of shapes and sizes on the skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served display functions . 
 = = Description = = 
 Tyrannosauroids varied widely in size , although there was a general trend towards increasing size over time . Early tyrannosauroids were small animals . One specimen of Dilong , almost fully grown , measured 1 @.@ 6 meters ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) in length , and a fully @-@ grown Guanlong measured 3 meters ( 10 ft long ) . Teeth from lower Lower Cretaceous rocks ( 140 to 136 million years old ) of Hyogo , Japan , appear to have come from an approximately 5 metres ( 16 ft ) long animal , possibly indicating an early size increase in the lineage . An immature Eotyrannus was over 4 meters ( 13 ft ) in length , and a subadult Appalachiosaurus was estimated at more than 6 meters ( 20 ft ) long , indicating that both genera reached larger sizes . The Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids ranged from the 9 meter ( 30 ft ) Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus to Tyrannosaurus , which exceeded 12 meters ( 39 ft ) in length and may have weighed more than 6400 kilograms ( 7 short tons ) . A 2010 review of the literature concluded that tyrannosaurs were " small- to mid @-@ sized " for their first 80 million years but were " some of the largest terrestrial carnivores to ever live " in their last 20 million years . 
 Skulls of early tyrannosauroids were long , low and lightly constructed , similar to other coelurosaurs , while later forms had taller and more massive skulls . Despite the differences in form , certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids . The premaxillary bone is very tall , blunting the front of the snout , a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids . The nasal bones are characteristically fused together , arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface . The premaxillary teeth at the front of the upper jaw are shaped differently from the rest of the teeth , smaller in size and with a D @-@ shaped cross section . In the lower jaw , a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint , except in the basal Guanlong . 
 Tyrannosauroids had S @-@ shaped necks and long tails , as did most other theropods . Early genera had long forelimbs , about 60 % the length of the hindlimb in Guanlong , with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs . The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus , but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus . Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs strongly reduced in size , the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia , where the humerus was only one @-@ quarter the length of the femur . The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time . This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong , while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits . Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand . Tyrannosaurids had only two , although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well @-@ preserved specimens . As in most coelurosaurs , the second digit of the hand is the largest , even when the third digit is not present . 
 Characteristic features of the tyrannosauroid pelvis include a concave notch at the upper front end of the ilium , a sharply defined vertical ridge on the outside surface of the ilium , extending upwards from the acetabulum ( hip socket ) , and a huge " boot " on the end of the pubis , more than half as long as the shaft of the pubis itself . These features are found in all known tyrannosauroids , including basal members Guanlong and Dilong . The pubis is not known in Aviatyrannis or Stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in the ilium . The hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids , like most theropods , had four toes , although the first toe ( the hallux ) did not contact the ground . <unk> hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods , and show proportions characteristic of fast @-@ running animals , including elongated tibiae and metatarsals . These proportions persist even in the largest adult Tyrannosaurus , despite its probable inability to run . The third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at the top between the second and fourth , forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus . The arctometatarsus was also present in Appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in Eotyrannus or Dryptosaurus . This structure was shared by derived ornithomimids , troodontids and caenagnathids , but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong , indicating convergent evolution . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Tyrannosaurus was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905 , along with the family Tyrannosauridae . The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words <unk> / tyrannos ( ' tyrant ' ) and σαυρος / sauros ( ' lizard ' ) . The superfamily name Tyrannosauroidea was first published in a 1964 paper by the British paleontologist Alick Walker . The suffix <unk> , commonly used in the name of animal superfamilies , is derived from the Greek <unk> / eidos ( ' form ' ) . 
 Scientists have commonly understood Tyrannosauroidea to include the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors . With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology , however , the clade has received several more explicit definitions . The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998 , where Tyrannosauroidea was defined as a stem @-@ based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with Tyrannosaurus rex than with <unk> birds . To make the family more exclusive , Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox , Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis . Sereno published a new definition in 2005 , using Ornithomimus <unk> , Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers . The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review . 
 Some studies have suggested that the clade <unk> , usually considered to be allosauroids , are basal tyrannosauroids . However , other authors disputed the placement of <unk> within Tyrannosauroidea , and a study of <unk> hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at least partly reject their prior conclusion .

 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 While paleontologists have long recognized the family Tyrannosauridae , its ancestry has been the subject of much debate . For most of the twentieth century , tyrannosaurids were commonly accepted as members of the Carnosauria , which included almost all large theropods . Within this group , the <unk> were often considered to be ancestral to tyrannosaurids . In the early 1990s , cladistic analyses instead began to place tyrannosaurids into the Coelurosauria , echoing suggestions first published in the 1920s . Tyrannosaurids are now universally considered to be large coelurosaurs . 
 In 1994 , Holtz grouped tyrannosauroids with <unk> , ornithomimosaurs and troodonts into a coelurosaurian clade called <unk> based on a common ankle structure where the second and fourth metatarsals meet near the tarsal bones , covering the third metatarsal when viewed from the front . Basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong , however , were found with non @-@ <unk> ankles , indicating that this feature evolved convergently . <unk> has been dismantled and is no longer used by most paleontologists , with tyrannosauroids usually considered to be basal coelurosaurs outside <unk> . One recent analysis found the family Coeluridae , including the Late Jurassic North American genera Coelurus and Tanycolagreus , to be the sister group of Tyrannosauroidea . 
 The most basal tyrannosauroid known from complete skeletal remains is Guanlong . Other early taxa include Stokesosaurus and Aviatyrannis , known from far less complete material . The better @-@ known Dilong is considered slightly more derived than Guanlong and Stokesosaurus . Dryptosaurus , long a difficult genus to classify , has turned up in several recent analyses as a basal tyrannosauroid as well , slightly more distantly related to Tyrannosauridae than Eotyrannus and Appalachiosaurus . Alectrosaurus , a poorly known genus from Mongolia , is definitely a tyrannosauroid but its exact relationships are unclear . Other taxa have been considered possible tyrannosauroids by various authors , including Bagaraatan and <unk> . <unk> from the Early Cretaceous of Thailand was originally described as an early tyrannosaurid , but is usually considered a carnosaur today . Iliosuchus has a vertical ridge on the ilium reminiscent of tyrannosauroids and may in fact be the earliest known member of the superfamily , but not enough material is known to be sure . 
 Below is a cladogram by Loewen et al. in 2013 that includes virtually all known tyrannosauroid species . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The tyrannosauroids lived on the supercontinent Laurasia , which split from Gondwana in the Middle Jurassic , as well as on the northern continents , which separated from Laurasia later in the Mesozoic era . The earliest recognized tyrannosauroids lived in the Late Jurassic , including Guanlong from northwestern China , Stokesosaurus from the western United States and Aviatyrannis from Portugal . Some fossils currently referred to Stokesosaurus may instead belong to Aviatyrannis , given the great similarities in the dinosaur faunas of Portugal and North America during this time . If Iliosuchus from the Middle Jurassic of England is in fact a tyrannosauroid , it would be the earliest known genus and might suggest that the superfamily originated in Europe . 
 Early Cretaceous tyrannosauroids are also found on all three northern continents . Eotyrannus from England and Dilong from northeastern China are the only two named genera of this age , while Early Cretaceous tyrannosauroid premaxillary teeth are known from the Cedar Mountain Formation in Utah and the <unk> Group of Japan . 
 By the middle of the Cretaceous , tyrannosauroid fossils are no longer found in Europe , suggesting a localized extinction on that continent . <unk> teeth and possible body fossils are known from the North American Dakota Formation , as well as formations in Kazakhstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , from the middle of the Cretaceous . The first unquestionable remains of tyrannosaurids occur in the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous in North America and Asia . Two subfamilies are recognized . The albertosaurines are only known from North America , while the tyrannosaurines are found on both continents . Tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in Alaska , which may have served as a land bridge allowing dispersal between the two continents . Non @-@ tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroids like Alectrosaurus and possibly Bagaraatan were contemporaneous with tyrannosaurids in Asia , while they are absent from western North America . Eastern North America was divided by the Western Interior Seaway in the middle of the Cretaceous and isolated from the western portion of the continent . The absence of tyrannosaurids from the eastern part of the continent suggests that the family evolved after the appearance of the seaway , allowing basal tyrannosauroids like Dryptosaurus and Appalachiosaurus to survive in the east as a relict population until the end of the Cretaceous . 
 Basal tyrannosauroids may have also been present in what is now southeastern Australia during the Aptian of the Early Cretaceous . <unk> <unk> , a partial pubis ( a hip bone ) with a distinctive tyrannosauroid @-@ like form , was discovered in Dinosaur Cove in Victoria , indicating that tyrannosauroids were not limited to the northern continents as previously thought . 
 An as yet undescribed and unnamed tyrannosauroid from the Zuni Basin of New Mexico has been found . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Feathers = = = 
 Long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation and other nearby geological formations from Liaoning , China . These filaments have usually been interpreted as " protofeathers , " homologous with the branched feathers found in birds and some non @-@ avian theropods , although other hypotheses have been proposed . A skeleton of Dilong was described in 2004 that included the first example of feathers in a tyrannosauroid . Similarly to down feathers of modern birds , the feathers found in Dilong were branched but not pennaceous , and may have been used for insulation . Even large tyrannosauroids have been found with evidence of feathers . Yutyrannus <unk> , also from the Yixian Formation , is known from three specimens , each preserving traces of feathers on various parts of the body . While not all areas of the body preserve impressions across all three specimens , these fossils demonstrate that even in this medium @-@ sized species , most of the body was covered in feathers . 
 The presence of feathers in basal tyrannosauroids is not surprising , since they are now known to be characteristic of coelurosaurs , found in other basal genera like Sinosauropteryx , as well as all more derived groups . Rare fossilized skin impressions of some Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids lack feathers , however , instead showing skin covered in fine , non @-@ overlapping scales . It is possible that feathers were present on areas of the body not preserved with skin impressions ( which are very small and come primarily from the legs , pelvic region and underside of the tail ) . Alternatively , secondary loss of feathers in large tyrannosaurids may be analogous with the similar loss of hair in the largest modern mammals like elephants , where a low surface area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio slows down heat transfer , making insulation by a coat of hair unnecessary . A precedent can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians , in which filamentous structures were lost , and scales reappeared . 
 = = = Head crests = = = 
 Bony crests are found on the skulls of many theropods , including numerous tyrannosauroids . The most elaborate is found in Guanlong , where the nasal bones support a single , large crest which runs along the midline of the skull from front to back . This crest was penetrated by several large foramina ( openings ) which reduced its weight . A less prominent crest is found in Dilong , where low , parallel ridges run along each side of the skull , supported by the nasal and lacrimal bones . This ridges curve inwards and meet just behind the nostrils , making the crest Y @-@ shaped . The fused nasals of tyrannosaurid are often very rough @-@ textured . Alioramus , a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia , bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones ; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus , as well as some specimens of Daspletosaurus , Albertosaurus , and Tarbosaurus . In Albertosaurus , Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus , there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone . The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus , which instead have a crescent @-@ shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone . 
 These head crests may have been used for display , perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior . An example of the handicap principle may be the case of Guanlong , where the large , delicate crest may have been a hindrance to hunting in what was presumably an active predator . If an individual was healthy and successful at hunting despite the fragile crest , it would indicate the superior quality of the individual over others with smaller crests . Similarly to the unwieldy tail of a male peacock or the outsized antlers of an Irish elk , the crest of Guanlong may have evolved via sexual selection , providing an advantage in courtship that outweighed any decrease in hunting ability .

 = Portrait of Maria Portinari = 
 Portrait of Maria Portinari is a small c . 1470 – 72 tempera and oil on wood painting by Hans Memling . It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli , about whom very little is known . She is aged about 14 years old , and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari . Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth @-@ century fashion , with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel studded necklace . Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes 's later Portinari Altarpiece ( c . 1475 ) , a painting that may have been partly based on Memling 's portrait . 
 The panel is the right wing of a devotional and hinged triptych ; the lost center panel is recorded in sixteenth @-@ century inventories as a Virgin and Child . The panels were commissioned by Tommaso , a member of a prominent Florentine family . Tommaso was an intimate of Charles the Bold and an ambitious manager of the Bruges branch of a bank controlled by Lorenzo de ' Medici , and a well known and active patron of Flemish art . Tommaso eventually lost his position due to a series of large and risky unsecured loans given to Charles . 
 Maria and Tommaso 's portraits are hung alongside each other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . 
 = = Commission = = 
 The portrait was commissioned by the art loving Tommaso as the right @-@ hand wing of a triptych . She was placed opposite her husband , with a now lost central Madonna and Child . Their small size and intimacy suggests that the portraits were commissioned for private prayer , some art historians believe given that Tommaso 's cultural acumen and preoccupation with his social standing , they were partially accessible to the public . The triptych may have been intended for the Portinari Chapel , located behind the apse of the Basilica of Sant <unk> , Milan , and constructed between 1462 and 1468 . 
 Maria would have been around 14 years old at the time the portrait was commissioned , either the year of her marriage in 1470 or shortly after . Tommaso represented the Medici bank in Bruges , but after a promising early career he gave a number of risky and unsecured loans to Charles the Bold which were left unpaid and eventually led to the branch 's insolvency . He died young , and when the portrait was first mentioned as part of his collection in 1501 , he was no longer alive . Maria is recorded as being alive at the time ; she was executor to her husband 's will but her fate thereafter is uncertain . The 1501 inventory places both portraits as wings , with a central Virgin and Child panel ; " a small , valuable panel painting , with an image of Our Lady in the middle and on the sides painted Tommaso and mona Maria his wife " ( una <unk> <unk> <unk> [ i ] ata cum nel <unk> una <unk> di Nostra Donna e delle bande si è Tommaso e mona Maria sua donna <unk> in <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The half @-@ length portrait shows Maria Portinari ( born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456 ) in a three @-@ quarter view turned to the left . She has somewhat Nordic features , and is dressed in the high fashion then found at the apex of Flemish and Italian high society . She is placed against a flat , opaque , dark background , with her hands clasped in prayer . In Memling 's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain , as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden , and favored within Burgundian court circles . In contrast , Memling 's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns , such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari , a fact that has assisted in dating his work . 
 Maria 's face is idealised and conforms to contemporary ideals of beauty , especially in the raised eyebrows and elongated nose . The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling 's panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art , Lisbon . In this work , Maria 's frame is slightly undersized compared to her head , a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture , also found in similar works by Rogier van der Weyden and Petrus Christus . Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone frame , acting as a trompe @-@ l 'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer . Maria wears a relatively modest wedding band lined with rubies and sapphire . Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels , similar to Hugo van der Goes 's portrait of her in the Portinari Altarpiece . 
 The black hennin is long , truncated and relatively plain with a transparent veil which falls around the back of her neck , resting briefly on her shoulder . Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the necklace . Her costume is mostly black or brown , with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves . Portinari has dark eyes , a strong nose , full lips and a pointed chin . Her visible hand , folded in prayer but unrealistically off center , wears what looks like a jeweled ring . The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet @-@ like cloth tightened by a white belt . Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time . 
 Maria 's necklace is gilded and studded with pearls , rubies and sapphires . It contains three open flowers ; one white with a ruby jewel , another red with a sapphire , and one gray @-@ blue with a pearl . The upper line contains a row of onyx beads , from which hang , according to the art historian Sophie McConnell " small teardrops " gold and bluish @-@ grey enameled wire . The necklace is very similar to that worn by Margaret of York at her wedding to Charles the Bold in 1468 , an occasion the <unk> attended . A depiction of Charles in a double Portrait with Isabella of Bourbon , now in Ghent , closely resembles that of Thomas in facial features , while Isabella and Maria look very similar . Dirk De Vos believes van der Goes may have seen Memling 's panel when he stayed with Tommaso in Bruges c . 1497 , and incorporated elements for his own depiction . 
 The panel is in very good condition and among the best preserved of Memling 's work . Technical examination using x @-@ radiography shows that the hennin originally contained pearls which formed the letters " T " and " M " , standing for Tommaso and Maria . Similar pearl monograms , which would have been intended as a sign of marital connection , can be found in van der Goes 's portraits of the couple . Maryan Ainsworth concludes that they were removed from the final composition as they may have been " deemed too conspicuous a show of opulence in the presence of the Virgin and Child , most likely the now lost object of Maria 's veneration . " Maria 's ear was at one stage exposed , but was later covered by the wide frontlet of the hennin , a change of mind also found in the very similar portrait of the female donor in Memling 's c . 1470s to early 1480 Donne Triptych . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 The panel has at various times been attributed to van der Goes and van Eyck but was recognized as by Memling as early as the time of the seminal 1902 exhibition Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges in Bruges , when it was leant by Léopold Goldschmidt of Paris . In 1916 , Max J. Friedländer described it as " without doubt " by Memling , and both c . 1475 . The art historian <unk> Périer @-@ d <unk> , while noting that Memling 's portrait faces were rarely <unk> , this panel contains " thin yet confident incised lines " which may be preliminary drawings for Maria 's face , perhaps made from life . 
 The triptych was recorded in an inventory of Tommaso 's holdings upon his death . The New York panels passed through Tommaso 's son Francesco . The central panel was described in his 1544 will as " a small tabernacle with three movable wings , in which is depicted the glorious Virgin Mary and the father and mother of the donor " ( unum <unk> que <unk> con tribus <unk> , in qua est <unk> imago <unk> <unk> Marie et patris et <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . Francesco bequeathed the triptych to the convent of the hospital of Saint Maria Nuova in Florence . Records indicate a small intact winged altarpiece which stayed in their possession until around the time of the Napoleonic occupation , it was likely was broken up around this time . 
 Maria 's panel was sold as a Dieric Bouts for 6 @,@ 000 francs in 1870 . It later passed through several private collections , before arriving in the possession of Elia Volpi of Rome , who briefly returned it to Florence . Thereafter the panels were in London from 1901 , from where they were sold to <unk> Goldschmidt of Paris by for $ 426 @,@ 500 in 1910 . They purchased , also in 1910 , by the collector Benjamin Altman of New York on the advice of Friedländer , along with works by Albrecht Dürer , Gerard David and Hans Holbein the Younger ; paintings described as whose " grave austerity seems to have been most in tune with his own taste . " Altman bequeathed his holdings to the Metropolitan on his death in 1913 . 
 = What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? = 
 What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen . The album saw the departure of bassist Les Pattinson from the group , partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch ; McCulloch and the remaining band member , guitarist Will Sergeant , subsequently recorded the record with session musicians . The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin ' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks . The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England . Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album , Sergeant described it as " probably the worst time in my whole life " . 
 What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? was released on 16 April 1999 through London Records following the release of the first single from the album , " Rust " , the previous month . One further single , " Get in the Car " , followed the album 's release . The album received mixed reviews from the music press , being described as both flawless and having no appeal . The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen ; the album peaked at number twenty @-@ one on the UK Albums Chart . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 After the release of Echo & the Bunnymen 's previous album , Evergreen ( 1997 ) , and its three singles , the only new material by the band in 1998 was the song " Fools Like Us " . It was released only on the soundtrack for the romantic comedy film Martha , Meet Frank , Daniel and Laurence . Vocalist Ian McCulloch wrote the official song for England 's 1998 football World Cup campaign , which he recorded with the Spice Girls and Ocean Colour Scene as England United . Although McCulloch was proud of the song , it was not popular with the fans , peaking number nine on the UK Singles Chart . It was beaten to the number one position by the unofficial song , " Three Lions ' 98 " , released by David Baddiel , Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds . 
 When Echo & the Bunnymen entered the studio to record What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? , bassist Les Pattinson received news that his mother was unwell . That , coupled with Pattinson 's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way , led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band . McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album . The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames , Parr Street Studios in Liverpool , and Olympic Studios , Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London . 
 As with previous Echo & the Bunnymen albums , What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music . American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin ' Criminals appeared on the album as guest musicians on two tracks . Sergeant 's guitar @-@ work on the album was understated and he later said , " It was probably the worst time in my whole life , doing that LP — I hated it [ ... ] I 'm on all the tracks here and there , but generally I just stayed in the tent ! It was a horrible experience . " The album is a collection of ballads and has been described as a follow @-@ up to McCulloch 's 1989 solo album , <unk> . In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine , McCulloch said , " Will [ Sergeant ] hated the album , and I can understand why . He 'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I 'd say , ' Well , nowhere , it doesn 't really have a place ' . "

 Released in March 1999 , " Rust " was the first single to come from What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? . The single peaked at number twenty @-@ two on the UK Singles Chart , and NME magazine named it their Single of the Week . The album was released the following month on 16 April and , having failed to appeal to the public as much as the band 's previous albums , peaked at number twenty @-@ one on the UK Albums Chart . " Get in the Car " , one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin ' Criminals , was later released as a single . 
 Having awarded the album a score of nine out of ten , the reviewer for NME said , " At no point does [ the album ] rock . It glides with a beautiful , uninhibited momentum . " The reviewer described McCulloch 's voice as an " instrument honed by years of life , love and all the shitty bits in between to a ravishing state of molten cashmere " and the album as " flawless " for every " second of its defiantly brief 38 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes " . M. Tye Comer for CMJ said , " [ Echo & the Bunnymen ] revisit the melancholia they 've tussled with for nearly 20 years with a mature soul and a romantic urgency , having grown up without growing old . " Awarding the album four out of five stars , Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for Allmusic said the album " feels of a piece with their earlier albums , not only sonically , but in terms of quality . " Mark Richard @-@ San for Pitchfork Media said , " The over @-@ the @-@ top , bass @-@ driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective , acoustic songs appropriate for these aging <unk> . " Richard @-@ San also described McCulloch as having a " rich , resonant voice " , adding " the quality of his singing is perfect – a weary voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear . " 
 Andy Gill for The Independent newspaper took a less favourable view when he said , " [ The album ] has , as its title suggests , all the appeal of a discussion with a career adviser . " When he described the style of the album , Gill said , " It doesn 't really help matters that as they get more mature , the band appear to be indulging their interest in Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb rather more openly , despite lacking either songwriter 's way with a winning melody . " In his 2003 book The Rough Guide to Rock , Peter Buckley described the album as " a little gushing and overall disappointing " . 
 Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records in early 2000 . McCulloch said , " What they said is , ' We 'll keep you on if you don 't take as much money as in the contract , ' and we had no intention of staying anyway , so it was kind of ' were we pushed or did we fall ? ' " There was also a change in the band 's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label . With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life ? moving on , McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band , with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP , Avalanche , which was only available to buy over the internet .

 = Frost at Midnight = 
 Frost at Midnight is a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge , written in February 1798 . Part of the conversation poems , the poem discusses Coleridge 's childhood experience in a negative manner and emphasizes the need to be raised in the countryside . The poem expresses hope that Coleridge 's son , Hartley , would be able to experience a childhood that his father could not and become a true " child of nature " . The view of nature within the poem has a strong Christian element in that Coleridge believed that nature represents a physical presence of God 's word and that the poem is steeped in Coleridge 's understanding of Neoplatonism . Frost at Midnight has been well received by critics , and is seen as the best of the conversation poems . 
 = = Background = = 
 Frost at Midnight was written in February 1798 when he described to Thomas Poole aspects of his childhood at Christ 's Hospital grammar school that are similar to the content of the poem . The rest comes from Coleridge 's experience with his friend , William Wordsworth . It was Wordsworth who provided Coleridge with a detailed description of the Lake District which served as a basis for Coleridge 's description of the place . The relationship between Coleridge and Wordsworth was a close friendship , and Coleridge helped rewrite many of Wordsworth 's poems during this time . Frost at Midnight was later connected to many of Wordsworth 's poems . The poem was published in a small work containing his other poems France : An Ode and Fears in Solitude . 
 The poem was intended to be added to Coleridge 's third edition of his collected poems , but a dispute with Charles Lloyd , a fellow writer , and Joseph Cottle , their mutual publisher , altered his plans . The poem was later collected in Sibylline Leaves , published in 1817 ( see 1817 in poetry ) . It was rewritten many times , and seven different versions were printed . Of these revisions , the 1798 edition differs from the others in the final six lines , which were removed in later versions . Of this removal , Coleridge explains in George Beaumont 's copy of the poems : " The last six lines I omit because they destroy the rondo , and return upon itself of the Poem . Poems of this kind & length ought to lie coiled with its tail round its head . " 
 = = Poem = = 
 The image of soot in a grate in the early lines of the poem is a sign that a stranger would appear . The poem continues with a discussion of the narrator 's sleeping child : 
 Dear Babe , that <unk> cradled by my side , 
 Whose gentle breathings , heard in this deep calm , 
 Fill up the <unk> vacancies 
 And momentary pauses of the thought ! ( lines 44 – 47 ) 
 The narrator believes that his child will experience a better life than his own : 
 For I was reared 
 In the great city , pent ' mid cloisters dim , 
 And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars . 
 But thou , my babe ! shalt wander like a breeze 
 By lakes and sandy shores , beneath the crags 
 Of ancient mountain , and beneath the clouds , 
 Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores 
 And mountain crags : ( lines 51 – 58 ) 
 The poem concluded with a message of hope for the narrator 's child : 
 Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee , 
 Whether the summer clothe the general earth 
 With greenness , or the redbreast sit and sing 
 <unk> the tufts of snow on the bare branch 
 Of mossy apple @-@ tree , while the nigh thatch 
 Smokes in the sun @-@ thaw ; whether the eave @-@ drops fall 
 Heard only in the trances of the blast , 
 Or if the secret ministry of frost 
 Shall hang them up in silent icicles , 
 Quietly shining to the quiet Moon . ( lines 65 – 74 ) 
 The original ending of the 1798 version of the poem described the narrator 's child and wife during winter : 
 Or whether the secret ministry of cold 
 Shall hang them up in silent icicles , 
 Quietly shining to the quiet moon , 
 Like those , my babe ! which ere tomorrow 's warmth 
 Have <unk> 'd their sharp keen points with pendulous drops , 
 Will catch thine eye , and with their novelty 
 <unk> thy little soul ; then make thee shout , 
 And stretch and flutter from thy mother 's arms 
 As thou wouldst fly for very eagerness . ( lines 72 – 78 )

 The narrator comes to an understanding of nature after being isolated and left to his thoughts . Nature becomes a comforter , but the narrator remembers his loneliness during childhood . During his final year at Christ 's Hospital , Coleridge completed a poem he titled " On Quitting School for College " for a school exercise . In the poem , he describes his time at the school as a pleasant experience . However , Frost at Midnight redefines the experience as one that deprived him of the countryside . 
 There is another quality to Coleridge 's retelling of his childhood experience : he adds supernatural descriptions to the common scenes of his youth . In particular , the church bells are able to make a promise of a better life . The Gothic elements of the poem connect it to many of his other works , including Ancient Mariner , " Ballad of the Dark Ladie " , Fears in Solitude , France : An Ode , The Nightingale , " Three Graves " , and " Wanderings of Cain " . 
 Within the poem , the narrator expresses his hope that his child , Hartley Coleridge , will experience a life connected to nature as represented by features typical of the Lake District , which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered . This is similar to what Coleridge 's friend William Wordsworth does with the narrator of Tintern Abbey , a poem composed later that year . Many of the feelings of the narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge 's sonnet " To a Friend Who Asked , How I Felt When the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me " . The ideas about nature in This Lime @-@ Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education , and Hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way . Unlike Wordsworth 's nature , Coleridge 's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God 's word . Coleridge 's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge . 
 Like many of the conversation poems , Frost at Midnight touches on Coleridge 's idea of " One Life " , which connects mankind to nature and to God . Touching on themes that come up in The Eolian Harp , Religious Musings , and other poems , the poem produces the image of a life that the narrator 's child will experience in the countryside . The boy would become a " child of nature " and raised free of the constraints found in philosophical systems produced by those like William Godwin .

 Christopher Moody , in the Monthly Review of May 1799 , declared that the original six lines of the ending were " flat " , a view that Coleridge probably agreed with . 
 During the 20th century , Virginia Radley argues , " Although no conversation poem can rightly be said to stand equally with the poems of high imagination ... certainly " Frost at Midnight " and " This Lime @-@ tree Bower ... " both have within them that quality of heart so essential to these latter poems . Because of this quality , and because of the striking effectiveness of their imagery , these poems can be said to be the true harbingers of Coleridge 's greatest poems " . 
 Richard Holmes declares that the poem " is one of the most intricately structured of all the Conversation Poems , performing a characteristic ' outward and return ' movement through time and space ... This curve of memory and prophesy gives the poem a rich emotional resonance – sadness , poignancy , hope , joy – held in exquisite tension " . Rosemary Ashton believes that the poem is " one of [ Coleridge 's ] most delightful conversation poems " . Adam <unk> believes that Frost at Midnight is " perhaps the most beautiful of Coleridge 's ' conversation poems ' " . 
 = George II of Great Britain = 
 George II ( George Augustus ; German : Georg II . August ; 30 October / 9 November <unk> / N.S. – 25 October 1760 ) was King of Great Britain and Ireland , Duke of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg ( Hanover ) and Prince @-@ elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 ( O.S. ) until his death . 
 George was the last British monarch born outside Great Britain : he was born and brought up in northern Germany . His grandmother , Sophia of Hanover , became second in line to the British throne after about fifty Catholics higher in line were excluded by the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707 , which restricted the succession to Protestants . After the deaths of Sophia and Anne , Queen of Great Britain , in 1714 , his father George I , Elector of Hanover , inherited the British throne . In the first years of his father 's reign as king , George was associated with opposition politicians , until they rejoined the governing party in 1720 . 
 As king from 1727 , George exercised little control over British domestic policy , which was largely controlled by the Parliament of Great Britain . As elector , he spent twelve summers in Hanover , where he had more direct control over government policy . He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son , Frederick , who supported the parliamentary opposition . During the War of the Austrian Succession , George participated at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 , and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle . In 1745 , supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne , James Francis Edward Stuart ( " The Old Pretender " ) , led by James 's son Charles Edward Stuart ( " The Young Pretender " or " Bonnie Prince Charlie " ) , attempted and failed to depose George in the last of the Jacobite rebellions . Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751 , nine years before his father , and so George II was ultimately succeeded by his grandson , George III . 
 For two centuries after George II 's death , history tended to view him with disdain , concentrating on his mistresses , short temper and <unk> . Since then , most scholars have reassessed his legacy and conclude that he held and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George was born in the city of Hanover in Germany , and was the son of George Louis , Hereditary Prince of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg ( later King George I of Great Britain ) , and his wife , Sophia Dorothea of Celle . Both of George 's parents committed adultery , and in 1694 their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband . She was confined to <unk> House and denied access to her two children , George and his sister Sophia Dorothea of Hanover , who probably never saw their mother again . 
 George spoke only French , the language of diplomacy and the court , until the age of four , after which he was taught German by one of his tutors , Johann Hilmar Holstein . In addition to French and German , he was also schooled in English and Italian , and studied genealogy , military history and battle tactics with particular diligence . 
 George 's second cousin once removed , Queen Anne , ascended the thrones of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1702 . She had no surviving children , and by the Act of Settlement 1701 the English Parliament designated Anne 's closest Protestant blood relations , George 's grandmother Sophia and her descendants , as Anne 's heirs in England and Ireland . Consequently , after his grandmother and father , George was third in line to succeed Anne in two of her three realms . He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the Sophia Naturalization Act , and in 1706 he was made a Knight of the Garter and created Duke and Marquess of Cambridge , Earl of Milford Haven , Viscount Northallerton and Baron Tewkesbury in the Peerage of England . England and Scotland united in 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain , and jointly accepted the succession as laid down by the English Act of Settlement . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 George 's father did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he had , and wanted him to have the opportunity of meeting his bride before any formal arrangements were made . Negotiations from 1702 for the hand of Princess Hedvig Sophia of Sweden , Dowager Duchess and regent of Holstein @-@ Gottorp , came to nothing . In June 1705 , under the false name of " Monsieur de Busch " , George visited the Ansbach court at their summer residence in <unk> to investigate incognito a marriage prospect : Caroline of Ansbach , the former ward of his aunt Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia . The English envoy to Hanover , Edmund Poley , reported that George was so taken by " the good character he had of her that he would not think of anybody else " . A marriage contract was concluded by the end of July . On 22 August / 2 September <unk> / N.S. Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding , which was held the same evening in the chapel at Herrenhausen . 
 George was keen to participate in the war against France in Flanders , but his father refused permission for him to join the army in an active role until he had a son and heir . In early 1707 , George 's hopes were fulfilled when Caroline gave birth to a son , Frederick . In July , Caroline fell seriously ill with smallpox , and George caught the infection after staying by her side devotedly during her illness . They both recovered . In 1708 , George participated in the Battle of Oudenarde in the vanguard of the Hanoverian cavalry ; his horse and a colonel immediately beside him were killed , but George survived unharmed . The British commander , Marlborough , wrote that George " distinguished himself extremely , charging at the head of and animating by his example [ the Hanoverian ] troops , who played a good part in this happy victory " . Between 1709 and 1713 , George and Caroline had three more children , all girls : Anne , Amelia , and Caroline . 
 By 1714 , Queen Anne 's health had declined , and British Whigs , politicians who supported the Hanoverian succession , thought it prudent for one of the Hanoverians to live in England , to safeguard the Protestant succession on Anne 's death . As George was a peer of the realm ( as Duke of Cambridge ) , it was suggested that he be summoned to Parliament to sit in the House of Lords . Both Anne and George 's father refused to support the plan , although George , Caroline and Sophia were all in favour . George did not go . Within the year , both Sophia and Anne were dead , and George 's father was king . 
 = = Prince of Wales = = 
 = = = Quarrel with the king = = = 
 George and his father sailed for England from The Hague on 16 / 27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later . The following day , they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession . George was given the title of Prince of Wales . Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters , while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors . London was like nothing George had seen before : it was 50 times larger than Hanover , A and the crowd was estimated at up to one and a half million spectators . George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English , and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English . 
 In July 1716 , the king returned to Hanover for six months , and George was given limited powers , as " Guardian and Lieutenant of the Realm " , to govern in his father 's absence . He made a royal progress through Chichester , Havant , Portsmouth and Guildford in southern England . Spectators were allowed to see him dine in public at Hampton Court Palace . An attempt on his life at Drury Lane Theatre , in which one person was shot dead before the assailant was brought under control , boosted his high public profile . 
 His father distrusted or was jealous of George 's popularity , which contributed to the development of a poor relationship between them . The birth in 1717 of George 's second son , Prince George William , proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel ; the king , supposedly following custom , appointed the Lord Chamberlain , the Duke of Newcastle , as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child . The king was angered when George , who disliked Newcastle , verbally insulted the duke at the christening , which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a <unk> George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king , who subsequently banished his son from St James 's Palace , the king 's residence . The Prince and Princess of Wales left court , but their children remained in the care of the king . 
 George and Caroline missed their children , and were desperate to see them . On one occasion they secretly visited the palace without the approval of the king ; Caroline fainted and George " cried like a child " . The king partially relented and permitted them to visit once a week , though he later allowed Caroline unconditional access . The following February , George William died , with his father by his side . 
 = = = Political opposition = = = 
 Banned from the palace and shunned by his own father , for the next several years the Prince of Wales was identified with opposition to George I 's policies , which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover 's German territories at the expense of Sweden . His new London residence , Leicester House , became a frequent meeting place for his father 's political opponents , including Sir Robert Walpole and Viscount Townshend , who had left the government in 1717 . 
 The king visited Hanover again from May to November 1719 . Instead of appointing George to the guardianship , he established a regency council . In 1720 , Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile , for the sake of public unity , which they did half @-@ heartedly . Walpole and Townshend returned to political office , and rejoined the ministry . George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation ; his three daughters who were in the care of the king were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the king 's absences . He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power . Over the next few years , he and Caroline lived quietly , avoiding overt political activity . They had three more children : William , Mary and Louisa , who were brought up at Leicester House and Richmond Lodge , George 's summer residence . 
 In 1721 , the economic disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole to rise to the pinnacle of government . Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics , as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement . The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half @-@ century . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 George I died on 11 / 22 June 1727 during one of his visits to Hanover , and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43 . The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father 's funeral , which far from bringing criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England . He suppressed his father 's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II 's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains ( both in Britain and Hanover ) in a single person . Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful , as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally . Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father 's legacies . 
 George II was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 11 / 22 October 1727 . The composer George Frideric Handel was commissioned to write four new anthems for the coronation , including Zadok the Priest . 
 It was widely believed that George would dismiss Walpole , who had distressed him by joining his father 's government , and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton . George asked Compton , rather than Walpole , to write his first speech as king for him , but Compton asked Walpole to draft it . Caroline advised George to retain Walpole , who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list ( a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king 's official expenditure ) of £ 800 @,@ 000 . Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability . Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year . 
 Walpole directed domestic policy , and after the resignation of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George 's foreign policy . Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain , and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions . Although the king was eager for war in Europe , his ministers were more cautious . The Anglo @-@ Spanish War was brought to an end , and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession on the side of the German states . In April 1733 , Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition , including from within his own party . George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill 's opponents from their court offices . 
 = = Family problems = = 
 George II 's relationship with his son and heir apparent , Frederick , Prince of Wales , worsened during the 1730s . Frederick had been left behind in Germany when his parents came to England , and they had not met for 14 years . In 1728 , he was brought to England , and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition . When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729 , 1732 and 1735 , he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son . Meanwhile , rivalry between George II and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian – Hanoverian border , which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings . Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William 's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other , and the idea was shelved . Instead , the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe @-@ Gotha in April 1736 . 
 In May 1736 , George returned to Hanover , which resulted in unpopularity in England ; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James 's Palace decrying his absence . " Lost or strayed out of this house " , it read , " a man who has left a wife and six children on the parish . " The king made plans to return in the face of inclement December weather ; when his ship was caught in a storm , gossip swept London that he had drowned . Eventually , in January 1737 , he arrived back in England . Immediately he fell ill , with piles and a fever , and withdrew to his bed . The Prince of Wales put it about that the king was dying , with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip @-@ mongers . 
 When the Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increase in his allowance , an open quarrel broke out . The king , who had a reputation for meanness , offered a private settlement , which Frederick rejected . Parliament voted against the measure , but George reluctantly increased his son 's allowance on the advice of Walpole . Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife , who was in labour , into a coach and driving off in the middle of the night . George banished him and his family from the royal court , much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children . 
 Soon afterwards , George 's wife Caroline died on 20 November 1737 ( O.S. ) . He was deeply affected by her death , and to the surprise of many displayed " a tenderness of which the world thought him before utterly incapable " . On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry , to which he replied , " Non , j <unk> des <unk> ! " ( French for " No , I shall have mistresses ! " ) . It was common knowledge that George had already had mistresses during his marriage , and he had kept Caroline informed about them . Henrietta Howard , later Countess of Suffolk , had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne , and she had been one of Caroline 's women of the bedchamber . She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734 . She was followed by Amalie von Wallmoden , later Countess of Yarmouth , whose son , Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden , may have been fathered by George . Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband , and George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son . 
 = = War and rebellion = = 
 Against Walpole 's wishes , but to George 's delight , Britain reopened hostilities with Spain in 1739 . Britain 's conflict with Spain , the War of Jenkins ' Ear , became part of the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 . At issue was the right of Charles 's daughter , Maria Theresa , to succeed to his Austrian dominions . George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover , where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector . 
 Prince Frederick campaigned actively for the opposition in the British general election , 1741 , and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority . Walpole attempted to buy off the prince with the promise of an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts , but Frederick refused . With his support eroded , Walpole retired in 1742 after over 20 years in office . He was replaced by Spencer Compton , Lord Wilmington , whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727 . Lord Wilmington , however , was a figurehead ; actual power was held by others , such as Lord Carteret , George 's favourite minister after Walpole . When Wilmington died in 1743 , Henry Pelham took his place at the head of the government . 
 The pro @-@ war faction was led by Carteret , who claimed that French power would increase if Maria Theresa failed to succeed to the Austrian throne . George agreed to send 12 @,@ 000 hired Hessian and Danish mercenaries to Europe , ostensibly to support Maria Theresa . Without conferring with his British ministers , George stationed them in Hanover to prevent enemy French troops from marching into the electorate . The British army had not fought in a major European war in over 20 years , and the government had badly neglected its upkeep . George had pushed for greater professionalism in the ranks , and promotion by merit rather than by sale of commissions , but without much success . An allied force of Austrian , British , Dutch , Hanoverian and Hessian troops engaged the French at the Battle of Dettingen on 16 / 27 June 1743 . George personally accompanied them , leading them to victory , thus becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle . Though his actions in the battle were admired , the war became unpopular with the British public , who felt that the king and Carteret were subordinating British interests to Hanoverian ones . Carteret lost support , and to George 's dismay resigned in 1744 . 
 Tension grew between the Pelham ministry and George , as he continued to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet , which would have broadened the government 's support base . The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro @-@ Hanoverian . In February 1746 , Pelham and his followers resigned . George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration , but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office , unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support . Pelham returned to office triumphant , and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry . 
 George 's French opponents encouraged rebellion by the Jacobites , the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne , James Francis Edward Stuart , often known as the Old Pretender . Stuart was the son of James II , who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations . Two prior rebellions in 1715 and 1719 had failed . In July 1745 , the Old Pretender 's son , Charles Edward Stuart , popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender , landed in Scotland , where support for his cause was highest . George , who was summering in Hanover , returned to London at the end of August . The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the Battle of Prestonpans , and then moved south into England . The Jacobites failed to gain further support , and the French reneged on a promise of help . Losing morale , the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland . On 16 / 27 April 1746 , Charles faced George 's military @-@ minded son Prince William , Duke of Cumberland , in the Battle of Culloden , the last pitched battle fought on British soil . The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army . Charles escaped to France , but many of his supporters were caught and executed . Jacobitism was all but crushed ; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the House of Stuart . The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748 , when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria . The peace was celebrated by a fête in Green Park , London , for which Handel composed Music for the Royal Fireworks . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In the general election of 1747 , the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham 's party won easily . Like his father before him , the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square . When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751 , his eldest son , Prince George , became heir apparent . The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her . As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756 , a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent , assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland , in case of George II 's death . The king also made a new will , which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover . After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year , George lamented , " This has been a fatal year for my family . I lost my eldest son – but I am glad of it ... Now [ Louisa ] is gone . I know I did not love my children when they were young : I hated to have them running into my room ; but now I love them as well as most fathers . " 
 = = = Seven Years ' War = = = 
 In 1754 , Pelham died , to be succeeded by his elder brother , the Duke of Newcastle . Hostility between France and Britain , particularly over the colonization of North America , continued . Fearing a French invasion of Hanover , George aligned himself with Prussia , the enemy of Austria . Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria . A French invasion of the British @-@ held island of Minorca led to the outbreak of the Seven Years ' War in 1756 . Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the Duke of Devonshire as prime minister and William Pitt the Elder as Secretary of State for the Southern Department . In April the following year , George dismissed Pitt , in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking . Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed . In June , James Waldegrave , 2nd Earl Waldegrave , held the seals of office for only four days . By the start of July , Pitt was recalled , and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister . As Secretary of State , Pitt guided policy relating to the war . Great Britain , Hanover and Prussia and their allies Hesse @-@ Kassel and Brunswick @-@ Wolfenbüttel were pitted against other European powers , including France , Austria , Russia , Sweden and Saxony . The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India , where British dominance increased with the victories of Robert Clive over French forces and their allies at the Battle of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey . 
 George 's son the Duke of Cumberland commanded the king 's troops in northern Germany . In 1757 , Hanover was invaded and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace . By September , however , he was furious at Cumberland 's negotiated settlement , which he felt greatly favoured the French . George said his son had " ruined me and disgraced himself " . Cumberland , by his own choice , resigned his military offices , and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire . 
 In the annus mirabilis of 1759 British forces captured Quebec and Guadeloupe . A French plan to invade Britain was defeated following naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay , and a resumed French advance on Hanover was halted by a joint British – Hanoverian force at the Battle of Minden . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 By October 1760 , George II was blind in one eye , and hard of hearing . On the morning of 25 October , he rose as usual at 6 : 00 am , drank a cup of hot chocolate , and went to his close stool , alone . After a few minutes , his valet heard a loud crash . He entered the room to find the king on the floor . The king was lifted into his bed , and Princess Amelia was sent for , but before she reached him , he was dead . At the age of nearly 77 , he had lived longer than any of his English predecessors . A post @-@ mortem revealed that the right ventricle of the king 's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm . 
 George II was succeeded by his grandson George III , and was buried on 11 November in Westminster Abbey . He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife 's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 George donated the royal library to the British Museum in 1757 , four years after the museum 's foundation . He had no interest in reading , or in the arts and sciences , and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag @-@ hunting on horseback or playing cards . In 1737 , he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen , the first university in the Electorate of Hanover , and visited it in 1748 . The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902 . He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College , Dublin , between 1716 and 1727 , and in 1754 issued the charter for King 's College in New York City , which later became Columbia University . The province of Georgia , founded by royal charter in 1732 , was named after him . 
 During George II 's reign British interests expanded throughout the world , the Jacobite challenge to the Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished , and the power of ministers and Parliament in Britain became well @-@ established . Nevertheless , in the memoirs of contemporaries such as Lord Hervey and Horace Walpole , George is depicted as a weak buffoon , governed by his wife and ministers . Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts . Since the last quarter of the twentieth century , scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought . Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular . He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked , or sideline them into lesser offices . This academic reassessment of George II , however , has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a " faintly ludicrous king " . His parsimony , for example , may have opened him to ridicule , but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance . Lord Charlemont excused George 's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception , " His temper was warm and impetuous , but he was good @-@ natured and sincere . <unk> in the royal talent of dissimulation , he always was what he appeared to be . He might offend , but he never deceived . " Lord Waldegrave wrote , " I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter , when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters , and from which no man is totally exempt , he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings , under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness " . George may not have played a strong role in history , but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government . Elizabeth Montagu said of him , " With him our laws and liberties were safe , he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments ; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times ... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry , but will look well in the sober page of history . "

 " La Llamada " was the first song recorded for Live ! ( 1993 ) . It was written by Selena y Los Dinos backup singer Pete Astudillo and Selena 's brother , principal record producer and songwriter A.B. Quintanilla III . It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti . The song was intended to be one of three studio tracks for Selena 's Live ! album . Astudillo and Quintanilla III had spent an hour writing a song together . They wanted to write a song on a topic that many woman face with their boyfriends . Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women , letting them know that they should hold their heads up and remember that life goes on . Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme , a common one in her songs . " La Llamada " was recorded in Corpus Christi , Texas at Selena 's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla , Jr . ' s recording studio Q @-@ Productions . Before Live ! was released , the song was mixed by Brian " Red " Moore , a family friend . Because Selena favored the song , the band released a music video . It was filmed in a beach house in Malibu , California . The video features Selena dancing with guys on one side and woman on the other . In other scenes , Selena is belting the lyrics behind blue curtains . 
 " La Llamada " is an uptempo Mexican cumbia song . Written in the key of A minor , the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 90 beats per minute .

 = Barium = 
 Barium is a chemical element with symbol Ba and atomic number 56 . It is the fifth element in Group 2 , a soft silvery metallic alkaline earth metal . Because of its high chemical reactivity barium is never found in nature as a free element . Its hydroxide was known in pre @-@ modern history as baryta ; this substance does not occur as a mineral , but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate . 
 The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are barite ( barium sulfate , BaSO4 ) and witherite ( barium carbonate , <unk> ) , both being insoluble in water . Barium 's name originates from the alchemical derivative " baryta " , which itself comes from Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " heavy . " <unk> is the adjective form of barium . Barium was identified as a new element in 1774 , but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis . 
 Barium has only a few industrial applications . The metal has been historically used as a getter for vacuum tubes . It is a component of YBCO ( high @-@ temperature superconductors ) and <unk> , and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure of the metal . Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color . Barium sulfate is used as an insoluble heavy additive to oil well drilling fluid , as well as in a purer form , as X @-@ ray radiocontrast agents for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract . Soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium ion , and therefore have been used as rodenticides . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Barium is a soft , silvery @-@ white metal , with a slight golden shade when <unk> . The silvery @-@ white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon oxidation in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer . Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity . <unk> barium is very hard to prepare , and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet . 
 At room temperature and pressure , barium has a body @-@ centered cubic structure , with a barium – barium distance of 503 picometers , expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1 @.@ 8 × 10 − 5 / ° C. It is a very soft metal with a Mohs hardness of 1 @.@ 25 . Its melting temperature of 1 @,@ 000 K ( 730 ° C ; 1 @,@ 340 ° F ) is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium ( 1 @,@ 050 K or 780 ° C or 1 @,@ 430 ° F ) and heavier radium ( 973 K or 700 ° C or 1 @,@ 292 ° F ) ; however , its boiling point of 2 @,@ 170 K ( 1 @,@ 900 ° C ; 3 @,@ 450 ° F ) exceeds that of strontium ( 1 @,@ 655 K or 1 @,@ 382 ° C or 2 @,@ 519 ° F ) . The density ( 3 @.@ 62 g · cm − 3 ) is again intermediate between those of strontium ( 2 @.@ 36 g · cm − 3 ) and radium ( ~ 5 g · cm − 3 ) . 
 = = = Chemical reactivity = = = 
 Barium is chemically similar to magnesium , calcium , and strontium , being even more reactive . It always exhibits the oxidation state of + 2 . Reactions with chalcogens are highly exothermic ( release energy ) ; the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature , and therefore barium is stored under oil or inert gas atmosphere . Reactions with other nonmetals , such as carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus , silicon , and hydrogen , are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating . Reactions with water and alcohols are also very exothermic and release hydrogen gas : 
 Ba + 2 ROH → Ba ( OR ) 2 + H2 ↑ ( R is an alkyl or a hydrogen atom ) 
 Additionally , barium reacts with ammonia to form complexes such as Ba ( NH3 ) 6 . 
 The metal is readily attacked by most acids . Sulfuric acid is a notable exception , as passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate . Barium combines with several metals , including aluminium , zinc , lead , and tin , forming intermetallic phases and alloys . 
 = = = Compounds = = = 
 Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved , as barium ions provide no specific coloring . They are also denser than their strontium or calcium analogs , except for the halides ( see table ; zinc is given for comparison ) . 
 Barium hydroxide ( " baryta " ) was known to alchemists who produced it by heating barium carbonate . Unlike calcium hydroxide , it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations . This property is used in calibrating pH equipment . 
 Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green flame , which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound . The color results from spectral lines at 455 @.@ 4 , 493 @.@ 4 , 553 @.@ 6 , and 611 @.@ 1 nm . 
 <unk> compounds are a growing class of compounds : for example , <unk> are known , as are <unk> . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Barium occurs naturally on Earth as a mixture of seven primordial nuclides , barium @-@ 130 , 132 , and 134 through 138 . Barium @-@ 130 undergoes very slow radioactive decay to xenon @-@ 130 via double beta plus decay , and barium @-@ 132 is expected to decay similarly to xenon @-@ 132 . The corresponding half @-@ lives should exceed the age of the Universe by at least a thousand times . Their abundances are ~ 0 @.@ 1 % relative to that of natural barium . Their radioactivity is so weak that they pose no danger to life . Out of the stable isotopes , barium @-@ 138 makes up 71 @.@ 7 % of all barium , and the lighter the isotope , the less abundant it is . In total , barium has about 50 known isotopes , ranging in mass between 114 and 153 . The most stable metastable isotope is barium @-@ 133 , which has a half @-@ life of approximately 10 @.@ 51 years , and five more isotopes have their half @-@ lives longer than a day . Barium also has 10 meta states , out of which barium @-@ <unk> is the most stable , having a half @-@ life of about 39 hours . 
 = = History = = 
 Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals . Smooth pebble @-@ like stones of mineral barite found in Bologna , Italy , were known as " Bologna stones . " Alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years . The phosphorescent properties of barite heated with organics were described by V. <unk> in 1602 . 
 Carl Scheele identified barite as containing a new element in 1774 , but could not isolate barium , only barium oxide . Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies . <unk> barium was at first called " <unk> , " by Guyton de Morveau , a name that was changed by Antoine Lavoisier to baryta . Also in the 18th century , English mineralogist William Withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of Cumberland , now known to be witherite . Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 , by Sir Humphry Davy in England . Davy , by analogy with calcium named " barium " after baryta , with the " -ium " ending signifying a metallic element . Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride . 
 The production of pure oxygen in the Brin process was a large @-@ scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s , before it was replaced by electrolysis and fractional distillation of liquefied air in the early 1900s . In this process barium oxide reacts at 500 – 600 ° C ( 932 – 1 @,@ 112 ° F ) with air to form barium peroxide , which decomposes at above 700 ° C ( 1 @,@ 292 ° F ) by releasing oxygen : 
 2 BaO + O2 ⇌ 2 <unk> 
 In 1908 , barium sulfate was first applied as a radiocontrast agent in X @-@ ray imaging of the digestive system . 
 = = Occurrence and production = = 
 The abundance of barium is 0 @.@ <unk> % in the Earth 's crust and 13 µg / L in sea water . The main commercial source of barium is barite ( also called <unk> or heavy spar ) , which is a barium sulfate mineral . Its deposits are spread all over the world . The only other commercial source is far less important than barite ; it is witherite , a barium carbonate mineral . Its main deposits are located in England , Romania , and the former USSR . 
 The barite reserves are estimated between 0 @.@ 7 and 2 billion tonnes . The maximum production was achieved in 1981 , at 8 @.@ 3 million tonnes , and only 7 – 8 % of it was used to make barium or its compounds . The barite production has again risen since the second half of the 1990s : from 5 @.@ 6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7 @.@ 6 in 2005 and 7 @.@ 8 in 2011 . China accounts for more than 50 % of this output , followed by India ( 14 % in 2011 ) , Morocco ( 8 @.@ 3 % ) , US ( 8 @.@ 2 % ) , Turkey ( 2 @.@ 5 % ) , Iran and Kazakhstan ( 2 @.@ 6 % each ) . 
 The mined ore is washed , crushed , classified , and separated from quartz . If the quartz penetrates too deep into the ore , or the iron , zinc , or lead content is abnormally high , then froth flotation methods are applied . The product is a 98 % pure barite ( by mass ) ; the purity should be no less than 95 % , with a minimal content of iron and silicon dioxide . It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide : 
 BaSO4 + 2 C → <unk> + 2 CO2 ↑ 
 The water @-@ soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds : dissolved <unk> upon reaction with oxygen gives the sulfate , with nitric acid the nitrate , with carbon dioxide the carbonate , and so on . The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide . Barium metal is produced by reduction with aluminium at 1 @,@ 100 ° C ( 2 @,@ 010 ° F ) . The intermetallic compound BaAl4 is produced first : 
 3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl4 + Al2O3 
 It is an intermediate , which reacts with barium oxide to give the metal . Note that not all barium is reduced . 
 8 BaO + BaAl4 → Ba ↑ + 7 BaAl2O4 
 The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide : 
 BaO + Al2O3 → BaAl2O4 
 and the overall reaction is 
 4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba ↑ + BaAl2O4 
 The thus produced barium vapor is collected at the cooler part of the apparatus and then packed into molds under argon atmosphere . This method is used commercially and can yield <unk> barium . Commonly sold barium is about 99 % pure , with main impurities being strontium and calcium ( up to 0 @.@ 8 % and 0 @.@ 25 % ) and other contaminants contributing less than 0 @.@ 1 % . 
 A similar reaction with silicon at 1 @,@ 200 ° C ( 2 @,@ 190 ° F ) yields barium and barium <unk> . Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and is rather impure when isolated with this method .

 = = = Metal and alloys = = = 
 Barium , as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium , is used to remove unwanted gases ( <unk> ) from vacuum tubes , such as TV picture tubes . Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen , nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water ; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice . This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the <unk> LCD and plasma sets . 
 Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to <unk> ( aluminium – silicon alloys ) that refines their structure , as well as 
 bearing alloys ; 
 lead – tin soldering alloys – to increase the creep resistance ; 
 alloy with nickel for spark plugs ; 
 additive to steel and cast iron as an <unk> ;

 = = = Barium sulfate and barite = = = 
 Barium sulfate ( the mineral barite , BaSO4 ) is important to the petroleum industry , for example , as a drilling fluid in oil and gas wells . The precipitate of the compound ( called " blanc <unk> " , from a French expression meaning " permanent white " ) is used in paints and varnishes , and also as a filler in ringing ink , plastics , and rubbers . It is also a paper coating pigment . In the form of nanoparticles , it can improve physical properties of some polymers , such as epoxies . 
 Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca . 4 @.@ 5 g · cm − 3 ( and thus opacity to X @-@ rays ) . For this reason it is used as a radiocontrast agent in X @-@ ray imaging of the digestive system ( " barium meals " and " barium enemas " ) . <unk> , a pigment that contains barium sulfate and zinc sulfide , is a permanent white that has good covering power , and does not darken when exposed to sulfides . 
 = = = Other barium compounds = = = 
 Aside from the sulfate , other compounds of barium find only niche applications . Applications are limited by the toxicity of <unk> + ions ( barium carbonate is a rat poison ) , which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO4 . 
 Barium oxide is used in a coating for the electrodes of fluorescent lamps , which facilitates the release of electrons . 
 Barium carbonate is used in glassmaking and ferrite sintering . Being a heavy element , barium increases the refractive index and luster of the glass . The compound is also used to reduce leaks of X @-@ rays from cathode ray tubes ( CRT ) TV sets . 
 Barium , typically as barium nitrate , is added to fireworks to impart them a green color . The species responsible for the brilliant green is barium <unk> ; in the absence of chlorine a yellow or " apple " green is produced instead . 
 Barium peroxide can be used as a catalyst to start an aluminothermic reaction when welding rail tracks together . It can also be used in green tracer ammunition and as a bleaching agent . 
 Barium titanate is a promising <unk> . 
 Barium fluoride is used for optics in infrared applications because of its wide transparency range of 0 @.@ 15 – 12 micrometers . 
 YBCO was the first high @-@ temperature superconductor that could be cooled by liquid nitrogen , as its transition temperature of 93 K ( − 180 @.@ 2 ° C ; − 292 @.@ 3 ° F ) exceeded the boiling point of nitrogen ( 77 K or − 196 @.@ 2 ° C or − 321 @.@ 1 ° F ) . 
 <unk> a type of sintered ceramic compound composed of Iron Oxide ( Fe2O3 ) combined with Barium Oxide ( BaO ) , that is both electrically <unk> and ferrimagnetic , which can be temporarily or permanently magnetized . 
 = = Biological dangers and precautions = = 
 Because of the high reactivity of the metal , toxicological data are available only for compounds . Water @-@ soluble barium compounds are poisonous . At low doses , barium ions act as a muscle stimulant , whereas higher doses affect the nervous system , causing cardiac irregularities , tremors , weakness , anxiety , dyspnea and paralysis . This may be due to the ability of <unk> + to block potassium ion channels , which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system . Other target organs for water @-@ soluble barium compounds ( i.e. , barium ions ) are eyes , immune system , heart , respiratory system , and skin . They affect the body strongly , causing , for example , blindness and sensitization . 
 Barium is not carcinogenic , and it does not bioaccumulate . However , inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs , causing a benign condition called <unk> . For comparison to the soluble poisons , the insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is thus not classified as a dangerous good . 
 To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction , barium metal is kept under argon or mineral oils . Contact with air is dangerous , as it may cause ignition . Moisture , friction , heat , sparks , flames , shocks , static electricity , reactions with oxidizers and acids should be avoided . Everything that may make contact with barium should be grounded . Those who work with the metal should wear pre @-@ cleaned non @-@ sparking shoes , flame @-@ resistant rubber clothes , rubber gloves , apron , goggles , and a gas mask ; they are not allowed to smoke in the working area and must wash themselves after handling barium . 
 = Operation Mole Cricket 19 = 
 Operation Mole Cricket 19 ( Hebrew : מבצע <unk> @-@ 19 , <unk> <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ) was a suppression of enemy air defenses ( SEAD ) campaign launched by the Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) against Syrian targets on June 9 , 1982 , at the outset of the 1982 Lebanon War . The operation was the first time in history that a Western @-@ equipped air force successfully destroyed a Soviet @-@ built surface @-@ to @-@ air missile ( SAM ) network . It also became one of the biggest air battles since World War II , and the biggest since the Korean War . The result was a decisive Israeli victory , leading to the colloquial name the " Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot " . 
 The IAF began working on a SAM suppression operation since the end of the Yom Kippur War . Rising tensions between Israel and Syria over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying the SAM batteries in the Beqaa Valley . On June 6 , 1982 , Israel invaded Lebanon , and on the third day of the war , with clashes going on between the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and the Syrian Army , Israel decided to launch the operation . 
 The battle lasted about two hours , and involved innovative tactics and technology . By the end of the day , the IAF had destroyed seventeen of the nineteen SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley and shot down 90 enemy aircraft with minimal losses . The battle led the United States to impose a ceasefire on Israel and Syria .

 = = = Aftermath of the Yom Kippur War = = = 
 In the Yom Kippur War of 1973 , Egypt had 20 mobile SA @-@ 6 SAM systems , backed up by 70 SA @-@ 2s , 65 SA @-@ 3s , and upward of 2 @,@ 500 anti @-@ aircraft batteries and about 3 @,@ 000 SA @-@ 7s . Syria deployed another 34 SAM batteries . In the first three days , the IAF lost 50 aircraft in about 1 @,@ 220 sorties , a loss rate of four percent . The SA @-@ 6s , SA @-@ 7s , and ZSU @-@ 23 @-@ 4 guns hit 53 of Israel 's prewar total of 170 A @-@ 4 Skyhawks and 33 of its 177 F @-@ 4 Phantoms . As a result , the IAF found it difficult to provide air support to the ground troops . When Egypt tried to push beyond the range of its SAM batteries on October 14 , it lost 28 aircraft . Ezer Weizman , a former IAF commander , said that " the wing of the fighter plane was broken by the SAM " . Between 1973 and 1978 , the IAF undertook a major project to try to find an answer to the SAM threat . 
 The losses suffered by Israel in the 1973 war were so high that it indirectly spawned the United States stealth aircraft program , Project HAVE BLUE . The U.S. estimated that without a solution to the SAM problem , even the United States would suffer depletion of its Air Force within two weeks of a conflict erupting between the U.S. and Soviet Union . The Israelis had lost 109 aircraft in 18 days . 
 On May 28 , 1980 , IAF guided missiles destroyed two armored cars carrying SA @-@ 9 batteries , manned by Libyan troops , near Sidon . The Israeli media declared that a solution to the SAM problem was found , but the IAF Commander , David Ivry , said that this assessment was premature , and that the SA @-@ 9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors . The Prime Minister , Menachem Begin , then also Minister of Defense , announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours . Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind . 
 = = = 1981 SAM crisis = = = 
 On April 28 , 1981 the IAF ( F @-@ 16A fighters from 117 squadron in Ramat David air base ) shot down two Syrian helicopters over Lebanon . Syria responded by deploying its first SAM brigades to the Beqaa Valley . The SAM batteries were not a direct strategic threat to Israel , and there were already several Syrian SAM batteries in east Lebanon , across the border . Begin faced a dilemma : on one hand , the new deployment damaged Israel 's deterrence credibility and , on the other hand , a strike might lead to an unnecessary clash with Syria . Eventually , he decided on an attack , to be launched on April 30 , but the operation was called off due to weather conditions . By the time the weather cleared , the IAF was preoccupied with preparations for Operation Opera . Meanwhile , the United States was concerned that Soviet reaction to an Israeli strike might lead to a crisis between the superpowers , and pressured Begin not to attack . Israel agreed to cancel the strike , and an American envoy , Philip Habib , was sent to the region as a mediator . He shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus but failed to get the SAM batteries removed . 
 On December 14 , Israel passed the Golan Heights Law which annexed the Golan Heights to Israel . The Syrian President , Hafez al @-@ Assad , considered it a declaration of war , but believed that Syria was in no condition to fight it . The law subjected Israel to severe American and international criticism . On December 20 , the Cabinet of Israel convened for a weekly meeting , in which Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and the Chief of Staff ( <unk> ) Rafael Eitan presented the " Big Plan " for an invasion of Lebanon , which included seizure of the Beirut @-@ Damascus Highway . Begin supported the plan , but other members of the Cabinet opposed and he decided to cancel it . 
 The SAM suppression operation was originally called " Mole 3 " , but the figure increased in respect to the number of SAM batteries detected , eventually reaching 19 . At this point the name was changed to " Mole Cricket " , after the name of the plan for a general war since 1973 , in order to prepare the force psychologically . The name was first revealed in 2002 .

 On Tuesday June 8 , 1982 , while Israeli forces were advancing on Jezzine , Begin addressed part of his statement in the Knesset to the Syrians , urging them not to intervene in the war and saying , inter alia , that : " I once again state that we do not want a war with Syria . From this platform I call on President Assad to instruct the Syrian army not to harm Israeli soldiers and then nothing bad will happen to [ Syrian soldiers ] . We desire no clashes with the Syrian army , if we reach the line 40 km from out northern border the work will have been done , all fighting will end . I am directing my words to the ears of the President of Syria . He knows how to keep an agreement . He signed a cease @-@ fire with us and kept it . He did not allow the terrorists to act . If he behaves in this manner now in Lebanon , no Syrian soldier will be harmed by our soldiers " . 
 That night , while the Battle of Jezzine was raging in central Lebanon , Sharon said at a meeting in the Northern Command headquarters " We know today that there will be a direct confrontation with the Syrians " and argued that it would be best to move deeper into Lebanon . At 11 : 00 PM the IDF entered Ein Zahalta and were caught in a battle against a Syrian division , which halted its advance . Sharon used this as his principal argument for launching Mole Cricket 19 . <unk> Adam , former Deputy Chief of Staff and designated Head of the Mossad , voiced his concern that the Cabinet was not fully aware of the war 's scope and objective . Nevertheless , Sharon gave North Command chief , Amir Drori , a go @-@ ahead to drive on the Beqaa valley , and Deputy Chief of Staff Moshe Levi flew to Ein Zahalta to tell the commander , Menachem <unk> , that the IAF would attack the Syrian missiles that day . Meanwhile , Ivry learned that Remotely Piloted Vehicles ( <unk> ) had spotted an additional five SA @-@ 6s moving from the Golan Heights into the Beqaa Valley . The IAF interpreted that move as a signal that Syria had no intention of becoming involved in a major war — otherwise the SAMs would have been positioned to defend the approach to Damascus . The redeployment suggested to Ivry that they could strike the SAM sites without risking an all @-@ out war with Syria . 
 Sharon flew back to Jerusalem to attend a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday , June 9 . He said Syria had already begun moving its second armored division ( the 3rd Armoured Division ) south from Ein Zahalta . The political timetable dictated that waiting until Thursday would not leave enough time for a ground advance . Drori , who came with Sharon to the meeting , was against the attack , saying it was superfluous . Eitan was ambivalent , preferring to limit the attack to a signal to the Syrians . The Communications Minister , Mordechai <unk> , argued that Sharon 's plan had exceeded the original forty @-@ kilometer line . Sharon replied that the line had to be measured from Israel 's northernmost point , Metula . He added that destroying the missile batteries in the Beqaa was necessary to save the force at Ein Zahalta . The Interior Minister , Yosef Burg , pointed out that a fight against the Syrians seemed imminent , in contrast to what the Cabinet wanted , and that attacking the missiles would only aggravate things and lead to an all @-@ out war . Sharon stressed the vulnerability of the soldiers in the field . Begin turned to Ivry 's deputy , Amos Amir , and asked for his projection of the IAF 's losses in such an attack . Amir replied " I cannot promise no losses whatsoever , but they will be minimal " . Begin supported the attack and eventually Burg was also convinced . Sharon left the conference and issued an order for an air strike as well as a ground operation .

 On the morning of June 9 , the IAF aircraft over Lebanon were operating at three levels . <unk> and Skyhawks were along the coastline from Sidon to the outskirts of Beirut , providing close air support for the ground troops and striking at Palestine Liberation Organization targets . At the second level , over 10 @,@ 000 feet ( <unk> ) , similar formations were circling and awaiting orders . At the top level , Hawkeyes were stationed to ensure air control . The first task force aircraft attacked the Syrian radar at the top of Jebel <unk> , which was commanding a large area . 
 Ivry received the green light at 10 : 00 AM to execute the operation , but by then he had postponed the attack until 2 : 00 PM . At 1 : 30 PM , Eitan ordered Ivry to strike , and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs . The first wave was made up of 96 F @-@ 15s and F @-@ 16s . The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3 : 50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft . When the attack was launched , the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land . 
 IAF aircraft carried electronic countermeasures pods to foil radar tracking . The IAF command post in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real @-@ time command picture of the air battle through various data links . E @-@ 2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down @-@ linked their pictures to the command post . A squadron of <unk> Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles ( <unk> ) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time , providing constant location of the SAM batteries . A two @-@ way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up , allowing for real @-@ time command . 
 The primary Syrian fighters involved were MiG @-@ 21 , with considerable numbers of MiG @-@ 23s and Su @-@ 20s also deployed . Syrian aircraft depended on ground @-@ controlled interception ( GCI ) sites for command and control . The SAM sites were a combination of SA @-@ 2s , SA @-@ 3s , and SA @-@ 6s . The IAF 's F @-@ 15s , F @-@ 16s , F @-@ 4s , and <unk> were equipped with AIM @-@ <unk> Sparrow radar @-@ guided missiles , AIM @-@ 9L Sidewinder infrared @-@ guided missiles , and computer @-@ aimed 20 @-@ mm cannons . The F @-@ 15s and F @-@ 16s were equipped with a Head @-@ up display ( HUD ) system . 
 The Mastiff RPVs went in first to cause the Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing the Syrians that many attack aircraft were overhead . Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar , the tracking signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles ' range . The Scout then relayed the signal to <unk> Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast . The data gathered was analyzed by the <unk> and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft . Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones , the F @-@ 15s and F @-@ 16s provided air cover while F @-@ 4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries , destroying them with AGM @-@ 78 and AGM @-@ 45 anti @-@ radiation missiles . The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F @-@ 4s ' exposure to the SAMs . The Syrians reportedly fired 57 SA @-@ 6s , to no effect . 
 According to Ivry , many of the SAM batteries were on the Syrian side of the border . Said Eitan , " From the operational point of view I can say that we used the mini @-@ RPVs , long before the war , to identify and locate all the Syrian missile batteries . We then used superior electronic devices which enabled us to " blind " or neutralize the missile sites ' ground @-@ to @-@ air radar . We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft . But in advance of direct aerial attacks , we used long @-@ range artillery " . 
 The Syrians responded by launching about 100 fighter aircraft to stop the attacks . <unk> IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio , in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post . Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG @-@ 21s and MiG @-@ 23s and cut them off from ground control , making them vulnerable to AWACS @-@ directed attacks from the Israeli F @-@ 15s and F @-@ 16s . 
 The IAF positioned RPVs over three major airfields in Syria to report when and how many Syrian aircraft were taking off . The data was transmitted to the E @-@ 2Cs . The IAF took advantage of the fact that the MiGs had only nose and tail alert radar systems and no side warnings or look @-@ up and look @-@ down systems , by jamming the GCI communications net . E @-@ 2Cs guided the Israeli aircraft into positions that enabled them to attack the Syrian aircraft from the side , where the latter would have no warning . Because of the jamming , the Syrians GCI controllers could not direct their pilots toward the incoming Israeli aircraft . The Sparrow missiles attacked at speeds of Mach 3 @.@ 5 at ranges of 14 to 25 miles , which meant that they were not only outside the Syrians ' radar range but also outside their visual range . The Sidewinders ' " head @-@ on " capabilities at close range gave the Israelis firepower advantage . 
 Discussing the Syrian response to the attacks , Eitan said : " The first reaction of the Syrians when we attacked their missiles was to scramble their air forces ... any [ Syrian fighter pilots ] who crossed an imaginary line in the direction of our forces was destroyed , shot down . The imaginary line was actually the range of the missile batteries in Syria proper . The basic tactic of the Syrian air force is to take to the air and to cross this imaginary line , which brings them outside the protective range of their home @-@ based missiles . They do what they can , then run back for cover . " 
 By evening , twenty @-@ nine MiGs were shot down and seventeen of the nineteen SAM batteries were destroyed . The IAF suffered no losses . Near 4 : 00 PM , with fourteen batteries destroyed and an hour left until dark , Ivry decided to call off the operation , assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day . The operation was stopped shortly after 4 : 00 PM . Colonel Aviem Sella , a member of the operation staff , later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 That night , the IAF destroyed the Syrian Army 's 47th Armored Brigade north of Baalbek as it was moving south , and the following day , the IAF destroyed six other SAM batteries , two that remained from the operation and four that the Syrians moved into the Beqaa valley that night . Syrian Defense Minister , Mustafa Tlass told Assad that " the Syrian Air Force was outclassed , the ground @-@ to @-@ air missiles useless , and that without air cover , the army could not fight on " . 
 Sharon later said that " If we had tolerated that development , the Syrian armored forces would have consisted of 600 tanks protected by an extensive missile umbrella . Their missile batteries fired at our planes . We had no choice other than to approve a military operation to destroy the missile buildup " . He called the operation " the turning point " in the invasion . A senior IAF officer , widely believed to be Ivry himself , later said that " Syrian aircraft were fighting from a disadvantage , having to respond to the Israeli threat wherever and whenever it materialized , within a general strategic and tactical situation not in Syria 's favor . " 
 <unk> later wrote in his book that Sharon tricked the Cabinet into believing that the confrontation with the Syrians was unexpected , and that Sharon had in fact been planning the attack since the eve of the war . Sharon maintained that on June 6 he had ordered the IDF not to cross the Awali River and to avoid a confrontation with the Syrians . Sharon said he did order the army to prepare for a contingency plan , however , to drive on the Beirut @-@ Damascus highway in case the Syrians attacked first . Eitan claimed that on the night before the operation , he had agreed with Sharon to prepare the IAF for the attack , in case the Cabinet approved it . Senior Israeli commanders said after the operation that Operation Peace for Galilee could have been achieved without confronting the Syrians . 
 On Wednesday , Assad sent Tlass to Moscow to seek a comprehensive air umbrella . The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich <unk> to Syria to find out what happened to the Syrian SAMs , fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe . On June 9 , Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms , demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire . US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6 : 00 AM , on June 10 . By noon on Friday , when the ceasefire took effect , the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat . A year after the battle , a US fact @-@ finding mission headed by Lieutenant @-@ General John Chain , then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations , arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle . 
 The Soviet military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda announced that " sixty @-@ seven Israeli aircraft , including modern US @-@ made F @-@ 15 and F @-@ 16 fighters , were downed " in the fighting . The newspaper also reported a meeting with a Syrian airman who recounted an engagement in which he shot down an Israeli F @-@ 15 : " The victory had not been easy ; the enemy had been subtle " . Even within Soviet ranks , these claims met with great skepticism . In 1991 , Ivry met a Czech general who had been serving in Moscow in 1982 . He told Ivry that the operation made the Soviets understand that Western technology was superior to theirs , and that in his view , the blow to the Beqaa Valley SAMs was an impetus to Glasnost and the Soviet Union 's collapse . 
 = Architecture in early modern Scotland = 
 Architecture in early modern Scotland encompasses all building within the borders of the kingdom of Scotland , from the early sixteenth century to the mid @-@ eighteenth century . The time period roughly corresponds to the early modern era in Europe , beginning with the Renaissance and Reformation and ending with the start of the Enlightenment and Industrialisation . 
 Vernacular architecture made use of local materials such as stone , turf and , where available , wood . Most of the population was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings . The most common form of dwelling throughout Scotland was the long house , shared by humans and animals . About ten per cent of the population lived in the burghs , in a mixture of half @-@ timbered and stone houses . 
 The impact of the Renaissance on Scottish architecture began in the reign of James III in the late fifteenth century with the rebuilding of royal palaces such as Linlithgow , and reached its peak under James V. The Reformation had a major impact on ecclesiastical architecture from the mid @-@ sixteenth century onward , resulting in simple church buildings , devoid of ornamentation . From the 1560s great private houses were built in a distinctive style that became known as Scottish Baronial . Such houses combined Renaissance features with those of Scottish castles and tower houses , resulting in larger , more comfortable residences . 
 After the Restoration in 1660 , there was a fashion for grand private houses in designs influenced by the Palladian style and associated with the architects Sir William Bruce ( 1630 – 1710 ) and James Smith ( c . 1645 – 1731 ) . After the Act of Union in 1707 , the threat of Jacobite Rebellions led to the building of military defences such as Fort George near Inverness . Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the eighteenth century , including Colen Campbell , James Gibbs and William Adam , who all had a major influence on Georgian architecture across Britain . The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements , with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple . 
 = = Vernacular architecture = = 
 The vernacular architecture of Scotland , as elsewhere , made use of local materials and methods . The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction , and were built by groups of family and friends . Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material , employed in both mortared and dry stone construction . As in English vernacular architecture , where wood was available , crucks ( pairs of curved timbers ) were often used to support the roof . With a lack of long span structural timber , the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls . Walls were often built of stone , and could have gaps filled with turf , or plastered with clay . In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed , sometimes on a stone base . Turf @-@ filled walls were not long @-@ lasting , and had to be rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years . In some regions , including the south @-@ west and around Dundee , solid clay walls were used , or combinations of clay , turf and straw , rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof . Different regions used turfs , or thatch of broom , heather , straw or reeds for roofing . 
 Most of the early modern population , in both the Lowlands and Highlands , was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings . As the population expanded , some of these settlements were sub @-@ divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled , with sheilings ( clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing ) , becoming permanent settlements . The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural improvement was a byre @-@ dwelling or long house , with humans and livestock sharing a common roof , often separated by only a partition wall . Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder , with single rooms , slit windows and earthen floors , often shared by a large family . In contrast , many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers , were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows . 
 Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period , mainly in the east and south of the country . A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings , with <unk> , <unk> and alleys leading off it , many of which survive today . In towns , traditional thatched half @-@ timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate @-@ roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry . Most wooden thatched houses have not survived , but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair 's House , Acheson House and the six @-@ storey Gladstone 's Land , an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns , producing horizontally divided tenements . Many burghs acquired tollbooths in this period , which acted as town halls , courts and prisons . They often had peels of bells or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress . The Old Tolbooth , Edinburgh was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561 and housed the parliament until the end of the 1630s . Other examples can be seen at Tain , Culross and Stonehaven , often showing influences from the Low Countries in their crow @-@ stepped gables and steeples . 
 = = Renaissance = = 
 The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under James III ( r . 1460 – 88 ) , accelerated under James IV ( r . 1488 – 1513 ) and reached its peak under James V ( r . 1513 – 42 ) . The influence of Renaissance architecture is reflected in these buildings . Linlithgow was first constructed under James I ( r . 1406 – 27 ) , under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace from 1429 , apparently the first use of this term in the country . It was extended under James III and resembled a quadrangular , corner @-@ towered Italian signorial palace or palatium ad moden castri ( a castle @-@ style palace ) , combining classical symmetry with neo @-@ chivalric imagery . There is evidence that Italian masons were employed by James IV , in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions . 
 In 1536 James V visited France for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois and would have come in contact with French Renaissance architecture . His second marriage to Mary of Guise two years later may have resulted in longer @-@ term connections and influences . Architecture from his reign largely disregarded the insular style of England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European . Rather than slavishly copying continental forms , most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns , adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials ( particularly stone and harl ) . The building at Linlithgow was followed by rebuilding at Holyrood Palace , Falkland Palace , Stirling Castle and Edinburgh Castle , described by Roger Mason as " some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain " . 
 Many of the building programs were planned and financed by James Hamilton of Finnart , Steward of the Royal Household and Master of Works to James V. He was also responsible for the architectural works at Blackness Castle , Rothesay Castle , the house at Crawfordjohn , the New Inn in the St Andrews Cathedral Priory and the lodging at Balmerino Abbey for the ailing Queen Madeleine . Work undertaken for James VI demonstrated continued Renaissance influences ; the Chapel Royal at Stirling has a classical entrance built in 1594 and the North Wing of Linlithgow , built in 1618 , uses classical pediments . Similar themes can be seen in the private houses of aristocrats , as in Mar 's Wark , Stirling ( c . 1570 ) and Crichton Castle , built for the Earl of Bothwell in 1580s . 
 = = Reformation = = 
 From about 1560 , the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland . Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship , seeing no need for elaborate buildings divided up for the purpose of ritual . This resulted in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings , ornaments and decoration . New churches were built and existent churches adapted for reformed services , particularly by placing the pulpit centrally in the church , as preaching was at the centre of worship . Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles , a style that continued into the seventeenth century , as at Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s , Greenock ( 1591 ) and Durness ( 1619 ) . These churches often have windows on the south wall ( and none on the north ) , which became a characteristic of Reformation kirks . There were continuities with pre @-@ Reformation materials , with some churches using rubble for walls , as at Kemback in Fife ( 1582 ) . Others employed dressed stone and a few added wooden steeples , as at Burntisland ( 1592 ) . The church of Greyfriars , Edinburgh , built between 1602 and 1620 , used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form , but that at Dirleton ( 1612 ) , had a more sophisticated classical style . 
 A variation of the rectangular church developed in post @-@ Reformation Scotland , and often used when adapting existing churches , was the " T " -shaped plan , which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit . Examples can be seen at Kemback and Prestonpans after 1595 . This plan continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at Weem ( 1600 ) , Anstruther Easter , Fife ( 1634 – 44 ) and New Cumnock ( 1657 ) . In the seventeenth century a Greek cross plan was used for churches such as Cawdor ( 1619 ) and Fenwick ( 1643 ) . In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird 's aisle , meaning that they were in effect " T " -plan churches . 
 = = Scots Baronial = = 
 The unique style of great private houses in Scotland , later known as Scots Baronial , originated in the 1560s and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces . It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and also drew on the tower houses and peel towers that had been built in their hundreds by local lords since the fourteenth century , particularly in the borders . These houses abandoned the defensible curtain walls of castles , being fortified refuges that were designed to outlast a raid , rather than a sustained siege . They were usually of three stories , typically crowned with a parapet , projecting on corbels , continuing into circular bartizans at each corner . The new houses built from the late sixteenth century by nobles and lairds were primarily designed for comfort , not for defence . They retained many of the external features that had become associated with nobility but with a larger ground plan , classically a " Z @-@ plan " of a rectangular block with towers , as at Colliston Castle ( 1583 ) and Claypotts Castle ( 1569 – 88 ) . 
 William Wallace , the king 's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631 , was particularly influential . He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618 , Winton House for George Seton , 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot 's Hospital , Edinburgh . He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan similar to that used at Château d 'Ancy @-@ le @-@ Franc . This style can be seen in lords ' houses built at Caerlaverlock ( 1620 ) , Moray House , Edinburgh ( 1628 ) and Drumlanrig Castle ( 1675 – 89 ) , and was highly influential until the Baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century . 
 = = Commonwealth and Restoration = = 
 During the turbulent era of the Civil Wars and the incorporation of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England , Scotland and Ireland , significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture . Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions in the style of the trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr , Perth and Leith , and 20 smaller forts were built as far apart as Orkney and Stornoway . Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness . The universities saw an improvement in their funding , as they were given income from deaneries , defunct bishoprics and the excise , allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow . After the Restoration in 1660 , large @-@ scale building began again , influenced by a growing interest in Classicism . 
 = = = Palaces and estate houses = = = 
 Sir William Bruce ( c . 1630 – 1710 ) is considered " the effective founder of classical architecture in Scotland " and was the key figure in introducing the Palladian style to the country . Andrea Palladio ( 1508 – 80 ) was an influential architect who worked in the region of Venice in the sixteenth century and whose buildings are characterised by symmetry , fine proportion and formal elements drawn from Ancient Classical architecture . In England the introduction of the Palladian style is associated with Inigo Jones ( 1573 – 1652 ) . Bruce 's architectural style incorporated Palladian elements and was influenced by Jones , but also borrowed from the Italian Baroque and was most strongly influenced by Sir Christopher Wren 's ( 1632 – 1723 ) interpretation of the Baroque in England . Bruce popularised a style of country house among the Scottish nobility that encouraged a move towards a more leisure @-@ oriented architecture already adopted in continental Europe . He built and remodelled country houses , including Thirlestane Castle and Prestonfield House . Among his most significant work was his own Palladian mansion at Kinross , built on the Loch Leven estate he had purchased in 1675 . Bruce 's houses were predominantly built using well @-@ cut ashlar masonry on the façades ; rubble stonework was used only for internal walls . As the Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works Bruce undertook the rebuilding of the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse in the 1670s , giving the palace its present appearance . After the death of Charles II in 1685 , Bruce lost political favour , and following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he was imprisoned more than once as a suspected Jacobite . 
 James Smith ( c . 1645 – 1731 ) worked as a mason on Bruce 's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace . In 1683 he was appointed Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works , responsible for the palace 's maintenance . With his father @-@ in @-@ law , the master mason Robert Mylne ( 1633 – 1710 ) , Smith worked on Caroline Park in Edinburgh ( 1685 ) , and Drumlanrig Castle ( 1680s ) . Smith 's country houses followed the pattern established by William Bruce , with hipped roofs and pedimented fronts , in a plain but handsome Palladian style . Hamilton Palace ( 1695 ) was fronted by giant Corinthian columns , and a pedimented entrance , but was otherwise restrained . Dalkeith Palace ( 1702 – 10 ) was modelled after William of Orange 's palace at Het Loo in the Netherlands . 
 = = = Churches = = = 
 By the later seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the church had adopted the modestly sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation . Most had a centralised plan with two or three arms , in a rectangular or T @-@ planned arrangement . Steeples continued to be a major feature , either centrally on the long axis , or on an end gable , as had been the case in pre @-@ Reformation churches . As a result there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England . Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era . Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale , who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II . The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity , but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches . 
 The major exceptions to the common Greek cross plan are in the work of Smith , who had become a Jesuit in his youth . These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687 , which was outfitted in an elaborate style . In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh , in Greyfriars Kirkyard , a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro , designed by Donato Bramante ( 1444 – 1514 ) . The drive to Episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns , including rectangular plans with the pulpit at the end opposite the entrance . The Latin Cross form increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism , was also used , as in Smith 's Canongate Kirk ( 1688 – 90 ) , but the Presbyterian revolution of 1689 – 90 occurred before its completion and the chancel was blocked up , effectively transforming it into a T @-@ plan . 
 = = Early eighteenth century = = 
 After the Act of Union of 1707 , growing prosperity in Scotland led to a spate of new building , both public and private . The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period . Military structures relied on the strength of inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire . This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness ( 1748 – 69 ) , with its projecting bastions and redoubts . 
 = = = Country houses = = = 
 Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the early eighteenth century , including Colen Campbell ( 1676 – 1729 ) , James Gibbs ( 1682 – 1754 ) and William Adam ( 1689 – 1748 ) , all of whom were influenced by Classical architecture . Campbell was influenced by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture . Architectural historian Howard Colvin has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and may even have been his pupil . He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs , who trained in Rome and also practised mainly in England . Campbell 's architectural style incorporated Palladian elements , as well as forms from the Italian Baroque and Inigo Jones , but was most strongly influenced by Sir Christopher Wren 's interpretation of the Baroque . William Adam , the foremost Scottish architect of his time , designed and built numerous country houses and public buildings . Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh , and Duff House in Banff . His individual , exuberant , style was built on the Palladian style , but with Baroque motifs inspired by the work of John Vanbrugh and Continental architecture . After his death , his sons Robert and John took on the family business and became the leading British architects of the second half of the century . 
 = = = Neo @-@ classical churches = = = 
 In the eighteenth century established patterns of church building continued , with T @-@ shaped plans with steeples on the long side , as at New Church , Dumfries ( 1724 – 27 ) , and Newbattle Parish Church ( 1727 – 29 ) . William Adam 's Hamilton Parish Church ( 1729 – 32 ) , was a Greek cross plan inscribed in a circle , while John Douglas 's Killin Church ( 1744 ) was octagonal . Scots @-@ born architect James Gibbs was highly influential on British ecclesiastical architecture . He introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields , London , with a massive , steepled portico and rectangular , side @-@ aisled plan . Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at St Andrew 's in the Square ( 1737 – 59 ) , designed by Allan Dreghorn and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth , and at the smaller <unk> Chapel ( completed in 1731 ) , designed by Alexander McGill . Gibbs ' own design for St. Nicholas West , Aberdeen ( 1752 – 55 ) , had the same rectangular plan , with a nave @-@ and @-@ aisles , barrel @-@ vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front . After the Toleration Act of 1712 , Episcopalians began building a limited number of new chapels including Alexander Jaffray 's St Paul 's chapel in Aberdeen ( 1721 ) , the meeting house designed by McGill in Montrose , an Edinburgh chapel opened in 1722 and St Andrew 's @-@ by @-@ the @-@ Green in Glasgow ( 1750 – 52 ) , which adopted a simpler version of Gibbs ' pedimented rectangular plan . 
 = Hananu Revolt = 
 The Hananu Revolt ( also known as the Aleppo Revolt or the Northern revolts ) occurred in 1920 – 1921 in the western countryside of Aleppo and its purpose was to drive out French military forces from northern Syria . Support for the revolt was driven by opposition to the establishment of a French Mandate in the country . The revolt was named after its leading commander , Ibrahim Hananu , and mainly consisted of four allied revolts in the areas of Jabal Harim , Jabal Qusayr , Jabal Zawiya and Jabal Sahyun . The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure . 
 The Hananu Revolt coincided with the Alawite Revolt in Syria 's coastal mountains led by Saleh al @-@ Ali , and both al @-@ Ali and Hananu jointly referred to their revolts as part of the " general national movement of Western Aleppo " . Despite early rebel victories , guerrilla operations ceased after the French occupation of Aleppo in July 1920 and the dissolution of the Arab government , the revolt 's key backer . However , Hananu 's forces renewed their revolt in November 1920 after securing large amounts of military aid from the Turkish forces of Mustafa Kemal , who were fighting the French for control of southern Anatolia . At the revolt 's peak in 1920 , Hananu established a quasi @-@ state in the region between Aleppo and the Mediterranean . The rebels were dealt major blows on the battlefield in December 1920 and after agreements between the French and the Turks , Turkish military support for the rebels largely dissipated by the spring of 1921 . French forces overran Hananu 's last stronghold in Jabal Zawiya in July . Hananu was tried by the French Mandatory authorities and ultimately acquitted . A low @-@ level insurgency led by rebel leader Yusuf al @-@ Sa 'dun persisted , with the last major military engagement with French forces occurring on 8 August 1926 . The latter occurred amid the countrywide Great Syrian Revolt , which began in the summer of 1925 . 
 The collapse of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo 's political configurations . Whereas prior to the revolt , many in Aleppo 's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics , the betrayal that Aleppo 's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny with the rest of Syria . Many were also influenced by Hananu 's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus . In the aftermath of the Franco @-@ Turkish accords , Aleppo 's Anatolian hinterland , the major market for its goods and the supplier of its food and raw materials , was ceded to Turkey . This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia , harming the former 's economy . 
 = = Background = = 
 In October 1918 , Allied Forces and the Sharifian army wrested control of Syria from the Ottoman Empire . With British military support , the Hashemite leader of the Sharifian army , Emir Faisal , formed a rudimentary government in Damascus which extended its control to the northern inland Syrian cities of Homs , Hama and Aleppo . Meanwhile , France claimed special interests in Syria , per the Sykes @-@ Picot agreement made with the British , and sought to establish a French Mandate over the region . The prospect of French rule was opposed by Syria 's inhabitants . French forces landed in the northern coastal city of Latakia in November 1918 and began to push inland through the coastal mountains , where they faced a revolt led by Saleh al @-@ Ali , an Alawite feudal sheikh . 
 = = = Political and cultural sentiments in Aleppo = = = 
 At the time of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath , Aleppo 's political elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state . A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo 's elite and populace from those of Damascus . For one , the economic well @-@ being of Aleppo 's inhabitants was dependent on open , commercial access to Aleppo 's Anatolian hinterland , which was predominantly populated by Turks ; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo 's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials . 
 Furthermore , the political elite of Aleppo , which was considerably more ethnically and religiously diverse than the almost entirely Arab Muslim @-@ populated Damascus , was culturally closer to Turkish @-@ Ottoman society , and numerous members of Aleppo 's elite were of Turkic , Kurdish and Circassian descent . Because of these factors , many in Aleppo 's political class did not support the 1916 Arab Revolt , and those who joined it felt that the revolt negatively exceeded their expectations because it ultimately ended Ottoman rule , and thus broke the bonds of Islamic unity and initiated the separation of Aleppo from its Anatolian hinterland . There was also resentment in Aleppo , which under Ottoman rule had been the administrative center of the Aleppo Vilayet ( Province of Aleppo ) and was equal to Damascus in political stature , at the political dominance of Damascus under Faisal . While there were several Aleppines who held influential positions in Faisal 's Damascus @-@ based government , Faisal 's leading political authorities in Aleppo were from Damascus or Iraq . However , French officials incorrectly believed that the rivalry between Aleppo and Damascus would make Aleppo 's elite embrace French rule . Instead , according to historian Phillip S. Khoury , Aleppo " vigorously resisted [ French ] occupation in order that its voice be heard in the new political climate . " 
 Several <unk> dignitaries supported Emir Faisal and in late October 1918 , following the Sharifian army 's entry into Aleppo , a branch of the Arab Club was founded in the city . The Arab Club 's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine regionalism . It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity , and served as a political support base for Emir Faisal . Among the Arab Club 's founders were Ibrahim Hananu , the president of Aleppo Vilayet 's presidential council , Rashid al @-@ Tali 'a , governor of Aleppo Vilayet , Najib Bani <unk> , a wealthy Aleppine merchant , Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Kayyali , an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas 'ud al @-@ <unk> , one of the city 's leading Muslim scholars . 
 = = = Prelude and early rebel actions = = = 
 In November 1918 , soldiers from Emir Faisal 's army entered Antioch and were welcomed by the city 's Arab inhabitants . In late November , French troops landed on the coast of the Gulf of Alexandretta and entered the city of Alexandretta , prompting anti @-@ French uprisings in Antioch , al @-@ <unk> and <unk> and the al @-@ <unk> area . In December , French troops occupied Antioch and replaced the Arab flag on its governmental headquarters with the French flag . The revolts continued in the city 's countryside , namely in the vicinity of <unk> and al @-@ Qusayr . The local uprisings spread from the Antioch region to Aleppo 's countryside as far as the Euphrates . The rebels consisted of small , disorganized ′ iṣābāt ( bands ) and launched guerrilla @-@ style attacks against French targets , but they also engaged in banditry and highway robberies . An early attempt to coordinate the various rebel groups took place when one of the leaders of the Antiochian uprising and Alawite notable , Najib al @-@ Arsuzi , developed contacts with rebel leaders from Jisr al @-@ Shughur and other areas . 
 British forces withdrew from Syria to Transjordan and Palestine in December 1919 as part of agreements with France over dividing control of the Ottomans ' predominantly Arab territories ( later , in April 1920 , France was given a mandate over Syria at the San Remo conference ) . This left Faisal 's rudimentary state vulnerable to French occupation . The French demanded that Faisal rein in the ′ iṣābāt , which were not under Faisal 's control . Instead , Faisal opted to support and organize the northern rebels to prevent French advances from the coastal areas to the Syrian interior . The Arab government entrusted two natives of northern Syria , Hananu , a former Ottoman military instructor and a municipal official , and Subhi Barakat , a notable from Alexandretta , with expanding and organizing the local uprisings into a full @-@ blown revolt . 
 Initially , Hananu logistically supported the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region . He later decided to organize a rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside . Hananu was motivated to act by what he saw as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress , the legislative body of Faisal 's state of which Hananu was a member , in preventing French rule . He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al @-@ Tali 'a , the Arab government 's district governor of Hama , who had been supporting Saleh al @-@ Ali and the Alawite @-@ dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains . Meanwhile , the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920 . France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal 's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa , and moved to put an end to Faisal 's state . Anti @-@ French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense , which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland . The committees were founded by members of the local elite , many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule , but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism . 
 Hananu gained the backing of Aleppo 's Committee of National Defense , which consisted of numerous educated professionals , wealthy merchants and Muslim religious leaders . The committee provided him with arms and funds , and helped promote his armed campaign among the city 's Muslim scholars as well as put Hananu in touch with Ibrahim al @-@ <unk> , head of the Arab Army 's Second Division . On orders from the Arab government in Damascus , Hananu formed an ′ iṣābā in Aleppo consisting of seven men from his native Kafr Takharim , who he armed with hand @-@ held bombs and rifles . With al @-@ <unk> 's assistance , Hananu later expanded his ′ iṣābā to forty fighters , known as mujahidin ( fighters of a holy struggle ) , from Kafr Takharim and organized them into four equal @-@ sized units . According to historian Dalal Arsuzi @-@ <unk> , the small size of each unit made them highly mobile and " able to inflict chaos on French troops " . Hananu used his family 's farm in the regional administrative center of Harim as the headquarters of his branch of the Committee of National Defense .

 Hananu 's revolt coincided with Turkish revolts against the French military presence in the Anatolian cities of Urfa , Gaziantep and Mar 'ash . It also was related to Barakat 's revolt in Antioch , which was captured and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920 . The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to <unk> . On 18 April , taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place , Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim . With fifty of his irregulars , Hananu stormed the town . As word of his attack spread to nearby villages , his forces subsequently swelled to 400 . 
 Hananu and Rashid al @-@ Tali 'a cooperated with Barakat in an attempt to unify northern Syria 's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French , in allegiance with Faisal 's government in Damascus . Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi @-@ nomadic Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region . Following the battle at Harim , Hananu , with the assistance of Aleppo 's Committee of National Defense , had collected up to 2 @,@ 000 gold pounds in funds , and 1 @,@ 700 rifles for the 680 men in his ' iṣābā , who he and his aides trained . 
 = = = = French occupation of Aleppo = = = = 
 In April 1920 , Hananu coordinated the shipment of Turkish arms to Saleh al @-@ Ali 's forces in their revolt against the French in the coastal mountains south of Latakia . Faisal 's government aided Hananu 's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries . French General Henri Gouraud demanded that Faisal rein in the rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance . Faisal continued to oppose French rule and his government launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May as part of a last @-@ ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion , but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful . On 14 July , Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France 's mandate over Syria . Later in mid @-@ July , French forces broke Hananu 's resistance lines in Jisr al @-@ Shughur , capturing the town on their way to Aleppo . 
 In late July , the French escalated their push into Syria 's major inland cities . On 23 July , French troops led by General Fernand <unk> , commander of the Army of the Levant 's Fourth Division , captured Aleppo without resistance . The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al @-@ Sa 'dun in his memoirs . In the aftermath of Aleppo 's occupation , he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city , a plan that did not materialize . The consequent flight of Aleppo 's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces ' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city . On 25 July , French forces captured Damascus a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by Yusuf al- ' Azma at the Battle of Maysalun . Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus , Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al @-@ Qusayr , in which the attendants were divided between those who advocated either of the following : continuing the revolt , surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support . After the meeting , Barakat chose to defect to the French . Afterward , al @-@ Sa 'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat 's former area of operations . 
 Hananu meanwhile left Aleppo , which had served as his urban base , and went to the village of <unk> to regroup and continue the revolt , rallying support around his leadership from the active ′ iṣābāt in the western Aleppo countryside . The revolt subsequently expanded to include four other ′ iṣābāt , namely al @-@ Sa 'dun 's ′ iṣābā ( over 400 rebels ) in the Jabal Qusayr area near Antioch , Umar al @-@ Bitar 's ′ iṣābā ( 150 rebels ) in Jabal Sahyun in the mountains around al @-@ <unk> northeast of Latakia , the ′ iṣābā in Jabal Zawiya ( 200 rebels ) under commander Mustafa al @-@ Hajj Husayn and Najib Uwaid 's ′ iṣābā ( 250 fighters ) around Kafr Takharim in Harim District . Al @-@ Sa 'dun 's area of operations were centered in Jabal Qusayr , but extended as far north as al @-@ <unk> , as far south as Jisr al @-@ Shughur , as far east as Darkush and far west as the <unk> area . 
 An ′ iṣābā from Jableh led by Sheikh Izz ad @-@ Din al @-@ Qassam also formed part of the revolt . The French military authorities considered al @-@ Qassam 's group , which relocated its headquarters to the Jabal Sahyun village of <unk> from Jableh in early 1920 , to be a part of al @-@ Bitar 's unit , but the two commanders operated in different sectors . Al @-@ Bitar 's unit had been active in Jabal Sahyun since early 1919 soon after French forces landed in Latakia . Al @-@ Qassam left Syria to British @-@ held Palestine sometime after the Battle of Maysalun to avoid capture by the French who issued a warrant for his arrest .

 With the Arab government in Damascus destroyed and Faisal exiled , Hananu 's rebels sought to compensate for the consequent loss of aid from the Arab government . In the period following the Arab defeat , the rebels began appointing administrators in their territory who oversaw the institution of taxes to support the revolt , monthly salaries for the fighters and supply services for the ' iṣābā . They also sought military training by Turkish officers . 
 Hananu and some of his aides traveled to Mar 'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September , he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid . In the course of that month , Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support , and military advisers , from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army . Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey , who were leading their respective revolts , both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy . In addition , the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria 's inhabitants , and in northern Syria in particular , there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks . In the second week of September , Saleh al @-@ Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu 's rebels . 
 The Turkish forces in Anatolia were led by Mustafa Kemal , who Hananu established contact with via intermediaries , chief of whom was Jamil Ibrahim Pasha . The latter , who was an Arabized Kurd , Ottoman World War veteran and absentee landlord from Aleppo , met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep in the late summer of 1920 . During their meeting , an agreement was concluded to launch a propaganda campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation . The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920 . 
 Although an urban revolt in Aleppo did not take place in the aftermath of the city 's occupation by French forces , many of Aleppo 's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu 's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city . In addition to the rebels ' propaganda campaign , anti @-@ French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio @-@ economic factors . These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside , the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide . The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city 's neighborhoods . The French authorities also declared martial law , restricting travel and speech , further frustrating the inhabitants . 
 As a result of deteriorating conditions in the city attributed to French governance , the unpopular establishment of martial law , and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers , many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu 's rebels , while many of the city 's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause . The presence of 5 @,@ 000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces , but in numerous incidents , Muslims from Aleppo 's lower @-@ income neighborhoods , such as Bab al @-@ <unk> , violently assaulted members of the city 's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests . 
 = = = = Renewal of revolt = = = = 
 After the relative lull in fighting that followed the French occupation of Aleppo and Damascus , Hananu 's forces resumed their guerrilla campaign in November 1920 . By then , Hananu 's forces grew to about 5 @,@ 000 irregulars . Two months prior to the November offensive , the rebellions in the Antioch area and the Syrian coastal mountains had also resumed after temporarily tapering off in May 1920 . Armed action by Hananu 's allies included an assault against the police station of Hammam , a village north of Harim , by 600 rebels in September . Gouraud stated in a report on 21 September that the rebels were in full control of Antakya , the road between the latter city and Aleppo and the Amanus Mountains . Hananu 's rebels sabotaged telegraph lines and railroads , captured and disarmed French troops , and disrupted French military movements into Aleppo city . The repeated destruction of railroad and telegraph lines between Aleppo , Alexandretta and Beirut by Hananu and Saleh al @-@ Ali 's rebels placed the rebels in a position to take full control of northwestern Syria . 
 By the end of November , the rebels gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al @-@ Shughur and the villages of their districts . They then prepared for offensives to capture the towns and districts of Idlib and Maarrat al @-@ Nu 'man . Other major scenes of fighting occurred at <unk> , Jisr al @-@ Hadid , Kafr Takharim , Darkush , <unk> and the areas of al @-@ Qusayr and Antioch . At around the same time , Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at <unk> , east of Aleppo , and Bedouin forces commanded by ex @-@ Ottoman officer Ramadan al @-@ Shallash , who declared his support for Hananu , began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of al @-@ Raqqah . 
 In the late winter of 1920 , Hananu 's rebels assaulted French forces in Idlib and according to the British consul in Aleppo , looted the town and killed some of its Christian inhabitants . Hananu 's victory at Idlib and the arrival of Turkish military assistance led to a French withdrawal from Idlib . Hananu 's principal lieutenant commander in the Idlib operations was Tahir al @-@ Kayyali , who also served as president of the Arab Club of Aleppo and Aleppo 's Committee of National Defense . In early December , the French general of the 2nd Division in Aleppo , Henri @-@ Félix de Lamothe , assembled a column at Hammam . In mid @-@ December , the French launched a counterattack on Idlib and burned down the city . Afterward , General de Lamothe assembled a second column at Idlib . 
 The French column from Hammam managed to capture Harim and Jisr al @-@ Shughur from the rebels after a series of attacks and counterattacks between the two sides in late December . Hananu 's rebels and Turkish irregulars launched a broad offensive to regain their positions in Harim , Jisr al @-@ Shughur and Idlib , and according to Khoury , " a reversal seemed possible " , as a result of the offensive . However , a French relief column arrived in the area and the French consolidated their hold over the three major towns . The French victories in December proved to be a decisive setback for Hananu 's forces , who withdrew to Jabal Zawiya , a mountainous area south of Idlib . At Jabal Zawiya , Hananu and his commanders re @-@ organized the rebels into more numerous , smaller units . 
 In early 1921 , using al @-@ Shallash as an intermediary , Hananu began receiving support from Emir Abdullah , the Hashemite emir of Transjordan and Faisal 's brother . Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively small in quantity , the French authorities feared it was part of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French from Syria . Hananu , meanwhile , was launching frequent hit @-@ and @-@ run operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep . 
 = = = = Dwindling Turkish support = = = = 
 Hananu continued to receive arms and funds from Anatolia in early 1921 , including a shipment in March consisting of 30 machine guns and 20 horse @-@ loads of ammunition , which came after a larger weapons shipment via <unk> sometime in late February – early March . The Turks and the French negotiated a treaty to end fighting in Cilicia , the southern Anatolian region north of Aleppo , in March . That month , Hananu and Saleh al @-@ Ali issued a joint letter to the League of Nations via the US and Spanish consuls in Aleppo in which the rebel leaders referred to themselves as commanders of the " general national movement in the region of Western Aleppo " and asserted that Syria sought to remain independent of France , and that the country was part of a broader Islamic community associated with the Ottoman state . 
 Despite the treaty with France , Turkish forces in southern Anatolia continued to support Hananu 's rebels with arms for a while longer to pressure the French further and gain more leverage in negotiations over territorial concessions . At this point in the revolt , the rebels were in control of the villages of the Harim , Antioch , Jisr al @-@ Shughur , Idlib and Maarrat al @-@ Nu 'man districts , but not the towns themselves . The French and Hananu entered into negotiations in the village of <unk> near Idlib in April , but they faltered . By order of the French Mandate 's High Commissioner , Henri Gouraud , the French reinforced their military presence in the greater Aleppo region in April , and their columns defeated Hananu 's rebels in a number of confrontations during this period . By April , the French had over 20 @,@ 000 troops in southern Anatolia and northern Syria , with over 5 @,@ 000 troops in Aleppo , 4 @,@ 500 in the Idlib district , 1 @,@ 000 in <unk> and 5 @,@ 000 in the Antioch region . In May , French troops commanded by General <unk> pursued Mawali and <unk> Bedouin rebels after they launched several attacks against the highway between Homs and Hama . The Mawali surrendered after French aerial bombardments against their encampments in <unk> on 21 May . 
 According to French intelligence reports , the Turks sent political agents to northern Syria to persuade the inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule , which they claimed would benefit the population . Sometime between April and May , Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al @-@ <unk> , in which many of its inhabitants were killed . Asim Bey was a strongly pro @-@ Ottoman , Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency . Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him to carry out the raids on al @-@ <unk> and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants , as part of Turkey 's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria . Asim 's execution may have contributed to the rapid withdrawal of the rebels ' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution . 
 The arms flow from Anatolia ended in June , either due to a direct French diplomatic request or the diversion of arms and fighters to combat the Greek offensive against the Turks in western Anatolia . In any case , the stopping of weapons shipments had a significant impact on both the military aspect of the rebellion and morale , as Hananu and the revolt 's backers in Aleppo felt abandoned by the Turks , who later concluded a final peace arrangement with France , known as the Treaty of Ankara , in October . In need of funds , Hananu hired local bandits to extort money and supplies from Jabal Zawiya 's inhabitants . His main sources of weapons became limited to the towns of Maarrat al @-@ Nu 'man and Hama . With the previous blows dealt to the rebels by French forces , the waning support for the revolt by the local inhabitants and the lack of weapons , Hananu 's revolt largely dissipated during the spring of 1921 , although rebel operations against the French still continued at a reduced pace during this period . 
 = = = Suppression and aftermath = = = 
 Between the spring and early summer of 1921 , the rebels experienced a series of defeats . In July 1921 , Hananu 's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces . By this time , French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high . A number of these villages ' inhabitants were arrested or executed , prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender . On 11 or 12 July , Hananu fled to British @-@ held Transjordan , seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria , to avoid arrest by the French authorities . British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August . 
 After six months of incarceration , Hananu was subsequently put on trial on 15 March 1922 , with the charges against him including murder , organizing rebel bands , engaging in brigandage and the destruction of public property and infrastructure . He was defended by the Aleppine Christian attorney , Fathallah <unk> . In court , Hananu condemned the " illegal occupation of Syria " and argued that military operations were done under the aegis of Mustafa Kemal . The trial became a rallying point of popular support for Hananu and a led to a significant degree of solidarity among Aleppo 's urban elite who collectively supported Hananu 's freedom . The trial concluded on 18 March , and Hananu was acquitted after the court decided that he was not a rebel , but rather a soldier who was legally mandated by the Ottoman authorities to engage in warfare against French forces . According to Khoury , the " verdict would have been different ... had Hananu not become a legend in his own time " and if the Franco @-@ Turkish War had not ended . 
 Although Hananu 's revolt was largely suppressed , a low @-@ level insurgency involving small ′ iṣābāt persisted in Aleppo 's countryside . Al @-@ Sa 'dun and Uwaid opted to continue the armed struggle , fleeing to the coastal mountains and from there to Turkey in December 1921 . From the frontier area with Syria , they staged hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks against French forces . With 100 of his fighters , al @-@ Sa 'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance . On 26 August , al @-@ Sa 'dun 's ′ iṣābā assaulted a postal convoy in al @-@ <unk> , a village between Darkush and Antioch . In 1923 , rebel commander Aqil al @-@ <unk> and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French , including an assault against a government building in al @-@ Safira , southeast of Aleppo , and Jisr al @-@ Hadid near Antakya . 
 The insurgency in northwestern Syria continued and between December 1925 and August 1926 , al @-@ Sa 'dun 's fighters launched several attacks against French forces and military installments . These attacks coincided with the Great Syrian Revolt that started in the south of the country and spread to central and northern Syrian cities . Among the major engagements between al @-@ Sa 'dun 's ' iṣābā and the French was at Tell Amar at the end of April 1926 . The last major confrontation was at Jabal Qusayr on 8 August 1926 . 
 = = Rebel organization = = 
 The rebel groups were collectively known as <unk> al- ′ iṣābāt , and each individual ′ iṣābā was composed of anywhere between 30 and 100 rebels known as mujahidin and were led by a ra <unk> ( commander ) , who was often a local notable or the head of a major clan . Individual ′ iṣābāt began forming in the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances , but Hananu gradually consolidated them into his network . 
 The revolt was ultimately organized into four principal military zones , each headed by a ra <unk> ' iṣābā native to the particular zone . The four zones were the following : Jabal Qusayr ( Antioch area ) headed by Sheikh Yusuf al @-@ Sa 'dun ( headquarters in <unk> ) , Jabal Harim headed by Najib Uwaid ( headquarters in Kafr Takharim ) , Jabal Zawiya headed by Mustafa Haj Husayn and Jabal Sahyun ( al @-@ <unk> area ) headed by Umar al @-@ Bitar . Hananu , the overall leader of the revolt , and the regional commanders discussed major military decisions , typically involving a particular guerrilla campaign or arms procurement , together . At times they also consulted with <unk> Bey , commander of Turkish irregulars fighting the French in Anatolia . 
 At the height of the revolt , Hananu effectively created a quasi @-@ independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea . Hananu 's rebels first began administering captured territory in <unk> , where the rebels coordinated with that town 's municipality to impose taxes on landowners , livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations . From there , Hananu 's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages , including Kafr Takharim , and the district centers Harim , Jisr al @-@ Shughur and Idlib . The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced , but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions . Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources , and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters . 
 Volunteers from the rural villages formed the bulk of the rebels ' fighting force and during the course of the revolt , each village typically contained a 30 @-@ man reserve unit . However , Hananu 's forces also included volunteers from Aleppo city , former Ottoman conscripts , Bedouin tribesmen ( including some 1 @,@ 500 Mawali fighters ) and Turkish officers who served as advisers . The ′ iṣābāt were rooted in the rural countryside , but also drew financial support from people in the cities . While the rebels functioned as a traditional rural Syrian autonomous movement wary of centralized authority or foreign intervention into their affairs , they also sought to establish close ties with the Arab nationalist movement and , until the Arab Army 's defeat at Maysalun , with representatives of the Arab government based in the cities . 
 Besides military expertise , formal military language and style was important to rebel commanders as they sought to instill in their soldiers the " spirit , self @-@ image and shape of an army " , according to historian Nadine <unk> . During meetings of the rebel leadership , the mujahidin of the host leader assumed military formation by lining up along the road of the host village and saluting the visiting commanders . The rebels referred to themselves as <unk> al @-@ thawra ( sing. <unk> ) , meaning " soldiers of revolt " , which represented a more noble image than the term iṣābā , which was associated with banditry , and the term al @-@ <unk> , which referred to the military and had negative connotations due to its association with conscription and repression . Each mujahid received a salary depending on his rank , with cavalrymen ( <unk> ) or officers receiving higher pay than foot soldiers ( <unk> ) . 
 The rebels had multiple sources for arms , but did not possess heavy weaponry , with the exception of two artillery pieces . Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia , Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I , weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British @-@ Arab offensive in 1918 , and raids against French arms warehouses . The rebels ' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles , revolvers , shotguns , and Turkish five @-@ shooters , as well as sabres and daggers . According to Khoury , the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns . Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920 , the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels . The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans , who the rebels viewed negatively , by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal , who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation .

 The chief operational goals of the ′ iṣābāt were to inflict as much damage as they could on French forces and make clear their " determination to resist " , according to Arsuzi . The rebels utilized the familiar , mountainous terrain where they operated against the French forces , and typically launched guerrilla operations at night to avoid detection . However , at times when the rebels could not avoid direct confrontation with French forces , they maintained fighting order similar to a regular army . 
 = = = French forces = = = 
 Militarily , the French utilized large column formations against the rebels , a tactic which the French chief @-@ of @-@ staff of the Army of the Levant , General André @-@ Gaston Prételat , found to be generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units . Instead , he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels : knowledge of the terrain and high mobility . However , the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels because they were too small numerically , and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals . 
 The French were more successful in persuading large landowners to cease support for the rebels and recruit local militias to protect highways from rebel attacks . The French also ultimately understood that in order to quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks , whose financial , military and moral support was critical to the rebels . When truces were reached with the Turks , the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria . 
 = = Motivations for revolt = = 
 Hananu 's subordinate officers and rank @-@ and @-@ file fighters were all Sunni Muslims , but were ethnically heterogeneous . Hananu himself was a Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar , while Umar al @-@ Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha <unk> Agha was a Turk . The ′ isabat led by al @-@ Bitar and al @-@ Qassam were dominated by Arabs . The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels ' sense of defending their homeland and community . Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions , most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives . As such , al @-@ Sa 'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( Northern revolts ) rather than the singular thawra , and referred to the leadership of the revolt as the plural <unk> al @-@ thawra rather than <unk> al @-@ thawra , which refers to a central command . 
 The rebels of the Hananu Revolt were motivated by three principal factors : defense of the homeland , which the rebels referred to as al @-@ <unk> or al @-@ <unk> , defense of Islam in the face of conquest by an infidel enemy referred to as al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> , in this case the French , and the defense of the rebels ' traditional and sedentary way of life and the prevailing social order from foreign interference . In the early phase of the revolt , Hananu and Barakat acted as representatives of Faisal 's Arab government and continued to claim that they had the support of Faisal after the latter was ousted from Syria in July 1920 . Despite the collapse of the state they were ostensibly fighting under , the rebels resumed their struggle . In his memoirs , al @-@ Sa 'dun stated that the rebels engaged in jihad as an individual responsibility , instead of a duty delegated to them by a state . In his view , the individual rebel was required to behave virtuously in his personal life and with expertise and courage on the battlefield . Moreover , he had to strive to be a popular hero ( <unk> sha <unk> ) close to his people , brave and pious . Arsuzi @-@ <unk> asserts that while religious terminology was used by the rebels , the rebels ' " motivation was fundamentally nationalist " and that " religion does not seem to have played a more important role " than nationalist feeling . Moreover , the Islamic solidarity between the Turks and the Syrians did not prevent the withdrawal of Turkish support for the revolt in Syria . 
 According to historian Keith David Watenpaugh , the language used by Hananu and Saleh al @-@ Ali in their address to the League of Nations " undermine " Arab and Turkish nationalist claims that their revolts represented part of the Arab or Turkish national awakenings . Hananu and al @-@ Ali both referred to their revolts as part of a unified national resistance movement , but Watenpaugh states that the nation referred to was an Islamic community rather than the ethnic nationalism that steadily dominated Syrian and Turkish politics and society in the 20th century . Hananu and al @-@ Ali also stressed modernist principles about individual rights , and according to Watenpaugh , Hananu did not view the concepts of modernity , Islam and the Ottoman state to be mutually exclusive . Hananu had opposed many Ottoman policies in the pre @-@ World War I period , but was nonetheless wary of separatism as someone who formed part of the educated Ottoman middle class , while al @-@ Ali sought a return to a " decentralized Ottoman polity dominated by Muslims in which the state would protect his hegemony as a landowning rural chieftain " . Hananu and the rebel commanders had a deep attachment to their place in society and viewed French rule as an assault on their status , ambitions and dignity .

 As a result of the Hananu and Alawite revolts , the French authorities discovered pacifying northern Syria was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region . Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt , some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland , but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria , following agreements with France , caused a deterioration in Syrian @-@ Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed . Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal 's policies regarding Syria made Turkey 's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo 's Arab nationalists . In the few years after the revolt , Aleppo 's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule . This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus . 
 Hananu 's leadership of the revolt gained him wide popularity in Syria . Referring to Hananu , Khoury wrote " No name was more familiar to children growing up in Syria in the twenties and thirties ; stories of his heroics were standard bedtime fare . " In Ba 'athist historiography , Hananu became a hero of the Syrian Arab nationalist movement . The Hananu Revolt was a turning point in Aleppo 's relationship with the Arab nationalist movement . Under the influence of Hananu , his Arab Club , and other Aleppine leaders with similar politics , the Muslim elite of Aleppo gradually embraced Arab nationalism . Hananu later became a founding member of the National Bloc in 1928 , which according to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed , was " created out of the defeat of the armed revolts of the 1920s " . The National Bloc advocated diplomatic means to combat French rule and was the principal opposition movement against the French authorities until Syria 's independence in 1946 . Hananu served as the za 'im ( chief ) of the movement until his death in 1935 . 
 In September 1920 , Gouraud established the State of Aleppo , which consisted of the northern half of former Ottoman Syria , excluding the Tripoli district . The French authorities established a new bureaucratic administration in Aleppo led by four local , pro @-@ French sympathizers and mostly staffed by their family members . After the revolt was stamped out , the French authorities arrested or exiled numerous Arab nationalist politicians in an attempt to end the nationalist alliance between Aleppo and Damascus . The authorities also began appointing former Ottoman administrators who were willing to cooperate with them to senior bureaucratic posts . According to Khoury , " by 1922 , the Aleppo bureaucracy had become more unwieldy and inefficient than it had been in the last years " of Ottoman rule . Despite French attempts to completely exclude the nationalists from any administrative role , the overwhelming majority of Aleppo 's population supported the nationalists . 
 As a result of the Franco @-@ Syrian War , Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks ( districts ) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet , such as Mar 'ash , Gaziantep ( ' <unk> ) , <unk> ( Qal 'at Rum ) , Urfa ( al @-@ <unk> ) . These sanjaks became part of Turkey following the October 1921 treaty with France . <unk> opposed the Turkish annexation . The Franco @-@ Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the Alexandretta Sanjak , including Antioch , due to improved security conditions , but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased . Alexandretta was considered by <unk> to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio @-@ economic region . It remained part of Syria under French control , but was administered by a semi @-@ autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey . Aleppo 's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo ; <unk> was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of Turkey in the following year . 
 = Stanley Price Weir = 
 Brigadier General Stanley Price Weir , DSO , VD , JP ( 23 April 1866 – 14 November 1944 ) was a public servant and Australian Army officer . During World War I , he commanded the 10th Battalion of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) during the landing at Anzac Cove and the subsequent Gallipoli Campaign , and during the Battles of Pozières and Mouquet Farm in France . 
 Weir returned to Australia at his own request in late 1916 at the age of 50 , and in 1917 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm . He went on to become the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner . He was given an honorary promotion to brigadier general on his retirement from the Australian Military Forces in 1921 . Weir was retired as public service commissioner in 1931 . In retirement he contributed to various benevolent and charitable organisations , and died in 1944 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Weir was born in Norwood , South Australia , on 23 April 1866 , a son of Alfred Weir and Susannah Mary ( née Price ) . His father was a carpenter , who had emigrated to South Australia from Aberdeen , Scotland , in 1839 , two years after the colony was founded . Weir attended Moore 's School , the Norwood Public School , and Pulteney Street Grammar School . In 1879 , at the age of 13 , he joined the Surveyor General 's Department as an office assistant . He assisted the surveyor who pegged out the land at the rear of Government House , Adelaide , for the Torrens Parade Ground , and was later promoted to clerk . On 14 May 1890 , he married Rosa Wadham at the Christian Chapel , Norwood . He rose through the department to be appointed Survey Storekeeper , Custodian of Plans and Custodian of Government Motor Cars , on 1 July 1911 . He was appointed a justice of the peace on 10 September 1914 . 
 = = Early military service = = 
 Weir enlisted in the part @-@ time South Australian Volunteer Military Force in March 1885 , joining the 1st Battalion , Adelaide Rifles , as a private . By 1890 , he had been promoted to colour sergeant . He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion , Adelaide Rifles , on 19 March 1890 , and was promoted to captain on 25 May 1893 . When the South African War broke out he volunteered for service with the South Australian Bushmen 's Corps , but mounted officers were preferred , and he was not selected . 
 On 1 July 1903 , the Adelaide Rifles became the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Commonwealth Military Forces , and Weir was appointed adjutant . He was promoted to major on 1 January 1904 , and appointed as regimental second @-@ in @-@ command . He was awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in 1905 , and the Volunteer Officers ' Decoration in 1908 . On 22 June 1908 , Weir was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed the commanding officer of the 10th Infantry Regiment . On 1 January 1912 , he was transferred to the unattached list but this only lasted until 1 July , when the universal training scheme was introduced . He was soon appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade , and on 9 September 1913 he was promoted to colonel . 
 = = World War I = = 
 On 12 August 1914 , Weir received a telegram from Colonel Ewen Sinclair @-@ Maclagan , the designated commander of the 3rd Brigade , offering him the command of the 10th Battalion . Weir promptly accepted , and on 17 August was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , making him the first South Australian to be commissioned in the AIF . He retained his rank of colonel in the part @-@ time forces in an honorary capacity . 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 Weir assembled and trained his battalion at the Morphettville Racecourse , then embarked with them on the transport Ascanius on 20 October 1914 as the first convoy of Australian troops departed for overseas service . On arrival in Fremantle , six companies of the 11th Battalion were embarked on the transport , and Weir was appointed Officer Commanding Troops for the voyage . The troops began disembarking at Alexandria on 6 December 1914 , and were entrained for Cairo , where they began to set up camp at Mena . The Australian Official War Historian , Charles Bean , described Weir as being " somewhat above average in years " for a battalion commander . Following the Allied decision to land a force on the Gallipoli Peninsula , the 3rd Brigade was selected as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove . The 10th Battalion embarked for the Greek island of Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea on 1 March 1915 , and after further training on Lemnos , the battalion was one of the first two battalions ashore on the morning of 25 April 1915 . 
 During the landing , when the boats carrying the lead elements of the battalion were around 40 yards ( 37 m ) from shore , according to Bean , Weir observed to another officer in his boat that everything was silent , but soon after Ottoman troops began firing at the landing force . Weir landed with the scout platoon , and urged both his men and those of the 9th Battalion to immediately begin climbing the cliffs that overlooked the beach . Weir , along with " B " and " C " Companies of the battalion , reached what later became known as " Plugge 's Plateau " . Heavy fighting followed the initial landing and , within five days , half of Weir 's battalion had been killed or wounded . The Australian and New Zealand advance inland from Anzac Cove was subsequently checked by the defending Ottoman forces and was eventually contained in a small beachhead inside a series of ridges that ranged around the cove . Weir was the only commanding officer from the 3rd Brigade to go forward of the first ridge , and a ridge running off the 400 Plateau subsequently became known as " Weir Ridge " . 
 As stalemate set in , Weir continued to command his battalion throughout the early stages of the campaign until 25 August , when he was appointed acting brigadier general and placed in command of the 3rd Brigade . On 11 September , he became ill and was evacuated to Malta , where he was admitted to hospital . He was subsequently evacuated to the United Kingdom , where he convalesced until January 1916 , when he was appointed commandant of the Australian reinforcement camp at Weymouth , Dorset .

 Weir 's health had not completely recovered by the time he embarked for Egypt , and he rejoined his battalion on 4 March 1916 . After his departure , the 10th had fought through the remainder of the campaign before being withdrawn along with the rest of the Allied force in December 1915 . The battalion was subsequently moved back to Egypt . In mid @-@ 1916 , the bulk of the AIF was transferred to the Western Front , and Weir led the 10th Battalion through July and August 1916 during the Battles of Pozières and Mouquet Farm . At Pozières , the battalion suffered 350 casualties in four days . By the time of the battle , Weir was the only original battalion commander remaining in the 1st Australian Division , and had turned 50 years of age . On 23 August , immediately after Mouquet Farm , Weir was again appointed acting commander of the 3rd Brigade . Exhausted , on 7 September 1916 he asked to be relieved , and his request was granted . He returned to Australia on 23 September 1916 , and his AIF appointment was terminated on 14 December . In the Australian official history of the war , Bean observed that despite his age , Weir " took his battalion into the front line , commanded it there throughout its first battle , and remained longer in the field than almost any of the senior militia officers who had left with the original force " . 
 = = Post @-@ war military service = = 
 After his AIF appointment was terminated , Weir resumed his service in the Citizen Military Forces ( CMF ) . In 1917 , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Russian Empire Order of St. Anne , 2nd Class , with Swords , and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm . From 1917 to 1920 , he was aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Governor @-@ General of Australia , Sir Ronald Craufurd Munro Ferguson . Weir retired from the CMF as an honorary brigadier general in March 1921 , his last appointment being as commander of the 20th Infantry Brigade . He was only the second South Australia @-@ born officer to reach the rank of brigadier general . On 31 March 1921 , Weir was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 10th Battalion , a position he held for many years . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Weir had two significant advantages in his return to a civilian career . Firstly , he was repatriated well before most servicemen and , secondly , South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment . These circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916 . Weir was not suited to this role , being unable to navigate the competing personal and political agendas of senior public servants and politicians , and was soon sidelined . In 1925 , legislative changes made it possible for the government to replace Weir , and this took place in 1930 . In the last year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half before his retirement in 1931 , Weir was the chairman of both the Central Board of Health and the Public Relief Board , excelling at the latter . 
 On 8 June 1923 , after many years of poor health , Weir 's wife Rosa died . He married Lydia Maria <unk> in 1926 . Weir led an active retirement , contributing to several religious , charitable and welfare organisations and activities . These included the Norwood and Maylands Churches of Christ , Benevolent and Stranger 's Friend Society , the Our Boys Institute ( OBI ) , the Masonic Lodge , Cheer Up Society , and YMCA . At various times he served as President of the Commonwealth Club , the Churches of Christ Union , the St. Peters Sub @-@ Branch of the Returned and Services League , and the Cheer Up Society . 
 Weir wrote the foreword for the history of the 10th Battalion , titled The Fighting 10th : A South Australian Centenary Souvenir of the 10th Battalion , AIF 1914 – 1919 , which was written by a former member of the battalion , Cecil Lock , and published in 1936 . In 1943 , Weir was badly injured in a car accident while returning from an OBI camp at Victor Harbor . It was believed that his injuries in the accident contributed to his death on 14 November 1944 . Weir was survived by his wife Lydia , and his son Lionel and daughter Beryl from his first marriage . His brother , Harrison Weir , was the State Government Printer . Weir was buried in West Terrace Cemetery .

 Ping Tom Memorial Park ( Chinese : <unk> ) is a 17 @.@ 24 @-@ acre ( 6 @.@ 98 ha ) public urban park in Chicago 's Chinatown neighborhood , in South Side , Chicago . It is part of the Chicago Park District ( CPD ) . 
 Located on the south bank of the Chicago River , the park is divided into three sections by a Santa Fe rail track and 18th Street . Currently , only development in the area south of 18th Street has been completed . It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda @-@ style pavilion , bamboo gardens , and a playground . The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom ; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park 's pavilion .

 In 1962 , the construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway demolished the only two parks in the Chinatown area ( Hardin Square and Stanford Park ) . Sun Yat @-@ sen <unk> Park , a small , 1 ⁄ 3 acre ( 1 @,@ 300 m2 ) park , was created in the mid @-@ 1970s , however , the community wanted a larger open park space . 
 A private real estate firm formed by Ping Tom , then purchased a former 32 @-@ acre ( 13 ha ) rail yard in 1989 . After construction of Chinatown Square began on this property , the CPD purchased approximately 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) of unused land along the Chicago River in 1991 , along with an additional 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) that extended along the river , north of 18th Street . 
 The southern @-@ half of the area then underwent significant development , as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an at @-@ grade rail crossing was installed at the park 's western boundary . Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $ 5 million . The park was officially opened on October 2 , 1999 . 
 In 2002 , the Chicago Park District acquired 5 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) additional immediately east of the park 's undeveloped northern half . The second development @-@ stage of the park 's nearly 11 acres ( 45 @,@ 000 m2 ) undeveloped north of 18th Street was completed in 2011 , and included development of the area 's shoreline and access points . In September 2009 , a $ 10 million budget was approved to start development on the 6 @-@ acre ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) area along the Chicago River . The boathouse was opened on June 9 , 2013 , while the field house was opened later that year on October 14 , 2013 .

 In 1962 , construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway necessitated the demolition of Hardin Square and Stanford Parks , the only two public parks that serviced the Chinatown community . In the mid @-@ 1970s , a small , 1 ⁄ 3 acre ( 1 @,@ 300 m2 ) park was developed on a strip of land between 26th Street and the Stevenson Expressway ; the Chicago Park District purchased the park in 1977 and named it Sun Yat @-@ sen <unk> Park . However , in a 1992 study , 75 percent of Chinatown 's community leaders and 49 percent of business leaders felt that " the lack of open space in the Chinatown area is one of the most serious problems <unk> the community " , and both groups ranked it first among 15 community issues , including crime , education , housing , and employment . Community efforts to construct a larger park were impeded both a lack of funds and the absence of any suitable site . 
 After fighting for decades for the construction of a new park in Chinatown , civic leader Ping Tom formed the Chinese American Development Corporation ( CADC ) , a private real estate firm , in 1984 . Five years later , the firm purchased a former 32 @-@ acre ( 130 @,@ 000 m2 ) Santa Fe rail yard and began construction on Chinatown Square , a $ 100 million residential and commercial development project . However , the 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) area along the Chicago River was left untouched . The Chinatown community then formed the Chinatown Riverside Park Advisory Council to work with the Chicago Park District to assess the possibility of developing the remaining area into a public park . With the support of Park District Commissioner Raymond Lee , the Park District approved the proposal to purchase the land , along with an additional 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) that extended along the river northward to 16th Street in 1991 . 
 Tom died of pancreatic cancer in July 1995 — three years before construction of the park began . During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998 , the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom , the driving force behind the its creation . The request was approved on August 3 , 1998 , and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park . The park was dedicated and officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2 , 1999 . In 2005 , the CADC and friends of the Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao <unk> to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom . The bust was dedicated and installed at the park on October 22 , 2005 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group designed the park . Having designed landscape along Chinatown 's Cermak Avenue , Wong was familiar with the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park . The park 's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou , China . This design was scrapped , however , because of security and vandalism concerns . Instead , a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards . 
 A pagoda @-@ style pavilion based on a structure that Wong had seen in Suzhou is located near the park 's western boundary — the Chicago River . Site Design Group designed the pavilion 's ornamentation and railings and obtained its traditional Chinese roof tiles from a source in Japan . The park 's entrance is marked by four 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) -tall columns , each etched with Chinese dragons and is modeled after a traditional Chinese courtyard . The park containers Chinese @-@ influenced gardens that include ginkgo trees and bamboo . A children 's playground is located at the north end of the park . 
 Businesses in Chinatown attempted to raise $ 200 @,@ 000 to build an 11 @-@ story bell tower pagoda at the south end of the park . The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior . While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure , they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base . Chicago Sun @-@ Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park 's most important feature . Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower , it was never constructed . 
 Before construction of then @-@ named Chinatown Riverside Park could begin on the strip of land south of 18th Street , the area required significant development . The entire western boundary of the park is a functioning Santa Fe rail track . After unsuccessfully looking into possible underground or overground access , an at @-@ grade rail crossing was constructed . The US Army Corps of Engineers was then needed to restore the badly deteriorated shoreline of the Chicago River , the park 's eastern boundary . At a cost of $ 2 million , the project improved approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) of the retaining wall and lowered the shoreline considerably from its previous position 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the river . The land was also tested for any harmful contaminates from prolonged use as a rail yard . Once development was complete , construction began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $ 5 million .

 In 2002 , the Chicago Park District acquired 5 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) additional immediately east of the park 's 6 @-@ acre ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) undeveloped northern half . With the acquisition of this land , the CPD planned a second development @-@ stage — dubbed " Phase II " — of the park 's nearly 11 acres ( 45 @,@ 000 m2 ) undeveloped . The plan called for the development of the area 's shoreline and access points , as well as the construction of a cultural arts and recreational facility and a boathouse . The estimated cost was $ 38 million . 
 In September 2009 , the Chicago Park District ’ s Board of Commissioners entered into an agreement with the City of Chicago that approved the transfer of $ 10 million in tax increment financing ( TIF ) funds for the development of the park 's 6 @-@ acre ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) area between the Chicago River and the Santa Fe rail track north of 18th Street . These funds were used to build a retaining wall , fish habitats and sections of natural shoreline along the area 's 875 ft ( 267 m ) of shoreline along the Chicago River . Open lawn and landscaped areas were developed along with a fishing station and various pathways . 
 Approved also was an ordinance that finances the construction of an athletic field house in Ping Tom Memorial Park . Funds for the $ 10 million proposal will be allocated from the River South TIF district . This approximately 28 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot , single @-@ story , steel frame and precast construction building will include a natatorium , gymnasium , club rooms , a fitness center , and locker rooms . 
 On September 19 , 2011 , Mayor Rahm Emanuel held a press conference in the newly opened expansion of the park to announce a plan to build a series of boat houses along the Chicago River . 
 At about this time , the phase two five acre riverfront expansion located to the north of the existing park expanded the park to the north of the 18th street bridge . It was also designed by Site Design Group , and features a 300 linear foot boardwalk with iconic red Chinese ornamental railings that extends over the water , as well as unique decorative limestone rocks called scholar 's stones from Lake Tai in China . Native plantings and oak savanna restoration provide a sustainable planting palette , welcoming native wildlife to the park . The project cost was $ 4 @.@ 9 million . 
 On June 9 , 2013 , Mayor Emanuel officially opened the boathouse . 
 On October 14 , 2013 , Mayor Emanuel officially opened the Ping Tom Memorial Park Fieldhouse , a 30 @,@ 000 square @-@ foot facility with a gymnasium , natatorium , fitness center , and meeting rooms . At the entrance to the fieldhouse stands a stainless steel sculpture called " Stone Talk , " donated by the city of Shanghai on June 3 , 2015 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Sister City relationship between Chicago and Shanghai .

 Museum de Oude Wolden ( Dutch pronunciation : [ <unk> də <unk> <unk> ( n ) ] ; English : Museum The Old Wolds ) , abbreviated as <unk> , is a regional museum in the village of Bellingwolde in the Netherlands . The museum focuses on art and history of the regions of Oldambt and Westerwolde in the east of the province of Groningen . 
 The museum opened on 10 August 1973 . In the first decades , it primarily exhibited historical objects documenting everyday life . In the late 1990s , the museum started to exhibit artworks of artist collective De Ploeg and magic realist painter Lodewijk Bruckman . Since 2012 , it has a permanent display of paintings by Bruckman and temporary exhibitions . 
 The municipality of Bellingwedde employs the museum staff and provides most of the museum 's budget . From 2003 to 2012 , the museum had around 1 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 200 visitors per year . From 2013 to 2015 , the museum had around 4 @,@ 500 visitors . It is one of the lesser @-@ visited museums in Groningen .

 Museum de Oude Wolden is located at the <unk> in the village Bellingwolde in the municipality Bellingwedde in the east of the province Groningen near the Dutch – German border . It is situated in the south of the region Oldambt and in the north of the region Westerwolde . 
 The old museum building is the restored <unk> ( Dutch : <unk> ) of a former mansion ( Dutch : <unk> ) of which the <unk> was destroyed during a World War II bombing . In 1977 , the building was expanded with a new wing for 150 @,@ 000 guilders ( 68 @,@ 000 euro ) . In 2012 , the building was renovated and received a new glass entrance , which cost 223 @,@ 000 euro in total . 
 = = History = = 
 <unk> de Oude Wolden ( Regional Museum the Old Wolds ) was opened on 10 August 1973 by the mayor of Bellingwedde <unk> Jan <unk> . In the late 1960s , the province of Groningen requested the national government for subsidy to open a new museum in Bellingwolde . The subsidy was not granted , but the state paid indirectly for the restoration of the museum building via a subsidized employment project . 
 In 1976 , the museum exhibited primarily historical objects from the regions of Oldambt and Westerwolde , such as agricultural machines , traditional costumes , and archaeological and geological finds . After the expansion in 1977 , the museum had enough space to hold temporary exhibitions , group the historical objects thematically , and display a 19th @-@ century grocery store inventory . By the late 1980s , a barber shop and shoemaker 's inventory were shown in the museum . In 1988 , the newspaper Nieuwsblad van het <unk> called the museum " charming " and wrote : " A museum like De Oude Wolden is meaningful because of its rather complete documentation of everyday life in the 19th and early 20th century . " 
 In 1998 , the museum started to exhibit paintings by artists of De Ploeg , an artist collective established in the city Groningen . In 1999 , the museum also exhibited paintings by Lodewijk Bruckman , who lived in Bellingwedde for some years . At the time , the press described De Oude Wolden as a museum with historical artefacts and artworks by De Ploeg and Bruckman . In 2003 , De Ploeg celebrated their 85th birthday with an exhibition in the museum . In 2010 , seven 17 – 19th @-@ century icons with an estimated value of 23 @,@ 000 euro were stolen during a break @-@ in in the museum . At the time , the museum offered a reward of 2 @,@ 500 euro for tips that would lead to the recovery of the icons . 
 The museum dropped the word <unk> ( regional ) from its name and now calls itself Museum de Oude Wolden ( Museum the Old Wolds ) . Since the renovation in 2012 , the historical objects and the artworks by De Ploeg are no longer on permanent display , the museum now focuses on art , region , and history with Bruckman 's paintings and temporary exhibitions .

 = David Bowie = 
 David Robert Jones ( 8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016 ) , better known by his stage name David Bowie ( / <unk> / ) , was an English singer , songwriter and actor . He was a figure in popular music for over five decades , regarded by critics and musicians as an innovator , particularly for his work in the 1970s . His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation , his music and stagecraft significantly influencing popular music . During his lifetime , his record sales , estimated at 140 million worldwide , made him one of the world 's best @-@ selling music artists . In the UK , he was awarded nine platinum album certifications , eleven gold and eight silver , releasing eleven number @-@ one albums . In the US , he received five platinum and seven gold certifications . He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 . 
 Born and raised in south London , Bowie developed an interest in music as a child , eventually studying art , music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963 . " Space Oddity " became his first top @-@ five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969 . After a period of experimentation , he re @-@ emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust . The character was spearheaded by the success of his single " Starman " and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , which won him widespread popularity . In 1975 , Bowie 's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as " plastic soul " , initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number @-@ one single " Fame " and the album Young Americans . In 1976 , Bowie began a sporadic acting career , starring in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth . The following year , he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic @-@ inflected album Low ( 1977 ) , the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that would come to be known as the " Berlin Trilogy " . " Heroes " ( 1977 ) and Lodger ( 1979 ) followed ; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise . 
 After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s , Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single " Ashes to Ashes " , its parent album Scary Monsters ( And Super Creeps ) , and " Under Pressure " , a 1981 collaboration with Queen . He then reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let 's Dance , with its title track topping both UK and US charts . Throughout the 1990s and 2000s , Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles , including industrial and jungle . Bowie also continued acting ; his roles included Major Celliers in Merry Christmas , Mr. Lawrence ( 1983 ) , the Goblin King Jareth in Labyrinth ( 1986 ) , Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ ( 1988 ) , and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige ( 2006 ) , among other film and television appearances and cameos . He stopped concert touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006 . In 2013 , Bowie returned from a decade @-@ long recording hiatus with the release of The Next Day and remained musically active until he died of liver cancer two days after the release of his final album , Blackstar ( 2016 ) . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bowie was born in Brixton , south London . His mother , Margaret Mary " Peggy " ( née Burns ; 1913 – 2001 ) , who although born in Kent was of Irish descent , worked as a waitress , while his father , Haywood Stenton " John " Jones ( 1912 – 1969 ) , from Yorkshire , was a promotions officer for the children 's charity Barnardo 's . The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road , near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and Stockwell . Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old , acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single @-@ minded child — and a defiant brawler . 
 In 1953 , Bowie moved with his family to the suburb of Bromley , where , two years later , he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School . His voice was considered " adequate " by the school choir , and he demonstrated above @-@ average abilities in playing the recorder . At the age of nine , his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative : teachers called his interpretations " vividly artistic " and his poise " astonishing " for a child . The same year , his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers , the Platters , Fats Domino , Elvis Presley and Little Richard . Upon listening to " Tutti Frutti " , Bowie would later say , " I had heard God " . 
 Presley 's impact on him was likewise emphatic : " I saw a cousin of mine dance to ... ' Hound Dog ' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything . It really impressed me , the power of the music . I started getting records immediately after that . " By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea @-@ chest bass , begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends , and had started to play the piano ; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry — complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists — to his local Wolf Cub group was described as " mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet . " After taking his Eleven @-@ Plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education , Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School . 
 It was an unusual technical school , as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote : 
 Despite its status it was , by the time David arrived in 1958 , as rich in arcane ritual as any [ English ] public school . There were houses , named after eighteenth @-@ century statesmen like Pitt and Wilberforce . There was a uniform , and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments . There was also an accent on languages , science and particularly design , where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton . In David 's account , Frampton led through force of personality , not intellect ; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither , and yielded the school 's most gifted pupils to the arts , a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son , Peter , to pursue a musical career with David , a partnership briefly intact thirty years later . 
 Bowie studied art , music and design , including layout and typesetting . After Terry Burns , his half @-@ brother , introduced him to modern jazz , his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a plastic alto saxophone in 1961 ; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician . Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl , and doctors feared he would become blind in that eye . After a series of operations during a four @-@ month hospitalisation , his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil , which gave a false impression of a change in the iris ' colour . Despite their altercation , Underwood and Bowie remained good friends , and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie 's early albums .

 In 1962 Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15 . Playing guitar @-@ based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings , the Konrads had a varying line @-@ up of between four and eight members , Underwood among them . When Bowie left the technical school the following year , he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star . His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician 's mate . Frustrated by his band @-@ mates ' limited aspirations , Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band , the King Bees . He wrote to the newly successful washing @-@ machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to " do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles — and make another million . " Bloom did not respond to the offer , but his referral to Dick James 's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie 's first personal management contract . 
 Conn quickly began to promote Bowie . The singer 's debut single , " Liza Jane " , credited to Davie Jones and the King Bees , had no commercial success . Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin ' Wolf and Willie Dixon blues numbers , Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys , another blues outfit , who incorporated folk and soul — " I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger " , Bowie was to recall . " I Pity the Fool " was no more successful than " Liza Jane " , and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third , a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who . " You 've Got a Habit of Leaving " fared no better , signalling the end of Conn 's contract . Declaring that he would exit the pop world " to study mime at Sadler 's Wells " , Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third . His new manager , Ralph Horton , later instrumental in his transition to solo artist , soon witnessed Bowie 's move to yet another group , the Buzz , yielding the singer 's fifth unsuccessful single release , " Do Anything You Say " . While with the Buzz , Bowie also joined the Riot Squad ; their recordings , which included a Bowie number and The Velvet Underground material , went unreleased . Ken Pitt , introduced by Horton , took over as Bowie 's manager . 
 Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy ( and Davie ) Jones , which in the mid @-@ 1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees , Bowie renamed himself after the 19th @-@ century American frontiersman Jim Bowie and the knife he had popularised . His April 1967 solo single , " The Laughing Gnome " , using speeded @-@ up thus high @-@ pitched vocals , failed to chart . Released six weeks later , his album debut , David Bowie , an amalgam of pop , psychedelia , and music hall , met the same fate . It was his last release for two years . 
 = = = 1968 – 71 : Space Oddity to Hunky Dory = = = 
 Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre . He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image " really blossomed " . " He lived on his emotions , he was a wonderful influence . His day @-@ to @-@ day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen , ever . It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was . I joined the circus . " Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp , from avant @-@ garde theatre and mime to commedia dell 'arte , Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world . <unk> life in a British prison , meanwhile , the Bowie @-@ penned " Over the Wall We Go " became a 1967 single for Oscar ; another Bowie composition , " Silly Boy Blue " , was released by Billy Fury the following year . In January 1968 Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot in the Theatre 625 series , and used Bowie with a dancer , Hermione Farthingale ; the pair began dating , and moved into a London flat together . Playing acoustic guitar , Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson ; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk , Merseybeat , poetry and mime . Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film , Song of Norway ; this had an impact on him , and several songs , such as " Letter to Hermione " and " Life on Mars ? " reference her , and for the video accompanying " Where Are We Now ? " he wore a T @-@ shirt with the words " Song for Norway " . They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday , a 30 @-@ minute film , not released until 1984 , intended as a vehicle to promote him , featuring performances from Bowie 's repertoire , including an as yet unreleased " Space Oddity " . 
 After the breakup with Farthingale , Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger . During this period he appeared in a Lyons Maid ice cream commercial , and was rejected for another by Kit Kat . In February and March 1969 , he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan 's duo Tyrannosaurus Rex , as third on the bill , performing a mime act . On 11 July 1969 , " Space Oddity " was released five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch , and reached the top five in the UK . Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale , Bowie joined forces with Finnigan , Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street . 
 Influenced by the Arts Lab Movement , this developed into the Beckenham Arts Lab , and became extremely popular . The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park , the subject of his song " Memory of a Free Festival " . Bowie 's second album followed in November ; originally issued in the UK as David Bowie , it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name , and the early US release was instead titled Man of Words / Man of Music ; it was re @-@ released internationally in 1972 by RCA as Space Oddity . Featuring philosophical post @-@ hippie lyrics on peace , love and morality , its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock , the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release . 
 Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969 . They married within a year . Her impact on him was immediate , and her involvement in his career far @-@ reaching , leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating . Having established himself as a solo artist with " Space Oddity " , Bowie began to sense a lacking : " a full @-@ time band for gigs and recording — people he could relate to personally " . The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan , who was at the time acting as his session guitarist . A band was duly assembled . John Cambridge , a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab , was joined by Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar . Known as the Hype , the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders From Mars . After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse , they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist . Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter 's drumming style . Matters came to a head when an enraged Bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance , exclaiming " You 're fucking up my album . " Cambridge summarily quit and was replaced by Mick <unk> . Not long after , in a move that resulted in years of litigation , at the conclusion of which Bowie was forced to pay Pitt compensation , the singer fired his manager , replacing him with Tony Defries . 
 The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie 's third album , The Man Who Sold the World ( 1970 ) , which contained references to schizophrenia , paranoia and delusion . Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band , it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by Space Oddity . To promote it in the US , Mercury Records financed a coast @-@ to @-@ coast publicity tour in which Bowie , between January and February 1971 , was interviewed by radio stations and the media . Exploiting his androgynous appearance , the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted the singer wearing a dress : taking the garment with him , he wore it during interviews — to the approval of critics , including Rolling Stone 's John Mendelsohn who described him as " ravishing , almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall " — and in the street , to mixed reaction including laughter and , in the case of one male pedestrian , producing a gun and telling Bowie to " kiss my ass " . 
 During the tour , Bowie 's observation of two seminal American proto @-@ punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character : a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed , producing " the ultimate pop idol " . A girlfriend recalled his " scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy " , and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character " who looks like he 's landed from Mars " . The " Stardust " surname was a tribute to the " Legendary Stardust Cowboy " , whose record he was given during the tour . Bowie would later cover " I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship " on 2002 's Heathen . 
 Hunky Dory ( 1971 ) found Visconti , Bowie 's producer and bassist , supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder respectively . The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of " Space Oddity " , with light fare such as " Kooks " , a song written for his son , Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones , born on 30 May . ( His parents chose " his kooky name " — he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years — after the Greek word <unk> , life . ) Elsewhere , the album explored more serious themes , and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with " Song for Bob Dylan " , " Andy Warhol " , and " Queen Bitch " , a Velvet Underground pastiche . It was not a significant commercial success at the time . 
 = = = 1972 – 73 : Ziggy Stardust = = = 
 Dressed in a striking costume , his hair dyed reddish @-@ brown , Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars — Ronson , Bolder and <unk> — at the Toby Jug pub in <unk> on 10 February 1972 . The show was hugely popular , catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating , as described by Buckley , a " cult of Bowie " that was " unique — its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom . " The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars ( 1972 ) , combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory , was released in June . " Starman " , issued as an April single ahead of the album , was to cement Bowie 's UK breakthrough : both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song . The album , which remained in the chart for two years , was soon joined there by the 6 @-@ month @-@ old Hunky Dory . At the same time the non @-@ album single " John , I 'm Only Dancing " , and " All the Young Dudes " , a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople , were successful in the UK . The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States . 
 Bowie contributed backing vocals to Lou Reed 's 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer , co @-@ producing the album with Mick Ronson . His own Aladdin Sane ( 1973 ) topped the UK chart , his first number one album . Described by Bowie as " Ziggy goes to America " , it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour , which now continued to Japan to promote the new album . Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles " The Jean Genie " and " Drive @-@ In Saturday " . 
 Bowie 's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music . " Offstage I 'm a robot . Onstage I achieve emotion . It 's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David . " With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties : acting the same role over an extended period , it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust — and , later , the Thin White Duke — from his own character offstage . Ziggy , Bowie said , " wouldn 't leave me alone for years . That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected . It became very dangerous . I really did have doubts about my sanity . " His later Ziggy shows , which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane , were ultra @-@ theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments , such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson 's guitar . Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on @-@ stage " retirement " at London 's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973 . Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars . 
 After breaking up the Spiders from Mars , Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona . His back catalogue was now highly sought after : The Man Who Sold the World had been re @-@ released in 1972 along with Space Oddity . " Life on Mars ? " , from Hunky Dory , was released in June 1973 and made number three on the UK singles chart . Entering the same chart in September , Bowie 's novelty record from 1967 , " The Laughing Gnome " , reached number six . Pin Ups , a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites , followed in October , producing a UK number three hit in " Sorrow " and itself peaking at number one , making David Bowie the best @-@ selling act of 1973 in the UK . It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six . 
 = = = 1974 – 76 : " Plastic soul " and the Thin White Duke = = = 
 Bowie moved to the US in 1974 , initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles . Diamond Dogs ( 1974 ) , parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk , was the product of two distinct ideas : a musical based on a wild future in a post @-@ apocalyptic city , and setting George Orwell 's 1984 to music . The album went to number one in the UK , spawning the hits " Rebel Rebel " and " Diamond Dogs " , and number five in the US . To promote it , Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour , visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974 . Choreographed by Toni Basil , and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects , the high @-@ budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob . The resulting documentary , Cracked Actor , featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie : the tour coincided with the singer 's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction , producing severe physical debilitation , paranoia and emotional problems . He later commented that the accompanying live album , David Live , ought to have been titled " David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory " . David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie 's status as a superstar , charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US . It also spawned a UK number ten hit in Bowie 's cover of " Knock on Wood " . After a break in Philadelphia , where Bowie recorded new material , the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul . 
 The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans ( 1975 ) . Biographer Christopher Sandford writes , " Over the years , most British rockers had tried , one way or another , to become black @-@ by @-@ extension . Few had succeeded as Bowie did now . " The album 's sound , which the singer identified as " plastic soul " , constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees . Young Americans yielded Bowie 's first US number one , " Fame " , co @-@ written with John Lennon , who contributed backing vocals , and Carlos Alomar . Lennon called Bowie 's work " great , but it 's just rock 'n'roll with lipstick on " . Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show Soul Train , Bowie mimed " Fame " , as well as " Golden Years " , his November single , which was originally offered to Elvis Presley , who declined it . Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK , and a re @-@ issue of the 1969 single " Space Oddity " became Bowie 's first number one hit in the UK a few months after " Fame " achieved the same in the US . Despite his by now well established superstardom , Bowie , in the words of Sandford , " for all his record sales ( over a million copies of Ziggy Stardust alone ) , existed essentially on loose change . " In 1975 , in a move echoing Ken Pitt 's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier , Bowie fired his manager . At the culmination of the ensuing months @-@ long legal dispute , he watched , as described by Sandford , " millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered " in what were " uniquely generous terms for Defries " , then " shut himself up in West 20th Street , where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door . " Michael Lippman , Bowie 's lawyer during the negotiations , became his new manager ; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year . 
 Station to Station ( 1976 ) introduced a new Bowie persona , " The Thin White Duke " of its title track . Visually , the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton , the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year . Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans , Station to Station 's synthesizer @-@ heavy arrangements prefigured the krautrock @-@ influenced music of his next releases . The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when Russell Harty interviewed the singer for his London Weekend Television talk show in anticipation of the album 's supporting tour . Shortly before the satellite @-@ linked interview was scheduled to commence , the death of the Spanish dictator Franco was announced . Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking , to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live <unk> . This he refused to do , and his interview went ahead . In the ensuing lengthy conversation with Harty , Bowie was incoherent and looked " disconnected " . His sanity — by his own later admission — had become twisted from cocaine ; he overdosed several times during the year , and was withering physically to an alarming degree . Bowie 's positive comments about Hitler , and Eric Clapton 's about immigration restrictions in 1976 , led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism . 
 Station to Station 's January 1976 release was followed in February by a 3 ½ <unk> @-@ long concert tour of Europe and North America . Featuring a starkly lit set , the Isolar – 1976 Tour highlighted songs from the album , including the dramatic and lengthy title track , the ballads " Wild Is the Wind " and " Word on a Wing " , and the funkier " TVC 15 " and " Stay " . The core band that coalesced to produce this album and tour — rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar , bassist George Murray , and drummer Dennis Davis — continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s . The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy . Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that " Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader " , and was detained by customs on the Russian / Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia . 
 Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the " Victoria Station incident " . Arriving in an open @-@ top Mercedes convertible , Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute , which was captured on camera and published in NME . Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid @-@ wave . He later blamed his pro @-@ fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke . " I was out of my mind , totally crazed . The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and <unk> ... I 'd discovered King Arthur " . According to playwright Alan Franks , writing later in The Times , " he was indeed ' deranged ' . He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs . " Bowie 's cocaine addiction , which had caused these controversies , had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles , a city which alienated him hugely . Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME , Bowie explained that Los Angeles was " where it had all happened . The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth . To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is , I think , just heading for disaster . It really is . " 
 = = = 1976 – 79 : Berlin era = = = 
 Bowie moved to Switzerland in 1976 , purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of Lake Geneva . In the new environment , his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career . He devoted more time to his painting , and produced a number of post @-@ modernist pieces . When on tour , he took to sketching in a notebook , and photographing scenes for later reference . Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin , Bowie became , in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford , " a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art . ... Not only did he become a well @-@ known patron of expressionist art : locked in Clos des <unk> he began an intensive self @-@ improvement course in classical music and literature , and started work on an autobiography . " 
 Before the end of 1976 , Bowie 's interest in the burgeoning German music scene , as well as his drug addiction , prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career . There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on <unk> in Schöneberg and Hansa <unk> , the recording studio he used , located on <unk> Straße in Kreuzberg , near the Berlin Wall . While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop , he began to focus on minimalist , ambient music for the first of three albums , co @-@ produced with Tony Visconti , that became known as his Berlin Trilogy . During the same period , Iggy Pop , with Bowie as a co @-@ writer and musician , completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow @-@ up Lust for Life , touring the UK , Europe , and the US in March and April 1977 . 
 The album Low ( 1977 ) , partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu ! , evinced a move away from narration in Bowie 's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional . Although he completed the album in November 1976 , it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it . It received considerable negative criticism upon its release — a release which RCA , anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum , did not welcome , and which Bowie 's former manager , Tony Defries , who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer 's affairs , tried to prevent . Despite these forebodings , Low yielded the UK number three single " Sound and Vision " , and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart , where it reached number two . Leading contemporary composer Philip Glass described Low as " a work of genius " in 1992 , when he used it as the basis for his Symphony No. 1 " Low " ; subsequently , Glass used Bowie 's next album as the basis for his 1996 Symphony No. 4 " Heroes " . Glass has praised Bowie 's gift for creating " fairly complex pieces of music , masquerading as simple pieces " . 
 Echoing Low 's minimalist , instrumental approach , the second of the trilogy , " Heroes " ( 1977 ) , incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent , seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp . Like Low , " Heroes " evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War , symbolised by the divided city of Berlin . Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators , synthesisers and koto , the album was another hit , reaching number three in the UK . Its title track , though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart , gained lasting popularity , and within months had been released in both German and French . Towards the end of the year , Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan 's television show Marc , and again two days later for Bing Crosby 's final CBS television Christmas special , when he joined Crosby in " Peace on Earth / Little Drummer Boy " , a version of " The Little Drummer Boy " with a new , contrapuntal verse . Five years later , the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit , charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day , 1982 . 
 After completing Low and " Heroes " , Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour , bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries . By now he had broken his drug addiction ; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was " Bowie 's first tour for five years in which he had probably not <unk> himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage . ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought , he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends . " Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage , released the same year . 
 The final piece in what Bowie called his " triptych " , Lodger ( 1979 ) , eschewed the minimalist , ambient nature of the other two , making a partial return to the <unk> and guitar @-@ based rock and pop of his pre @-@ Berlin era . The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music , in places incorporating Hijaz non @-@ Western scales . Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt 's Oblique Strategies cards : " Boys Keep Swinging " entailed band members swapping instruments , " Move On " used the chords from Bowie 's early composition " All the Young Dudes " played backwards , and " Red Money " took backing tracks from " Sister Midnight " , a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop . The album was recorded in Switzerland . Ahead of its release , RCA 's Mel <unk> stated , " It would be fair to call it Bowie 's Sergeant Pepper ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer , shunned and victimized by life 's pressures and technology . " As described by biographer Christopher Sandford , " The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices , and production that spelt the end — for fifteen years — of Bowie 's partnership with Eno . " Lodger reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US , and yielded the UK hit singles " Boys Keep Swinging " and " DJ " . Towards the end of the year , Bowie and Angela initiated divorce proceedings , and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980 .

 Scary Monsters ( And Super Creeps ) ( 1980 ) produced the number one hit " Ashes to Ashes " , featuring the textural work of guitar @-@ <unk> Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from " Space Oddity " . The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club " Blitz " — the main New Romantic hangout — to recruit several of the regulars ( including Steve Strange of the band Visage ) to act in the accompanying video , renowned as one of the most innovative of all time . While Scary Monsters utilised principles established by the Berlin albums , it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically . The album 's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp , Chuck Hammer and Pete Townshend . As " Ashes to Ashes " hit number one on the UK charts , Bowie opened a three @-@ month run on Broadway on 24 September , starring in The Elephant Man . 
 Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one @-@ off single release , " Under Pressure " . The duet was a hit , becoming Bowie 's third UK number one single . Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC 's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht 's play Baal . Coinciding with its transmission , a five @-@ track EP of songs from the play , recorded earlier in Berlin , was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht 's Baal . In March 1982 , the month before Paul Schrader 's film Cat People came out , Bowie 's title song , " Cat People ( Putting Out Fire ) " , was released as a single , becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK top 30 . 
 Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let 's Dance . Co @-@ produced by Chic 's Nile Rodgers , the album went platinum in both the UK and the US . Its three singles became top twenty hits in both countries , where its title track reached number one . " Modern Love " and " China Girl " each made number two in the UK , accompanied by a pair of " absorbing " promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said " activated key archetypes in the pop world . ' Let 's Dance ' , with its little narrative surrounding the young Aborigine couple , targeted ' youth ' , and ' China Girl ' , with its bare @-@ bummed ( and later partially censored ) beach lovemaking scene ( a homage to the film From Here to Eternity ) , was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV " . Stevie Ray Vaughan was guest guitarist playing solo on " Let 's Dance " , although the video depicts Bowie miming this part . By 1983 , Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day . Let 's Dance was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour , during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms . The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular . " 
 Tonight ( 1984 ) , another dance @-@ oriented album , found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and , once again , Iggy Pop . It included a number of cover songs , among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit " God Only Knows " . The album bore the transatlantic top ten hit " Blue Jean " , itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video , " <unk> ' for Blue Jean " . Bowie performed at Wembley in 1985 for Live Aid , a multi @-@ venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief . During the event , the video for a fundraising single was premièred , Bowie 's duet with Mick Jagger . " Dancing in the Street " quickly went to number one on release . The same year , Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record " This Is Not America " for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman . Released as a single , the song became a top 40 hit in the UK and US . 
 Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners . It was poorly received by critics , but Bowie 's theme song rose to number two in the UK charts . He also appeared as Jareth , the Goblin King , in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth , for which he wrote five songs . His final solo album of the decade was 1987 's Never Let Me Down , where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums , instead offering harder rock with an industrial / techno dance edge . Peaking at number six in the UK , the album yielded the hits " Day @-@ In , Day @-@ Out " ( his 60th single ) , " Time Will Crawl " , and " Never Let Me Down " . Bowie later described it as his " nadir " , calling it " an awful album " . Supporting Never Let Me Down , and preceded by nine promotional press shows , the 86 @-@ concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May . Bowie 's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar . Critics maligned the tour as overproduced , saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing .

 Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989 , retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s . A hard @-@ rocking quartet , Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels . The line @-@ up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales , whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution , on bass and drums respectively , to Iggy Pop 's 1977 album Lust For Life . 
 Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy , Bowie dominated , both in songwriting and in decision @-@ making . The band 's album debut , Tin Machine ( 1989 ) , was initially popular , though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval : Bowie described one song as " a simplistic , naive , radical , laying @-@ it @-@ down about the emergence of neo @-@ Nazis " ; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford , " It took nerve to denounce drugs , fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book . " EMI complained of " lyrics that preach " as well as " repetitive tunes " and " minimalist or no production " . The album nevertheless reached number three in the UK . 
 Tin Machine 's first world tour was a commercial success , but there was growing reluctance — among fans and critics alike — to accept Bowie 's presentation as merely a band member . A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart , and Bowie , after a disagreement with EMI , left the label . Like his audience and his critics , Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band . Tin Machine began work on a second album , but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work . Performing his early hits during the seven @-@ month Sound + Vision Tour , he found commercial success and acclaim once again . 
 In October 1990 , a decade after his divorce from Angela , Bowie and Somali @-@ born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend . Bowie recalled , " I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate . " They married in 1992 . Tin Machine resumed work the same month , but their audience and critics , ultimately left disappointed by the first album , showed little interest in a second . Tin Machine II 's arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill @-@ timed conflict over the cover art : after production had begun , the new record label , Victory , deemed the depiction of four ancient nude <unk> statues , judged by Bowie to be " in exquisite taste " , " a show of wrong , obscene images " , requiring air @-@ brushing and patching to render the figures sexless . Tin Machine toured again , but after the live album Tin Machine Live : Oy Vey , Baby failed commercially , the band drifted apart , and Bowie , though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels , resumed his solo career .

 On 20 April 1992 , Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert , following the Queen singer 's death the previous year . As well as performing " Heroes " and " All the Young Dudes " , he was joined on " Under Pressure " by Annie Lennox , who took Mercury 's vocal part ; during his appearance , Bowie knelt and recited the Lord 's Prayer at Wembley Stadium . Four days later , Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland . Intending to move to Los Angeles , they flew in to search for a suitable property , but found themselves confined to their hotel , under curfew : the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived . They settled in New York instead . 
 In 1993 , Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure , the soul , jazz and hip @-@ hop influenced Black Tie White Noise . Making prominent use of electronic instruments , the album , which reunited Bowie with Let 's Dance producer Nile Rodgers , confirmed Bowie 's return to popularity , hitting the number one spot on the UK charts and spawning three top 40 hits , including the top 10 song " Jump They Say " . Bowie explored new directions on The Buddha of Suburbia ( 1993 ) , a soundtrack album of incidental music composed for the TV series adaptation of Hanif Kureishi 's novel . It contained some of the new elements introduced in Black Tie White Noise , and also signalled a move towards alternative rock . The album was a critical success but received a low @-@ key release and only made number 87 in the UK charts . 
 Reuniting Bowie with Eno , the quasi @-@ industrial Outside ( 1995 ) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non @-@ linear narrative of art and murder . Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie , the album achieved UK and US chart success , and yielded three top 40 UK singles . In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics , Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour . Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996 , the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie 's guitarist . On 7 January 1997 Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden , New York , at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests , Lou Reed , Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters , Robert Smith of the Cure , Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins , Frank Black of the Pixies and Sonic Youth . 
 Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996 . Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum ' n ' bass , Earthling ( 1997 ) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US , and two singles from the album became UK top 40 hits . Bowie 's song " I 'm Afraid of Americans " from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re @-@ recorded for the album , and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release . The heavy rotation of the accompanying video , also featuring Reznor , contributed to the song 's 16 @-@ week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100 . The Earthling Tour took in Europe and North America between June and November 1997 . In November 1997 , Bowie performed on the BBC 's Children in Need charity single " Perfect Day " , which reached number one in the UK . Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record " ( Safe in This ) Sky Life " for The Rugrats Movie . Although the track was edited out of the final cut , it was later re @-@ recorded and released as " Safe " on the B @-@ side of Bowie 's 2002 single " Everyone Says ' Hi ' " . The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited @-@ edition single release version of Placebo 's track " Without You I 'm Nothing " , co @-@ produced by Visconti , with Bowie 's harmonised vocal added to the original recording . 
 = = = = Bowie Bonds = = = = 
 Bowie Bonds , an early example of celebrity bonds , were asset @-@ backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums ( 287 songs ) that Bowie recorded before 1990 . Bowie Bonds were pioneered by rock and roll investment banker David Pullman . Issued in 1997 , the bonds were bought for US $ 55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America . The bonds paid an interest rate of 7 @.@ 9 % and had an average life of ten years , a higher rate of return than a 10 @-@ year Treasury note ( at the time , 6 @.@ 37 % ) . Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds ' interest payments . Prudential also received guarantees from Bowie 's label , EMI Records , which had recently signed a $ 30m deal with Bowie . By forfeiting ten years worth of royalties , Bowie received a payment of US $ 55 million up front . Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager . Bowie 's combined catalogue of albums covered by this agreement sold more than 1 million copies annually at the time of the agreement . By March 2004 , Moody 's Investors Service lowered the bonds from an A3 rating ( the seventh highest rating ) to <unk> , one notch above junk status . The downgrade was prompted by lower @-@ than @-@ expected revenue " due to weakness in sales for recorded music " and that an unnamed company guaranteed the issue . Nonetheless , the bonds liquidated in 2007 as originally planned , without default , and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie .
