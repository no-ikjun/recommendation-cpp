 Flight testing of the F @-@ 22 began in 1997 with Raptor 4001 , the first EMD jet , and eight more F @-@ 22s would participate in the EMD and flight test program . Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base ( AFB ) for survivability testing , including live fire testing and battle damage repair training . EMD F @-@ 22s have been used for testing upgrades , and also as maintenance trainers . The first production F @-@ 22 was delivered to Nellis AFB , Nevada , in January 2003 . 
 In May 2006 , a released report documented a problem with the F @-@ 22 's forward titanium boom , caused by defective heat @-@ treating . This made the boom on roughly the first 80 F @-@ 22s less ductile than specified and potentially shortened the part 's life . Modifications and inspections were implemented to the booms to restore life expectancy . 
 In August 2008 , an unmodified F @-@ 22 of the 411th Flight Test Squadron performed in the first ever air @-@ to @-@ air refueling of an aircraft using synthetic jet fuel as part of a wider USAF effort to qualify aircraft to use the fuel , a 50 / 50 mix of JP @-@ 8 and a Fischer – Tropsch process @-@ produced , natural gas @-@ based fuel . In 2011 , an F @-@ 22 flew supersonic on a 50 % mixture of biofuel derived from <unk> .

 In December 2005 , the USAF announced that the F @-@ 22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability ( IOC ) . During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006 , in simulated combat exercises 12 F @-@ 22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses . In the exercises , the Raptor @-@ led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air @-@ to @-@ air combat , with neither loss being an F @-@ 22 . During Red Flag 07 @-@ 1 in February 2007 , 14 F @-@ 22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties . Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F @-@ 15s and F @-@ 16s , 6 – 8 F @-@ 22s maintained air dominance throughout . No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures ; a single F @-@ 22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force . F @-@ 22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance . 
 The Raptor achieved Full Operational Capability ( FOC ) in December 2007 , when General John Corley of Air Combat Command ( ACC ) officially declared the F @-@ 22s of the integrated active duty 1st Fighter Wing and Virginia Air National Guard <unk> Fighter Wing fully operational . This was followed by an Operational Readiness Inspection ( ORI ) of the integrated wing in April 2008 , in which it was rated " excellent " in all categories , with a simulated kill @-@ ratio of 221 – 0 .

 F @-@ 22 fighter units have been frequently deployed to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa , Japan . In February 2007 , on the aircraft 's first overseas deployment to Kadena Air Base , six F @-@ 22s of 27th Fighter Squadron flying from Hickam AFB , Hawaii , experienced multiple software @-@ related system failures while crossing the International Date Line ( 180th meridian of longitude ) . The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft . Within 48 hours , the error was resolved and the journey resumed . In early 2013 , F @-@ 22s were involved in U.S.-South Korean military drills . 
 In November 2007 , F @-@ 22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB , Alaska , performed their first NORAD interception of two Russian Tu @-@ <unk> " Bear @-@ H " bombers . Since then , F @-@ 22s have also escorted probing Tu @-@ 160 " Blackjack " bombers . The first pair of F @-@ 22s assigned to the 49th Fighter Wing became operational at Holloman AFB , New Mexico , in June 2008 . In 2014 , Holloman F @-@ 22s and their support personnel were reassigned to the reactivated 95th Fighter Squadron at Tyndall AFB . 
 Secretary of Defense Gates initially refused to deploy F @-@ 22s to the Middle East in 2007 . The type made its first deployment in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE in 2009 . In April 2012 , F @-@ 22s have been rotating into Al Dhafra Air Base , less than 200 miles from Iran ; the Iranian defense minister referred to the deployment as a security threat . In March 2013 the USAF announced that an F @-@ 22 had intercepted an Iranian F @-@ 4 Phantom II that approached within 16 miles of an MQ @-@ 1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline . 
 In June 2014 , F @-@ 22s from the 199th Fighter Squadron of the Hawaii Air National Guard were deployed to Malaysia to participate in the Cope <unk> 2014 exercise conducted by the USAF Pacific Air Forces and Royal Malaysian Air Force . 
 On 22 September 2014 , F @-@ 22s performed the type 's first combat sorties during the American @-@ led intervention in Syria ; a number of aircraft dropped 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound GPS @-@ guided bombs on Islamic State targets in the vicinity of <unk> Dam . Combat operations by F @-@ 22s are planned to continue into the foreseeable future . While some missions involve striking targets , the F @-@ 22 's main role is intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR ) gathering . By January 2015 , the F @-@ 22 accounted for three percent of Air Force sorties during Operation Inherent Resolve . General Mike Hostage of ACC said that it performed " flawlessly " during this deployment . Between September 2014 and July 2015 , F @-@ 22s flew 204 sorties over Syria , dropping 270 bombs at some 60 locations . On 23 June 2015 , a pair of F @-@ 22s performed the aircraft 's first close air support ( CAS ) mission after receiving a short @-@ notice request for airstrikes in close proximity to friendly forces . 
 In late 2014 , the USAF was testing a rapid deployment concept involving four F @-@ 22s and one C @-@ 17 for support , first proposed in 2008 by two F @-@ 22 pilots . The goal was for the type to be able to set up and engage in combat within 24 hours . Four F @-@ 22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany in August and <unk> Air Base in Poland and Amari Air Base in Estonia in September 2015 to train with NATO allies . 
 = = = Maintenance and training = = = 
 F @-@ 22 aircraft were available for missions 62 % of the time on average in 2004 and 70 % in 2009 . The rate was at 63 % in 2015 . Early on , the F @-@ 22 required more than 30 hours of maintenance per flight hour and a total cost per flight hour of $ 44 @,@ 000 ; by 2008 it was reduced to 18 @.@ 1 , and 10 @.@ 5 by 2009 ; lower than the Pentagon 's requirement of 12 maintenance hours per flight hour . When introduced , the F @-@ 22 had a Mean Time Between Maintenance ( <unk> ) of 1 @.@ 7 hours , short of the required 3 @.@ 0 ; in 2012 this rose to 3 @.@ 2 hours . By 2013 , the cost per flight hour was $ 68 @,@ 362 , over three times as much as the F @-@ 16 . In 2014 , the F @-@ 22 fleet required 43 maintenance man @-@ hours per flight hour . 
 Each aircraft requires a month @-@ long packaged maintenance plan ( <unk> ) every 300 flight hours . The stealth system , including its radar absorbing metallic skin , account for almost one third of maintenance . The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours . F @-@ 22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB , Utah . 
 In January 2007 , the F @-@ 22 reportedly maintained 97 % sortie rate , flying 102 out of 105 tasked sorties while amassing a 144 @-@ to @-@ zero kill ratio during " Northern Edge " air @-@ to @-@ air exercises in Alaska . According to Lieutenant Colonel Wade Tolliver , squadron commander of the 27th Fighter Squadron , the stealth coatings of the F @-@ 22 are more robust than those used in earlier stealth aircraft , being less sensitive to weather and wear and tear . However , rain caused " shorts and failures in sophisticated electrical components " when F @-@ 22s were posted to Guam . 
 To reduce operating costs and lengthen the F @-@ 22 's service life , some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators , while the T @-@ 38 Talon is used for adversary training . DoD budget cuts led to F @-@ 22 demonstration flights being halted in 2013 before resuming in 2014 . In 2012 , it was reported that the F @-@ 22 's maintenance demands have increased as the fleet aged , the stealth coatings being particularly demanding . 
 = = = = Operational problems = = = = 
 Operational problems have been experienced and some have caused fleet @-@ wide groundings . Critically , pilots have experienced a decreased mental status , including losing consciousness . There were reports of instances of pilots found to have a decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing . F @-@ 22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough ; other symptoms include irritability , emotional lability and neurological changes . A number of possible causes were investigated , including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing , pressure suit malfunction , side effects from oxygen delivery at greater @-@ than @-@ atmospheric concentrations , and oxygen supply disruptions . Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures . The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight , but reports of oxygen issues persisted . 
 In 2005 , the Raptor <unk> Working Group , a USAF expert panel , recommended several changes to deal with the oxygen supply issues . In October 2011 , Lockheed Martin was awarded a $ 24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties . In July 2012 , the Pentagon concluded that a pressure valve on flight vests worn during high @-@ altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia @-@ like symptoms . Long @-@ distance flights were resumed , but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made . The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates . The breathing regulator / anti @-@ g ( <unk> ) valve , used to inflate the pilot 's vest during high G maneuvers , was found to be defective , inflating the vest at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot 's breathing . The on @-@ board oxygen generating system ( OBOGS ) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high @-@ G maneuvers . In late 2012 , Lockheed Martin was awarded contracts to install a supplemental automatic oxygen backup system , in addition to the primary and manual backup . Changes recommended by the Raptor <unk> Working Group in 2005 received further consideration in 2012 ; the USAF reportedly considered installing EEG brain wave monitors on the pilot 's helmets for inflight monitoring . 
 New backup oxygen generators and filters have been installed on the aircraft . The coughing symptoms have been attributed to acceleration atelectasis , which may be exacerbated by the F @-@ 22 's high performance ; there is no present solution to the condition . The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated . On 4 April 2013 , the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F @-@ 22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided .

 The FB @-@ 22 was a proposed medium @-@ range bomber for the USAF . The FB @-@ 22 was projected to carry up to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to about twice the range of the F @-@ 22A , while maintaining the F @-@ 22 's stealth and supersonic speed . However , the FB @-@ 22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments , in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber with a much greater range . 
 The X @-@ 44 <unk> , or multi @-@ axis , no @-@ tail aircraft , was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F @-@ 22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup .

 In April 1992 , the second YF @-@ 22 crashed while landing at Edwards AFB . The test pilot , Tom <unk> , escaped without injury . The cause of the crash was found to be a flight control software error that failed to prevent a pilot @-@ induced oscillation . 
 The first F @-@ 22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004 , in which the pilot ejected safely before impact . The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight @-@ control system malfunction ; consequently the aircraft design was corrected to avoid the problem . Following a brief grounding , F @-@ 22 operations resumed after a review . 
 On 25 March 2009 , an EMD F @-@ 22 crashed 35 miles ( 56 km ) northeast of Edwards AFB during a test flight , resulting in the death of Lockheed Martin test pilot David P. Cooley . An Air Force Materiel Command investigation found that Cooley momentarily lost consciousness during a high @-@ G maneuver , then ejected when he found himself too low to recover . Cooley was killed during ejection by blunt @-@ force trauma from <unk> due to the aircraft 's speed . The investigation found no design issues . 
 On 16 November 2010 , an F @-@ 22 from Elmendorf AFB crashed , killing the pilot , Captain Jeffrey Haney . F @-@ 22s were restricted to flying below 25 @,@ 000 feet , then grounded during the investigation . The crash was attributed to a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected , shutting down the Environmental Control System ( ECS ) and OBOGS . The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame , as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system . Haney 's widow sued Lockheed Martin , claiming equipment defects . She later reached a settlement . After the ruling , the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned ; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure . On 11 February 2013 , the DoD 's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney , and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions ; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling . 
 During a training mission , an F @-@ 22 crashed to the east of Tyndall AFB , on 15 November 2012 . The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground . The investigation determined that a " chafed " electrical wire ignited the fluid in a hydraulic line , causing a fire that damaged the flight controls .

 = The Call ( 2013 film ) = 
 The Call is a 2013 American crime thriller film directed by Brad Anderson and written by Richard D 'Ovidio . The film stars Abigail Breslin as Casey Welson , a teenage girl kidnapped by a serial killer and Halle Berry as Jordan Turner , a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 operator , still suffering emotionally from a prior botched 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call , who receives Casey 's call . Morris Chestnut , Michael Eklund , Michael Imperioli , and David Otunga also star . The story was originally envisioned as a television series , but D 'Ovidio later rewrote it as a 94 @-@ minute feature film . Filming began in July 2012 and spanned a period of 25 days , with all scenes being shot in Los Angeles , mainly Burbank and Santa Clarita . 
 A screening of The Call was held at the Women 's International Film Festival hosted at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26 , 2013 . TriStar Pictures released it to theatres a few weeks later on March 15 , 2013 . Considered to be high @-@ concept by many reviewers , the film proved a commercial success , grossing over $ 68 million against budget of $ 13 million . Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the Teen Choice Awards and Best Actress at the BET Awards and the film received generally mixed reviews from critics , but praised Berry 's performance and the film 's suspense . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A Los Angeles Police Department veteran 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 operator , Jordan Turner ( Berry ) , receives a call one night from a teenage girl , Leah Templeton ( Evie Thompson ) , fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home . Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs , but when the call is disconnected , Jordan calls Leah back , a decision that later costs Leah her life , as the ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder . Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone . He responds " It 's already done " and hangs up , leaving her distraught . The next day , Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered . Emotionally affected by the incident , Jordan tells her boyfriend , Officer Paul Phillips ( Morris Chestnut ) , that she can no longer handle field calls . 
 Six months later , she is working as a trainer for 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 operators . Simultaneously , teenager Casey Welson ( Breslin ) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend , Autumn , and forced into the trunk of a car . Casey had taken Autumn 's disposable phone , and uses it to call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . A rookie operator ( Jenna Lamia ) receives the call but is unable to handle it , prompting Jordan to take over , though Casey 's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found . While the kidnapper drives , Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars . One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 , allowing the police to narrow their search . When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk , Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the <unk> hole , attracting the attention of another motorist , Alan <unk> ( Michael Imperioli ) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel , assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey . He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably , which causes the kidnapper to stab him . He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help . The worker attempts to bust the door open , but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him . 
 Upon arriving at his destination , the kidnapper , Michael Foster ( Michael Eklund ) , removes Casey from the trunk and finds the phone in her pocket , with 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 listening on the line . Through the phone , Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to turn himself in and not hurt the girl . Before smashing the phone , Michael responds , " It 's already done " and Jordan realizes that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah six months prior . Meanwhile , Phillips , accompanied by Officer Jake <unk> ( David Otunga ) and others in law enforcement , raid Michael 's home , but find only his wife and children . Finding a photo of Michael and his sister , Melinda , they realize that Casey resembles the latter . Additionally , the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael 's wife to have burned down , although a nearby cottage still remains . The police raid it , but find nobody there and leave . Michael begins to wash and cut Casey 's hair . Determined to rescue Casey , Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his leukemia @-@ stricken sister . Stepping outside , she recognizes sounds from an outdoor flagpole , reminiscent of sounds heard in the background in the final moments of the 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call . She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood . After she accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar , she climbs down in without calling the police . 
 Navigating the cellar , Jordan hides from an emerging Michael . The cellar itself pieces together Michael 's backstory . Michael had incestuous feelings towards his sister and was distraught when she fell ill , lost all of her hair and died of leukemia . Foster has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister . He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair , trying to find scalps that match his sister 's hair . Jordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a dentist chair and attacks Michael , as he begins to <unk> Casey 's scalp . She frees Casey and both manage to gradually escape the cellar , and Casey stabs Michael in the back with a pair of scissors . Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar , rendering him unconscious . While he is knocked out , they tie him to a chair . When he regains consciousness , they inform him that they plan to leave him to die and claim that Casey had escaped , was found by Jordan in the woods , and that Michael disappeared . Pleading with them that they cannot just leave him there , Jordan replies to Foster using his own words , " It 's already done , " and as he shouts insults at them locks the door , avenges Leah 's death and leaves .

 Screenwriter Richard D 'Ovidio was inspired to script the story after his wife heard an NPR segment with a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 operator discussing her job . He began to research the subject and visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center ( <unk> ) . Finding the center , which has backup generators , bulletproof windows , and a moat surrounding the building , to be " pretty amazing , " he decided to shed light on what he viewed as a previously overlooked occupation . The story was originally conceptualized as a television series entitled The Hive ( a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing ) , but D 'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that " the operators couldn 't be the ones kicking in doors and going out into the field " all the time . As a result , what was planned to be the pilot episode was expanded and revised as a movie . 
 For most of the film , Berry 's character , Turner , the 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 operator , does stay inside " the hive " before becoming actively involved in the search for Breslin 's character , Welson , the kidnapped caller . D 'Ovidio chose two female leads , explaining , " I wanted strong women ... I think it was appropriate here , since most 911 call operators are women . " Berry remarked , " I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women . We don 't often get to play roles like this , where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary . " D 'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters — the operator and the caller — believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one . As a result , he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay . As well as collaborating on the story with his wife , Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp , he accepted suggestions from Berry , Breslin and Eklund : " Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out . I 'm not one to say ' no ' to a great suggested line of dialogue . It just makes me look better as a writer ! I feel it 's a very collaborative process , and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people . When someone comes up to you and says , ' Why don 't we do it this way ? ' I think that it 's important to listen . " 
 Chestnut , who plays Phillips , a police officer and Turner 's boyfriend , prepared by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe what it is like to be an officer in a squad car and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work . She told a Miami Herald interviewer , " You get a different perspective by doing research ... You can 't know what it 's like to be a cop even though you 've seen it in the movies . But nobody ever saw a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 center . I thought they lived in the ground somewhere ! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be . I was a wreck watching them . They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing . I thought , ' I could never do this job . ' " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Producers scheduled for The Call to be filmed in Canada in June 2011 after they failed to make the cut for a California tax credit . With a low budget of $ 13 million , they settled on Ottawa , Ontario , where director Anderson had just finished another project . However , the California Film Commission ( CFC ) called back nine months later and informed them that the waiting list had been largely cleared and that they now qualified for $ 1 @.@ 9 million in tax deduction . According to Producer Michael <unk> , they were " literally days from starting to put down a deposit . " Berry was reportedly pleased with the news , having wanted to stay in Los Angeles and the CFC helped secure film locations for the project . 
 With a crew of roughly 120 persons , filming took a total of 25 days , spanning from July to August 2012 . Car chase scenes were shot at Long Beach and a Westlake Village office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center . The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked in the trunk of a car . Other filming locations include the Burbank Town Center on Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank , California , Santa Clarita , California and the 170 Highway . At one point , Berry was rushed to Cedars @-@ Sinai Medical Center after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence . A spokesperson for Berry confirmed that she suffered a minor head injury and was taken to the hospital as a precaution , but she checked out healthy and was released . 
 Berry told interviewer Kimberly Grant , " The hard part for me was to try to stay connected to Phillips and Welson . " This was because , Grant writes , " she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue , rattling off in quick succession 911 @-@ operator jargon , that would be cut and edited to fit the film ... In film terms , that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks , not an easy feat for any actor . " Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut , Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co @-@ stars for most of the film : " That was my constant challenge ; to stay on such an emotional level [ as Jordan ] , so that I would be on the same level as they [ i.e. , Casey and Officer Phillips ] were . I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character . "

 Spanning 94 minutes upon completion , the movie received an R rating for violence , disturbing content and some language . Berry and Chestnut promoted the film at the <unk> ICON movie theater at the red @-@ carpet premiere in Chicago on February 28 . Berry also traveled to Rio to promote The Call in anticipation of its April 12 release in Brazil . 
 The Women 's International Film Festival hosted a screening of The Call at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26 , 2013 . Chestnut told the audience that he would sign on for a sequel , saying about Berry , " I didn 't get to kiss this woman enough ! " Berry added , " I 'm in the movie and even I was scared . " The film was released in theatres on March 15 and on DVD and Blu @-@ ray Disc on June 25 of that same year . DVD extras included a featurette entitled " Emergency Procedure : Making the Film " and commentary from Abigail Breslin , Halle Berry , and other filmmakers . The Blu @-@ ray version came with more features , including deleted scenes , an alternate ending , Michael Eklund 's audition tape , featurettes entitled " A Set Tour of The Hive and The Lair " and " Inside the Stunts " , as well as all of the original DVD content .

 According to Boxoffice , The Call was expected to earn about $ 11 – 12 million on its opening weekend in 2 @,@ 507 theaters across the United States but surpassed this by a significant margin and grossed $ 17 million in its first three days . This indicated good profits , as the film cost about $ 13 million to produce and TriStar Pictures paid a much smaller amount to acquire U.S. distribution rights . With box office takings of over $ 68 million , The Call is WWE Studios ' most commercially successful film to date , the previous top @-@ grossing productions being See No Evil , which stars professional wrestler Kane ( Glenn Jacobs ) ( $ 19 million ) and 12 Rounds , which stars professional wrestler John Cena ( $ 17 million ) . 
 Critics were surprised by the movie 's success because " Berry hadn 't had a hit in a number of years " and because the R rating narrowed down the audience . WWE Studios head Michael <unk> commented that The Call " [ exceeded ] our most optimistic forecasts . " 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The Call has received mostly mixed reviews from critics , having a 44 % overall film rating review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 124 reviews with the consensus : " The Call builds plenty of suspense before taking a problematic turn in the third act . " Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B rating , saying that the tale " is surprisingly good and surprisingly gruesome fun . Eklund makes the most of the maniac role and Breslin is a sympathetic victim . " Similarly , Metacritic , another film review aggregator , gave the movie a 51 out of 100 based on 23 reviews . Reviewer Dwight Brown wrote , " The script gives Berry a blue @-@ collar character she can make accessible , vulnerable and gutsy ... Chestnut is not suitably gallant and stalwart as her caring lover and a cop on a mission ... This film is a whole lot scarier than you think it 's going to be . " Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote , " An effectively creepy thriller about a 911 operator and a young miss in peril , The Call is a model of low @-@ budget filmmaking . " She praised its " clean , clever premise " and said that Berry 's Jordan is " an old @-@ fashioned hero in many respects , so it 's fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old @-@ fashioned filmmaking techniques , like crosscutting , to build tension and old @-@ school exploitation tricks like evil to justify taking the story dark and then dark and bonkers . " 
 A reviewer for The Hutchinson News , Jake Coyle , commented , " Director Brad Anderson ... working from the simple , high @-@ concept screenplay by Richard D 'Ovidio , ably cuts between Berry 's increasingly emotionally @-@ attached Jordan Turner and Breslin 's panicking Casey Welson , contrasting the fraught strategizing of Turner with the frantic police pursuit of the kidnapper . " Coyle stated that " The Call dials up a shallow thrill ride , but one efficiently peppered with your typical ' don 't go in there ! ' moments , " but concluded , " The Call is a rudimentary , almost old @-@ fashioned 90 @-@ minute escape that manages to achieve its low ambitions . " Rating the film 2 stars out of 4 , Coyle writes that once the film " manages to build some suspense from the trunk of the <unk> the clever attempts to elicit help , the dwindling cell phone <unk> its deficiencies become less forgivable once the action turns off the road . " 
 Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed feelings in his review : " Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one @-@ hour mark .

" The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review : " The semi @-@ fresh thriller , set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles , puts a tech slant on a damsel @-@ in @-@ distress setup .

 = Kannada = 
 Kannada / <unk> , <unk> / ( <unk> ್ <unk> <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> ] ) , also known as Canarese or Kanarese / <unk> / , is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Kannada people in South India , mainly in the state of Karnataka , and by linguistic minorities in the states of Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , Tamil Nadu , Maharashtra , Kerala , and Goa . The language has roughly 40 million native speakers who are called Kannadigas ( <unk> ) , and a total of 50 @.@ 8 million speakers according to a 2001 census . It is one of the scheduled languages of India and the official and administrative language of the state of Karnataka . 
 The Kannada language is written using the Kannada script , which evolved from the 5th @-@ century Kadamba script . Kannada is attested <unk> for about one and a half millennium , and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 6th @-@ century Ganga dynasty and during the 9th @-@ century Rashtrakuta Dynasty . Kannada has an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years . 
 Based on the recommendations of the Committee of Linguistic Experts , appointed by the ministry of culture , the government of India designated Kannada a classical language of India . In July 2011 , a centre for the study of classical Kannada was established as part of the Central Institute of Indian Languages at Mysore to facilitate research related to the language . 
 = = Development = = 
 Kannada is a Southern Dravidian language , and according to Dravidian scholar Sanford B. Steever , its history can be conventionally divided into three periods ; Old Kannada ( <unk> ) from 450 – 1200 A.D. , Middle Kannada ( <unk> ) from 1200 – 1700 A.D. , and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present . Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit . Influences of other languages such as Prakrit and Pali can also be found in Kannada language . The scholar <unk> Mahadevan indicated that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than 3rd century B.C. , and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit and Tamil inscriptions of that period , Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population . The scholar K. V. Narayana claims that many tribal languages which are now designated as Kannada dialects could be nearer to the earlier form of the language with lesser influence from other languages .. Kannada is seems to be oldest living language in the world ( Citation needed ) . 
 = = Influence of Sanskrit and Prakrit = = 
 The sources of influence on literary Kannada grammar appear to be three @-@ fold ; Pāṇini 's grammar , non @-@ <unk> schools of Sanskrit grammar , particularly Katantra and <unk> schools , and Prakrit grammar . Literary Prakrit seemed to have prevailed in Karnataka since ancient times . The vernacular Prakrit speaking people may have come in contact with the Kannada speakers , thus influencing their language , even before Kannada was used for administrative or liturgical purposes . Kannada phonetics , morphology , vocabulary , grammar and syntax show significant influence of these languages . 
 Some examples of naturalised ( <unk> ) words of Prakrit origin in Kannada are : <unk> ( color ) derived from <unk> , <unk> ( new moon ) from <unk> . Examples of naturalized Sanskrit words in Kannada are : <unk> ( color ) , <unk> ( king ) from <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> from <unk> ( king ) . Kannada has numerous borrowed ( <unk> ) words such as <unk> ( day ) , <unk> ( anger ) , <unk> ( sun ) , mukha ( face ) , <unk> ( minute ) and anna ( rice ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early traces = = = 
 Pre @-@ old Kannada ( or <unk> <unk> ) was the language of Banavasi in the early Common Era , the Satavahana , <unk> Satakarni ( Naga ) and Kadamba periods and hence has a history of over 2000 years . The Ashoka rock edict found at Brahmagiri ( dated to 230 BC ) has been suggested to contain words in identifiable Kannada . 
 Aristophanes and Euripides ( 5th @-@ 4th century BCE ) : The great Greek dramatists of the 5th @-@ 4th century BCE , particularly Euripides and Aristophanes , appear to have been familiar with the Kannada country and the Kannada language , and had actually used Kannada phrases and expressions in the dialogues of their characters along with Persian and Punic in their skits and dramas . This shows a far more intimate contact of the Greeks with Kannada culture than with Indian culture elsewhere . 
 Alexandria ( Egypt ) ( 4th century BCE ) : <unk> Gowda stumbled upon a piece of evidence in the Egyptian city of Alexandria that proves the existence of Kannada in 4th century BCE . He saw the Kannada word ' <unk> ' ( lit in a village ) written on a huge wall constructed in Alexandria by ancient Greek ruler Alexander the Great in 4th century BCE . The Kannada word ‘ <unk> ’ is part of the remnants of 36 @,@ 000 palm manuscripts that had been burnt in an accidental fire during Alexander ’ s time . When the accidental fire destroyed much of the palm manuscripts , Alexander ordered his commanders to erect a huge wall so that the remnants can be magnified and reproduced on it . The palm manuscripts contained texts written not only in Greek , Latin and Hebrew , but also Sanskrit and Kannada . 
 In some 3rd – 1st century BCE Tamil inscriptions , words of Kannada influence such as ' <unk> ' , ' kavuDi ' and ' <unk> ' have been introduced . The use of the vowel ' a ' as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil but its usage is available in Kannada . Kannada words such as ' <unk> @-@ <unk> ' transform into Tamil ’ s ' kavuDi ' for lack of the usage of Ghosha <unk> in Tamil . Hence the Kannada word ' <unk> ' becomes ' kavuDi ' in Tamil . ' <unk> ' ( ' <unk> ' ) was introduced into Tamil from Kannada and colloquial Tamil uses this word as ' <unk> ' . In a 1st century CE Tamil inscription , there is a personal reference to ' <unk> ' , a word of Kannada origin . In a 3rd century CE Tamil inscription there is usage of ' <unk> <unk> ' . Here the honorific ' <unk> ' to a person ’ s name is an influence from Kannada . Another word of Kannada origin is ' <unk> ' and is found in a 4th @-@ century CE Tamil inscription . These are some examples that are proof of the influence of Kannada on Tamil before the common era and in the early centuries of the common era . 
 Pliny ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) : Pliny , who was the naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire , writes about pirates between Muziris and Nitrias ( Netravati River ) . He also mentions <unk> ( Barcelore ) . Nitrias of Pliny and <unk> of Ptolemy refer to the Netravati River as also the modern port city of Mangaluru , upon its mouth . Many of these are Kannada origin names of places and rivers of the Karnataka coast of 1st century CE . 
 Ptolemy ( 150 AD ) : The Greek Geographer Ptolemy mentions in his writing places such as <unk> ( Badami ) , <unk> ( Indi ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Pattadakal ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> or <unk> ( Savadi ) , <unk> ( Banavasi ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Paithan ) , <unk> ( Malkhed ) , Aloe ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) indicating prosperous trade between Egypt , Europe and Karnataka . He also mentions <unk> ( <unk> ) and refers to beryls , i.e. , the <unk> gems of that country . He mentions <unk> ( <unk> ) a coastal town of Karnataka . In this work <unk> and <unk> are identified as <unk> and <unk> . Ptolemy writes in the midst of the false mouth and the <unk> , there is a city called <unk> ( Mangalore ) . He mentions of inland centres of pirates called <unk> ( <unk> ) . He mentions Ariake <unk> meaning <unk> Satakarni and <unk> as capital of Siro ( e ) P ( t ) <unk> , i.e. , Sri <unk> clearly indicating his knowledge of the Satavahana kings . The word <unk> means One with body of Tiger in Kannada , which bears testimony to the possible Kannada origin of Satavahana kings . 
 A possibly more definite reference to Kannada is found in the ' <unk> Mime ' ascribed to the late 1st to early 2nd century CE . The farce , written by an unknown author was discovered in the early 20th century at <unk> in Egypt . The play is concerned with a Greek lady named <unk> who has been stranded on the coast of a country bordering the Indian Ocean . The king of this region , and his countrymen , sometimes use their own language , and the sentences they spoke include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( lit having poured a little wine into the cup separately ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( lit having taken up the cup separately and having covered it , I shall take wine separately ) . The language employed in the papyrus indicates that the play is set in one of the numerous small ports on the western coast of India , between Karwar and <unk> . 
 = = = Epigraphy = = = 
 The written tradition of Kannada begins in the early centuries of common era . The earliest examples of a full @-@ length Kannada language stone inscription ( <unk> ) containing Brahmi characters with characteristics attributed to those of proto @-@ Kannada in Hale Kannada ( lit Old Kannada ) script can be found in the Halmidi inscription , usually dated c . AD 450 , indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language at that time . The Halmidi inscription provides invaluable information about the history and culture of Karnataka . The 5th century <unk> inscription of <unk> and the Chikkamagaluru inscription of 500 AD are further examples . Recent reports indicate that the Old Kannada <unk> inscription discovered on the Chandragiri hill , Shravanabelagola , is older than Halmidi inscription by about fifty to hundred years and may belong to the period AD 350 – 400 . The noted archaeologist and art historian S. <unk> is of the opinion that an inscription of the Western Ganga King <unk> Madhava ( c . 350 – 370 ) found at <unk> ( <unk> ) in <unk> taluk of Shimoga district is of 350 CE and is also older than the Halmidi inscription . 
 Current estimates of the total number of existing epigraphs written in Kannada range from 25 @,@ 000 by the scholar Sheldon Pollock to over 30 @,@ 000 by the <unk> Datta of the Sahitya Akademi . Prior to the Halmidi inscription , there is an abundance of inscriptions containing Kannada words , phrases and sentences , proving its antiquity . The 543 AD Badami cliff inscription of Pulakesi I is an example of a Sanskrit inscription in old Kannada script . Kannada inscriptions are not only discovered in Karnataka but also quite commonly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana , Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu . Some inscriptions were also found in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat . The Northern most Kannada inscription of the Rashtrakutas of 964 CE is the Jura record found near Jabalpur in present @-@ day Madhya Pradesh , belonging to the reign of Krishna III . This indicates the spread of the influence of the language over the ages , especially during the rule of large Kannada empires . <unk> sites of Myanmar yielded variety of Indian scripts including those written in a script especially archaic , most resembling the Kadamba ( Kannada @-@ speaking Kadambas of 4th century CE Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh ) form of common Kannada @-@ Telugu script from Andhra Pradesh . 
 The earliest copper plates inscribed in Old Kannada script and language , dated to the early 8th century AD , are associated with Alupa King <unk> II from <unk> ( the Dakshina Kannada district ) , and display the double crested fish , his royal emblem . The oldest well @-@ preserved palm leaf manuscript in Old Kannada is that of Dhavala . It dates to around the 9th century and is preserved in the Jain Bhandar , <unk> , Dakshina Kannada district . The manuscript contains 1478 leaves written using ink .

 Some early Kadamba Dynasty coins bearing the Kannada inscription Vira and <unk> were found in Satara <unk> . A gold coin bearing three inscriptions of Sri and an abbreviated inscription of king Bhagiratha 's name called <unk> ( c . AD 390 – 420 ) in old Kannada exists . A Kadamba copper coin dated to the 5th century AD with the inscription <unk> in Kannada script was discovered in Banavasi , Uttara Kannada district . Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered spanning the rule of the Western Ganga Dynasty , the Badami Chalukyas , the Alupas , the Western Chalukyas , the Rashtrakutas , the Hoysalas , the Vijayanagar Empire , the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi , the Keladi Nayakas and the Mysore Kingdom , the Badami Chalukya coins being a recent discovery . The coins of the Kadambas of Goa are unique in that they have alternate inscription of the king 's name in Kannada and Devanagari in triplicate , a few coins of the Kadambas of Hangal are also available . 
 = = Literature = = 
 = = = Old Kannada = = = 
 The oldest existing record of Kannada poetry in Tripadi metre is the Kappe Arabhatta record of AD 700 . Kavirajamarga by King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I ( AD 850 ) is the earliest existing literary work in Kannada . It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries . The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King Durvinita of the 6th century and Ravikirti , the author of the Aihole record of 636 AD . Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of Kannada grammar and literary styles , it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier . An early extant prose work , the <unk> by <unk> of AD 900 provides an elaborate description of the life of Bhadrabahu of Shravanabelagola . 
 Kannada works from earlier centuries mentioned in the Kavirajamarga are not yet traced . Some ancient texts now considered extinct but referenced in later centuries are <unk> ( AD 650 ) by <unk> , Chudamani ( Crest Jewel — AD 650 ) by <unk> , also known as <unk> , which is a work of 96 @,@ 000 verse @-@ measures and a commentary on logic ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . Other sources date Chudamani to the 6th century or earlier . The <unk> Katha , a eulogy for King Pulakesi II , is said to have belonged to the 7th century ; the <unk> , a work on elephant management by King Shivamara II , belonged to the 8th century , and the Chandraprabha @-@ purana by Sri Vijaya , a court poet of King Amoghavarsha I , is ascribed to the early 9th century . Tamil Buddhist commentators of the 10th century AD ( in the commentary on <unk> , a Tamil grammatical work ) make references that show that Kannada literature must have flourished as early as the AD 4th century . 
 Around the beginning of the 9th century , Old Kannada was spoken from Kaveri to Godavari . The Kannada spoken between the rivers Varada and Malaprabha was the pure well of Kannada undefiled . 
 The late classical period gave birth to several genres of Kannada literature , with new forms of composition coming into use , including Ragale ( a form of blank verse ) and meters like Sangatya and Shatpadi . The works of this period are based on Jain and Hindu principles . Two of the early writers of this period are Harihara and Raghavanka , trailblazers in their own right . Harihara established the Ragale form of composition while Raghavanka popularised the Shatpadi ( six @-@ lined stanza ) meter . A famous Jaina writer of the same period is Janna , who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works . 
 The Vachana Sahitya tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature , and the sum of contributions by all sections of society . Vachanas were pithy poems on that period 's social , religious and economic conditions . More importantly , they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution , which caused a radical re @-@ examination of the ideas of caste , creed and religion . Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include Basavanna , Allama Prabhu and Akka Mahadevi . 
 Emperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was Margi ( formal or written form of language ) and Desi ( folk or spoken form of language ) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada . In 1112 CE , Jain poet <unk> of <unk> , Dharwad district , in his Champu work <unk> , a book on morals , warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil . He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada . In 1235 CE , Jain poet Andayya , wrote Kabbigara Kava ( Poet 's Defender ) , also called Sobagina <unk> ( Harvest of Beauty ) or Madana @-@ Vijaya and Kavana @-@ <unk> ( Cupid 's Conquest ) , a Champu work in pure Kannada using only indigenous ( <unk> ) Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words – <unk> , without the admixture of Sanskrit words . He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated that it was impossible to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words . Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates . Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature ( like Tamil ) , but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary ( like Telugu , Malayalam , Tulu , etc . ) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages . 
 = = = Middle Kannada = = = 
 During the period between the 15th and 18th centuries , Hinduism had a great influence on Middle Kannada ( <unk> ) language and literature . Kumara Vyasa , who wrote the Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari , was arguably the most influential Kannada writer of this period . His work , entirely composed in the native <unk> Shatpadi ( hexa @-@ meter ) , is a sublime adaptation of the first ten books of the Mahabharata . During this period , the Sanskritic influence is present in most abstract , religious , scientific and rhetorical terms . During this period , several Hindi and Marathi words came into Kannada , chiefly relating to feudalism and militia . 
 Hindu saints of the Vaishnava sect such as Kanakadasa , Purandaradasa , Naraharitirtha , Vyasatirtha , Sripadaraya , Vadirajatirtha , Vijaya Dasa , Jagannatha Dasa , Prasanna <unk> produced devotional poems in this period . Kanakadasa 's <unk> Charite is a rare work , concerning with the issue of class struggle . This period saw the advent of Haridasa Sahitya ( lit Dasa literature ) which made rich contributions to Bhakti literature and sowed the seeds of Carnatic music . Purandara Dasa is widely considered the Father of Carnatic music . 
 = = = Modern Kannada = = = 
 The Kannada works produced from the 19th century make a gradual transition and are classified as <unk> or Modern Kannada . Most notable among the modernists was the poet <unk> <unk> whose writing may be described as the " Dawn of Modern Kannada " , though generally , linguists treat Indira Bai or <unk> <unk> by <unk> Venkata Raya as the first literary works in Modern Kannada . The first modern movable type printing of " Canarese " appears to be the Canarese Grammar of Carey printed at Serampore in 1817 , and the " Bible in Canarese " of John Hands in 1820 . The first novel printed was John Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , along with other texts including Canarese Proverbs , The History of Little Henry and his Bearer by Mary Martha Sherwood , Christian Gottlob Barth 's Bible Stories and " a Canarese hymn book . " 
 Modern Kannada in the 20th century has been influenced by many movements , notably Navodaya , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Contemporary Kannada literature has been highly successful in reaching people of all classes in society . Further , Kannada has produced a number of prolific and renowned poets and writers such as Kuvempu , Bendre , and V K Gokak . Works of Kannada literature have received eight Jnanpith awards , the highest number awarded to any Indian language .

The character set is almost identical to that of other Indian languages . The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic , but for the sound of a " half n " ( which becomes a half m ) . The number of written symbols , however , is far more than the forty @-@ nine characters in the alphabet , because different characters can be combined to form compound characters ( <unk> ) . Each written symbol in the Kannada script corresponds with one syllable , as opposed to one phoneme in languages like English . The Kannada script is syllabic . 
 = = = Obsolete Kannada letters = = = 
 Kannada literary works employed the letters <unk> ( transliterated ' <unk> ' or ' rh ' ) and <unk> ( transliterated ' <unk> ' , ' lh ' or ' zh ' ) , whose manner of articulation most plausibly could be akin to those in present @-@ day Malayalam and Tamil . The letters dropped out of use in the 12th and 18th centuries , respectively . Later Kannada works replaced ' rh ' and ' lh ' with <unk> ( ra ) and <unk> ( la ) respectively . 
 Another letter ( or unclassified <unk> ( consonant ) ) that has become extinct is ' <unk> ' or ' inn ' . Likewise , this has its equivalent in Telugu , where it is called <unk> <unk> . The usage of this consonant was observed until the 1980s in Kannada works from the mostly coastal areas of Karnataka ( especially the Dakshina Kannada district ) . Now , hardly any mainstream works use this consonant . This letter has been replaced by <unk> ್ ( consonant n ) .

 The canonical word order of Kannada is SOV ( subject – object – verb ) as is the case with Dravidian languages . Kannada is a highly inflected language with three genders ( masculine , feminine , and neuter or common ) and two numbers ( singular and plural ) . It is inflected for gender , number and tense , among other things . The most authoritative known book on old Kannada grammar is <unk> by Keshiraja . The first available Kannada book , a treatise on poetics , rhetoric and basic grammar is the Kavirajamarga from 850 C.E. 
 The most influential account of Kannada grammar is Keshiraja 's Shabdamanidarpana ( c . AD 1260 ) . The earlier grammatical works include portions of Kavirajamarga ( a treatise on <unk> ) of the 9th century , and Kavyavalokana and <unk> ( both authored by Nagavarma II in the first half of the 12th century ) .

 Texas ( / <unk> / , locally / <unk> / ; Spanish : Texas or Tejas [ <unk> ] ) is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population . Geographically located in the south central part of the country , Texas shares borders with the other US states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo León , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast . 
 Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the US , while San Antonio is the second most populous in the state and seventh largest in the US . Dallas – Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second most populous state capital in the US , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State to signify its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The " Lone Star " can be found on the Texan state flag and on the Texan state seal . The origin of the state name , Texas , is from the word , " Tejas " , which means ' friends ' in the Caddo language . 
 Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the US southern and southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the US southwestern deserts , less than 10 percent of Texas ' land area is desert . Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . 
 The term " six flags over Texas " refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory . Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas . France held a short @-@ lived colony . Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence , becoming an independent Republic . In 1845 , Texas joined the United States as the 28th state . The state 's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican – American War in 1846 . A slave state before the American Civil War , Texas declared its secession from the US in early 1861 , and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March 2 of the same year . After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government , Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation . 
 One Texan industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle . Due to its long history as a center of the industry , Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy . The state 's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century , when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state . With strong investments in universities , Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid @-@ 20th century . As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57 . With a growing base of industry , the state leads in many industries , including agriculture , petrochemicals , energy , computers and electronics , aerospace , and biomedical sciences . Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second @-@ highest gross state product . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Texas , based on the Caddo word <unk> meaning " friends " or " allies " , was applied by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves and to the region of their settlement in East Texas . 
 During Spanish colonial rule , the area was officially known as the Nuevo Reino de Filipinas : La Provincia de Texas . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Texas is the second largest U.S. state , behind Alaska , with an area of 268 @,@ 820 square miles ( 696 @,@ 200 km2 ) . Though 10 percent larger than France and almost twice as large as Germany or Japan , it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size . If it were an independent country , Texas would be the 40th largest behind Chile and Zambia . 
 Texas is in the south central part of the United States of America . Three of its borders are defined by rivers . The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo León , and Tamaulipas to the south . The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north . The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east . The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100 ° W , a northern border with Oklahoma at 36 ° 30 ' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103 ° W. El Paso lies on the state 's western tip at 32 ° N and the Rio Grande . 
 With 10 climatic regions , 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions , regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils , topography , geology , rainfall , and plant and animal communities . One classification system divides Texas , in order from southeast to west , into the following : Gulf Coastal Plains , Interior Lowlands , Great Plains , and Basin and Range Province . 
 The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state . Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods . The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine @-@ hardwood forest . 
 The Great Plains region in central Texas is located in spans through the state 's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state 's hill country near Austin . This region is dominated by prairie and steppe . " Far West Texas " or the " Trans @-@ Pecos " region is the state 's Basin and Range Province . The most varied of the regions , this area includes Sand Hills , the Stockton Plateau , desert valleys , wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands . 
 Texas has 3 @,@ 700 named streams and 15 major rivers , with the Rio Grande as the largest . Other major rivers include the Pecos , the Brazos , Colorado , and Red River . While Texas has few natural lakes , Texans have built over 100 artificial reservoirs . 
 The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable ; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state , or both . The vast geographic , economic , and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States . Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South , to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains , which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico . The continental crust forms a stable <unk> craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico . The oldest rocks in Texas date from the <unk> and are about 1 @,@ 600 million years old . 
 These Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state , and are exposed in three places : Llano uplift , Van Horn , and the Franklin Mountains , near El Paso . Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks . The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin , or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time . 
 This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea . This is the buried crest of the Appalachian Mountains – Ouachita Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision . This orogenic crest is today buried beneath the Dallas – Waco — Austin – San Antonio trend . 
 The late Paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the Jurassic period began to open the Gulf of Mexico . Pangea began to break up in the Triassic , but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid and late Jurassic . The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico passive margin began to form . Today 9 to 12 miles ( 14 to 19 km ) of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are located here . At the start of its formation , the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age . These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs , and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast . 
 East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite . The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north ; Permian sediments in the west ; and Cretaceous sediments in the east , along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil . Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area . A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer . Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary , Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes .

At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas . 
 Texas plays host to several species of wasps . Texas is one of the regions that has the highest abundance of Polistes exclamans . Additionally , Texas has provided an important ground for the study of Polistes annularis .

 = = Climate = = 
 The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather . The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas , while the Gulf Coast has mild winters . Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns . El Paso , on the western end of the state , averages 8 @.@ 7 inches ( 220 mm ) of annual rainfall , while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) per year . Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches ( 940 mm ) per year . 
 Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas , once or twice a year in North Texas , and once every few years in Central and East Texas . Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast in rare circumstances only . Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm , when 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville , where the average high temperature in December is 65 ° F. 
 Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s ° F ( 26 ° C ) in the mountains of West Texas and on Galveston Island to around 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) in the Rio Grande Valley , but most areas of Texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) range . 
 Night @-@ time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s ° F ( 14 ° C ) in the West Texas mountains to 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) in Galveston . 
 The table below consists of averages for August ( generally the warmest month ) and January ( generally the coldest ) in selected cities in various regions of the state .

Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in the months of April , May , and June . 
 Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas . A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola , followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town . These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city . The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city , killing about 8 @,@ 000 people or possibly as many as 12 @,@ 000 . This makes it the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history . 
 Other devastating Texas hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston hurricane , Hurricane Audrey in 1957 which killed over 600 people , Hurricane Carla in 1961 , Hurricane Beulah in 1967 , Hurricane Alicia in 1983 , Hurricane Rita in 2005 , and Hurricane Ike in 2008 .

 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ European era = = = 
 Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre @-@ Columbian North America : the Southwestern and the Plains areas . Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory , and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact . These were : 
 the Pueblo from the upper Rio Grande region , centered west of Texas ; 
 the Mississippian culture , also known as Mound Builders , which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas ; and 
 the civilizations of Mesoamerica , centered south of Texas . Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries . 
 No culture was dominant in the present @-@ day Texas region , and many peoples inhabited the area . Native American tribes that lived inside the boundaries of present @-@ day Texas include the Alabama , Apache , Atakapan , Bidai , Caddo , Coahuiltecan , Comanche , Choctaw , Coushatta , Hasinai , Jumano , Karankawa , Kickapoo , Kiowa , Tonkawa , and Wichita . The name Texas derives from <unk> , a word in the <unk> language of the Hasinai , which means " friends " or " allies " . 
 Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land . Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops , prepare foods , and hunt wild game . <unk> tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers . 
 = = = Colonization = = = 
 The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast , created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda . Nine years later , shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas . Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528 , when the Spanish landed in the area , " half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us . " Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the <unk> Natives of Texas : " They went about with a firebrand , setting fire to the plains and timber so as to drive off the mosquitos , and also to get lizards and similar things which they eat , to come out of the soil . In the same manner they kill deer , encircling them with fires , and they do it also to deprive the animals of pasture , compelling them to go for food where the Indians want . " 
 Francisco Vázquez de Coronado describes his 1541 encounter with " Two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows ; one is called <unk> and the others <unk> ; they are very well built , and painted , and are enemies of each other . They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows . They kill all of these they wish , and tan the hides , with which they clothe themselves and make their tents , and they eat the flesh , sometimes even raw , and they also even drink the blood when thirsty . The tents they make are like field tents , and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose , which come together and are tied at the top , and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have , of which they have many , and they load them with the tents and poles and other things , for the country is so level , as I said , that they can make use of these , because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground . The sun is what they worship most . " 
 European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685 . <unk> by René @-@ Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River . The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives . 
 In 1690 Spanish authorities , concerned that France posed competitive threat , constructed several missions in East Texas . After Native American resistance , the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico . When France began settling Louisiana , mostly in the southern part of the state , in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas . Two years later , they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area . 
 Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area . It was one of New Spain 's least populated provinces . In 1749 , the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes , including the Comanche , Tonkawa , and Hasinai . The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes . With more numerous missions being established , priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes . By the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity . 
 When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803 , American authorities insisted that the agreement also included Texas . The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819 , at what is now the border between Texas and Louisiana . Eager for new land , many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement . Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River . In 1821 , the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory , which became part of Mexico . Due to its low population , Mexico made the area part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas . 
 Hoping that more settlers would reduce the near @-@ constant Comanche raids , Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain . Under the Mexican immigration system , large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios , who recruited settlers from the United States , Europe , and the Mexican interior . The first grant , to Moses Austin , was passed to his son Stephen F. Austin after his death . 
 Austin 's settlers , the Old Three Hundred , made places along the Brazos River in 1822 . Twenty @-@ three other empresarios brought settlers to the state , the majority of whom were from the United States . The population of Texas grew rapidly . In 1825 , Texas had about 3 @,@ 500 people , with most of Mexican descent . By 1834 , the population had grown to about 37 @,@ 800 people , with only 7 @,@ 800 of Mexican descent . 
 Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law , especially the prohibition against slavery . Combined with United States ' attempts to purchase Texas , Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States . New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering both native Mexican citizens ( Tejanos ) and recent immigrants . 
 The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation 's president . Texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas . They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom . Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood , among other issues . The following year , Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833 . 
 = = = Republic = = = 
 Within Mexico , tensions continued between federalists and centralists . In early 1835 , wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety . The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales . This launched the Texas Revolution , and over the next two months , the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region . Texians elected delegates to the Consultation , which created a provisional government . The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting , and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836 . 
 During this time of political turmoil , Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt . The Mexican expedition was initially successful . General José de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre . Santa Anna 's forces , after a thirteen @-@ day siege , overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo . News of the defeats sparked panic amongst Texas settlers . 
 The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2 , forming the Republic of Texas . After electing interim officers , the Convention disbanded . The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape , fleeing from the approaching Mexican army . After several weeks of retreat , the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated Santa Anna 's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto . Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco , ending the war . 
 While Texas had won its independence , political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic . The nationalist faction , led by Mirabeau B. Lamar , advocated the continued independence of Texas , the expulsion of the Native Americans , and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean . Their opponents , led by Sam Houston , advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co @-@ existence with Native Americans . The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War . 
 Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in 1842 . The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson massacre . Despite these successes , Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas , and the republic survived . The republic 's inability to defend itself added momentum to Texas 's eventual annexation into the United States . 
 = = = Statehood = = = 
 As early as 1837 , the Republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the United States . Opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction , along with strong abolitionist opposition within the United States , slowed Texas 's admission into the Union . Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk won the election of 1844 . On December 29 , 1845 , Congress admitted Texas to the U.S. as a constituent state of the Union . 
 After Texas 's annexation , Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States . While the United States claimed that Texas 's border stretched to the Rio Grande , Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River . While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims , the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so . President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13 , 1846 . A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican – American War . The first battles of the war were fought in Texas : the Siege of Fort Texas , Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma . After these decisive victories , the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas . 
 After a series of United States victories , the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two @-@ year war . In return , for US $ 18 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 , Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas , ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848 , most of which today is called the American Southwest , and Texas 's borders were established at the Rio Grande . 
 The Compromise of 1850 set Texas 's boundaries at their present form . U.S. Senator James Pearce of Maryland drafted the final proposal where Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present @-@ day New Mexico , a third of Colorado , and small portions of Kansas , Oklahoma , and Wyoming to the federal government , in return for the assumption of $ 10 million of the old republic 's debt . Post @-@ war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state . 
 They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans , whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 , from 58 @,@ 000 to 182 @,@ 566 . 
 = = = Civil War and Reconstruction ( 1860 – 1900 ) = = = 
 Texas was at war again after the election of 1860 . At this time , blacks comprised 30 percent of the state 's population , and they were overwhelmingly enslaved . When Abraham Lincoln was elected , South Carolina seceded from the Union . Five other Lower South states quickly followed . A State Convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28 , 1861 . On February 1 , by a vote of 166 – 8 , the Convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession from the United States . Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23 , 1861 . Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4 , 1861 ratifying the permanent C.S. Constitution on March 23 . 
 Not all Texans favored secession initially , although many of the same would later support the Southern cause . Texas 's most notable Unionist was the state Governor , Sam Houston . Not wanting to aggravate the situation , Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office . After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy , Houston was deposed as governor . 
 While far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War , Texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the Confederacy . Union troops briefly occupied the state 's primary port , Galveston . Texas 's border with Mexico was known as the " backdoor of the Confederacy " because trade occurred at the border , bypassing the Union blockade . The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route , but Texas 's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid @-@ 1863 after the Union capture of the Mississippi River . The final battle of the Civil War was fought near Brownsville , Texas at Palmito Ranch with a Confederate victory . 
 Texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger . Violence marked the early months of Reconstruction . Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger , almost two and a half years after the original announcement . President Johnson , in 1866 , declared the civilian government restored in Texas . Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements , Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870 . Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues . 
 = = = 20th century to present = = = 
 In 1900 , Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the Galveston hurricane . On January 10 , 1901 , the first major oil well in Texas , Spindletop , was found south of Beaumont . Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas , West Texas , and under the Gulf of Mexico . The resulting " oil boom " transformed Texas . Oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972 . 
 In 1901 , the Democratic @-@ dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting , which effectively disenfranchised most blacks , and many poor whites and Latinos . In addition , the legislature established white primaries , ensuring that minorities were excluded from the formal political process . The number of voters dropped dramatically , and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties . 
 The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state 's economy , which had significantly improved since the Civil War . Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years . Especially from this period on , blacks left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation . In 1940 , Texas was 74 percent Anglo , 14 @.@ 4 percent black , and 11 @.@ 5 percent Hispanic . 
 World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas , as federal money poured in to build military bases , munitions factories , POW detention camps and Army hospitals ; 750 @,@ 000 young men left for service ; the cities exploded with new industry ; the colleges took on new roles ; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better paying war jobs , never to return to agriculture . Texas manufactured 3 @.@ 1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II , ranking eleventh among the 48 states . 
 Texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s . The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education , funded in large part by oil revenues , and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently . These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds . 
 On November 22 , 1963 , President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas . 
 On 18 April 2016 , Houston experienced severe flooding . 
 On 31 May 2016 , several cities experienced record setting flooding

 The current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876 . Like many states , it explicitly provides for a separation of powers . The state 's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart , and has provisions unique to Texas . 
 = = = State government = = = 
 Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor , which is a weak executive compared to some other states . Except for the Secretary of State , voters elect executive officers independently ; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public , not the governor . This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program . When Republican President George W. Bush served as Texas 's governor , the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor , Bob Bullock . The executive branch positions consist of the Governor , Lieutenant Governor , Comptroller of Public Accounts , Land Commissioner , Attorney General , Agriculture Commissioner , the three @-@ member Texas Railroad Commission , the State Board of Education , and the Secretary of State . 
 The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives , with 150 members , and a Senate , with 31 members . The Speaker of the House leads the House , and the lieutenant governor , the Senate . The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days , but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired ( notably , the Legislature cannot call itself into session ) . The state 's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year 's September 1 to the current year 's August 31 . Thus , the FY 2015 dates from September 1 , 2014 through August 31 , 2015 . 
 The judiciary of Texas is one of the most complex in the United States , with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions . Texas has two courts of last resort : the Texas Supreme Court , for civil cases , and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals . Except for some municipal benches , partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary ; the governor fills vacancies by appointment . Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment , having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the Gregg v. Georgia case ( see Capital punishment in Texas ) . 
 The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction . Over the years , the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption . They have acted as riot police and as detectives , protected the Texas governor , tracked down fugitives , and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state . The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835 . The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history and some of the best @-@ known criminal cases in the history of the Old West . 
 The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments , which serve as agents of the state . What are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm . Most cities in the state , those over 5 @,@ 000 in population , have home @-@ rule governments . The vast majority of these have charters for council @-@ manager forms of government , by which voters elect council members , who hire a professional city manager as operating officer . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 In the 1870s , white Democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction . In the early 20th century , the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes , followed by white primaries ; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks , poor whites and Mexican Americans . In the 1890s , 100 @,@ 000 blacks voted in the state ; by 1906 , only 5 @,@ 000 could vote . As a result , the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century , imposing racial segregation and white supremacy . It held power until after passage in the mid @-@ 1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens . 
 The state 's conservative white voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid @-@ 20th century . After this period , they supported Republicans for local and state offices as well , and most whites have become Republican Party members . The party has attracted some minorities , but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates . 
 Texas voters lean toward fiscal conservatism conservatism , while enjoying the benefits of huge federal investment in the state in military and other facilities achieved by the power of the Solid South in the 20th century . They also support social conservatism . 
 Since 1980 , most Texas voters have supported Republican presidential candidates . In 2000 and 2004 , Republican George W. Bush won Texas with 60 @.@ 1 percent of the vote , partly due to his " favorite son " status as a former governor of the state . John McCain won the state in 2008 , but with a smaller margin of victory compared to Bush at 55 percent of the vote . Austin , Dallas , Houston , and San Antonio consistently lean Democratic in both local and statewide elections . 
 Residents of counties along the Rio Grande closer to the Mexico @-@ United States border , where there are many Latino residents , generally vote for Democratic Party candidates , while most other rural and suburban areas of Texas have shifted to voting for Republican Party candidates . 
 The 2003 Texas redistricting of Congressional districts led by Republican Tom DeLay , was called by the New York Times " an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering " . A group of Democratic legislators , the " Texas Eleven " , fled the state in a quorum @-@ busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting , but was unsuccessful . The state had already redistricted following the 2000 census . Despite these efforts , the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of Republicans , based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since that date . Career attorneys and analysts at the Department of Justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of African American and Hispanic voters , but political appointees overrode them and approved it . Legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national Supreme Court in the case League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry ( 2006 ) , but the court ruled in favor of the state ( and Republicans ) . 
 As of the general elections of 2014 , a large majority of the members of Texas 's U.S. House delegation are Republican , along with both U.S. Senators . In the 114th United States Congress , of the 36 Congressional districts in Texas , 25 are held by Republicans and 11 by Democrats . Texas 's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz . Since 1994 , Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office . The state 's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin , San Antonio , Dallas , Houston , Beaumont , and El Paso , as well as minority voters in East Texas and South Texas . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Texas has 254 counties — the most nationwide . Each county runs on Commissioners ' Court system consisting of four elected commissioners ( one from each of four precincts in the county , roughly divided according to population ) and a county judge elected at large from the entire county . County government runs similar to a " weak " mayor @-@ council system ; the county judge has no veto authority , but votes along with the other commissioners . 
 Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter " <unk> agreements " to share services , the state does not allow consolidated city @-@ county governments , nor does it have metropolitan governments . Counties are not granted home rule status ; their powers are strictly defined by state law . The state does not have townships — areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated . Incorporated areas are part of a municipality . The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas . Municipalities are classified either " general law " cities or " home rule " . A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5 @,@ 000 population with voter approval . 
 Texas also permits the creation of " special districts " , which provide limited services . The most common is the school district , but can also include hospital districts , community college districts , and utility districts ( one utility district located near Austin was the plaintiff in a landmark Supreme Court case involving the Voting Rights Act ) . 
 Municipal , school district , and special district elections are nonpartisan , though the party affiliation of a candidate may be well @-@ known . County and state elections are partisan . 
 = = = Criminal law = = = 
 Texas has a reputation of very harsh criminal punishment for criminal offenses . It is one of the 32 states that practice capital punishment , and since the US Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976 , 40 % of all US executions have taken place in Texas . As of 2008 , Texas had the 4th highest incarceration rate in the US . Texas also has strong self defense laws , allowing citizens to use lethal force to defend themselves , their families , or their property . 
 = = Economy = = 
 As of 2014 , Texas had a gross state product ( GSP ) of $ 1 @.@ 648 trillion , the second highest in the U.S. Its GSP is greater than the GDPs of Australia and South Korea , which are the world 's 12th- and 13th @-@ largest economies , respectively . Texas ' economy is the fourth @-@ largest of any country subdivision globally , behind England ( as part of the UK ) , California , and Tokyo Prefecture . Its Per Capita personal income in 2009 was $ 36 @,@ 484 , ranking 29th in the nation . 
 Texas 's large population , abundance of natural resources , thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy . Since oil was discovered , the state 's economy has reflected the state of the petroleum industry . In recent times , urban centers of the state have increased in size , containing two @-@ thirds of the population in 2005 . The state 's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms . 
 As of April 2013 , the state 's unemployment rate is 6 @.@ 4 percent . 
 In 2010 , Site Selection Magazine ranked Texas as the most business @-@ friendly state in the nation , in part because of the state 's three @-@ billion @-@ dollar Texas Enterprise Fund .

According to the Tax Foundation , Texans ' state and local tax burdens rank among the lowest in the nation , 7th lowest nationally ; state and local taxes cost $ 3 @,@ 580 per capita , or 8 @.@ 4 percent of resident incomes . Texas is one of seven states that lack a state income tax . 
 Instead , the state collects revenue from property taxes ( though these are collected at the county , city , and school district level ; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax ) and sales taxes . The state sales tax rate is 6 @.@ 25 percent , but local taxing jurisdictions ( cities , counties , special purpose districts , and transit authorities ) may also impose sales and use tax up to 2 percent for a total maximum combined rate of 8 @.@ 25 percent . 
 Texas is a " tax donor state " ; in 2005 , for every dollar Texans paid to the federal government in federal income taxes , the state got back about $ 0 @.@ 94 in benefits . To attract business , Texas has incentive programs worth $ 19 billion per year ( 2012 ) ; more than any other US state .

 = = = Energy = = = 
 Ever since the discovery of oil at Spindletop , energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state . If Texas were its own country it would be the sixth largest oil producer in the world . 
 The Railroad Commission of Texas , contrary to its name , regulates the state 's oil and gas industry , gas utilities , pipeline safety , safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry , and surface coal and uranium mining . Until the 1970s , the commission controlled the price of petroleum because of its ability to regulate Texas 's oil reserves . The founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) used the Texas agency as one of their models for petroleum price control . 
 Texas has known petroleum deposits of about 5 billion barrels ( 790 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) , which makes up about one @-@ fourth of the known U.S. reserves . The state 's refineries can process 4 @.@ 6 million barrels ( 730 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil a day . The Baytown Refinery in the Houston area is the largest refinery in America .

 = = Culture = = 
 Historically , Texas culture comes from a blend of Southern ( Dixie ) , Western ( frontier ) , and Southwestern ( Mexican / Anglo fusion ) influences , varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another . A popular food item , the breakfast burrito , draws from all three , having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot , cooked fillings . Adding to Texas 's traditional culture , established in the 18th and 19th centuries , immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world . East Texas and the Gulf Coastal Plains regions near the Louisiana border have a Cajun / Creole influence . 
 Texas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture . The state is strongly associated with the image of the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music . The state 's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series Dallas . 
 The internationally known slogan " Don 't Mess with Texas " began as an anti @-@ littering advertisement . Since the campaign 's inception in 1986 , the phrase has become " an identity statement , a declaration of Texas swagger " .

 Texas @-@ sized is an expression that can be used in two ways : to describe something that is about the size of the U.S. state of Texas , or to describe something ( usually but not always originating from Texas ) that is large compared to other objects of its type . Texas was the largest U.S. state , until Alaska became a state in 1959 . The phrase , " everything is bigger in Texas , " has been in regular use since at least 1950 ; and was used as early as 1913 .

 The second president of the Republic of Texas , Mirabeau B. Lamar , is the Father of Texas Education . During his term , the state set aside three leagues of land in each county for equipping public schools . An additional 50 leagues of land set aside for the support of two universities would later become the basis of the state 's Permanent University Fund . Lamar 's actions set the foundation for a Texas @-@ wide public school system . 
 Between 2006 and 2007 , Texas spent $ 7 @,@ 275 per pupil ranking it below the national average of $ 9 @,@ 389 . The pupil / teacher ratio was 14 @.@ 9 , below the national average of 15 @.@ 3 .

 Thirty @-@ six ( 36 ) separate and distinct public universities exist in Texas , of which 32 belong to one of the six state university systems . Discovery of minerals on Permanent University Fund land , particularly oil , has helped fund the rapid growth of the state 's two largest university systems : The University of Texas System and the Texas A & M System . The four other university systems : the University of Houston System , the University of North Texas System , the Texas State System , and the Texas Tech System are not funded by the Permanent University Fund . 
 The Carnegie Foundation classifies three of Texas 's universities as Tier One research institutions : The University of Texas at Austin , the Texas A & M University , and the University of Houston . The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M University are flagship universities of the state of Texas . Both were established by the Texas Constitution and hold stakes in the Permanent University Fund . The state has been putting effort to expand the number of flagship universities by elevating some of its seven institutions designated as " emerging research universities . " The two that are expected to emerge first are the University of Houston and Texas Tech University , likely in that order according to discussions on the House floor of the 82nd Texas Legislature . 
 The state is home to various private institutions of higher learning — ranging from liberal arts colleges to a nationally recognized top @-@ tier research university . Rice University in Houston is one of the leading teaching and research universities of the United States and is ranked the nation 's 17th @-@ best overall university by U.S. News & World Report .

 Texans have historically had difficulties traversing Texas due to the state 's large size and rough terrain . Texas has compensated by building both America 's largest highway and railway systems in length . The regulatory authority , the Texas Department of Transportation ( TxDOT ) maintains the state 's immense highway system , regulates aviation , and public transportation systems . 
 Located centrally in North America , the state is an important transportation hub . From the Dallas / Fort Worth area , trucks can reach 93 percent of the nation 's population within 48 hours , and 37 percent within 24 hours .

 = = = Railroads = = = 
 Part of the state 's tradition of cowboys is derived from the massive cattle drives which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to drive livestock to railroads and markets in Kansas , for shipment to the East . Towns along the way , such as Baxter Springs , the first cow town in Kansas , developed to handle the seasonal workers and tens of thousands of head of cattle being driven . 
 The first railroad to operate in Texas was the Buffalo Bayou , Brazos and Colorado Railway , opening in August 1853 . The first railroad to enter Texas from the north , completed in 1872 , was the Missouri – Kansas – Texas Railroad . With increasing railroad access , the ranchers did not have to take their livestock up to the Midwest , and shipped beef out from Texas . This caused a decline in the economies of the cow towns . 
 Since 1911 , Texas has led the nation in length of railroad miles within the state . Texas railway length peaked in 1932 at 17 @,@ 078 miles ( 27 @,@ 484 km ) , but declined to 14 @,@ 006 miles ( 22 @,@ 540 km ) by 2000 . While the Railroad Commission of Texas originally regulated state railroads , in 2005 the state reassigned these duties to TxDOT . 
 Both Dallas and Houston feature light rail systems . Dallas Area Rapid Transit ( DART ) built the first light rail system in the Southwest United States , completed in 1996 . The Trinity Railway Express ( TRE ) commuter rail service , which connects Fort Worth and Dallas , is provided by the Fort Worth Transportation Authority ( the T ) and DART . In the Austin area , Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates a commuter rail service known as Capital MetroRail to the northwestern suburbs . The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County , Texas ( METRO ) operates light rail lines in the Houston area . 
 Amtrak provides Texas with limited intercity passenger rail service .

 While American football has long been considered " king " in the state , Texans today enjoy a wide variety of sports . 
 Texans can cheer for a plethora of professional sports teams . Within the " Big Four " professional leagues , Texas has two NFL teams ( the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans ) , two Major League Baseball teams ( the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros ) , three NBA teams ( the Houston Rockets , the San Antonio Spurs , and the Dallas Mavericks ) , and one National Hockey League team ( the Dallas Stars ) . The Dallas – Fort Worth Metroplex is one of only twelve American metropolitan areas that hosts sports teams from all the " Big Four " professional leagues . Outside of the " Big Four " leagues , Texas also has one WNBA team ( the San Antonio Stars ) and two Major League Soccer teams ( the Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas ) . 
 Collegiate athletics have deep significance in Texas culture , especially football . The state has ten Division I @-@ FBS schools , the most in the nation . Four of the state 's universities , the Baylor Bears , Texas Longhorns , TCU Horned Frogs , and Texas Tech Red Raiders , compete in the Big 12 Conference . The Texas A & M Aggies left the Big 12 and joined the Southeastern Conference in 2012 , which led the Big 12 to invite TCU to join ; TCU was previously in the Mountain West Conference . The Houston Cougars and the SMU Mustangs compete in the American Athletic Conference . The Texas State Bobcats and the UT Arlington Mavericks compete in the Sun Belt Conference . Four of the state 's schools claim at least one national championship in football : the Texas Longhorns , the Texas A & M Aggies , the TCU Horned Frogs , and the SMU Mustangs . 
 According to a survey of Division I @-@ A coaches the rivalry between the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas at Austin , the Red River Shootout , ranks the third best in the nation . The TCU Horned Frogs and SMU Mustangs also share a rivalry and compete annually in the Battle for the Iron Skillet . A fierce rivalry , the Lone Star Showdown , also exists between the state 's two largest universities , Texas A & M University and the University of Texas at Austin . The athletics portion of the Lone Star Showdown rivalry has been put on hold after the Texas A & M Aggies joined the Southeastern Conference . 
 The University Interscholastic League ( UIL ) organizes most primary and secondary school competitions . Events organized by UIL include contests in athletics ( the most popular being high school football ) as well as artistic and academic subjects . 
 Texans also enjoy the rodeo . The world 's first rodeo was hosted in Pecos , Texas . The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest rodeo in the world . It begins with trail rides that originate from several points throughout the state that convene at Reliant Park . The Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth is the oldest continuously running rodeo incorporating many of the state 's most historic traditions into its annual events . Dallas hosts the State Fair of Texas each year at Fair Park .

 = Fanno Creek = 
 Fanno Creek is a 15 @-@ mile ( 24 km ) tributary of the Tualatin River in the U.S. state of Oregon . Part of the drainage basin of the Columbia River , its watershed covers about 32 square miles ( 83 km2 ) in Multnomah , Washington , and Clackamas counties , including about 7 square miles ( 18 km2 ) within the Portland city limits . 
 From its headwaters in the Tualatin Mountains ( West Hills ) in southwest Portland , the creek flows generally west and south through the cities of Portland , Beaverton , Tigard and Durham , and unincorporated areas of Washington County . It enters the Tualatin River about 9 miles ( 14 km ) above the Tualatin 's confluence with the Willamette River at West Linn . 
 When settlers of European origin arrived , the Kalapuya lived in the area , having displaced the Multnomahs in pre @-@ contact times . The first settler of European descent , Augustus Fanno , for whom the creek is named , arrived in the mid @-@ 19th century . He established an onion farm in what became Beaverton . Fanno Farmhouse , the restored family home , is a Century Farm on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of 16 urban parks in a narrow corridor along the creek . 
 Although heavily polluted , the creek supports aquatic life , including coastal cutthroat trout ( leopard spotted ) in its upper reaches . Watershed councils such as the Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in riparian zones .

 Fanno Creek arises at an elevation of 478 feet ( 146 m ) above sea level and falls 370 feet ( 110 m ) between source and mouth to an elevation of 108 feet ( 33 m ) . The main stem begins at about river mile ( RM ) 15 or river kilometer ( RK ) 24 in the Hillsdale neighborhood of southwest Portland , in Multnomah County . The creek flows west along the north side of Oregon Route 10 ( the Beaverton – Hillsdale Highway ) , passing Albert Kelly Park and receiving Ivey Creek and <unk> Creek on the right before reaching the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) stream gauge at Southwest 56th Avenue 11 @.@ 9 miles ( 19 @.@ 2 km ) from the mouth . Shortly thereafter and in quick succession , it enters Washington County and the unincorporated community of Raleigh Hills , crosses under Route 10 , and receives Sylvan Creek on the right . Here the stream turns south , passing through Bauman Park , where Vermont Creek enters on the left about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the mouth , and then southwest to flow through the Portland Golf Club and Vista Brook Park , where Woods Creek enters on the left . From here it flows west again for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , passing through Fanno Creek Trail Park and entering Beaverton about 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the mouth before turning sharply south and flowing under Oregon Route 217 ( Beaverton – Tigard Highway ) . 
 Fanno Creek then flows roughly parallel to Route 217 for about 2 miles ( 3 km ) through Fanno Creek Park and Greenway Park . Near the southern end of Greenway Park , the creek passes under Oregon Route 210 ( Scholls Ferry Road ) , and enters Tigard about 5 miles ( 8 km ) from the mouth . In quick succession , <unk> Creek enters on the right , Ash Creek on the left , and Summer Creek on the right before the creek reaches Woodard Park , goes under Oregon Route 99W ( Southwest Pacific Highway ) , and flows through Fanno Park and Bonita Park as well as residential neighborhoods . Between the two parks , Red Rock Creek enters on the left about 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) from the mouth . Slightly downstream of Bonita Park , Ball Creek enters on the left . Fanno Creek then enters Durham , passes a USGS gauging station 1 @.@ 13 miles ( 1 @.@ 82 km ) from the mouth , flows through Durham City Park , and empties into the Tualatin River 9 @.@ 3 miles ( 15 @.@ 0 km ) from its confluence with the Willamette River .

The average flow of the creek at the Durham station is 43 @.@ 9 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 24 m3 / s ) . This is from a drainage area of 31 @.@ 5 square miles ( 81 @.@ 6 km2 ) , more than 99 percent of the total Fanno Creek watershed .

 Draining 31 @.@ 7 square miles ( 82 @.@ 1 km2 ) , Fanno Creek receives water from Portland 's West Hills , Sexton Mountain in Beaverton , and Bull Mountain near Tigard . Nearly all of the watershed is urban . About 7 square miles ( 18 km2 ) , roughly 22 percent of the total , lies inside the Portland city limits . The highest elevation in the watershed is 1 @,@ 060 feet ( 320 m ) at Council Crest in the West Hills . The peak elevation on Sexton Mountain is 476 feet ( 145 m ) , while Bull Mountain rises to 715 feet ( 218 m ) . About 117 miles ( 188 km ) of streams flow through the watershed , including Ash Creek , Summer Creek , and 12 smaller tributaries . A small part of the drainage basin lies in the city of Lake Oswego in Clackamas County , near the headwaters of Ball Creek , a Fanno Creek tributary . 
 The slopes at the headwaters of Fanno Creek consist mainly of Columbia River Basalt exposed in ravines but otherwise covered by up to 25 feet ( 8 m ) of wind @-@ deposited silt . <unk> and clays are the most common watershed soils , and significant erosion is common . About 50 inches ( 1 @,@ 300 mm ) of precipitation , almost all of which is rain and about half of which arrives in November , December , and January , falls on the watershed each year . Although significant flooding occurred in 1977 , the watershed has not experienced a 100 @-@ year flood since the area became urban . 
 Small watersheds adjacent to the Fanno Creek watershed include those of minor tributaries of the Willamette or Tualatin rivers . Tryon Creek , Balch Creek , and other small streams east of Fanno Creek flow down the eastern flank of the West Hills into the Willamette . To the northwest , Hall Creek , Cedar Mill Creek , and Bronson Creek flow into Beaverton Creek , a tributary of Rock Creek , which empties into the Tualatin River at the larger stream 's RM 38 @.@ 4 ( RK 61 @.@ 8 ) , about 29 miles ( 47 km ) upriver from the mouth of Fanno Creek . 
 = = = Annual report card = = = 
 In 2015 , Portland 's Bureau of Environmental Services ( BES ) began issuing annual " report cards " for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city . BES assigns grades for each of four categories : hydrology , water quality , habitat , and fish and wildlife . Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and the degree to which its streams flow freely , not dammed or diverted . Water @-@ quality grades are based on measurements of dissolved oxygen , E @-@ coli bacteria , temperature , suspended solids , and substances such as mercury and phosphorus . Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains , riparian zones , tree canopies , and other variables . The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds , fish , and macroinvertebrates . In 2015 , the BES grades for the Fanno Creek watershed fraction within Portland are hydrology , C ; water quality , C + ; habitat , B − , and fish and wildlife , D − . 
 = = History = = 
 The previous people of the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or <unk> tribe of the Kalapuya , said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants , the Multnomahs , prior to European contact . The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning , with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks . The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish , to hunt small animals , birds , waterfowl , deer , and elk , and to gather nuts , seeds , roots , and berries . Important foods included camas and wapato . In addition to fishing for eels , suckers , and trout , the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls . During the winter , the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages . Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th century with Europeans , who carried malaria , smallpox , measles , and other diseases . Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land , regarded it as private property , and sometimes punished natives for trespassing . Of the original population of 1 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 000 Atfalati reported in 1780 , only 65 remained in 1851 . In 1855 , the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west . 
 Fanno Creek is named after Augustus Fanno , the first European American settler along the creek . In 1847 , he started an onion farm on a 640 @-@ acre ( 260 ha ) donation land claim in what later became part of Beaverton . Other 19th century newcomers along the creek engaged mainly in logging , farming , and dairy farming until the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Oregon Electric Railway lines made the watershed more accessible for urban development around the turn of the 20th century . The Oregon Electric , a 49 @-@ mile ( 79 km ) system built between 1903 and 1915 , ran between downtown Portland and Garden Home in the Fanno Creek watershed , where it split into branches leading to Salem and Forest Grove . The Southern Pacific began running electric passenger trains , known as the Red Electric , in the watershed in 1914 . The company that eventually became Portland General Electric installed electric service in the area , and by 1915 the population of the upper Fanno Creek neighborhoods of Multnomah , Maplewood , Hillsdale , and West Portland Park had grown to 2 @,@ 000 . 
 Passenger service on the Red Electric line ended in 1929 , and the Oregon Electric Railway ceased passenger operations in 1933 . Private autos largely replaced interurban rail service . Oregon Highway 217 between Durham and Beaverton , and Oregon Highway 10 between Beaverton and Portland , follow the creek . Although passenger rail ceased for nearly 80 years , freight trains continued to use the tracks . In 2009 , a new rail passenger service began along a former Oregon Electric line owned by Portland and Western Railroad in Washington County . The Westside Express Service ( WES ) runs 14 @.@ 7 miles ( 23 @.@ 7 km ) between Beaverton on the north and Wilsonville on the south . The middle stretch of this run lies close to the lower 8 miles ( 13 km ) of Fanno Creek between Beaverton and Durham . WES is the first modern commuter rail in Oregon and one of the few suburb @-@ to @-@ suburb commuter rail lines in the United States . At the northern end of the line , WES connects to the MAX Blue Line , an east @-@ west light rail line linking Hillsboro and Gresham via Portland and the MAX Red Line , with connections to Portland International Airport . 
 The highways and railroads serve a population that increased most dramatically in the second half of the 20th century . When Beaverton was incorporated as a city in 1893 , it had a population of 400 . By 2010 , the number had soared to 94 @,@ 000 , although not all of them lived in the watershed . Tigard , which did not exist as a city until 1961 , grew to 49 @,@ 000 by the year 2013 , all in the watershed . The estimated population of the entire watershed reached 123 @,@ 000 just before the 2000 census . Fanno Creek , which had few people living near it until 1850 , " is surrounded by the most populous region in Oregon " .

 Although the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) rated the average water quality of Fanno Creek as " very poor " between 1986 and 1995 , it also noted steady improvement over that span . Historically , Fanno Creek has been polluted by urban and industrial sources , small sewage treatment plants , ineffective septic systems , farming and grazing operations , and illegal dumping . Health and environmental concerns led to the closing of substandard wastewater treatment plants in the 1970s , and urban development reduced the number of farms and farm animals along the creek . A ban in 1991 on phosphate detergents , increased connection to municipal sewers , stormwater management , and greater public awareness helped to reduce urban pollution not coming from point sources , and water quality improved . 
 DEQ monitors Fanno Creek at Bonita Road in Tigard , at about 2 miles ( 3 km ) from the mouth . On the Oregon Water Quality Index ( OWQI ) used by DEQ , water quality scores can vary from 10 ( worst ) to 100 ( ideal ) . The average for Fanno Creek between 1986 and 1995 was 55 but steadily improved to 65 , or " poor " , by the end of the period . By comparison , the average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years . Measurements of water quality at the Tigard site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of phosphates , fecal coliform bacteria , and suspended solids , and a high biochemical oxygen demand . Moderately high concentrations of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen occurred during high flows during fall , winter , and spring . High temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentration in the summer were evidence of eutrophication . 
 The high fraction of impervious surfaces in the watershed makes it difficult to improve water quality in the creek . The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services estimates that one @-@ third of the surface area of the watershed that lies within its jurisdiction is impervious . All of the roughly 12 square miles ( 31 km2 ) of the surface of Tigard , much of it impervious , drains into Fanno Creek . The watershed watch coordinator for Tualatin <unk> , a volunteer group , was quoted in a July 2008 newspaper article saying that " the biggest impact to Fanno Creek is the impervious area " . To slow run @-@ off , reduce erosion , and keep pollutants out of streams , watershed councils , neighborhood groups , and government agencies have been planting native species of vegetation at selected sites throughout the watershed .

 = = = Fish and wildlife = = = 
 About 100 bird species , several kinds of mammals , and a few fish species live in the watershed . Mammals commonly seen include beaver , raccoon , opossum , spotted skunk , Douglas squirrel , and Townsend 's chipmunk ; black @-@ tail deer and coyotes are more rare . Fanno Creek supports non @-@ migrating coastal cutthroat trout that spawn in the fast @-@ flowing , gravel @-@ bottomed headwaters and grow to as long as 14 inches ( 36 cm ) . Other fish species found in the creek include sculpins , mosquitofish and eel . 
 Beavers , rodents weighing up to 60 pounds ( 27 kg ) , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek . In 2014 and 2015 , a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton . Rising waters have covered one of the side trails in the park , which has been gated and closed . During heavy rains , water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail . Park officials are considering a variety of options , including re @-@ routing the trails , building a boardwalk over the water , or removing the beaver dams . 
 = = = Vegetation = = = 
 The creek begins in the Coast Range ecoregion designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and flows thereafter through the Willamette Valley ecoregion . The narrow riparian corridors along streams in the watershed commonly include native species such as western redcedar , Douglas fir , vine maple , and sword fern as well as invasive species like English ivy . Many red alder and big leaf maple grow in the watershed , and shrubs include red huckleberry , Oregon @-@ grape , elderberry , wood rose , and salmonberry . A restoration project in Tigard along the main stem has removed invasive plants such as reed canary grass and Himalayan blackberry and replaced them with native species . A project in Beaverton is replacing turf and degraded habitat along the creek with native shrubs and trees such as Oregon white oak . 
 The Tualatin <unk> , a nonprofit watershed council based in Tigard ; Clean Water Services , a public utility that protects water resources in the Tualatin River watershed , and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District ( THPRD ) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants , cause erosion , and diminish water quality . The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed , meadow knapweed , giant hogweed , garlic mustard and purple loosestrife . The Oregon Department of Agriculture and the city of Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek .

 Fanno Creek passes through or near 16 parks in several jurisdictions . Portland Parks & Recreation manages three : Hillsdale Park , 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) with picnic tables and a dog park near the headwaters ; Albert Kelly Park , 12 acres ( 4 @.@ 9 ha ) with unpaved paths , picnic tables , play areas , and Wi @-@ Fi north of the creek about 14 miles ( 23 km ) from the mouth , and the Fanno Creek Natural Area , 7 acres ( 2 @.@ 8 ha ) north of the creek about 12 miles ( 19 km ) from the mouth . 
 The Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District ( THPRD ) manages seven Fanno Creek parks in Beaverton and unincorporated Washington County . The district , tax @-@ supported and governed by an elected board , is the largest special park and recreation district in Oregon . The seven include Bauman Park , about 8 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) at about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the mouth . Slightly downstream from Bauman Park are Vista Brook Park , about 4 acres ( 1 @.@ 6 ha ) with trails including one that is accessible to people with physical handicaps , a playground , and courts for basketball and tennis , and Fanno Creek Trail , about 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 8 ha ) , with picnic tables and trails . Other THPRD parks lie along Fanno Creek from roughly 7 miles ( 11 km ) to roughly 5 miles ( 8 km ) from the mouth . These are Fanno Creek Park , about 21 acres ( 8 @.@ 5 ha ) , with trails including one accessible to people with handicaps ; Fanno Farmhouse , about 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 4 ha ) with an accessible trail and picnic tables as well as the Fanno family home , restored by THPRD and listed on the National Register of Historic Places ; Greenway Park , about 87 acres ( 35 ha ) with trails including an accessible trail , picnic tables , a playground , and sports fields , and Koll Center Wetlands , about 13 acres ( 5 @.@ 3 ha ) with wildlife . 
 The five Fanno Creek parks managed by the city of Tigard include Englewood Park , 15 acres ( 6 @.@ 1 ha ) with play structures and trails , including a segment of the Fanno Creek Trail ; Woodard Park , 15 acres ( 6 @.@ 1 ha ) of big trees , trails , and play structures ; Bonita Park , 3 @.@ 5 acres ( 1 @.@ 4 ha ) including a playground and picnic areas ; Dirksen Nature Park , 48 acres ( 19 ha ) of forest , wetlands , and open space , and Fanno Creek Park , a 30 @-@ acre ( 12 ha ) natural area in downtown Tigard . About 20 percent of the small city of Durham is parkland . Surrounded by the larger cities of Tigard and Tualatin , the city covers 265 acres ( 107 ha ) occupied by about 1 @,@ 400 people . Durham City Park , at the confluence of Fanno Creek and the Tualatin River , consists of 46 acres ( 19 ha ) of heavily wooded floodplain with paved trails , children 's play areas , and a picnic shelter . 
 Sections of trail along the main stem of Fanno Creek form part of a planned 15 @-@ mile ( 24 km ) Fanno Creek Greenway Trail linking Willamette Park on the Willamette River in southwest Portland to the confluence of the creek with the Tualatin River in Durham . The trail , for pedestrians and bicyclists , is accessible to people with disabilities . Several unfinished segments remained as of 2013 . 
 = St Mary 's Church , Pentraeth = 
 St Mary 's Church , Pentraeth is a small medieval parish church in the village of Pentraeth , in Anglesey , north Wales . The date of construction is unknown , but is probably from some time between the 12th to 14th centuries . A church dedicated to St Mary was recorded here in 1254 , but there is a tradition that there was an older church dedicated to St Geraint , an early British saint . Some medieval stonework remains in three walls of the building ( the west wall , and parts of the north and south walls ) . A chapel was added to the south side in the 16th or 17th century . The church was altered and refurbished during the 19th century , including an extensive rebuilding by Henry Kennedy , the architect for the Diocese of Bangor , in 1882 . St Mary 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of three churches in a combined parish . Its conservation is specifically included in the aims of a Chester @-@ based charity that promotes health and the arts in Anglesey and the north @-@ west of England . 
 It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because of the retention of medieval fabric in a predominately 19th @-@ century building , and its " fine " memorials . It is built from rubble masonry with a slate roof , and part of a font thought to date from the 12th century has been reused as a water basin in the porch . St Mary 's has a number of memorials from the 18th and 19th centuries , some commemorating residents of a nearby manor house . There was once a tradition of decorating the interior with paper garlands , although writers differ on whether this was to celebrate parishioners ' weddings or to mark the death of unmarried women . It was one of only two churches in Anglesey included by the 18th @-@ century writer Francis Grose in his multi @-@ volume guide to English and Welsh antiquities . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Mary 's Church is in the middle of Pentraeth , Anglesey , about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from the town of Menai Bridge . It is situated at the junction of the <unk> and the <unk> roads . The date of the foundation of the first religious building on this site is unknown . There is a tradition that there was originally a church here dedicated to St Geraint , an early British saint , since the old name for the village was Llanfair @-@ <unk> @-@ Geraint . However , a Pentraeth church dedicated to St Mary was recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 . The present building probably dates from sometime between the 12th and the 14th centuries , with the nave and chancel being medieval in origin . 
 A chapel was added to the south side of the parish church at the end of the 16th century or the early part of the 17th century . A restoration of the interior took place in 1821 with further changes in 1839 . Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor , oversaw a partial but extensive rebuilding in 1882 , which included reconstruction of the east wall and the addition of the porch on the south side . He also added an internal arch to mark the sanctuary as part of rebuilding or extending of the chancel . A reredos and some other fittings were added in the first part of the 20th century . 
 St Mary 's is still in use for worship and belongs to the Church in Wales . It is one of three churches in the combined benefice of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf with Llanbedrgoch with Pentraeth . The church is in the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the position of rector is held by the Venerable R P Davies , Archdeacon of Bangor . 
 The " conservation , protection and improvement " of St Mary 's are included in the aims of the Tyrer Charitable Trust , a Chester @-@ based charity that promotes health and the arts in Anglesey and north @-@ west England ; it is the only church so specified in the charity 's aims and objectives . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church is built from irregularly positioned pieces of rubble masonry , and Kennedy added red sandstone dressings in his 1882 work . The nave measures 50 feet 3 inches long by 17 feet 3 inches wide ( about 15 @.@ 3 by 5 @.@ 3 m ) ; the chancel is the same width , and about 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) long . The chapel is 17 feet by 20 feet 6 inches ( about 5 @.@ 2 by 6 @.@ 25 m ) . There is medieval masonry in three of the walls : the west wall , and the lower parts of the north and south walls . The roof is made of slate , with a stone bellcote containing one bell at the west end . Inside , the wooden trusses of the roof are visible . The trusses were re @-@ used when the roof was reconstructed . The church is entered through a porch on the south side , added in the 19th century , and a Tudor arch doorway ; the porch contains a stone piscina ( a water basin ) , said to be part of a font dating from the 12th century . An old entrance in the north wall of the nave has been blocked up . Two of the three windows in the north wall are from the 19th century . The third , nearest to the east end , is from the early 17th century and has a square frame . The eight @-@ sided font also dates from the 19th century . The 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also recorded the existence of an oak poor box , with iron straps , bearing the date of 1740 , and a plain silver cup from about 1685 . 
 The chancel and the south chapel are each separated from the nave by arches ; the chancel arch , which was added by Kennedy in 1882 , is decorated with carvings of an eagle on one side and a lamb on the other . Steps lead up from the nave to the chancel , with a further step marking the sanctuary . The east window dates from the late 14th or the early 15th century , although it has been rebuilt , with three lights ( vertical sections separated by mullions ) . These are topped with tracery ( decorative stone work ) and cinquefoils ( a five leaf pattern ) . It contains stained glass depicting St Mary and St John , added in 1890 . The east window in the chapel is of similar design to the 17th @-@ century window in the north wall of the nave , and dates from the late 16th or early 17th century ; restoration work has been carried out on it . The south window has a pointed arch with two lights topped by cinquefoils ; it is above a sill for an older window . There is also a window in the west wall of the chapel . 
 St Mary 's contains a number of memorials from the 18th and 19th centuries . Members of the families associated with Plas Gwyn , a nearby manor house , have their memorials in the chapel . John Jones , who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727 , was born at Plas Gwyn , and is commemorated with a stone tablet on the south wall of the chancel . Another native of Pentraeth , the cleric and writer Thomas Owen , who died in 1812 , also has a tablet in the chancel . Charles Vivian , 2nd Baron Vivian ( who died in 1886 ) , and his wife Mary are remembered with a bronze tablet on the east wall of the chapel . There are other memorials on the walls of the chapel and the nave . The south window of the chapel has stained glass in memory of Claud Panton Vivian , of Plas Gwyn , who died at the age of 24 during the Second World War . The churchyard has a number of graves for members of the Vivian family , and their plot contains " four beautifully @-@ carved Celtic crosses . " The churchyard also contains two Commonwealth war graves , of a South Lancashire Regiment soldier of World War I and a Royal Navy sailor of World War II . 
 The church used to be decorated with paper garlands . This tradition was noted in the 18th century , when a writer thought that they symbolised the " <unk> union " ( i.e. marriage ) of parishioners , because the garlands each had a pair of hands in the centre . In 1833 , another writer said that the garlands marked the death of unmarried women , but the tradition was no longer observed . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 , and has been listed because it is " a predominantly late 19th @-@ century church which retains some Medieval fabric " . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes " some fine 18th @-@ century and 19th @-@ century memorials . " 
 The 18th @-@ century writer Francis Grose , who wrote a multi @-@ volume guide to the antiquities of England and Wales , included St Mary 'a in his survey of Anglesey , one of only two churches on the island that he featured ( the other being St Cybi 's , Holyhead ) . He said that this " little edifice is more remarkable for its simplicity , and the beauty of the rural scene by which it is surrounded , than for any matters of antiquity or curiosity in its construction , or contained within its walls " . The Welsh antiquarian Angharad Llwyd and the writer Samuel Lewis ( both writing in the 19th century before the 1882 alterations ) each described St Mary 's as a " small neat edifice " . They particularly noted the internal and external monuments to members of various local families . 
 Writing in 1847 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that St Mary 's was " remarkable for being in one of the sweetest spots in the isle of Anglesey " The interior , he said , was " greatly blocked up with pews " , but was in " excellent repair " , with " a degree of neatness and comfort about it quite unusual in this district . " The roof timbers , he commented , were " closely set together , light in section , but producing a good effect . " The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited a couple of years later , in 1849 . He described St Mary 's as being in a " pretty " situation , " surrounded by trees " . He noted the " fair " east window and the " rude timber framework " of the roof . In 2006 , a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that the red sandstone used in the windows and in the bellcote was showing signs of " severe weathering " in places . 
 = Rainbow trout = 
 The rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) is a trout and species of salmonid native to cold @-@ water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America . The steelhead ( sometimes called " steelhead trout " ) is an anadromous ( sea @-@ run ) form of the coastal rainbow trout ( O. m. irideus ) or Columbia River redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean . Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead . 
 Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb ( 0 @.@ 5 and 2 @.@ 3 kg ) , while lake @-@ dwelling and anadromous forms may reach 20 lb ( 9 kg ) . Coloration varies widely based on subspecies , forms and habitat . Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line , from gills to the tail , which is most vivid in breeding males . 
 Wild @-@ caught and hatchery @-@ reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica . Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States ( U.S. ) , Southern Europe , Australia , New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species . Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them , out @-@ competing them , transmitting contagious diseases ( such as whirling disease ) , or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies , thus reducing genetic purity . Other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created world @-@ class sport fisheries such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming 's Firehole River . 
 Some local populations of specific subspecies , or in the case of steelhead , distinct population segments , are listed as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act . The steelhead is the official state fish of Washington . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The scientific name of the rainbow trout is Oncorhynchus mykiss . The species was originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia . Walbaum 's original species name , mykiss , was derived from the local Kamchatkan name used for the fish , <unk> . The name of the genus is from the Greek <unk> ( " hook " ) and <unk> ( " nose " ) , in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season ( the " kype " ) . 
 Sir John Richardson , a Scottish naturalist , named a specimen of this species Salmo gairdneri in 1836 to honor Meredith Gairdner , a Hudson 's Bay Company surgeon at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River who provided Richardson with specimens . In 1855 , William P. Gibbons , the curator of Geology and Mineralogy at the California Academy of Sciences , found a population and named it Salmo <unk> ( Latin : rainbow ) , later corrected to Salmo irideus . These names faded once it was determined that Walbaum 's description of type specimens was conspecific and therefore had precedence . In 1989 , morphological and genetic studies indicated that trout of the Pacific basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus species ) than to the <unk> – brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) or Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) of the Atlantic basin . Thus , in 1989 , taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow , cutthroat and other Pacific basin trout into the genus Oncorhynchus . Walbaum 's name had precedence , so the species name Oncorhynchus mykiss became the scientific name of the rainbow trout . The previous species names irideus and gairdneri were adopted as subspecies names for the coastal rainbow and Columbia River redband trout , respectively . <unk> forms of the coastal rainbow trout ( O. m. irideus ) or redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) are commonly known as steelhead .

 Resident freshwater rainbow trout adults average between 1 and 5 lb ( 0 @.@ 5 and 2 @.@ 3 kg ) in riverine environments , while lake @-@ dwelling and anadromous forms may reach 20 lb ( 9 kg ) . Coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies . Adult freshwater forms are generally blue @-@ green or olive green with heavy black spotting over the length of the body . Adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line , from gills to the tail , which is most pronounced in breeding males . The caudal fin is squarish and only mildly forked . Lake @-@ dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone . Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks ( dark vertical bars ) typical of most salmonid juveniles . In some redband and golden trout forms parr marks are typically retained into adulthood . Some coastal rainbow trout ( O. m. irideus ) and Columbia River redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) populations and <unk> hybrids may also display reddish or pink throat markings similar to cutthroat trout . In many regions , hatchery @-@ bred trout can be distinguished from native trout via fin clips , 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Rainbow trout , including steelhead forms , generally spawn in early to late spring ( January to June in the Northern Hemisphere and September to November in the Southern Hemisphere ) when water temperatures reach at least 42 to 44 ° F ( 6 to 7 ° C ) . The maximum recorded lifespan for a rainbow trout is 11 years . 
 = = = Freshwater life cycle = = = 
 Freshwater resident rainbow trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large , well oxygenated , shallow rivers with gravel bottoms . They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin , but introduced rainbow trout have established wild , self @-@ sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks . Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep , cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources . Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self @-@ sustaining . 
 Spawning sites are usually a bed of fine gravel in a riffle above a pool . A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down . Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 4 @-@ to @-@ 5 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 16 to 0 @.@ 20 in ) eggs per kilogram of weight . During spawning , the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel , and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest , covering the eggs with the displaced gravel . As eggs are released by the female , a male moves alongside and deposits milt ( sperm ) over the eggs to fertilize them . The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat . Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or <unk> . In approximately two weeks , the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton . The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area , habitat , life history and quality and quantity of food . As fry grow , they begin to develop " parr " marks or dark vertical bars on their sides . In this juvenile stage , immature trout are often called " parr " because of the marks . These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger . In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs , some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or " carryover " for several seasons before they are caught or perish . 
 = = = Steelhead life cycle = = = 
 The oceangoing ( anadromous ) form , including those returning for spawning , are known as steelhead in Canada and the U.S. In Tasmania they are commercially propagated in sea cages and are known as ocean trout , although they are the same species . 
 Like salmon , steelhead return to their original hatching grounds to spawn . Similar to Atlantic salmon , but unlike their Pacific Oncorhynchus salmonid kin , steelhead are iteroparous ( able to spawn several times , each time separated by months ) and make several spawning trips between fresh and salt water , although fewer than 10 percent of native spawning adults survive from one spawning to another . The survival rate for introduced populations in the Great Lakes is as high as 70 percent . As young steelhead transition from freshwater to saltwater , a process called " <unk> " occurs where the trout undergoes physiological changes to allow it to survive in sea water . There are genetic differences between freshwater and steelhead populations that may account for the <unk> in <unk> . 
 Juvenile steelhead may remain in the river for one to three years before <unk> and migrating to sea . Individual steelhead populations leave the ocean and migrate into their freshwater spawning tributaries at different times of the year . Two general forms exist — " summer @-@ run steelhead " and " winter @-@ run steelhead " . Summer @-@ run fish leave the ocean between May and October , before their reproductive organs are fully mature . They mature in fresh water while en route to spawning grounds where they spawn in the spring . Summer @-@ run fish generally spawn in longer , more inland rivers such as the Columbia River . Winter @-@ run fish are ready to spawn when they leave the ocean , typically between November and April , and spawn shortly after returning to fresh water . Winter @-@ run fish generally spawn in shorter , coastal rivers typically found along the Olympic Peninsula and British Columbia coastline , and summer @-@ run fish are found in some shorter , coastal streams . Once steelhead enter riverine systems and reach suitable spawning grounds , they spawn just like resident freshwater rainbow trout . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture . They are not as piscivorous or aggressive as brown trout or <unk> . Rainbow trout , including juvenile steelhead in fresh water , routinely feed on larval , pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects ( typically caddisflies , stoneflies , mayflies and aquatic <unk> ) . They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects ( typically ants , beetles , grasshoppers and crickets ) that fall into the water . Other prey include small fish up to one @-@ third of their length , crayfish , shrimp , and other crustaceans . As rainbow trout grow , the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations . Some lake @-@ dwelling forms may become planktonic feeders . In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species , rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs , including those of salmon , brown and cutthroat trout , mountain whitefish and the eggs of other rainbow trout . Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish . Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish , squid and amphipods . 
 = = Range = = 
 The native range of Oncorhynchus mykiss is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin , from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia , east along the Aleutian Islands , throughout southwest Alaska , the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska , and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico . It is claimed that the Mexican forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss represent the southernmost native range of any trout or salmon ( Salmonidae ) , though the Formosan landlocked salmon ( O. <unk> formosanus ) in Asia inhabits a similar latitude . The range of coastal rainbow trout ( O. m. irideus ) extends north from the Pacific basin into tributaries of the Bering Sea in northwest Alaska , while forms of the Columbia River redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) extend east into the upper Mackenzie River and Peace River watersheds in British Columbia and Alberta , Canada , which eventually drain into the Beaufort Sea , part of the Arctic Ocean . Since 1875 , the rainbow trout has been widely introduced into suitable lacustrine and riverine environments throughout the United States and around the world . Many of these introductions have established wild , self @-@ sustaining populations . 
 = = Artificial propagation = = 
 Since 1870 , rainbow trout have been artificially propagated in fish hatcheries to restock streams and to introduce them into non @-@ native waters . The first rainbow trout hatchery was established on San Leandro Creek , a tributary of San Francisco Bay , in 1870 , and trout production began in 1871 . The hatchery was stocked with the locally native rainbow trout , and likely steelhead of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies ( O. m. irideus ) . The fish raised in this hatchery were shipped to hatcheries out of state for the first time in 1875 , to Caledonia , New York , and then in 1876 to Northville , Michigan . In 1877 , another California rainbow trout hatchery , the first federal fish hatchery in the National Fish Hatchery System , was established on Campbell Creek , a McCloud River tributary . The McCloud River hatchery indiscriminately mixed coastal rainbow trout eggs with the eggs of local McCloud River redband trout ( O. m. <unk> ) . Eggs from the McCloud hatchery were also provided to the San Leandro hatchery , thus making the origin and genetic history of hatchery @-@ bred rainbow trout somewhat diverse and complex . In the U.S. , there are hundreds of hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and various state agencies and tribal governments propagating rainbow trout for conservation and recreational sport fishing . Six of ten Canadian provinces have rainbow trout farms , with Ontario leading production . 
 = = = Aquaculture = = = 
 Rainbow trout are commercially farmed in many countries throughout the world . The practice began in the late 19th century , and since the 1950s commercial production has grown dramatically . Worldwide , in 2007 , 604 @,@ 695 tonnes ( 595 @,@ 145 long tons ; 666 @,@ 562 short tons ) of farmed rainbow trout were harvested with a value of about US $ 2 @.@ 6 billion . The largest producer is Chile . In Chile and Norway , sea cage production of steelhead has expanded to supply export markets . Inland production of rainbow trout to supply domestic markets has increased in countries such as Italy , France , Germany , Denmark and Spain . Other significant trout @-@ producing countries include the U.S. , Iran , the United Kingdom , and Lesotho . While the U.S. rainbow trout industry as a whole is viewed as ecologically responsible , trout raised elsewhere are not necessarily farmed with the same methods . 
 About three @-@ quarters of U.S. production comes from Idaho , particularly the Snake River area , due in part to the quality and temperature of the water available there . California and Washington also produce significant amounts of farmed trout . In the east , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and West Virginia have farming operations . Rainbow trout farming is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where raceways or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape . The U.S. industry is noted for using best management practices . Imports constitute only about 15 percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S. , and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country ; very little is exported . The U.S. produces about 7 percent of the world 's farmed trout . Rainbow trout , especially those raised in farms and hatcheries , are susceptible to enteric redmouth disease . A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease , given its serious implications for rainbow trout farming . The disease does not infect humans . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Populations of many rainbow trout subspecies , including anadromous forms ( steelhead ) of O. m. irideus ( coastal rainbow trout ) and O. m. gairdneri ( Columbia River redband trout ) have declined in their native ranges due to over @-@ harvest , habitat loss , disease , invasive species , pollution and hybridization with other subspecies , and some introduced populations , once healthy , have declined for the same reasons . As a consequence , some rainbow populations , particularly anadromous forms within their native range , have been classified as endangered , threatened or species of special concern by federal or state agencies . Rainbow trout , and subspecies thereof , are currently a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency @-@ approved indicator species for acute fresh water toxicity testing . 
 Many non @-@ profit organizations have formed to protect , conserve and restore native rainbow trout and steelhead populations . Generally , in partnership with various universities , state , federal and tribal agencies and private interests , these organizations sponsor projects to restore habitat , prevent habitat loss and promote awareness of threats to native trout populations . 
 Trout Unlimited ( TU ) is a non @-@ profit organization dedicated to the conservation of North American freshwater streams , rivers , and associated upland habitats for trout , salmon , other aquatic species and people . A typical TU project is the Circle Creek Fish Passage Project , in which access to a spawning stream is being improved for steelhead and other salmonid species . The Wild Salmon Center , an international coalition of Russian , Canadian and U.S. scientists , sponsors the Kamchatka Steelhead Project , a 20 @-@ year ( 1994 – 2014 ) scientific program to study and conserve the present condition of Kamchatkan steelhead ( " <unk> " ) , a species listed in the Red Data Book of Russia . Other high @-@ profile organizations involved in rainbow trout conservation include California Trout , which protects wild trout and other salmonids in the waters of California . The Steelhead Society of British Columbia promotes the wellbeing of wild salmonids in British Columbia . In 1997 , a group of approximately 40 ichthyologists , biologists and naturalists from several U.S. and Mexican institutions formed a collaborative group — <unk> Mexicanas — to study the diversity of Mexican native trout , most of which are considered subspecies of O. mykiss . 
 = = = Hybridization and habitat loss = = = 
 Rainbow trout , primarily hatchery @-@ raised fish of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies ( O. m. irideus ) introduced into waters inhabited with cutthroat trout , will breed with cutthroats and produce fertile hybrids called cutbows . In the case of the westslope cutthroat trout ( O. clarki lewisi ) , hybridization with introduced rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout ( O. clarki <unk> ) is threatening the westslope cutthroat trout with genomic extinction . Such introductions into the ranges of redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri , <unk> , and <unk> ) have severely reduced the range of pure stocks of these subspecies , making them " species of concern " in their respective ranges . 
 Within the range of the Kern River golden trout of Southern California , hatchery @-@ bred rainbows introduced into the Kern River have diluted the genetic purity of the Kern River rainbow trout ( O. m. <unk> ) and golden trout ( O. m. <unk> ) through intraspecific breeding . The Beardslee trout , ( O. m. irideus var. <unk> ) , a genetically unique lake @-@ dwelling variety of the coastal rainbow trout that is isolated in Lake Crescent ( Washington ) , is threatened by the loss of its only spawning grounds in the Lyre River to siltation and other types of habitat degradation . 
 = = = Invasive species and disease = = = 
 Whirling disease 
 Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxosporean parasite of salmonids ( salmon , trout , and their allies ) that causes whirling disease in farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations . It was first described in rainbow trout in Germany a century ago , but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe , northern Asia , the U.S. , South Africa and other countries . In the 1980s , M. cerebralis was found to require Tubifex tubifex ( a kind of segmented worm ) to complete its life cycle . The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst @-@ like capsules . 
 This parasite was originally a mild pathogen of brown trout in central Europe and other salmonids in northeast Asia , and the spread of the rainbow trout has greatly increased its impact . Having no innate immunity to M. cerebralis , rainbow trout are particularly susceptible , and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area , such as Salmo trutta , can become overloaded with parasites and incur mortalities of 80 to 90 percent . Where M. cerebralis has become well @-@ established , it has caused decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish . 
 The parasite M. cerebralis was first recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania , but until the 1990s whirling disease was considered a manageable problem only affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries . It eventually became established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states ( Colorado , Wyoming , Utah , Montana , Idaho , New Mexico ) , where it is damaging several sport fishing rivers . Some streams in the western U.S. lost 90 percent of their trout . Whirling disease threatens recreational fishing , which is important for the tourism industry , a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states . For example , in 2005 anglers in Montana spent approximately $ 196 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in activities directly related to trout fishing in the state . Some of the salmonids that M. cerebralis infects ( bull trout , cutthroat trout , and anadromous forms of rainbow trout — steelhead ) are already threatened or endangered , and the parasite could worsen their population decline . 
 New Zealand mud snail 
 The New Zealand mud snail ( <unk> <unk> ) , once endemic to New Zealand , has spread widely and has become naturalised and an invasive species in many areas including : Australia , Tasmania , Asia ( Japan ) , in the <unk> Ali River in Iraq since 2008 ) , Europe ( since 1859 in England ) , and North America ( U.S. and Canada : Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001 , British Columbia since July 2007 ) , most likely inadvertently during human activity . It can reach concentrations greater than 500 @,@ 000 per m ² , endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food , leading to sharp declines in native populations . There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells of the mud snail , and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout . 
 The mud snail was first detected in the U.S. in Idaho 's Snake River in 1987 . Since then , the snail has spread to the Madison River , Firehole River , and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park , and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of transmission is unknown , but it is likely that it was introduced in water transferred with live game fish and has been spread by ship ballast or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> , commonly known as <unk> or rock snot , is a species of diatom that produces nuisance growths in freshwater rivers and streams with consistently cold water temperatures . In New Zealand , invasive <unk> can form large mats on the bottom of rivers and streams in late winter . It is not considered a significant human health risk , but it can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish , including rainbow trout , and make recreational activities unpleasant . Even though it is native in North America , it is considered a nuisance organism or invasive species . 
 <unk> disease 
 <unk> redmouth disease is a bacterial infection of freshwater and marine fish caused by the pathogen Yersinia <unk> . It is primarily found in rainbow trout and other cultured salmonids . The disease is characterized by subcutaneous hemorrhaging of the mouth , fins , and eyes . It is most commonly seen in fish farms with poor water quality . <unk> disease was first discovered in Idaho rainbow trout in the 1950s . 
 = = = Removal Methods = = = 
 Some fisheries are focused on removing rainbow trout in order to reestablish native trout populations . This can be done by poisoning rivers with chemicals such as <unk> or rotenone which have been declared safe in the USA by the Environmental Protection Agency . Once the chemicals have dissipated native trout are released into the river . Another method is to use electrofishing which enable the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re @-@ located . This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since . They are hoping to re @-@ establish native brook trout in at least some of the 2100 @-@ mile river system . Neither method of control is 100 % effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species . 
 = = = Steelhead declines = = = 
 Steelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes . While populations in Alaska and along the British Columbia coast are considered healthy , populations in Kamchatka and some populations along the U.S. west coast are in decline . The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has 15 identified distinct population segments ( DPS ) s , in Washington , Oregon , and California . Eleven of these <unk> are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act , ten as threatened and one as endangered . One DPS on the Oregon Coast is designated a U.S. Species of Concern . 
 The Southern California DPS , which was listed as endangered in 2011 , has been affected by habitat loss due to dams , confinement of streams in concrete channels , water pollution , groundwater pumping , urban heat island effects , and other byproducts of urbanization . Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula are threatened by over @-@ harvest , particularly from poaching and potential development , and are listed in the Red Data Book of Russia that documents rare and endangered species . 
 = = = = Hatchery stocking influence = = = = 
 Several studies have shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin , despite over a century of hatchery stocking . Genetic analysis shows that the South Central California Coast DPS and Southern California DPS from Malibu Creek north , and including the San Gabriel River , Santa Ana River and San Mateo Creek , are not hatchery strains . Steelhead from Topanga Creek and the Sweetwater River were partly , and those from San Juan Creek completely , of hatchery origin . Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of the Santa Clara County and Monterey Bay basins are not of hatchery origin , including the Coyote Creek , Guadalupe River , Pajaro River , Permanente Creek , Stevens Creek , San Francisquito Creek , San Lorenzo River , and San Tomas Aquino Creek basins . Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated Russian River steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers ; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30 million hatchery trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925 , the steelhead remain of native and not hatchery origin . 
 Releases of conventionally reared hatchery steelhead pose ecological risks to wild steelhead populations . Hatchery steelhead are typically larger than the wild forms and can displace wild @-@ form juveniles from optimal habitats . Dominance of hatchery steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival as a result of reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Fishing = = = 
 Rainbow trout and steelhead are highly regarded game fish . Rainbow trout are a popular target for fly fishers , and several angling methods are used . The use of lures presented via spinning , casting or trolling techniques is common . Rainbow trout can also be caught on various live and dead natural baits . The International Game Fish Association recognizes the world record for rainbow trout as a fish caught on Saskatchewan 's Lake Diefenbaker by Sean Konrad on September 5 , 2009 . The fish weighed 48 lb ( 22 kg ) and was a genetically modified hatchery escapee . Many anglers consider the rainbow trout the hardest @-@ fighting trout species , as this fish is known for leaping when hooked and putting up a powerful struggle . It is considered one of the top five sport fish in North America and the most important game fish west of the Rocky Mountains . 
 There are tribal commercial fisheries for steelhead in Puget Sound , the Washington coast and in the Columbia River , but there has been controversy regarding over @-@ harvesting of native stocks . 
 The highly desirable sporting qualities and adaptability of the rainbow trout to hatchery rearing and new habitats resulted in it being introduced to many countries around the world by or at the behest of sport fishermen . Many of these introductions have resulted in environmental and ecological problems , as the introduced rainbow trout disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete or eat indigenous fishes . Other introductions to support sport angling in waters either devoid of fish or with seriously depleted native stocks have created world @-@ class fisheries such as in the Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park , and in the Great Lakes . 
 = = = As food = = = 
 Rainbow trout is popular in Western cuisine ; both wild @-@ caught and farmed fish are eaten . It has tender flesh and a mild , somewhat nutty flavor . Wild fish has a stronger , <unk> taste than farmed fish . While the taste of wild @-@ caught trout is often promoted as superior , it is illegal to sell or market wild @-@ caught rainbow trout , which are legally classified as game fish , in the United States . Thus , rainbow trout and " steelhead " sold in American restaurants is farmed . Farmed rainbow are considered one of the safest fish to eat and are noted for high levels of vitamin B and a generally appealing flavor . Seafood Watch ranks farmed rainbow as a " Best Choice " fish for human consumption . 
 The color and flavor of the flesh depends on the diet and freshness of the trout . Farmed trout and some populations of wild trout , especially anadromous steelhead , have reddish or orange flesh as a result of high astaxanthin levels in their diets . <unk> is a powerful antioxidant that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed . Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in astaxanthin are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them " steelhead " . As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range , farmed rainbow are viewed as a preferred alternative . In Chile and Norway , rainbow trout farmed in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead . 
 Trout can be cooked as soon as they are cleaned , without scaling , skinning or <unk> . If cooked with the skin on , the meat tends to hold together better . While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way , most trout sold commercially in the U.S. have had heads removed and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted . Medium to heavy bodied white wines , such as chardonnay , <unk> blanc or pinot gris are typical wine pairings for trout . 
 = O Canada = 
 " O Canada " ( French : <unk> Canada ) is the national anthem of Canada . The song was originally commissioned by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Théodore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint @-@ Jean @-@ Baptiste Day ceremony ; Calixa Lavallée composed the music , after which words were written by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe @-@ Basile Routhier . The lyrics were originally in French and an English version was created in 1906 . Robert Stanley Weir wrote in 1908 another English version , which is the official and most popular version , one that is not a literal translation of the French . Weir 's lyrics have been revised twice , taking their present form in 1980 , but the French lyrics remain unaltered . " O Canada " had served as a de facto national anthem since 1939 , officially becoming Canada 's national anthem in 1980 when the Act of Parliament making it so received Royal Assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year 's Dominion Day celebrations . 
 = = Official lyrics = = 
 The Crown @-@ in @-@ Council established set lyrics for " O Canada " in Canada 's two official languages , English and French . The lyrics are as follows : 
 Official bilingual version 
 O Canada ! 
 Our home and native land ! 
 True patriot love in all thy sons command . 
 Car ton bras sait porter l <unk> , 
 Il sait porter la croix ! 
 Ton histoire est une <unk> 
 Des plus <unk> exploits . 
 God keep our land glorious and free ! 
 O Canada , we stand on guard for thee . 
 O Canada , we stand on guard for thee . 
 It has been noted that the opening theme of " O Canada " bears a strong resemblance to the " March of the Priests " from the opera The Magic Flute , composed in 1791 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . The line " The True North strong and free " is based on the Lord Tennyson 's description of Canada as " that true North , whereof we lately heard / A strain to shame us " . In the context of Tennyson 's poem To the Queen , the word true means " loyal " or " faithful " . 
 The lyrics and melody of " O Canada " are both in the public domain , a status unaffected by the trademarking of the phrases " with glowing hearts " and " des plus <unk> exploits " for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . Two provinces have adopted Latin translations of phrases from the English lyrics as their mottos : Manitoba — <unk> et Liber ( Glorious and Free ) — and Alberta — Fortis et Liber ( Strong and Free ) . Similarly , the Canadian Army 's motto is <unk> pro te ( we stand on guard for thee ) . 
 = = = Lyric changes = = = 
 Weir 's original lyrics from 1908 contained no religious references and used the phrase " thou dost in us command " before they were changed by Weir in 1914 to read " in all thy sons command " . In 1926 , a fourth verse of a religious nature was added . 
 In June 1990 , Toronto City Council voted 12 to 7 in favour of recommending to the Canadian government that the phrase " our home and native land " be changed to " our home and cherished land " and that " in all thy sons command " be partly reverted to " in all of us command . " Councillor Howard <unk> said that the words native land were not appropriate for the many Canadians who were not native @-@ born and that the word sons implied " that women can 't feel true patriotism or love for Canada . " Senator Vivienne <unk> similarly criticized the English lyrics of the anthem as being sexist and she introduced a bill in 2002 proposing to change the phrase " in all thy sons command " to " in all of us command . " In the late 2000s , the anthem 's religious references ( to God in English and to the Christian cross in French ) were criticized by secularists . 
 In the Throne Speech delivered by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on March 3 , 2010 , a plan to have parliament review the " original gender @-@ neutral wording of the national anthem " was announced . However , three @-@ quarters of Canadians polled after the speech objected to the proposal and , two days later , the prime minister 's office announced that the Cabinet had decided not to restore the original lyrics . 
 In May 2016 , Liberal MP <unk> <unk> introduced a private member 's Bill C @-@ 210 to change two words in " O Canada " . These proposed changes are said to make the anthem more gender @-@ neutral by changing the words " thy sons " to " of us " . In June 2016 , the bill passed its third reading with a vote of 225 to 74 in the House of Commons . 
 = = History = = 
 The original French lyrics of " O Canada " were written by Sir Adolphe @-@ Basile Routhier , to music composed by Calixa Lavallée , as a French Canadian patriotic song for the Saint @-@ Jean @-@ Baptiste Society and first performed on June 24 , 1880 , at a Saint @-@ Jean @-@ Baptiste Day banquet in Quebec City . At that time , the " Chant National " , also by Routhier , was popular amongst Francophones as an anthem , while " God Save the Queen " and " The Maple Leaf Forever " had , since 1867 , been competing as unofficial national anthems in English Canada . " O Canada " joined that fray when a group of school children sang it for the 1901 tour of Canada by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall ( later King George V and Queen Mary ) . 
 Five years later , the Whaley and Royce company in Toronto , Ontario , published the music with the French text and a first translation into English by Thomas Bedford Richardson and , in 1908 , Collier 's Weekly magazine held a competition to write new English lyrics for " O Canada " . The competition was won by Mercy E. Powell McCulloch , but her version never gained wide acceptance . In fact , many made English translations of Routhier 's words ; however , the most popular version was created in 1908 by Robert Stanley Weir , a lawyer and Recorder of the City of Montreal . A slightly modified version was officially published for the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation in 1927 , and gradually it became the most widely accepted and performed version of this song . 
 The tune was thought to have become the de facto national anthem after King George VI remained at attention during its playing at the dedication of the National War Memorial in Ottawa , Ontario , on May 21 , 1939 ; though George was actually following a precedent set by his brother , Edward , the previous king of Canada , when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936 . Still , by @-@ laws and practices governing the use of song during public events in municipalities varied ; in Toronto , " God Save the Queen " was employed , while in Montreal it was " O Canada " . 
 Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country 's national anthem and the government resolved to form a joint committee to review the status of the two musical works . The next year , Pearson put to the House of Commons a motion that " the government be authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to provide that ' O Canada ' shall be the National Anthem of Canada while ' God Save the Queen ' shall be the Royal Anthem of Canada , " of which parliament approved . In 1967 , the Prime Minister advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems ; the group first met in February and , within two months , on April 12 , 1967 , presented its conclusion that " O Canada " should be designated as the national anthem and " God Save the Queen " as the Royal Anthem of Canada , one verse from each , in both official languages , to be adopted by parliament . The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song . For " O Canada " , the Robert Stanley Weir version of 1908 was recommended , with a few minor changes , for the English words ; two of the " stand on guard " phrases were replaced with " from far and wide " and " God keep our land . " 
 Still , it was not until 1970 that the Queen of Canada purchased the right to the lyrics and music of " O Canada " and 1980 before the song finally became the official national anthem via the National Anthem Act . The act established a religious reference to the English lyrics and the phrase " From far and wide , O Canada " to replace one of the repetitions of the phrase " We stand on guard . " This change was controversial with traditionalists and , for several years afterwards , it was not uncommon to hear people still singing the old lyrics at public events . In contrast , the French version has never been changed from its original . 
 Gordon V. Thompson Music , Toronto , held the publishing copyright to the English words of the song " O Canada " . Thompson sold that copyright to the Government of Canada for $ 1 , stating : " At a certain point , a song belongs to the people . "

 " O Canada " is routinely played before sporting events involving Canadian teams . Singers at such public events often mix the English and French lyrics to represent Canada 's linguistic duality . Other linguistic variations have also been performed : During the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary , " O Canada " was sung in the southern <unk> language by Yukon native Daniel <unk> . At a National Hockey League ( NHL ) game in Calgary in February , 2007 , Cree singer Akina Shirt became the first person ever to perform " O Canada " in the Cree language at such an event . 
 Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , the National Basketball Association , and the NHL all require venues to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries , with the away team 's anthem being performed first , followed by the host country . One American NHL team , the Buffalo Sabres , goes a step further and performs both anthems before every game as a nod to Buffalo 's location near the Canadian border and the team 's substantial number of Canadian fans . Major League Baseball teams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos , and National Basketball Association teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors , and previously , the Vancouver Grizzlies . Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at league and Amway Canadian Championship matches involving Toronto FC , Montreal Impact , and Vancouver Whitecaps FC . 
 = = Laws and etiquette = = 
 The National Anthem Act specifies the lyrics and melody of " O Canada " , placing both of them in the public domain , allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derived works , including musical arrangements . There are no regulations governing the performance of " O Canada " , leaving citizens to exercise their best judgment . When it is performed at an event , traditional etiquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem , including situations when other anthems are played , and for the audience to stand during the performance . Civilian men usually remove their hats , while women and children are not required to do so . Military men and women in uniform traditionally keep their hats on and offer the military salute during the performance of the anthem , with the salute offered in the direction of the Maple Leaf Flag if one is present , and if not present it is offered standing at attention .

 = Ian O 'Brien = 
 Ian Lovett O 'Brien ( born 3 March 1947 ) is an Australian breaststroke swimmer of the 1960s , who won the 200 metre breaststroke at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in world record time . He won five Commonwealth Games gold medals and claimed a total of nine individual and six relay titles at the Australian Championships , before retiring at the age of 21 due to financial pressures . 
 After showing promise at an early age , O 'Brien was sent to Sydney to train under renowned coach Forbes Carlile and his breaststroke assistant Terry Gathercole . He competed in his first national championships in 1962 at the age of 15 , winning the 220 yard breaststroke to gain selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth , Western Australia , where he won both the 110 and 220 yd ( 200 m ) breaststroke and the 4 × 110 yd medley relay . He won both breaststroke events at the 1963 Australian Championships , repeating the feat for the next three years . In 1964 , O 'Brien went to the Tokyo Olympics and came from third at the 150 m mark to win the gold medal . He added a bronze in the medley relay . O 'Brien successfully defended both his breaststroke titles at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston , Jamaica , before retiring to support his family . Swimming officials persuaded him to make a comeback for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City , as Australia did not have a breaststroker , and after a crash diet , came sixth in the 100 m event but failed to reach the final in the 200 m event . He then retired and went into the television industry . 
 = = Early years = = 
 O 'Brien grew up in the rural town of Wellington , 360 kilometres ( 225 miles ) from Sydney . Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers . His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke — the breaststroke — and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55 . O 'Brien 's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years , but she preferred horseback riding . The local pool was an old @-@ style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week . Aged four , O 'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program . There were not many non @-@ sporting activities for children in Wellington , and O 'Brien played basketball and rugby league , did athletics , swimming and rode horses . In 1954 , a chlorinated pool was built in the town , leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club . At the age of 10 , he began competitive swimming under local coach Bert <unk> , and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo , Bathurst and Orange . 
 After winning all the breaststroke events at the country championships , O 'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960 , to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant , retired world record @-@ breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole . Carlile was regarded as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time . At age 13 , O 'Brien was already a large teenager , weighing in at 82 @.@ 6 kg . He only trained with Gathercole during holidays , when his father could take him to Sydney ; Jim Wilkins , a Catholic priest in Bathurst , supervised him according to Gathercole 's program while he was in the countryside . Within a year , O 'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national @-@ level athlete , despite the death of his father in the same year . 
 = = International debut = = 
 In 1962 , O 'Brien gained selection for the Australian swimming team at the age of 15 when he won the 220 yard ( yd ) breaststroke at his first Australian Championships in the time of 2 minutes ( min ) 41 @.@ 8 seconds ( s ) . He added a second gold as part of the New South Wales team that won the 4 × 100 m medley relay in a time of 4 min 18 @.@ 3 s . His performances gained him selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth . At his first international competition , he won gold in each of his three events . He competed in the 110 yd ( 100 m ) and 220 yd ( 200 m ) breaststroke , defeating fellow Australian William Burton in both events with times of 1 min <unk> and 2 min 38 @.@ 1 s , respectively . He then completed his campaign with a victory in the 4 × 110 yd medley relay , combining with Julian Carroll , Kevin Berry and David Dickson to complete the race in a time of 4 min 12 @.@ 4 s . 
 In 1963 , O 'Brien captured the breaststroke double at the Australian Championships , setting personal bests in both events , and was a member of the New South Wales team that won the medley relay . His performances earned him selection for an overseas tour to Europe with the Australian team , competing in the Soviet Union , Germany and England , before visiting Japan and Hong Kong . O 'Brien defended his breaststroke double at the 1964 Australian Championships , lowering his times to 1 min 8 @.@ 1 s and 2 min 32 @.@ 6 s for the 100 metres ( m ) and 200 m breaststroke respectively . He capped off his campaign as well as a third consecutive medley relay triumph for New South Wales . Within a year , he had reduced his times in the two events by more than 3 % . As O 'Brien was widely regarded as Australia 's best breaststroker , he was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo . O 'Brien joined the rest of the team for the national camp before the Olympics in Ayr in northern Queensland , where he trained under head coach Don Talbot . O 'Brien described Talbot as a " <unk> " , but felt that the experience was invaluable . 
 = = Olympic gold = = 
 Arriving in Tokyo , O 'Brien was nominated in the 200 m event and the medley relay ; the 100 m event was yet to be included in the Olympic program . The favourites for the 200 m breaststroke were Chet Jastremski of the United States — the world record holder — and Georgy Prokopenko of the Soviet Union . Gathercole had modelled O 'Brien 's technique on that of Jastremski , attempting to refine and <unk> it . Years after O 'Brien retired , Harry Gallagher said that " Ian O 'Brien has an almost faultless style and is a great example for Australian youngsters to copy " . O 'Brien was known for the strength that his torso generated , and his powerful kicks ; sports science experiments showed that his vertical jump was especially strong . O 'Brien was also known for his efficient start . He often gained a lead of approximately a metre from his dive and underwater glide at the start , and was able to complete 50 m in 31 @.@ 0 s . 
 During the final training sessions in Tokyo , Talbot organised time trials for the Australians , which were held in front of opposition swimmers in an attempt to intimidate them . O 'Brien posted a time of 2 min 33 s , which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O 'Brien 's opponents . When competition started , O 'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2 @.@ 0 s . He posted a time of 2 min 31 @.@ 4 s , reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5 @.@ 8 s , an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years . However , in the next heat , Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark , and by the end of the heats , O 'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals , with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times . O 'Brien lowered Henninger 's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2 min 28 @.@ 7 s , after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3 @.@ 4 s slower than O 'Brien . This made O 'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final , with a time that was 1 @.@ 0 s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko , who came second to him in the second semifinal . O 'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race . He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski , who was known for an aggressive opening style , which resulted in a faster first half . 
 In the final , Jastremski attacked from the outset as expected , while O 'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace . After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski , Prokopenko and Henninger , O 'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50 m and overtook Jastremski , leaving the American in fourth place . He then moved past Henninger , before overtaking Prokopenko . O 'Brien 's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end , but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win the gold medal in a new world record time of 2 min 27 @.@ 8 s , a margin of 0 @.@ 4 s , with Jastremski a further 1 @.@ 4 s in arrears . O 'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win . 
 The Australian coaches rested O 'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay ; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead . It turned out to be a close call for the Australians , as they finished fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest , only 1 @.@ 2 s from elimination . In the final , O 'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds , Berry and Dickson . At the end of Reynolds ' backstroke leg , Australia were sixth , 3 @.@ 4 s behind the American leaders . O 'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1 min 7 @.@ 8 s , a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko . This pulled Australia up to fourth position , 1 @.@ 7 s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark . Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4 min 2 @.@ 3 s , missing the silver by 0 @.@ 7 s .

 O 'Brien completed a hat @-@ trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships , but in a year with no international competition , he swam much slower times of 1 min 11 @.@ 1 s and 2 min 38 @.@ 6 s respectively . He completed a fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales . At the 1966 Australian Championships , his times were again slower , at 1 min 11 @.@ 8 s and 2 min 41 @.@ 6 s respectively , more than 4 % slower than his personal bests , but it was still enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston , Jamaica . Critics had written him off , because just six weeks before the competition , he was 16 kg overweight . However , he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica , where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1 min 8 @.@ 2 s and 2 min 29 @.@ 3 s respectively . His winning run in the 4 × 100 m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover . 
 In 1967 , O 'Brien skipped the Australian Championships because he had no sponsorship and ran out of money , forcing him to seek full @-@ time work . In 1968 , despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200 m breaststroke title , the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O 'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics . Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program , O 'Brien lost 12 @.@ 7 kg in twelve weeks of intense training . O 'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles , but New South Wales again won the medley relay . Nevertheless , he was selected for his second Olympics . 
 At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico , O 'Brien placed second in his heat of the 200 m breaststroke in a time of 2 min 36 @.@ 8 s , which placed him 13th . He was eliminated , having been 2 @.@ 9 s slower than the last @-@ placed qualifier for the final . The eventual winner posted a time 0 @.@ 9 s slower than that of O 'Brien four years earlier . O 'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100 m event , winning his heat in a time of 1 min 8 @.@ 9 s to qualify second @-@ fastest for the semifinals . O 'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1 min 9 @.@ 0 s . It was the barest of margins ; O 'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth @-@ fastest semifinalist , with judges being used to decide the placings . O 'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1 min 8 @.@ 6 s . 
 O 'Brien narrowly missed a medal in the 4 × 100 m medley relay . Along with Michael Wenden , Robert Cusack and Karl Byrom , the Australian quartet won their heat and entered the final as the equal fifth fastest qualifier . In the final , O 'Brien swam his leg in 1 min 8 @.@ 6 s , which was only the fifth fastest breaststroke leg . Australia were fourth at the end of each leg , except O 'Brien 's , when they were third . Australia eventually missed out on the bronze by 0 @.@ 1 s to the Soviet Union . O 'Brien admitted that his training had been insufficient for Olympic standards , noting that " I needed to put on another thousand kilometres in training " . O 'Brien also rued the absence of Talbot to motivate him to work , and had a further accident at the Olympic Village when his fingers were slammed by a closing window . Under competition regulations , he was not allowed to bind his hand during competition .

 At age 21 , O 'Brien retired after the 1968 Olympics , so he could concentrate solely on making a living . Since his father 's death in 1962 , O 'Brien 's swimming career had caused substantial financial stress for his family , with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet . O 'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate , so that he could support the family 's income by wrapping parcels . Television and camera work had always interested O 'Brien , and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics , which he held for more than ten years . He then worked for Channel Ten for two years , before working for an independent production company for another two years . In 1979 , he started <unk> , which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia . <unk> 's sound stages were used by public and private television companies .

 O 'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986 . In 2000 , he received an Australian Sports Medal . 
 = Tropical Storm Debby ( 2006 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Debby was the fifth tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season . Debby formed just off the coast of Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave . After passing near the Cape Verde islands , Debby moved generally northwestward for much of its life , reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Strong wind shear weakened the storm , and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean . 
 Early in its life , Debby was forecast to pass through the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm , potentially causing life @-@ threatening flooding . Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track to the northwest throughout its lifetime , though intensity was more problematic for forecasters . The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status , though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa late on August 20 , and almost immediately developed convective banding and a broad circulation . A broad area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260 mi ( 420 km ) southeast of the Cape Verde islands . Though convection decreased early on August 21 , the area of low pressure remained well @-@ organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21 . Water temperatures remained warm enough for development , while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west @-@ northwestward due to a ridge of high pressure to its north . Initial predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecast a motion to the northwest based on consistent model predictions , though , as quoted by forecaster James Franklin , " The models have also been excellently wrong thus far " . 
 Despite a decrease in convection shortly after forming , the large depression remained well organized , with a wind field 575 mi ( 930 km ) in diameter . On August 22 , as it passed 140 mi ( 225 km ) to south of the Cape Verde islands , deep convection developed over the center of circulation , and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300 mi ( 485 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened , and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean . Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status , while its projected path placed the storm in an area of warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear . 
 Shortly after reaching its peak intensity , Debby encountered an area of dry air , and subsequently weakened . The low level circulation detached itself from the diminishing convection while the system as a whole continued west @-@ northwestward . Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center , while banding features redeveloped as well . Organization continued , and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) on August 24 . Southerly wind shear displaced the convection to the north of the center , and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25 . The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated , and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression . Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure . The low turned to the north and north @-@ northeast ahead of an approaching trough , and on August 28 the low dissipated . 
 = = Preparation and Impact = = 
 The government of the Cape Verde islands issued a tropical storm warning coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Tropical Depression Four , meaning tropical storm conditions were expected in the area within 24 hours . The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall , potentially as high as 10 in ( 250 mm ) in mountainous areas , would be possible in the territory , possibly causing life @-@ threatening flash floods and mudslides . However , due to a reformation further to the south , tropical storm warnings were discontinued as the depression moved from the area . While passing around 115 mi ( 185 km ) to the southwest of the southwestern most islands , the depression produced a 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) wind gust at Fogo and some rainfall , though no damage was reported . 
 Long range forecasts brought the storm near Bermuda . However Debby remained over 900 mi ( 1 @,@ 450 km ) from the island at its closest approach . Though the storm was forecast to remain far away from the Gulf of Mexico , investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise 60 cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations . 
 = Brown County State Park = 
 Brown County State Park is located in the United States in the center of the southern half of the state of Indiana . The park is the largest of 24 state parks in Indiana , and occupies 15 @,@ 776 acres ( 63 @.@ 84 km2 ) — making it one of the larger state parks in the United States . It is Indiana 's most visited state park , and has about 1 @.@ 3 million visitors each year . Although Bloomington , Indiana , is the closest city , the park is closer to the small town of Nashville in Brown County . Brown County is named for General Jacob Brown , who fought in the War of 1812 and became Commanding General of the United States Army . 
 The park opened in 1929 , and was dedicated in 1932 as a memorial to Indiana humorist Frank McKinney " Kin " Hubbard . Although Hubbard lived and worked in Indianapolis , he was a frequent visitor to Nashville and the surrounding woods . The park 's Abe Martin Lodge is named after Hubbard 's fictional backwoodsmen character used to convey Hubbard 's humor and witticisms . 
 Brown County and its park are known for their scenic views of the hills of southern Indiana . Both are the home of a wide variety of trees that attract visitors each year when the vegetation transforms to its autumn colors . The park also contains many trees that flower in the springtime . Visitors will find a rustic atmosphere , enhanced by an infrastructure that was mostly constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s . In addition to the park 's lodge , cabins can be rented and campsites are available . The park has trails for hiking , biking and horseback riding . It has two lakes for fishing that complement the surrounding forests and provide a water source for the local wildlife . The area 's beauty attracts artists and photographers worldwide .
