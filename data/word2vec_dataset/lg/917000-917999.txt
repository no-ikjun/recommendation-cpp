 Donaggio won a ' best soundtrack of the year ' award for his work on the film , which gave him the confidence to quit his successful singing career and embark on a career scoring films . Donaggio became a regular composer for Brian De Palma films and credits Nicolas Roeg with giving him his first lesson in writing film scores , and expressed a desire to work with him again .

 Don 't Look Now has become famous for a sex scene involving Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland , which caused considerable controversy prior to its release in 1973 . British tabloid newspaper , the Daily Mail , observed at the time " one of the <unk> love scenes ever to be filmed is likely to plunge lovely Julie Christie into the biggest censorship row since Last Tango in Paris " . The scene was unusually graphic for the period , including a rare depiction of cunnilingus in a mainstream film . 
 Christie commented that " people didn 't do scenes like that in those days " , and that she found the scenes difficult to film : " There were no available examples , no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [ Roeg ] shouted instructions . " The scene caused problems with censors on both sides of the Atlantic . The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly , saying , " We cannot see humping . We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs . " The scene 's much celebrated fragmented style , in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post @-@ <unk> getting dressed to go out to dinner , partly came about through Roeg 's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors : " They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to . If someone goes up , you cut and the next time you see them they 're in a different position , you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself . But , technically speaking , there was no ' humping ' in that scene . " In the end , Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence , and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States . In Britain , the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be " tasteful and integral to the plot " , and a scene in which Donald Sutherland 's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie 's character was permitted , but it was still given an X rating — an adults only certificate . 
 The sex scene remained controversial for some years after the film 's release . The BBC cut it altogether when Don 't Look Now premiered on UK television , causing a flood of complaints from viewers . The intimacy of the scene led to rumours that Christie and Sutherland had unsimulated sex which have persisted for years , and that outtakes from the scene were doing the rounds in screening rooms . Michael Deeley , who oversaw the film 's UK distribution , claimed on BBC Radio 4 's Desert Island Discs that Warren Beatty had flown to London and demanded that the sex scene — featuring then girlfriend Julie Christie — be cut from the film . The rumours were seemingly confirmed in 2011 by former Variety editor Peter Bart , who was a Paramount executive at the time . In his book , Infamous Players : A Tale of Movies , the Mob , ( and Sex ) , Bart says he was on set on the day the scene was filmed and could clearly see Sutherland 's penis " moving in and out of " Christie . Bart also reiterated Warren Beatty 's discontent , noting that Beatty had contacted him to complain about what he perceived to be Roeg 's exploitation of Christie , and insisting that he be allowed to help edit the film . Sutherland subsequently issued a statement through his publicist stating that the claims were not true , and that Bart did not witness the scene being filmed . Peter Katz , the film 's producer , corroborated Sutherland 's account that the sex was entirely simulated .

 Don 't Look Now — marketed as a " psychic thriller " — was released in Britain on 16 October 1973 , as the main feature of a double bill . The Wicker Man was its accompanying ' B ' feature and — like Don 't Look Now — went on to achieve great acclaim . The two films have thematic similarities , and both end with their protagonists being led to preordained fates by a ' child ' they believe to be helping . Michael Deeley , who was managing director of British Lion Films at the time of the film 's release , claimed that the film 's US reception was hurt by Paramount Pictures rushing the film into cinemas too early , due to the unexpected failure of Jonathan Livingston Seagull ; despite its mismanaged distribution , Peter Bart — from his time at Paramount — recalls it performing " fairly well " at the box office . The film had recouped most of its expenses before it was even released , with its $ 1 @.@ 1 million budget offset by the fee Paramount paid for the US distribution rights . 
 Don 't Look Now was chosen by the British Film Institute in 2000 as one of eight classic films from those that had begun to deteriorate to undergo restoration . On completion of the restoration in 2001 , the film was given another theatrical release .

 Don 't Look Now has been released on VHS , DVD and Blu @-@ ray . Extras include an introduction by film journalist Alan Jones , an audio commentary by director Nicolas Roeg , a retrospective documentary featurette ( " Looking Back " ) , an extract from a 1980s documentary about Roeg ( " Nothing is as it Seems " ) , and interviews with Donald Sutherland , composer Pino Donaggio ( " Death in Venice " ) , scriptwriter Allan Scott , cinematographer Anthony Richmond and film director Danny Boyle , as well as a " compressed " version of the film made by Boyle for a BAFTA tribute . 
 A new DVD and Blu @-@ ray release with a 4K digital restoration was released in 2015 by The Criterion Collection . In addition to the " Death in Venice " and " Looking Back " featurettes which accompanied earlier editions , there is a conversation between editor Graeme Clifford and film writer Bobbie O ’ Steen , an essay by film critic David Thomson and a Q & A with Roeg at London ’ s <unk> Lumière from 2003 .

 At the time of its initial release , Don 't Look Now was generally well received by critics , although some criticised it for being " arty and mechanical " . Jay Cocks for Time , wrote that " Don 't Look Now is such a rich , complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing " , while Variety commented that the film 's visual flourishes made it " much more than merely a well @-@ made psycho @-@ horror thriller " . Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise , considering the film to be " the fanciest , most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen " but that there was a " distasteful <unk> about the picture " , while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg 's previous two films , Performance and Walkabout , but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth . Vincent Canby , reviewer for The New York Times , on the other hand , criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end , and at which point it " stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second @-@ sightseeing in Venice " . Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen , since it appeared simply like flash @-@ forward which is a standard story @-@ telling device in films , and concluded that " Not only do you probably have better things to do , but so , I 'm sure , do most of the people connected with the film . " 
 British critics were especially enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg 's direction . In the view of Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin , Roeg 's combined work on Performance , Walkabout and Don 't Look Now put him " right up at the top as film @-@ maker " . George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined " that handful of names whose appearance at the end of the credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation " . Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg 's direction : " Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection . " American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg 's work on the film . Jay Cocks regarded Don 't Look Now to be Roeg 's best work by far and that Roeg was one of " those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing " . Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella , noting that a reading " makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [ Allan ] Scott and [ Chris ] Bryant all the more . Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise . The story is detached , almost cursory . Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate , intense speculation about levels of perception and reality . " Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times commented that Roeg is " a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions " , while Pauline Kael labelled him " chillingly chic " in hers . Even Vincent Canby , whose opinion of the film was negative overall , praised Roeg for being able to " maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it " . 
 Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland also received praise for their performances . Variety considered Sutherland to be at his most subdued but also at his most effective , while Christie does her " best work in ages " . Cocks felt that thanks to their superb performances the film had a " rigorous psychological truth and an emotional timbre " that most other films in the supernatural genre lacked . Canby considered the " sincerity of the actors " to be one of the better aspects of the film , while Kael found Christie especially suited to the part , observing she has the " anxious face of a modern tragic muse " . 
 Roeg 's use of Venice was praised too , with Roger Ebert finding that he " uses Venice as well as she 's ever been used in a movie " , and Canby also noted Venice is used to great effect : " He gets a great performance from Venice , which is all wintery grays , blues and blacks , the color of the pigeons that are always underfoot . " Variety also found much to admire about the editing , writing that it is " careful and painstaking ( the classically brilliant and erotic love @-@ making scene is merely one of several examples ) and plays a vital role in setting the film 's mood " . 
 Daphne du Maurier was pleased with the adaptation of her story , and wrote to Nicolas Roeg to congratulate him for capturing the essence of John and Laura 's relationship . The film was not received well by Venetians , particularly the councillors who were afraid it would scare away tourists . 
 At the 27th British Academy Film Awards , Anthony B. Richmond won for Best Cinematography , and Don 't Look Now received further nominations in the Best Film , Direction , Actor , Actress , Sound Track and Film Editing categories . It was also nominated in the Best Motion Picture category at the 1974 Edgar Allan Poe Awards . 
 = = = Re @-@ evaluation = = = 
 The reputation of Don 't Look Now has grown since its release and it is now regarded as a key work in horror cinema . It has led to some critics re @-@ evaluating their original opinions of it : Roger Ebert , nearly thirty years after his original review , states that he has come to an " accommodation " with his reservations about what he terms the " admitted weakness of the denouement " . Having gone through the film shot by shot , he now considers it a " masterpiece of physical filmmaking , in the way the photography evokes mood and the editing underlines it with uncertainty " . It was ranked 127th by Sight & Sound in the 2012 edition of their prestigious decennial critics poll . 
 Don 't Look Now is also very well regarded by other industry professionals , placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound 's directors poll , run in tandem with their critics poll . A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry , undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999 , saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century . It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011 , in which 150 film industry professionals were polled . In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry , in which more than 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films , which saw Don 't Look Now finish in twelfth position . 
 = = = Influence = = = 
 Don 't Look Now has been much admired by and an influence on subsequent filmmakers . Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films . Mark Gatiss , Steve Pemberton , Reece Shearsmith , and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don 't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen ; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s , and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched the The Wicker Man and Don 't Look Now . Similarly , Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to ' 60s and ' 70s psychological horror , citing Don 't Look Now , Rosemary 's Baby and The Shining as particular examples . Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier 's Antichrist have also been observed , with Antichrist 's cinematographer , Anthony Dod Mantle , commenting that he has watched Don 't Look Now more times than any other film . Fabrice Du <unk> , whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don 't Look Now , has stated that it is a film he is " obsessed with " , and one of his favourites , while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin , which incidentally is also produced by Roeg 's son , Luc . Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don 't Look Now while directing her debut feature , Texas Killing Fields . 
 Its imagery has been directly referenced in several works . The 2006 James Bond film , Casino Royale contains a small homage where James Bond pursues a female character through Venice , catching glimpses of her through the crowds wearing a red dress . The Bruges set thriller , In Bruges , starring Colin Farrell , includes a number of explicit references ; director Martin McDonagh said that the " Venice of Don 't Look Now " was the template for the depiction of Bruges in his film , and the film includes numerous thematic similarities , including one character stating that the film she is working on is a " pastiche of Don 't Look Now " . Flatliners , a 1990 supernatural thriller directed by Joel Schumacher , also draws explicitly on the red @-@ coated childlike figure by having a character terrorised by a child wearing a red coat ; coincidentally , the character who is being tormented is played by Kiefer Sutherland , Donald Sutherland 's son . In the 2007 stage play of Don 't Look Now , written by Nell Leyshon and directed by Lucy Bailey , the play made a conscious effort to bypass the film and be a faithful adaptation of du Maurier 's short story , but it did however retain the iconic red mac from the film as worn by the elusive childlike figure . 
 Its influence is less obvious but still apparent in Out of Sight , a 1998 film directed by Steven Soderbergh . The famous intercutting technique used in the sex scene was used to similar effect in a sex scene featuring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez . The film 's imagery and stylistic techniques have served as an inspiration to films such as Schindler 's List directed by Steven Spielberg , Memento by Christopher Nolan , The Dark by John Fawcett , Frozen by Juliet <unk> , Submarine by Richard Ayoade , and Snow White and the Huntsman by Rupert Sanders . David Cronenberg regards it as the most frightening film he has seen , and its influence has been detected on Cronenberg 's The Brood . 
 Nicolas Roeg has never been slow to draw upon the world of pop music for his work , casting Mick Jagger in Performance , David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth and Art Garfunkel in Bad Timing , and in turn his films have served as inspiration for musicians . Big Audio Dynamite wrote a tribute song to Roeg , called " E = MC2 " , which included lyrical references to Don 't Look Now — among Roeg 's other films — along with clips from it in the video , directed by Luc Roeg , while Sophie Ellis @-@ Bextor performed a " pop synth homage " to Don 't Look Now with her song , " Catch You " .

 Undine was ordered under the contract name " J " and was laid down at the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel in 1901 and launched on 11 December 1902 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 5 January 1904 . The ship was 105 meters ( 344 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 4 m ( 41 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 81 m ( 15 @.@ 8 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 112 t ( 3 @,@ 063 long tons ; 3 @,@ 430 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines manufactured by Howaldtswerke . They were designed to give 6 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) , for a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . The engines were powered by eight coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers .

She had a crew of 14 officers and 256 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts .

 After her commissioning , Undine was assigned to the training squadron for use as a gunnery training ship . On the night of 17 November 1904 , Undine collided with the torpedo boat S26 while on maneuvers just outside Kiel . S26 , along with the rest of her unit , the IV Torpedo Boat Flotilla , was conducting a mock night attack on Undine . The cruiser was steaming with her lights off , and when the torpedo boats approached , Undine turned her search lights on , which blinded the crew of S26 . The torpedo boat inadvertently ran in front of Undine , and the latter rammed and sank the former . One officer and thirty @-@ two enlisted men aboard S26 were killed in the accident . 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Undine was employed as a coastal defense ship in the Baltic . On 7 November 1915 , Undine was steaming north of Arkona with a pair of destroyers when she was attacked by the British submarine E19 , under the command of Lieutenant Commander Francis <unk> . E19 launched a pair of torpedoes at Undine at a range of 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) , both of which hit . The second torpedo detonated her ammunition magazines and blew up the ship . Undine sank quickly at 13 : 08 ; only fourteen men were killed in the attack , and the majority of her crew was rescued by the escorting destroyers . The loss of Undine came on the heels of the sinking of the armored cruiser Prinz Adalbert two weeks earlier . These two losses were significant enough to compel the German Navy to curtail the movements of the fleet in the Baltic for the remainder of the year . 
 = The Vicar of Wakefield ( 1910 film ) = 
 The Vicar Of Wakefield is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film was adapted from Oliver Goldsmith 's novel The Vicar of Wakefield , but covers only part of the plot and deviates significantly from the book to allow the story to be told within the confines of a single reel of film . 
 The film begins with the vicar and his family heading to a picnic with Squire Thornhill , during the course of which the vicar notices Thornhill 's interest in his daughter , Olivia . The vicar warns his family that Thornhill is a degenerate young man , but Olivia is seduced and elopes with Thornhill . Secretly , Thornhill arranges a fake marriage ceremony to capitalize on his sexual desires while avoiding the responsibility that would come with the union . Olivia learns the marriage was fake and that she has duped into a form of consensual prostitution with Thornhill , but escapes and returns home . Thornhill decides to take his revenge by having the vicar incarcerated for his debts . While in prison , the vicar learns that the marriage was in fact legitimate ; Thornhill 's uncle , Sir William , then forces his nephew to apologize to Olivia and fulfill his obligations . 
 The identities of most of the cast are known , but the role of director , often erroneously credited to Theodore Marston is not . The film was released on December 27 , 1910 and met with positive reviews . The surviving print is in the Nederlands Filmmuseum and has been released on DVD . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Thanhouser production is an adaptation of only part of the novel . The film departs significantly from the original plot , such as in the omission of the double @-@ wedding scene . It begins with Dr Charles Primrose , the vicar of Wakefield , attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill . The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill , who is reputed to be a degenerate young man , but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill 's interest in his daughter , Olivia . The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him , so the two can be married . But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her , and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony . The farmer accepts , but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed . 
 Squire Thornhill leaves in a carriage with Olivia , whose departure is soon reported to the rest of the family . Stricken with grief , the vicar heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter . At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment , and the squire and Olivia embrace . The vicar arrives shortly afterwards , but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him leaves in despair . Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham , but continues to live in Thornhill 's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his . Olivia flees in a rage and returns home , where she is reunited with her family . Thornhill , now out for revenge , has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts . 
 Olivia goes to meet her father in prison , and upon exiting the farmer who had arranged the marriage between Olivia and Thornhill appears and gasps in shock . The vicar explains that Olivia is his daughter , and the farmer reveals his role in the plot , but that out of hatred for Thornhill he procured the services of a real priest to officiate at the wedding . The farmer heads to Thornhill 's house and reveals that the marriage was in fact legitimate . Thornhill 's uncle , Sir William , forces him to take responsibility for his actions and beg Olivia 's forgiveness . Olivia accepts Thornhill 's apology and the couple embrace and kiss . Although not in the surviving print , the synopsis concludes with " Sir William then discloses his identity and asks for the hand of Sophia [ another of the vicar 's daughters ] . The vicar is released from prison , and he and his family look forward to a future of happiness and plenty . "

 The film was adapted from Oliver Goldsmith 's novel The Vicar of Wakefield . The complex plot was broken down to a single @-@ reel adaptation by Edwin Thanhouser and / or Lloyd Lonergan . Edwin Thanhouser 's wife Gertrude assisted with the scenarios and editing of the films , but it is not specifically known if she contributed to this production . 
 The film 's director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . Credit is sometimes given to Theodore Marston , an error that apparently originates with the American Film @-@ Index 1908 – 1915 . Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co @-@ authors of the book , Gunnar Lundquist , and confirmed that the credit of Marston as director was in error . Marston worked with Pathé , Kinemacolor , Vitagraph and other companies , but there is no record of him working with Thanhouser . This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film . Cameramen employed by the company at the time the film was made include Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory and Alfred H. Moses , Jr . , but the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . This production is unique for having the cast members known , because most of the credits in Thanhouser 's 1910 productions are fragmentary .

 The single @-@ reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on December 27 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , theaters are known to have shown the film in Pennsylvania , Kansas , Indiana , and South Dakota . The film received positive reviews from trade publications including the The Moving Picture World , which praised the acting and the execution of the film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces . The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was less enthusiastic , writing that " The production gave a very praiseworthy portrayal of the period , but a moving picture needs such different treatment from a novel that its interpretation in a picture is bound to lose much of the original interest . The acting was in every way adequate , although not great . " 
 The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film lists this film as the first adaptation of the Vicar of Wakefield . It was followed by identically titled adaptations , including Pathé Frères 's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1912 and the Kinematograph Trading Company 's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1913 , Ideal Film Company 's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1916 . The Thanhouser Company reproduced the The Vicar of Wakefield in 1917 . The two Thanhouser films differ in more than just length , as the feature @-@ length adaptation shows the progression of motion pictures from " essentially static tableaus , each announced by a title card , to a series of scenes and sequences analyzed by editing , most notably with vivid close @-@ ups of the great stage actor Frederick Warde . " 
 A surviving print held in the Nederlands Filmmuseum was the source of the modern re @-@ release of film . It is 13 minutes 20 seconds long and features a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. <unk> . The film was released on DVD as Volume 4 of the Thanhouser Classics Video Collectors Set . It was also released as part of the Treasures from the <unk> Collection at the EYE Filmmuseum . 
 = Central Atlas Tamazight = 
 Central Atlas Tamazight language ( also known as Central Morocco Tamazight , Middle Atlas Tamazight , Tamazight , Central Shilha , and , rarely , <unk> ; native name : <unk> Tamazight [ <unk> ] , [ <unk> ] ) is a Berber language of the Afro @-@ Asiatic language family , spoken by 3 to 5 million people in the Atlas mountains of Central Morocco , as well as by smaller emigrant communities in France and elsewhere . 
 Central Atlas Tamazight is one of the most @-@ spoken Berber languages , along with Kabyle , Shilha , Riff , and <unk> , and in Morocco it rivals Shilha as the most @-@ spoken . All five languages may be referred to as ' Tamazight ' , but Central Atlas speakers are the only ones who use the term exclusively . As is typical of Afro @-@ Asiatic languages , Tamazight has a series of " emphatic consonants " ( realized as pharyngealized ) , <unk> , pharyngeals , and lacks the phoneme / p / . Tamazight has a phonemic three @-@ vowel system , but also has numerous words without vowels . 
 Central Atlas Tamazight ( unlike neighbouring <unk> ) had no known significant writing tradition until the 20th century . It is now officially written in the Tifinagh script for instruction in Moroccan schools , while descriptive linguistic literature commonly uses the Latin alphabet , and the Arabic alphabet has also been used . 
 The standard word order is verb – subject – object but sometimes subject – verb – object . Words inflect for gender , number , and state , using prefixes , suffixes , and <unk> . Verbs are heavily inflected , being marked for tense , aspect , mode , voice , person of the subject , and polarity , sometimes undergoing ablaut . Pervasive borrowing from Arabic extends to all major word classes , including verbs ; borrowed verbs , however , are conjugated according to native patterns , including ablaut . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Central Atlas Tamazight is one of the four most @-@ spoken Berber languages , in addition to Kabyle , Shilha , and Riff , and rivals Shilha as the most @-@ spoken Berber language in Morocco . Differentiating these dialects is complicated by the fact that speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as ' Tamazight ' . The differences between all three groups are largely phonological and lexical , rather than syntactic . Tamazight itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity , including whether spirantization occurs . 
 Central Atlas Tamazight speakers refer to themselves as Amazigh ( pl . <unk> ) , an <unk> ethnonym whose etymology is uncertain , but may translate as " free people " . The term Tamazight , the feminine form of Amazigh , refers to the language . Both words are also used self @-@ referentially by other Berber groups to replace local terms such as <unk> or <unk> , although Central Atlas Tamazight speakers use them regularly and exclusively . 
 In older studies , Central Atlas Tamazight is sometimes referred to as " <unk> " / " <unk> " , a <unk> Arabic term , or its Tamazight equivalent " <unk> " . This is related to the Standard Arabic and English term " Berber " , used to refer to all Berber dialects / languages , though eschewed by many Berbers because its etymology is pejorative . 
 Tamazight belongs to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic language family ; Afroasiatic subsumes a number of languages in North Africa and Southwest Asia including the Semitic languages , the Egyptian language , and the <unk> and Cushitic languages . Along with most other Berber languages , Tamazight has retained a number of widespread Afroasiatic features , including a two @-@ gender system , verb – subject – object ( VSO ) typology , emphatic consonants ( realized in Tamazight as pharyngealized ) , a <unk> morphology , and a causative morpheme / s / ( the latter also found in other <unk> , such as the Niger – Congo languages . ) Within Berber , it belongs , along with neighbouring <unk> , to the Atlas branch of the Northern Berber subgroup . 
 Tamazight is in the middle of a dialect continuum between Riff to its north @-@ east and Shilha to its south @-@ west . The basic lexicon of Tamazight differs markedly from Shilha , and its verbal system is more similar to Riff or Kabyle . Moreover , Tamazight has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha . 
 Tamazight 's dialects are divided into three distinct subgroups and geographic regions : those spoken in the Middle Atlas mountains ; those spoken in the High Atlas mountains ; and those spoken in Jbel Saghro and its foothills . Although the characteristic spirantization of / b / > [ β ] ; / t / > [ θ ] or [ h ] ; / d / > [ ð ] ; / k / > [ ç ] or [ ʃ ] ; and / ɡ / > [ ʝ ] , [ ʃ ] or [ j ] is apparent in Berber languages in central and northern Morocco and Algeria , as in many Middle Atlas dialects , it is more rare in High Atlas Tamazight speakers , and is absent in Tamazight speakers from the foothills of Jbel Saghro . Southern dialects ( e.g. Ayt Atta ) may also be differentiated syntactically : while other dialects predicate with the auxiliary / d / ( e.g. / d argaz / " it 's a man " ) , Southern dialects use the typically ( High Atlas , Souss @-@ Basin rural country , Jbel Atlas Saghro ) auxiliary verb / g / ( e.g. / <unk> argaz / " it 's a man " ) . The differences between each of the three groups are primarily phonological . 
 Groups speaking Tamazight include : Ait Ayache , Ait <unk> , Ait <unk> , Ait <unk> , <unk> , Ait <unk> , Beni <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Ait <unk> , Ait Seri , <unk> , Ait <unk> , Ait <unk> , Ait <unk> , Ayt Ndhir ( Beni <unk> ) . 
 There is some ambiguity as to the eastern boundary of Central Atlas Tamazight . The dialect of the Ait <unk> and Ait <unk> tribes are commonly classed as Central Atlas Tamazight , and Ait <unk> is reported to be mutually intelligible with the neighbouring Tamazight dialect of Ait Ayache . Genetically , however , they belong to the <unk> subgroup of Northern Berber , rather than to the Atlas subgroup to which the rest of Central Atlas Tamazight belongs , and are therefore excluded by some sources from Central Atlas Tamazight . The Ethnologue lists another group of <unk> dialects , South Oran Berber ( <unk> sud @-@ <unk> ) , as a dialect of Central Atlas Tamazight , but these are even less similar , and are treated by Berber specialists as a separate dialect group . 
 = = History = = 
 The Berbers have lived in North Africa between western Egypt and the Atlantic Ocean since before recorded history began in the region about 33 centuries ago . By the 5th century BC , the city of Carthage , founded by Phoenicians , had extended its hegemony across much of North Africa ; in the wake of the Punic Wars , Rome replaced it as regional hegemon . The Central Atlas region itself remained independent throughout the classical period , but occasional loanwords into Central Atlas Tamazight , such as <unk> , " plough ox " , from Latin <unk> , " team of oxen " and <unk> " onion " < Punic 
 <unk> @-@ im , bear witness to their ancestors ' contact with these conquerors . 
 Arabs conquered the area of modern @-@ day Morocco and Algeria around the 7th century , prompting waves of Arab migration and Berber adoption of Islam . Particularly following the arrival of the Banu Hilal in modern @-@ day Tunisia in the 11th century , more and more of North Africa became Arabic @-@ speaking over the centuries . However , along with other high mountainous regions of North Africa , the Middle Atlas continued to speak Berber . 
 Between the 12th and 15th centuries , the Central Atlas , along with the rest of Morocco , successively fell within the domain of the Berber Almoravid , Almohad , and Marinid dynasties . Since the 17th century the region has acknowledged the rule of the Alaouite Dynasty , the current Moroccan royal family . However , effective control of the region was limited ; until the 20th century much of the Central Atlas was in a condition of <unk> , recognising the spiritual legitimacy of royal authority but rejecting its political claims . The expansion of the Ait Atta starting from the 16th century brought Tamazight back into the already <unk> Tafilalt region and put other regional tribes on the defensive , leading to the formation of the Ait <unk> alliance . 
 The 1912 Treaty of Fez made most of Morocco a French @-@ Spanish protectorate ( under French and Spanish military occupation ) , leaving the Alaouite monarchy but establishing a French military presence in the Atlas region and installing a French commissioner @-@ general . However , the Berber tribes of the Middle Atlas , as in other areas , put up stiff military resistance to French rule , lasting until 1933 in the case of the Ait Atta . 
 After Morocco 's independence in 1956 , a strong emphasis was laid on the country 's Arab identity , and a national Arabic language educational system was instituted , in which Berber languages , including Middle Atlas Tamazight , had no place . However , in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages , including Central Atlas Tamazight . For the promotion of Tamazight and other Berber languages and cultures , the government created the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture ( IRCAM ) in 2001 . 
 = = Geographic distribution = = 
 Central Atlas Tamazight is among the four most @-@ spoken Berber languages ( the other three being Kabyle , Shilha , and Riff ) , and rivals Shilha as the most @-@ spoken Berber language in Morocco . Central Atlas Tamazight is mostly spoken in the entire Middle Atlas and its outcroppings , reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat . It is also spoken in the central and eastern High Atlas mountains in Morocco . It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle Atlas mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara ( Tafilalt ) . Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas : Riff in the north , Central Atlas in the center , and Shilha in the south / southwest . Central Atlas is mutually intelligible with the dialects Riff and Shilha ; but <unk> and Riff @-@ speakers cannot understand each other , although transitional varieties exist between these dialects , creating a smooth transition . 
 Figures for the number of speakers of Berber languages are generally a matter of estimates rather than linguistic censuses . At least a third of Moroccans seem to speak Berber languages , . Tamazight is estimated to be spoken by about 40 ~ 49 % of Morocco 's Berber @-@ speakers , while Shilha commands 32 ~ 40 % and Riff 20 ~ 25 % . 
 = = Status = = 
 Tamazight , along with other Berber languages of Morocco , has a low sociolinguistic status , used mainly in the home , and rarely in official or formal contexts ; it is not an official language . However , media broadcasts and music are available in it , and there is a policy of teaching it in schools . 
 Of the Central Atlas Tamazight speakers , 40 – 45 % are monolingual , while the others use Arabic as a second language . Monolingual speakers consist mostly of older generations and children . Women are more likely to be monolingual than men , since they typically stay in the village while the men go to work in the cities . Since Tamazight is the language of the home , girls grow up speaking Berber languages and pass them on to their children — this gender stratification helps to preserve the language . Bilingual Berber speakers have learned Moroccan Arabic via schooling , migration , media , or through the government . Most rural Berber children are monolingual . They struggle to succeed in schools where the teachers do not speak Berber , and require them to learn both Arabic and French . 
 Rural Morocco , including the Central Atlas area , suffers from poverty . Tamazight along with its relative Shilha are undergoing " contraction " as rural families , motivated by economic necessity , move to cities and stop speaking Tamazight , leading many intellectuals to fear Berber language shift or regression . However , Tamazight speakers are reported to immigrate less than many other Berber groups . Moreover , Tamazight has a large enough body of native speakers not to be considered under risk of endangerment , although Tamazight speakers reportedly have a lower birth rate than the country of Morocco as a whole . 
 = = = Official status = = = 
 As of the Moroccan constitutional referendum , 2011 , the Berber languages are official in Morocco alongside Arabic . In 1994 , King Hassan II declared that a national Berber dialect would acquire a formal status ; television broadcasts are summarized in Tamazight , as well as Shilha and Rif , three times a day ; and educational materials for schools are being developed . On October 17 , 2001 King Mohammed VI sealed the decree ( Dahir 1 – 01 – 299 ) creating and organizing the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture ( IRCAM ) . IRCAM 's board is composed of Amazigh experts , artists , and activists , all of whom are appointed by the king . The institute , located in Rabat , has played an important role in the establishment of the Tifinagh script in Morocco . There are multiple political parties and cultural associations in Morocco that advocate for the advancement of Berber , calling for it to be recognized as an official language , used more extensively in the mass media , and taught more in schools . 
 A legal issue affecting Tamazight speakers is restrictions on naming - Moroccan law stipulates that first names must have a " Moroccan character " , and uncommon names , including some Berber ones used in the Central Atlas , are often rejected by the civil registry . 
 = = Orthography = = 
 Until the 20th century Tamazight , like many other Berber languages but in contrast with neighbouring <unk> , was basically unwritten ( although sporadic cases , using Arabic script , are attested . ) It was preserved through oral use in rural areas , isolated from urban hubs . Scholars from the Middle Atlas , as elsewhere in North Africa , usually wrote in the more prestigious Arabic language , rather than their vernacular . 
 At present three writing systems exist for Berber languages , including Tamazight : Neo @-@ Tifinagh , the Latin alphabet and the Arabic script . To some extent , the choice of writing system is a political one , with various subgroups expressing preference based on ideology and politics . The orthography used for government services including schooling is Neo @-@ Tifinagh , rendered official by a Dahir of King Mohammed VI based on the recommendation of IRCAM . However , various Latin transcriptions have been used in a number of linguistic works describing Central Atlas Tamazight , notably the dictionary of <unk> ( 1991 ) . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 Central Atlas Tamazight has a contrastive set of " flat " consonants , manifested in two ways : 
 For front segments , pharyngealization : / tˤ dˤ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / ) 
 For back segments , labialization : / <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / ) 
 Note that pharyngealization may spread to a syllable or even a whole word . Historically Proto @-@ Berber only had two pharyngealized phonemes ( / dˤ , <unk> / ) , but modern Berber languages have borrowed others from Arabic and developed new ones through sound shifts . 
 In addition Tamazight has uvular and pharyngeal consonants , as well as a conspicuous lack of / p / in its plosive inventory . 
 All segments may be geminated except for the pharyngeals / ʕ ħ / . In Ayt Ndhir , which is a dialect of Tamazight with spirantization , the <unk> consonants appear in their stop forms when geminated , and additionally the geminate correspondents of / ʁ , dˤ , ʃ , ʒ , w , j / are usually / <unk> , <unk> , t ͡ <unk> , d ͡ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / respectively . However some native Berber words have / <unk> / ( not / <unk> / ) where other dialects have singleton / ʁ / , and similarly for / <unk> , <unk> / . In addition , in Arabic loans singleton non @-@ spirantized [ b , t , tˤ , d , k , ɡ , q ] occur ( though [ b t d ] and to an extent [ tˤ ] often alternate with their spirantized versions in loans ) , giving this alternation marginal phonemic status . 
 In the table below , when consonants appear in pairs , the one on the left is voiceless . 
 Phonetic notes : 
 ^ 1 / k ɡ / are fricatives [ x ɣ ] in the Ayt Ayache dialect 
 ^ 2 rare — native speakers can freely substitute / χ ʁ / 
 ^ 3 mainly in Arabic borrowings 
 ^ 4 For a small number of speakers , / b / is sometimes lenited to [ β ] . 
 ^ 5 / t / is aspirated [ <unk> ] . 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 Tamazight has a typical phonemic three @-@ vowel system , similarly to Classical Arabic : 
 These phonemes have numerous allophones , conditioned by the following environments : 
 ( # denotes word boundary , X denotes C [ − flat − / χ / − / ʁ / ] , C ̣ denotes C [ + flat ] , G denotes C , / χ / , and / ʁ / ) 
 Phonetic Schwa 
 There is a predictable non @-@ phonemic vowel inserted into consonant clusters , realized as [ ɪ ̈ ] before front consonants ( e.g. / b t d ... / ) and [ ə ] before back consonants ( e.g. / k χ ... / ) . It is voiced before voiced consonants and voiceless before voiceless consonants , or alternatively it can be realized as a voiced or unvoiced consonant release . It also may be realized as the <unk> of a nasal , lateral , or / r / . 
 The occurrence of schwa epenthesis is governed <unk> . These are some of the rules governing the occurrence of [ ə ] : 
 ( # denotes word boundary , L denotes / l r m n / , H denotes / h ħ ʕ w j / ) 
 Examples : 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' you ( fp ) turned ' ) 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' she is present ' ) 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' to meet ' ) 
 However note that word @-@ initial initial / j , w / are realized as / i , u / before consonants . In word @-@ medial or <unk> position [ <unk> ] , [ <unk> ] , and [ <unk> ] are realized as [ ij ] , [ ij ] , and [ <unk> ] respectively , and may become [ i ] and [ u ] in rapid speech . 
 Tamazight in fact has numerous words without phonemic vowels , and those consisting entirely of voiceless consonants will not phonetically contain voiced vowels . 
 [ ə ] is written as 〈 <unk> 〉 in neo @-@ Tifinagh and as 〈 e 〉 in the Berber Latin alphabet . French publications tended to include [ ə ] in their transcriptions of Berber forms despite their predictability , perhaps due to the French vowel system . This can cause problems because alternations such as / <unk> ( ə ) rs / ' he slaughtered ' – / <unk> / ' he did not slaughter ' would then have to conditioned morphologically . 
 = = = Stress = = = 
 Word stress is non @-@ contrastive and predictable — it falls on the last vowel in a word ( including schwa ) . 
 Examples : 
 / sal / > [ <unk> ] ( ' to ask ' ) 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' he is present ' ) 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' to explain ' ) 
 / <unk> / > [ <unk> ] ( ' you ( fp ) explained ' ) 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Central Atlas Tamazight grammar has many features typical of Afro @-@ Asiatic languages , including extensive <unk> in both the derivational and inflectional morphology , gender , possessive suffixes , VSO typology , the causative morpheme / s / , and use of the status <unk> . 
 = = = Morphology = = = 
 Tamazight nouns are inflected for gender , number , and state . Singular masculine nouns usually have the prefix / a- / , and singular feminines the <unk> / t ... t . <unk> may either involve a regular change ( " sound plurals " ) , internal vowel change ( " broken plurals " ) , or a combination of the two . Masculine plurals usually take the prefix / <unk> / , feminines / <unk> / , and sound plurals also take the suffix / -n / in masculine and / -in / } in feminine , although many other plural patterns are found too . 
 Examples : 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' big tent ( s ) ' ( m ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' Berber ( s ) ' ( m ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' sandal ( s ) ' ( m ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' mule ( s ) ' ( m ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' tent ( s ) ' ( f ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' cow ( s ) ' ( f ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' mat ( s ) ' ( f ) 
 / <unk> / → / <unk> / ' property ( ies ) ' ( f ) 
 Nouns may be put into the construct state ( contrasting with free state ) to indicate possession , or when the subject of a verb follows the verb . This is also used for nouns following numerals and some prepositions , as well as the conjunction / d- / ( ' and ' ) . The construct state is formed as follows : in <unk> , initial / a / becomes / u , <unk> , wa / , initial / i / becomes / i , j , ji / , and initial / u / becomes / wu / . In feminines , initial / ta / usually becomes / t / , initial / ti / usually becomes / t / , and initial / tu / remains unchanged . 
 Examples ( in Ayt Ayache ) : 
 / <unk> / ( ← / <unk> / ) ' head of the <unk> 
 / <unk> <unk> / ( ← / <unk> / ) ' the horse of the <unk> 
 Central Atlas Tamazight 's personal pronouns distinguish three persons , and two genders . Pronouns appear in three forms : an independent form used in the subject position , a possessive suffix ( and a derived independent possessive pronoun ) , and an object form affixed to the controlling verb . 
 Demonstrative pronouns distinguish between proximate and remote . When they occur independently , they inflect for number . They may also be suffixed to nouns , e.g. / <unk> / ' this pack @-@ saddle ' . 
 Central Atlas Tamazight verbs are heavily inflected , being marked for tense , aspect , mode , voice , person , and polarity . Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem , modified by prefixes , suffixes , moveable affixes , <unk> , and ablaut . The prefixes indicate voice , tense , aspect , and polarity , while the suffixes indicate mood ( normal , <unk> , or imperative ) . Subject markers are <unk> to the verb , while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms are accompanied by ablaut , and sometimes metathesis . 
 Pronominal complement markers <unk> to the verb , with the indirect object preceding the direct object , e.g. / <unk> @-@ as @-@ t / " he sold it to him " . 
 Attributive Adjectives after the noun they modify , and inflect for number and gender . Adjectives may also occur alone , in which case they become an NP . Practically all adjectives also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes , which behaves just like a normal verb . 
 / argaz <unk> / ' the foolish man ' ( lit . ' man foolish ' ) 
 / <unk> <unk> / ' the foolish <unk> 
 / <unk> <unk> / ' the foolish <unk> 
 / <unk> <unk> / ' the foolish <unk> 
 / i @-@ <unk> <unk> / ' the man is foolish ' ( lit . ' <unk> – foolish man ' ) 
 / argaz i @-@ <unk> @-@ n / ' the foolish man ' [ using a non @-@ finite verb ] 
 Prepositions include / <unk> / ( ' on ' ) , / <unk> / ( ' before ' ) , / <unk> / ( ' to ' ) , and the <unk> / n / ( ' of ' ) and / d / ( ' with , and ' ) . These may take pronominal suffixes . Some prepositions require the following noun to be in the construct state , while others do not . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Word order is usually VSO ( with the subject in construct state ) but sometimes is SVO ( with the subject in free state ) , e.g. ( / <unk> <unk> / vs. / <unk> <unk> / ' the Berber went out ' ) . Tamazight also exhibits pro @-@ drop behavior . 
 Tamazight may use a null copula , but the word / ɡ / ' to be , to do ' can function as a copula in Ayt Ayache , especially in structures preceded by / aj / ' who , which , what ' . 
 wh- questions are always clefts , and multiple wh @-@ questions do not occur . Consequently , Tamazight 's clefting , <unk> , and wh @-@ interrogation contribute to anti @-@ agreement effects , similar to Shilha , and causes deletion of the verbal person marker in certain situations . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 As a result of relatively intense language contact , Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans . Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms , e.g. / <unk> / or / <unk> / ' door ' , the latter used more in rural areas . The contact was unequal , as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages , though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian <unk> ' very reduced vowel systems . 
 Arabic loans span a wide range of lexical classes . Many nouns begin with / l- / , from the Arabic definite prefix , and some Arabic feminines may acquire the native Berber feminine ending / -t / , e.g. / <unk> / for / <unk> / ' fire ' . Many Arabic loans have been integrated into the Tamazight verb lexicon . They adhere fully to inflectional patterns of native stems , and may even undergo ablaut . Even function words are borrowed , e.g. / <unk> / or / <unk> / ' that ' , / <unk> / ' although ' , / <unk> / ' just ' , etc . 
 The first few ( 1 – 3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir ) cardinal numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms . All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic , consistent with the linguistic universals that the numbers 1 – 3 are much more likely to be retained , and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed . The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near @-@ universally use unity as a determiner . 
 Central Atlas Tamazight uses a <unk> negative construction ( e.g. / <unk> <unk> / ' he did not go out ' ) which apparently was modeled after proximate Arabic varieties , in a common development known as Jespersen 's Cycle . It is present in multiple Berber varieties , and is argued to have originated in neighboring Arabic and been adopted by contact .

 = Lex Luthor ( Smallville ) = 
 Lex Luthor is a fictional character from the television series Smallville . He was a series regular from the pilot episode until the season seven finale , and has been played continuously by Michael Rosenbaum , with various actors portraying the character as a child throughout the series . The character of Lex Luthor , first created for comic books by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1940 as nemesis of Superman , was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar — this is only the third time the character has been adapted to a live action television series . The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville television series , none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes . 
 In this 2001 series , Lex Luthor is sent to Smallville , by his father Lionel Luthor , to run the local LuthorCorp fertilizer plant . After driving his car off a bridge , he is saved by Clark Kent and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy . As the series unfolds , Lex 's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship . Lex 's relationship with his father is tension @-@ filled from the start of the show , and eventually comes to an end when Lex murders his father in an effort to discover Clark 's secret . 
 The Smallville incarnation of the character is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character , who walks a fine line between good and evil . Lex is an inquisitive person , and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses — it will ultimately lead him to being Clark 's greatest enemy . Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville . After seven seasons as a series regular , Michael Rosenbaum left the show , but reprised the role for the two @-@ hour series finale .

 Lex Luthor , introduced in the pilot as the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor ( John Glover ) , is sent to Smallville by his father to run the local fertilizer plant . As a child , he is caught in the first meteor shower that renders him completely bald . Years later as a young adult , Lex first meets Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) saving his life from drowning and the two quickly become friends . Lex tries to be a good guy for most of the early seasons , but his motives are usually driven by curiosity for the unexplained , like the day Clark rescued him from drowning . Over the course of seven seasons — beginning in the pilot episode on the day Clark rescued him from drowning — Lex has been trying to uncover the secrets that Clark keeps . 
 In season one , Lex hires Roger Nixon ( Tom O 'Brien ) , a reporter for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor , to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning . All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex 's car , but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone . Around the same time , Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton ( Joe Morton ) ; Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks . Hamilton finds an octagonal disc , with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc 's surface that match those on Clark 's ship , while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989 . The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark 's ship . 
 In season two , Lex 's curiosity with the symbols continues . Lex first kills Nixon before the reporter can kill Jonathan Kent ( John Schneider ) for protecting Clark from Nixon . When Clark discovers the Kawatche Caves , under a LuthorCorp construction site , Lex opts to be the curator of the caves to preserve them after he notices symbols on the cave walls that match the symbols on the disc , as well as an octagonal shape in the wall of the cave that would fit the disc perfectly . His interest grows more and more when he finds Clark constantly in the caves , and later with a piece of paper that appears to indicate that Clark has deciphered the language on the cave walls — although , Clark denies being able to read the language . Lex 's company eventually loses the Kawatche caves to Lionel as his father has also developed an interest in the caves and the octagonal disc . During all this , Lex also met and courted Dr. Helen Bryce ( Emmanuelle Vaugier ) but Helen would try to kill him on their honeymoon . 
 Season three revealed why Lex endured Lionel 's harsh parenting ; his father blames him for his younger brother Julian Luthor 's death , however , Lex took the blame to protect the true killer , his mentally unwell mother Lillian Luthor ( <unk> Down ) , from Lionel 's wraith . Also , Lex 's curiosity into the symbols ( and Clark ) leads to a blowout between the two . When Lionel gives Clark a key to a room in the Luthor Mansion where Lex has been collecting information on Clark 's family , Clark informs Lex that their friendship " is over " . In season four , Lex replaces his father as LuthorCorp 's CEO and turns his attention turns toward finding three ancient stones , which contain the same symbols as those in the cave and on the disc . He fails to find all three stones but suspects that Clark did , and used the stones to find the treasure of knowledge they were supposed to have led to , often having confrontations with Jason Teague ( Jensen Ackles ) . Around this time , Lex 's lifestyle of bedding women and then leaving them the next day would catch up to him when one ( Cobie Smulders ) that he had previously slept with attempts to kill him . 
 In season five , Lex becomes obsessed with uncovering Clark 's secret ; he breaks three <unk> criminals out of Belle Reve and sends them to the Kent Farm , where they hold several people close to Clark hostage . The scheme amounts to nothing , however , and Clark cuts Lex out of life completely upon finding out . His curiosity into the symbols , which he believes to be alien in nature , results in Brainiac ( James Marsters ) arranging him to be possessed by the spirit of the Kryptonian criminal Zod . In season six , Lex married Lana Lang ( Kristin Kreuk ) after deceiving Lana into being pregnant with his child . Upon learning the truth , Lana faked her own death and attempted to pin the murder on Lex . 
 Season seven displayed Lex 's descent into darkness ; he has a brother @-@ like relationship with Grant Gabriel ( Michael Cassidy ) , the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor , until it 's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex 's late brother . After Lex buys the Daily Planet , Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling , thus Lex has his brother 's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging . Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas , which his father is a part of . The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as " The Traveler " would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 . At this time , Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler 's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it . He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler , so Lex sets out to find the device . The device , an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion , leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude , where he is confronted by Clark . Having finally discovered Clark 's secret , Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself . 
 In season eight , Lex is missing and Tess Mercer ( Cassidy Freeman ) is put in charge as Lex 's hand @-@ picked successor . Tess wants Lex found , until Lex is revealed to have a surgically @-@ implanted nano @-@ transmitter in Tess 's optic nerve . Wanting revenge , Lex uses a kryptonite bomb to have Lana 's stolen bio @-@ enhanced suit , designed to absorb and emit kryptonite radiation , absorb the radiation to de @-@ activate the bomb and subsequently never be able to go near Clark again without fatal effects . Oliver Queen ( Justin Hartley ) discovers Lex 's location and uses a bomb to blow up Lex 's travelling medical transport , seemingly killing him . 
 Season ten revealed that Lex had manufactured a number of clones in an attempt to use to heal himself . However , the majority of these clones are flawed and would age at an accelerated rate . One clone of Lex ( Mackenzie Gray ) , aged approximately twenty years older than the original , attempted to get revenge on Clark by trying to kill Lois Lane ( Erica Durance ) but died before he could finish . The 2 @-@ hour series finale reveals Lex had used the parts of other clones to create a composite one but lacked a heart . After an alternate reality version of his father sacrifices himself to Darkseid , Lex speaks with Clark , telling his former friend he accepts they have a destiny as enemies , but neither of them can fulfill their roles unless Clark defeats Darkseid by inspiring humanity . Lex later meets with Tess , and fatally stabs his sister , however , Tess poisons him with a specialized neurotoxin that removes all of Lex 's memories . The series ends by shifting seven years into the future , where Lex had been elected as the President of the United States .

 When crafting Smallville 's version of Lex Luthor , series developers Al Gough and Miles Millar decided that he would not be a precursor to the more comedic role performed by Gene Hackman in the Superman film series ; the pair wanted him to be likeable and vulnerable . The role was difficult to cast , as no one involved in the casting could agree on who they liked for the role . Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series , on the belief that comedians always want to " please and be loved at the same time . " Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice . Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously , Rosenbaum outlined a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ page scene , indicating all the places to be funny , charismatic , or menacing . His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was " the guy " . 
 Before Rosenbaum got the part , Martin Cummins auditioned for the role of Lex Luthor ; Cummins would go on to play Dr. Garner , a neuro @-@ scientist who experiments on Clark , in multiple episodes of Smallville spanning season two and three . Michael Rosenbaum is not the only actor to portray Lex on the show . There have been four other actors that have performed the role ; Matthew Munn , Wayne <unk> , Lucas Grabeel , and Connor Stanhope have all portrayed Lex Luthor as a child in various episodes throughout the series . Rosenbaum relished the opportunities he gets to show Lex 's evil side , even if it is only for a few seconds in earlier seasons . Specifically , he delighted in the chance to " go overboard " , like he did in " Hug " where his character pulls out a machine gun and shoots everything in sight ; to the actor , this gave the audience a glimpse into who Lex was becoming . To portray Lex 's signature bald head , Rosenbaum had to go through more than just a regular head shaving . Not only was his head shaved every day , but he had to undergo hours of make @-@ up treatments on his head , in various color combinations , so that his natural hairline did not show up on film . After seven seasons of portraying Lex Luthor on Smallville , Michael Rosenbaum decided to move on with his acting career , so he departed from the show . On February 11 , 2011 , Michael Ausiello reported that after the back and forth speculation as to whether Rosenbaum would return to the series , the actor finally agreed to appear in the series finale . Rosenbaum expressed that his return for the final episode was for the fans , stating , " I appreciate all of their passion , their relentlessness , and even their threats . "

 Rosenbaum believed that Lex was trying to be a hero in season one , but that his character showed signs of having to fight " ambiguity " and stay on the straight path . The tension @-@ filled relationship with his father , which is first established in the pilot episode , comes to a crossing in the season one finale , when Lex is left with the decision to either help his father remove the structural beam that has fallen on him , or let him die . Rosenbaum wanted the audience to see that Lex was really contemplating what his life would be like if Lionel was no longer around . As Rosenbaum explained the scene : 
 Season two delved deeper into Lex 's darker moments , from the time he wavers to save his father 's life , to his outburst at Jonathan for what he feels is unfair treatment . These moments play into Lex 's psyche . Season three 's " Memoria " finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex 's infant brother , Julian . Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one , when the character was first mentioned in " Stray " , but they wanted to find the right time to explain the situation . The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian 's death as an infant , before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother . 
 Season four began expanding on the series long story arc of Lex 's feelings for Lana . Though the seeds were planted in the second episode of the first season , it was not until season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings . According to Gough , not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague ( Jensen Ackles ) , Lana 's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge , but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself . Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex 's motives from earlier seasons : " You have to ask yourself , in the words of Lex Luthor himself : Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with ? What 's that all about ? " Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as " the darkening of Lex Luthor " . By the time " Aqua " came around , Lex had removed the gloves , as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about , and his dark side began to show its face . Season five also saw Lex 's hunger for power begin to develop , as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat . It was the events of " Lexmas " that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power . In " Lexmas " , Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power . In this alternate reality , without all the power and money that he had originally had , Lex is unable to save Lana , who dies after giving birth to their second child . It is here that Lex decided that he would always " go for the prize " . 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 One of Lex 's key characteristics is his curiosity for the unexplained . Lex 's primary motive for his " shady " actions derives from his curiosity , specifically beginning from the moment he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche . Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex 's curiosity . Rosenbaum believes that Lex 's only sees two options : " For Lex , it 's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad , or find out what 's going on with this strong , strange fellow , Clark Kent . " Another characteristic of Smallville ' s Lex Luthor — one that is being developed over the course of the series — is his evilness . Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex 's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of . In the season two premiere " Vortex " , Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close @-@ up of him after he shoots Nixon , in an effort to open a window into Lex 's darker side . Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience . As Beeman explains Rosenbaum 's thoughts , " ... either Lex is horrified and appalled , or he liked it , and it felt good to him " . According to Rosenbaum , when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind , and " really flips out " , that is the point where the " world needs to hide " . Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti @-@ hero , but also , given that the audience familiar with Lex 's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman 's greatest enemy , make Smallville 's Lex Luthor a " tragic figure [ of ] almost Shakespearean grandeur " . 
 Taking a page out of Chazz Palminteri 's A Bronx Tale , Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk for the season six finale . Here , as Lana is informing Lex that she is going to leave , Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit . Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the audience . To the actor , he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana ; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be . 
 As the seasons progressed , and the character began to grow darker and more sinister , Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene , either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments , or " self @-@ deprecating humor " . One such instance , which became popular with audiences , was in the season six episode " Justice " , where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail . The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue , but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off . To Rosenbaum , this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person , because it is well known that Lex always wanted hair . This moment reflects an earlier episode , where Lex reveals his feelings of <unk> when comparing himself to Clark . In season five 's " Lockdown " , Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville . As writer Steven S. DeKnight describes it , the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider , and that he views Clark as this " perfect person " . DeKnight believes that , from how Clark sees it , Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has , like his family and girlfriend . 
 Lex also develops a craving for power , with that hunger expanding in season five . Al Gough believes that Lex 's political motivations are based on his lust for power . Rosenbaum echoes that opinion , believing that Lex can never get enough ; " Lex is an insatiable character " . Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex 's hunger , and that he will keep going until he is president of the United States . Even then , he will keep trying to make the majority of people like and believe in him . 
 Visually , the character of Lex Luthor has his own characteristics . In Smallville , Lex is usually given a " glass , steel [ colored ] background " , and dressed in a lot of black , grey , and " cool tones " like purples and blues . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Rosenbaum realizes that the friendship between Lex and Clark is destined to fail , but that Clark 's friendship truly is important to Lex early in the series . The actor also believes that if Clark could see the darkness that Lex is constantly fighting then he would understand more of Lex 's actions . Reviewer Brian Byun expressed that the choice to explore the friendship between Clark and Lex , before they become sworn enemies , which was something that had been used in the past but never to the depth of what Smallville is doing , helped keep the show from becoming " Dawson 's Creek with superpowers " . 
 Like Lana , who held emptiness inside her after the loss of her parents , which she tried to fill with the men in her life , Lex attempts to fill his own void , over the loss of his mother , with the women in his life . According to writer Holly Harold , Lex " needs and wants to be loved " . Rosenbaum agrees , and feels that Lex is searching for that " unconditional love " . The actor likens this feeling to one that everyone can relate to , but that Lex fails to achieve with not only the women he develops relationships with , but also with his own father . Rosenbaum and Annette O 'Toole ( Martha Kent ) agree that the only person that could give Lex that love is his mother , who died when he was a child . Whenever they have scenes together , O 'Toole and Rosenbaum try and hint around the idea that Martha wants to provide that love for Lex , because she recognizes that he needs it , and that Lex really wants her to provide it as well . 
 After various failed relationships , Lex finally believes he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang . In " Hypnotic " , in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally , Clark told her that he no longer loved her . This drives Lana into Lex 's arms . Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series , but something that had been hinted at for many seasons . Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years , but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on — he succeeded . When Clark and Lana 's relationship crumbled , because of Clark 's deceit , Lex was waiting . Rosenbaum believes that Lana was " tired of the boy and wanted a man around " . By contrast , Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad , but the relationship " turned into much more " . Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because " she knows she will never really love him . " Kreuk believes that Lana 's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed . This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in " Void " , when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife . Upon meeting her parents , Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her . Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex . Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of " Lexmas " , then Lana would have been able to truly love him . 
 As Rosenbaum describes it , Lex views Lana as this beautiful , charming girl with a little naïveté . It is this naïveté that allows Lex to believe that he can trust and confide in Lana , and that she is his one true love . Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark , but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same . Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex . Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex 's relationship with Lana , and that of Lionel 's relationship with Martha . Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace , and pull them back from the dark side . In Lex 's defense , Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark , but that he really does love her . The actor believes that Lex 's problem lies in the fact that every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt , or betrayed . Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her , he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past . Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters ' lives . It is a moment that solidifies Lex 's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him . 
 It is not just the women in his life that Lex has a difficult time maintaining a healthy relationship with , but his father as well . Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug @-@ of @-@ war , and disagrees with John Glover 's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over . For Rosenbaum , Lex is being pushed and pushed , and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will no longer be able to come back from . In " Vortex " , Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column , and he felt guilty over the situation . According to Rosenbaum , Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path , and would have become all that his father was — evil . As Lex continues to live in his father 's shadow , and as time progresses , he learns more about the " monster " that Lionel truly is . The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex 's grandparents in a tenement fire . Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma — he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone , and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not — and Lex , who can no longer take his father 's abuse , decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI . According to Rosenbaum , the decision is justified to Lex , who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions — using electroshock therapy to erase Lex 's memories , drugging Lex , killing his own parents , and the way he treated Lex 's mother .

 In 2012 , the Smallville series was continued through the comic book medium , with Smallville : Season 11 . Written by Bryan Q. Miller , who also wrote for the television series , the first issue details Lex changing the LuthorCorp name to LexCorp , due to his memory loss in the series finale . Tess Mercer 's death is ruled a suicide , and Lex sells the ownership rights to the Daily Planet . He also begins to question why he would befriend the " unsophisticated " Clark Kent , after reading some newspaper clippings . He immediately harbors distrust with " Superman " , after the latter reveals himself to the world . In addition , there are remnants of memories left for Lex to continue his hatred towards the superhero but have no knowledge of Superman 's secret identity . This leads to a proposal with General Sam Lane to create a joint venture between LexCorp and the Pentagon for the company 's project , " Guardian Defense Platforms " , which involves monitoring the world 's superhuman population . In the second issue , Lex takes steps to regain his lost memories , having his assistant Otis Berg research the neurotoxin Tess used on him , eventually he discovers that the toxin has caused Lex 's brain to operate at a higher percentage than normal , increasing his overall intelligence . In addition , Otis discovers that the toxin not only erased Lex 's memories and enhanced his intelligence , but also caused him to mentally bond with Tess 's consciousness when she poisoned him . Clark and Oliver eventually discover what happened to Tess , and extracts her consciousness from Lex and uploaded it into the Watchtower 's computer until they can clone her a new body . It is also revealed that Lex was friends with Bruce Wayne , the secret identity of Batman , since childhood , but lost touch after the murder of Bruce 's parents . Years later , Bruce is secretly aware that Lex is now corrupt . 
 = Purple @-@ throated cotinga = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga ( Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema ) is a species of bird in the cotinga family , Cotingidae . It is found in the western Amazonian region of South America ; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil . It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range . The purple @-@ throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies . It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism . Males have black upperparts with a bold white <unk> and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks . The throat is a deep purple , giving the bird both its common and scientific names . Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts , buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts , and rufous on the throat . The male has a powerful voice . 
 Little research has been done on this species , and not much is known about its ecology . The purple @-@ throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous , although it does occasionally eat small insects . A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and letting the sunlight reflect off of its iridescent feathers . It is suspected to breed year @-@ round and is non @-@ migratory . Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range , the purple @-@ throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga was originally described in 1852 as Cotinga porphyrolaema by Emile Deville and Philip Sclater from a male specimen collected near the Ucayali River in Peru 's <unk> District . The holotype is kept at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris . However , just two years later the species was split from the genus Cotinga into the monotypic genus Porphyrolaema by Charles Lucien Bonaparte . The generic and specific name of porphyrolaema comes from the Ancient Greek words <unk> " dark purple , " and <unk> , " throat . " 
 While it is structurally similar to the Cotinga species , the purple @-@ throated cotinga differs from them in that it has a heavier , <unk> bill , distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers , and barred underparts in the female . While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species , recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy @-@ dwelling cotingas , specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus <unk> , the cotingas of the genus <unk> , the black @-@ faced cotinga of the monotypic genus <unk> , and the bare @-@ necked <unk> of the monotypic genus <unk> . Of these genera , the molecular analysis suggested that the purple @-@ throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds . This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies . 
 = = Description = = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga is strongly sexually dimorphic as male and female purple @-@ throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage . The male has black upperparts , including the head , wings , and tail . The feathers on the bird 's back to its uppertail coverts , as well as its upperwing coverts , have white fringes . There is also a conspicuous white <unk> and white edges to the tertial feathers . Additionally the male has a deeply purple throat and a white belly , with some black barring on its rear flanks . 
 In contrast , the female purple @-@ throated cotinga is a dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts . The underparts are a buffy cinnamon with black barring . The throat is a deeper , unbarred rufous in coloration . The female 's tail feathers are longer and more pointed at the tip than those of the male . The juvenile purple @-@ throated cotinga resembles a paler , <unk> female ; the plumage of the immature is undescribed . 
 The adult purple @-@ throated cotinga is about 18 @.@ 0 to 18 @.@ 5 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 to 7 @.@ 3 in ) in length and weighs an average of 49 to 60 g ( 1 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 1 oz ) . The cotinga has a very wide bill with a strongly arched culmen and weakly developed rictal bristles . The bird 's iris is dark brown , while the bill and legs are black . 
 This species has a powerful if infrequently @-@ used voice , unlike the structurally @-@ similar Cotinga species , which are mostly silent . The male 's call is a high , plaintive " <unk> " that lasts for one or two seconds while dropping in pitch and is regularly repeated from a treetop perch . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga is found from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru to the Madre de Dios region and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil . The eastern boundary of the species appears to be the lower Rio Negro and northern Mato Grosso in Brazil . The purple @-@ throated cotinga 's total range covers approximately 2 @,@ 190 @,@ 000 km2 ( 850 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , throughout which it occurs in patches at low population densities . 
 The cotinga can be found in the canopy or borders of humid forest up to 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) in elevation , but mostly is restricted to humid forests below 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) . It can be found in either unflooded humid forests or in várzea forests , which are seasonally flooded . It is non @-@ migratory . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga feeds primarily on the fruits of forest trees , most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia . It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates , such as insects . All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off of a tree in the forest canopy . These birds are distinct from similar species in that they are often seen in pairs . This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun . 
 A solitary male purple @-@ throated cotinga attracts a female by perching above the canopy and letting the sun highlight its iridescent plumage . The breeding behavior of this species is largely unknown , but the range in molting times implies that this species may breed year @-@ round . 
 = = Status = = 
 The purple @-@ throated cotinga is not well known and appears to be naturally uncommon or rare across a widespread area ; however , it is almost certainly under @-@ reported due to its canopy lifestyle . The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range . While the IUCN has not estimated the population size , it believes it is declining due to habitat loss . 
 = Al Williamson = 
 Alfonso " Al " Williamson ( March 21 , 1931 – June 12 , 2010 ) was an American cartoonist , comic book artist and illustrator specializing in adventure , Western and science @-@ fiction / fantasy . 
 Born in New York City , he spent much of his early childhood in Bogotá , Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12 . In his youth , Williamson developed an interest in comic strips , particularly Alex Raymond 's Flash Gordon . He took art classes at Burne Hogarth 's Cartoonists and Illustrators School , there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel , who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips . Before long , he was working professionally in the comics industry . His most notable works include his science @-@ fiction / heroic fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s , on titles including Weird Science and Weird Fantasy . 
 In the 1960s , he gained recognition for continuing Raymond 's illustrative tradition with his work on the Flash Gordon comic @-@ book series , and was a seminal contributor to the Warren Publishing 's black @-@ and @-@ white horror comics magazines Creepy and Eerie . Williamson spent most of the 1970s working on his own credited strip , another Raymond creation , Secret Agent X @-@ 9 . The following decade , he became known for his work adapting Star Wars films to comic books and newspaper strips . From the mid @-@ 1980s to 2003 , he was primarily active as an inker , mainly on Marvel Comics superhero titles starring such characters as Daredevil , Spider @-@ Man , and Spider @-@ Girl . 
 Williamson is known for his collaborations with a group of artists including Frank Frazetta , Roy Krenkel , Angelo Torres , and George Woodbridge , which was affectionately known as the " Fleagle Gang " . Williamson has been cited as a stylistic influence on a number of younger artists , and encouraged many , helping such newcomers as Bernie Wrightson and Michael Kaluta enter the profession . He has won several industry awards , and six career @-@ retrospective books about him have been published since 1998 . Living in Pennsylvania with his wife Corina , Williamson retired in his seventies . 
 Williamson was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2000 .

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Al Williamson was born in Manhattan , New York City , New York , one of two children of Sally and Alfonso Williamson , who was of Scottish descent and a Colombian citizen . The family relocated to Bogotá , Colombia , when Al was two years old . " My father was Colombian and my mother was American , " Williamson said in 1997 . " They met in the States , got married and went down there . I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time . It was comic books that taught me to read both languages . " At age nine , Williamson took an interest in comic strips via the Mexican magazine Paquin , which featured American strips as well as Underwater Empire by Argentine cartoonist Carlos <unk> . Later , Williamson was attracted to Alex Raymond 's Flash Gordon strip after his mother took him to see the Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe movie serial . While living in Bogotá he met future cartoonist Adolfo <unk> , who befriended him and gave him artistic advice . At age 12 , in 1943 , Williamson moved with his mother to San Francisco , California ; they later moved to New York . 
 In the mid @-@ 1940s Williamson continued to pursue his interest in cartooning and began to take art classes with Tarzan cartoonist Burne Hogarth , and later at Hogarth 's Cartoonists and Illustrators School . There he met future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel . According to Williamson , " Roy broadened my collecting horizons , he became my guide to all the great illustrators — the artists who directly influenced adventure cartoonists like [ Alex ] Raymond and [ Hal ] Foster . He showed me J.C. Coll , Franklin Booth , Joseph Franke , Dan Smith , Norman Lindsay , Fortunino Matania , and the great Blue Book illustrators like Herbert Morton Stoops and Frank Hoban . " As he continued to learn about the cartooning field , he would visit the comic @-@ book publisher Fiction House , meeting such artists as George Evans , Bob Lubbers , John Celardo , and Mort Meskin . 
 Williamson 's first professional work may have been helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948 , although Williamson , who had initially believed so , reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic @-@ book art : providing spot illustrations for the story " The Ugliest Horse in the World " in an unspecified issue of Eastern Color 's seminal series Famous Funnies , and a two @-@ page Boy Scouts story , his first comics narrative , in New Heroic Comics # 51 ( Nov. 1948 ) . ( Williamson is also identified as co @-@ penciler , with Frank Frazetta , of a three @-@ page crime story , " The Last Three Dimes " , in Standard Comics ' Wonder Comics # 20 [ Oct. 1948 ] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work , Williamson " just couldn 't do it . ... I couldn 't get it into my little brain that he wanted me to do it exactly the way that he did it , " and instead successfully recommended Celardo , artist of the Tarzan @-@ like feature " Ka <unk> " in Fiction House 's Jungle Comics . As Williamson recalled : 
 ... Hogarth got in touch with [ Celardo ] , and the next thing you knew , he was penciling the Sunday page for him . He did it for quite some time and something must have happened ... but at that point I was going to the Hogarth school again in the evenings ... and he asked me again if I would like to give it a try , so I said OK . He gave me a page and he had already laid it out , so I just tightened it up . Then he gave me another page that I tightened up and he inked it . Then I said I 'd like to try laying it out myself and asked if I could do that , and he said , ' Go ahead , Al , ' and handed me the script . So I laid that page out on a sketchpad . He said fine and just made a couple of suggestions as to what I should do ; then I just did it on the big Sunday page , and when I was through , he inked it and the other one I had done the same way , and that was it . 
 During this period Williamson met his main stylistic influence , Raymond : " I had just turned 18 . I had been in the business about six months or so . He gave me about two hours . " 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 From 1949 to 1951 , Williamson worked on science @-@ fiction and Western stories for publishers such as American Comics Group ( AGC ) , Avon Publications , Fawcett Comics , Standard Comics , and , possibly , Toby Press . He began collaborating with Frank Frazetta , who often inked his work ; and with Roy Krenkel , who often did backgrounds . Examples of his work from that period include " Chief Victorio 's Last Stand " , in Avon 's Chief Victorio 's Apache Massacre ( no number , no month , 1951 ) ; " Death in Deep Space " , in Magazine Enterprises ' Jet # 4 ( no month , 1951 ) ; and " Skull of the Sorcerer " , in ACG 's Forbidden Worlds # 3 ( Dec. 1951 ) , inked by Wally Wood 
 In 1952 , upon the suggestion of artists Wally Wood and Joe Orlando , Williamson began working for EC Comics , an influential comic book company with a reputation for quality artists . While at EC , Williamson frequently collaborated with fellow artists Frank Frazetta , Roy Krenkel and Angelo Torres , a group which , along with Nick Meglin and George Woodbridge , became affectionately known as the " Fleagle Gang " , named after a notorious criminal gang . Williamson primarily worked on EC 's science fiction comics Weird Science , Weird Fantasy , and Weird Science @-@ Fantasy , illustrating both original stories , primarily by writer Al <unk> , and adaptations of stories by authors such as Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison , but his work occasionally appeared in EC 's horror and crime comics as well . 
 Williamson worked at EC through 1956 until the cancellation of most of the company 's line . Williamson 's EC art has been lauded for its illustrative flamboyance , evident in such stories as " I , Rocket " , in Weird Fantasy # 20 ( Aug. 1953 ) , co @-@ penciled and co @-@ inked with Frank Frazetta ; and " 50 Girls 50 " , in Weird Science # 20 ( Aug. 1953 ) , co @-@ inked by Williamson and Frazetta . His final published EC story was the 10 @-@ page " A Question of Time " , in Shock Illustrated # 2 ( Feb. 1956 ) with partial inking by Torres , who put his initials on the last page . In the fall of 1956 , writer Larry Ivie introduced Williamson to future comics writers @-@ editor Archie Goodwin , with whom he would become friends and , later , a frequent collaborator . Williamson eventually helped Goodwin enter the comics field , having him script a Harvey Comics story , " The Hermit " , penciled by Reed Crandall and inked by Williamson . 
 From 1955 to 1957 , Williamson produced over 400 pages of three @-@ to @-@ five @-@ page stories for Atlas Comics , the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics , working in various genres but primarily Westerns . He continued to collaborate with Torres and Krenkel , as well as with Gray Morrow , George Woodbridge and Ralph Mayo . With Mayo , one of the first editors to give Williamson work , at Standard Comics , Williamson collaborated on the jungle girl series Jann of the Jungle # 16 – 17 ( April and June 1957 ) . Following Mayo 's death , Williamson drew stories solo for the planned # 18 , but the series was abruptly canceled before that issue could be published . His " prolific though somewhat uneven two @-@ year stint at Atlas " , where he first drew war comics , yielded superlative art in such stories as " The City That Time Forgot " , in Marvel Tales # 144 ( March 1956 ) ; " Menace from the Stars " , in Mystery Tales # 44 ( Aug. 1956 ) ; " The Unknown Ones " , in Astonishing # 57 ( Jan. 1957 ) ; " <unk> " , in Navy Tales # 2 ( March 1957 ) ; and " Helpless " , in Battle # 55 ( Nov. 1957 ) . While " something appeared to be missing from a lot of his Atlas work : enthusiasm , " Williamson 's Atlas Westerns , at least , " form a strongly consistent body of work , characterized by minimal to nonexistent action , a preponderance of closeups and reaction shots , and well @-@ defined figures set against sparse backgrounds . " 
 From 1958 to 1959 Williamson worked for Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall , Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby ( for Race to the Moon # 2 – 3 and Blast @-@ Off # 1 ) . On inking Kirby , Williamson relates : " I remember going up to Harvey and getting work there . They said , ' We haven 't got any work for you , but we have some stories here that Jack penciled . Do you want to ink them ? ' I 'd never really inked anybody else before , but I said , ' Sure , ' because I looked at the stuff , and thought , I can follow this , it 's all there . I inked it and they liked it , and they gave me three or four stories to do . " 
 Additionally , Williamson drew stories for Classics Illustrated ( in collaboration with Crandall and Woodbridge ) ; Canaveral Press 's line of Edgar Rice Burroughs books ( inked by Crandall ) ; Westerns for Dell Comics ( including Gunsmoke # 8 – 12 ) and Charlton Comics , including two complete issues of the Cheyenne Kid , ( # 10 – 11 ) with Angelo Torres , and science @-@ fiction stories for ACG ( including " The Vortex " , in Forbidden Worlds # 69 ( 1958 ) . He also worked with former EC artist John Severin on the " American Eagle " feature in Prize Comics Western # 109 and 113 ( 1955 ) . 
 Williamson 's work during this decade was his most prolific in terms of comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality . He has been noted for his perfectionism and love for the medium . Despite its high reputation , S.C. <unk> felt that Williamson 's artwork from this period could at times be uneven and uninspired . Williamson was single during this period and , according to The Art of Al Williamson , had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle .

 In 1960 , with little work to be found in the comic book field due to a downturn in the industry , he went to work as an assistant to John Prentice on the Alex Raymond @-@ created comic strip Rip Kirby for a three @-@ year period . According to Williamson : " The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac [ Al McWilliams ] , John 's prior assistant , didn 't want to go ... The deal was : would I be willing to go to Mexico ? ... and I said ' Si ! ' ... " It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson , as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods . According to Prentice : " ... he was terrific . He 's the best guy I ever had by far . " During that time , Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg . He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise . 
 He returned to comics in 1965 doing one story each in Gold Key Comics ' Ripley 's Believe It or Not # 1 ( June 1965 ) , The Twilight Zone # 12 ( Aug. 1965 ) , and Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery # 11 ( Sept . 1965 ) , and helped launch Warren Publishing 's black @-@ and @-@ white horror @-@ comics magazines Creepy and Eerie with several stories in early issues , while contributing to Warren 's war comics magazine Blazing Combat . He was instrumental in recruiting other former EC Comics artists as Frazetta , Krenkel , Torres , Crandall , and Evans , as well as artist Gray Morrow and writer @-@ editor Archie Goodwin . 
 In 1966 , he drew the first issue ( Sept . 1966 ) of a new Flash Gordon comic book series , published by King Features . Williamson 's work received positive reader response , and returned to draw issues # 4 – 5 ( March and May 1967 ) , as well as the cover of # 3 ( Jan. 1967 ) . Williamson received a National Cartoonist Society Best Comic Book art award for his work on that title . In 1967 , on the strength of a backup feature he had done in the Flash Gordon book , he took over another Alex Raymond creation , the long @-@ running Secret Agent X @-@ 9 comic strip , collaborating with writer Goodwin . At the start of their tenure , the title was changed to Secret Agent Corrigan . 
 Williamson helped assemble the first major book on Alex Raymond 's Flash Gordon , published by Nostalgia Press in 1967 , and wrote the introduction . In 1969 , Wally Wood 's alternative @-@ press comic book <unk> # 1 published Williamson 's " Savage World " , a 1956 story originally drawn for a Buster Crabbe comic book that had been cancelled . With significant contributions by Frazetta , Krenkel , and Torres , the story is a prime sample of the " Fleagle Gang " style and has since been reprinted by Marvel Comics ( in the black @-@ and @-@ white comics magazine Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction # 1 , January 1975 ) , Pacific Comics and Kitchen Sink Press . Wood would later write the script for a three @-@ page story drawn by Williamson , " The Tube " , in another alternative @-@ press comic , publisher Flo Steinberg 's Big Apple Comix ( 1975 ) . 
 By the end of the decade , Williamson was beginning to encourage younger artists whom he would meet at comic book conventions , helping Bernie Wrightson to enter the comics profession . 
 = = = 1970s = = = 
 Williamson worked on Secret Agent Corrigan through the 1970s until he left the strip in 1980 . The first Corrigan anthology was published in France in 1975 , Le FBI <unk> et <unk> , reprinting Williamson 's first episode on the feature . He returned to Warren Publishing in 1976 and again in 1979 to draw three additional stories in Creepy ( # 83 , 86 , 112 ) . These were published in France in the collection Al Williamson : A la fin de l <unk> in 1981 . 
 He drew a few more stories for Gold Key Comics , in Grimm 's Ghost Stories # 5 and 8 ( Aug. 1972 , March 1973 ) , and The Twilight Zone # 51 ( Aug. 1973 ) , as well two mystery stories for DC Comics , in The Witching Hour # 14 ( May 1971 ) , with inker Carlos Garzon , and House of Mystery # 185 ( April 1970 ) , with Michael Kaluta , another artist whom he helped enter the professional field , assisting him . Comics historian Les Daniels noted that " Williamson 's atmospheric technique , which relied on subtle textures as much as hard lines , was not typical of traditional DC art " and that editor Joe Orlando " got complaints from the production department " over using Williamson 'a art . He drew various Flash Gordon illustrations . In the burgeoning fan movement , Williamson became an early subject of comics historians with the publication of Jim Vadeboncoeur 's Al Williamson : His Work in 1971 and the " Al Williamson Collector " by James Van Hise , featured in the fanzine Rocket 's Blast <unk> in the early 1970s . Samples of his sketches appear in various fanzines of the period . Marvel Comics began regularly reprinting Williamson 's 1950 Atlas Comics Western stories , starting with The Ringo Kid # 1 ( Jan. 1970 ) and Kid Colt , Outlaw # 147 ( June 1970 ) , further introducing Williamson 's early work to a latter @-@ day generation . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 After leaving the Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip , he illustrated The Empire Strikes Back for Marvel Comics ' Star Wars movie adaptations with Carlos Garzon , as well as the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic . Williamson was <unk> ' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip , a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time . He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm 's specific request , as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson 's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work . Writer Archie Goodwin cited " the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson , an old friend that I 've worked with over the years . He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have . That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer , you have an artist that will make it look great . He 's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material . There was that comfort factor in it as well . " 
 A comic book adaptation of the Dino De Laurentiis ' film , Flash Gordon , written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Al Williamson , was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats to coincide with the film 's release . A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones , who played Flash Gordon , was pasted into the original cover art . It was serialized in three issues of Whitman 's Flash Gordon comic book , # 31 @-@ 33 , March – May 1981 . Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages . According to Williamson , " It was the hardest job I ever had to do in my life . " He then began drawing the Star Wars comic strip in February 1981 following Alfredo Alcala 's tenure , with Goodwin writing . He drew the daily and Sunday feature until March 11 , 1984 when the strip was canceled . Williamson 's daily strips on this series were completely reprinted in Russ Cochran 's three @-@ volume slipcase edition in 1991 . 
 Returning to comic books full @-@ time for the first time since 1959 , Williamson began work for Pacific Comics , collaborating with writer Bruce Jones for the Alien Worlds title ( # 1 , 4 , 8 ) , and " Cliff Hanger " , a six @-@ issue adventure @-@ strip backup feature in the Somerset Holmes miniseries . For Marvel , he illustrated the Blade Runner and Return of the Jedi movie adaptations . The two Archie Goodwin stories he illustrated for Epic Illustrated ( " Relic " in issue # 27 , 1984 ; and " Out of Phase " , in # 34 , 1986 ) have been considered to be some of his finest work , and Williamson himself named " Relic " as one of his best works . He drew a short story for <unk> # 4 and the full issue of Star Wars # 98 . For DC Comics , he penciled and inked an eight @-@ page story by Elliot S. <unk> for Superman # 400 ( Oct. 1984 ) and he inked Rick Veitch on the classic , oft reprinted Alan Moore Superman / Swamp Thing story " The Jungle Line " in DC Comics Presents # 85 ( Sept . 1985 ) . 
 Following the expiration of his contract on the Star Wars newspaper strip , Williamson found that the weight of doing both pencil and inks suddenly became stressful to him , drastically reducing his output . As a response to this , in the mid @-@ 1980s Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an inker , beginning at DC Comics inking Curt Swan on Superman # 408 – 410 and # 412 – 416 . The longtime Man of Steel artist would later describe Williamson as " his favorite inker " . Williamson then moved to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as John Romita , Jr . , Gene Colan , John Buscema , Rick Leonardi , Pat <unk> , Mike Mignola , Lee Weeks , and many others . John Romita , Sr. , Marvel 's art director during that time , considered Williamson to be " one of the best pencillers in the world but he really can 't make a living at penciling because he wants to do these beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them . That 's why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he 's working with . " He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997 . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 Williamson provided the covers and additional artwork for Dark Horse Comics ' 20 @-@ issue Classic Star Wars ( Aug. 1992 – June 1994 ) , which reprinted his Star Wars daily strips . He later inked the Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace and A New Hope film adaptations for the company . Through 2003 , he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles , including Daredevil ( # 248 – 300 ) , Spider @-@ Man 2099 ( # 1 – 25 ) , and Spider @-@ Girl ( # 1 – 61 ) , and such non @-@ superhero projects as the four @-@ issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age ( Nov. 1990 - Feb. 1991 ) , by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto , for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker . Daredevil penciler John Romita , Jr. recalled that , " Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [ comics artist John Romita , Sr. ] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes . ... If my art wasn ’ t correct , then Al would repair it . Oddly enough , Al said he never had to fix anything , claiming he just ' traced ' over my pencils . " In a 1988 interview Williamson indeed stated that " I 'm just tracing [ Romita 's ] pencils " and claimed that the only changes he made were occasionally leaving out an unnecessary background if he was in a rush . 
 In 1995 , Marvel released a two @-@ part Flash Gordon miniseries written by Mark Schultz and drawn by Williamson , which was his last major work doing both pencils and inks . Also with Schultz , he illustrated the short story " One Last Job " for Dark Horse Presents # 120 in 1997 . In 1999 , he drew the Flash Gordon character a final time when regular cartoonist Jim Keefe asked for his help on a Flash Gordon Sunday page . 
 = = = Later life and career = = = 
 Since 1998 , there have been six career retrospective books published ( see " Further Reading " section ) . Williamson cooperated with their production , with the exception of the books from Pure Imagination . He was interviewed for the 2003 Frank Frazetta documentary Painting with Fire , along with fellow surviving " Fleagle Gang " members Angelo Torres and Nick Meglin . In 2009 , a Williamson illustrated Sub @-@ Mariner story written by Schultz and dedicated to Sub @-@ Mariner creator Bill Everett was published . The story itself was originally drawn ten years previously . Williamson illustrated a " <unk> Tales " story written by Schultz that remains unpublished . 
 Living in Pennsylvania with his wife Corina , Williamson retired in his seventies and died on June 12 , 2010 , in Upstate New York . Some premature reports , based on unsubstantiated Twitter claims , erroneously gave June 13 , 2010 .

 = Battle of Ticonderoga ( 1759 ) = 
 The 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga was a minor confrontation at Fort Carillon ( later renamed Fort Ticonderoga ) on July 26 and 27 , 1759 , during the French and Indian War . A British military force of more than 11 @,@ 000 men under the command of General Sir Jeffery Amherst moved artillery to high ground overlooking the fort , which was defended by a garrison of 400 Frenchmen under the command of Brigadier General François @-@ Charles de Bourlamaque . 
 Rather than defend the fort , de Bourlamaque , operating under instructions from General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm and New France 's governor , the Marquis de Vaudreuil , withdrew his forces , and attempted to blow up the fort . The fort 's powder magazine was destroyed , but its walls were not severely damaged . The British then occupied the fort , which was afterwards known by the name Fort Ticonderoga . They embarked on a series of improvements to the area and began construction of a fleet to conduct military operations on Lake Champlain . 
 The French tactics were sufficient to prevent Amherst 's army from joining James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham . However , they also tied up 3 @,@ 000 of their own troops that were not able to assist in Quebec 's defense . The capture of the fort , which had previously repulsed a large British army a year earlier , contributed to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The French and Indian War , which started in 1754 over territorial disputes in what are now western Pennsylvania and upstate New York , had finally turned in the favor of the British in 1758 following a string of defeats in 1756 and 1757 . The British were successful in capturing Louisbourg and Fort Frontenac in 1758 . The only significant French victory in 1758 came when a large British army commanded by James Abercrombie was defeated by a smaller French force in the Battle of Carillon . During the following winter , French commanders withdrew most of the garrison from Fort Carillon ( called Ticonderoga by the British ) to defend Quebec City , Montreal and French @-@ controlled forts on the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River . 
 Carillon , located near the southern end of Lake Champlain , occupied a place that was strategic in importance even before Samuel de Champlain discovered it in 1609 , controlling access to a key portage trail between Champlain and Lake George along the main travel route between the Hudson River valley and the Saint Lawrence River . When the war began , the area was part of the frontier between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada , and the British had stopped French advances further south in the 1755 Battle of Lake George . 
 = = = British planning = = = 
 For the 1759 campaign , British secretary of state , William Pitt , ordered General Jeffery Amherst , the victor at Louisbourg , to lead an army into Canada by sailing north on Lake Champlain , while a second force under James Wolfe , who distinguished himself while serving under Amherst at Louisbourg , was targeted at the city of Quebec via the Saint Lawrence . Instructions were sent to the governors of the Thirteen Colonies to raise up 20 @,@ 000 provincial militia for these campaigns . About 8 @,@ 000 provincial men were raised and sent to Albany by provinces as far south as Pennsylvania and New Jersey . New York sent 3 @,@ 000 men and New Jersey sent 1 @,@ 000 . Massachusetts mustered 6 @,@ 500 men ; about 3 @,@ 500 went to Albany , while the remainder were dispatched for service with Wolfe at Quebec or other service in Nova Scotia . The balance of the provincial men came from the other New England provinces and Pennsylvania . When Quaker Pennsylvania balked at sending any men , Amherst convinced them to raise men by threatening to withdraw troops from forts in the Ohio River Valley on the province 's western frontier , which were regularly subjected to threats from Indians and the French . 
 When Amherst learned through Sir William Johnson that the Iroquois League was prepared to support British efforts to drive the French out of their frontier forts , he decided to send an expedition to capture Fort Niagara . He sent 2 @,@ 000 of the provincials west from Albany along with 3 @,@ 000 regular troops under Brigadier General John Prideaux in May . He led the remainder of the provincials , consisting primarily of Massachusetts , New Jersey , and Connecticut men , north to Fort Edward , where they joined 6 @,@ 000 regular troops ( about 2 @,@ 000 Royal Highlanders , as well as the 17th , 27th , and 53rd regiments of foot , the 1st Battalion of the 60th Foot , about 100 Royal Artillery , 700 of Rogers ' Rangers , and 500 light infantry under Thomas Gage ) . 
 = = = French planning = = = 
 In the 1759 campaign , French war planners directed most of their war resources into the European theater of the Seven Years ' War . In February , France 's war minister , Marshal Belle @-@ Isle , notified General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm , who was responsible for the defense of Canada , that he would not receive any significant support from France , due in large part to English naval domination of the Atlantic and the risks associated with sending a large military force under those circumstances . Belle @-@ Isle impressed on Montcalm the importance of maintaining at least a foothold in North America , as the territory would be virtually impossible to retake otherwise . Montcalm responded , " Unless we have unexpected luck , or stage a diversion elsewhere within North America , Canada will fall during the coming campaign season . The English have 60 @,@ 000 men , we have 11 @,@ 000 . " 
 Montcalm decided to focus French manpower on defending the core territory of Canada : Montreal , the city of Quebec , and the Saint Lawrence River Valley . He placed 3 @,@ 000 troops from the la Reine and Berry regiments under Brigadier General François @-@ Charles de Bourlamaque for the defense south of Montreal , of which around 2 @,@ 300 were assigned to Fort Carillon . He knew ( after his own experience in the previous year 's battle there ) that this force was too small to hold Carillon against a determined British attack by competent leaders . Instructions from Montcalm and New France 's governor , the Marquis de Vaudreuil , to de Bourlamaque were to hold Carillon as long as possible , then to destroy it , as well as the nearby Fort St. Frédéric , before retreating toward Montreal . 
 = = British advance and French retreat = = 
 Although General Amherst had been ordered to move his forces " as early in the year , as on or about , the 7th of May , if the season shall happen to permit " , Amherst 's army of 11 @,@ 000 did not leave the southern shores of Lake George until July 21 . There were several reasons for the late departure . One was logistical ; Prideaux 's expedition to forts Oswego and Niagara also departed from Albany ; another was the slow arrival of provincial militias . 
 When his troops landed and began advancing on the fort , Amherst was pleased to learn that the French had abandoned the outer defenses . He still proceeded with caution , occupying the old French lines from the 1758 battle on July 22 , amid reports that the French were actively loading bateaux at the fort . His original plan had been to flank the fort , denying the road to Fort St. Frédéric as a means of French escape . In the absence of French resistance outside the fort , he decided instead to focus his attention on the fort itself . 
 For the next three days , the British entrenched and began laying siege lines to establish positions near the fort . This work was complicated by the fact there was little <unk> ground near the fort , and sandbags were required to protect the siege works . During this time , the French gun batteries fired , at times quite heavily , on the British positions . On July 25 , a detachment of Rogers ' Rangers launched some boats onto the lake north of the fort and cut a log boom the French had placed to prevent ships from moving further north on the lake . By July 26 , the British had pulled artillery to within 600 feet ( 180 m ) of the fort 's walls . 
 Bourlamaque had withdrawn with all but 400 of his men to Fort St. Frédéric as soon as he learned that the British were approaching . The cannon fire by this small force killed five and wounded another 31 of the besieging British . Captain Louis @-@ Philippe Le <unk> d <unk> , who had been left in command of the fort , judged on the evening of July 26 that it was time to leave . His men aimed the fort 's guns at its walls , laid mines , and put down a powder trail to the overstocked powder magazine . They then lit the fuse and abandoned the fort , leaving the French flag flying . The British were notified of this action by the arrival of French deserters . General Amherst offered 100 guineas to any man willing to enter the works to find and douse the fuse ; but no one was willing to take up the offer . The entire works went off late that evening with a tremendous roar . The powder magazine was destroyed , and a number of wooden structures caught fire due to flying embers , but the fort 's walls were not badly damaged . After the explosion , some of Gage 's light infantry rushed into the fort and retrieved the French flag . Fires in the fort were not entirely extinguished for two days . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The British began occupying the fort the next day . In one consequence of the French forces ' hasty departure from Carillon , one of their scouting parties returned to the fort , believing it to still be in French hands ; forty men were taken prisoner . 
 The retreating French destroyed Fort St. Frédéric on July 31 , leaving the way clear for the British to begin military operations on Lake Champlain ( denying the British access to Champlain had been the reason for the existence of both forts ) . However , the French had a small armed fleet , which would first need to be neutralized . The time needed to capture and effect some repairs to the two forts , as well as the need to build ships for use on Lake Champlain , delayed Amherst 's forces further and prevented him from joining General Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec . Amherst , worried that Bourlamaque 's retreat might be leading him into a trap , spent August and September overseeing the construction of a small navy , Fort Crown Point ( a new fort next to the ruins of Fort St. Frédéric ) , and supply roads to the area from New England . 
 On October 11 , Amherst 's army began to sail and row north on Lake Champlain to attack Bourlamaque 's position at the Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix in the Richelieu River . Over the next two days , one of the French ships was captured ; the French abandoned and burned the others to prevent their capture . On October 18 , he received word of Quebec 's fall . As there was an " appearance of winter " ( parts of the lake were beginning to freeze ) , and provincial militia enlistments were set to end on November 1 , Amherst called off his attack , dismissed his militia forces , and returned the army to winter quarters . 
 The British definitively gained control of Canada with the surrender of Montreal in 1760 . The fort , which had always been called Ticonderoga by the British ( after the place where the fort is located ) , was held by them through the end of the French and Indian War . Following that war , it was manned by small garrisons until 1775 , when it was captured by American militia early in the American Revolutionary War .

 Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> <unk> ファイナルファンタジー , Hepburn : <unk> Nova <unk> Fainaru Fantajī ) is a series of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise , developed and published by Square Enix . While featuring various worlds and different characters , each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing around important crystals tied to deities . The series title translates from Latin as ' The New Tale of the Crystal ' . The original titles in the series were handled by Square Enix 's 1st Production Department , with each development team given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game 's story . 
 The series , originally announced in 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII , currently consists of six games across multiple platforms . Final Fantasy XIII , designed as the series ' flagship title , was released in 2009 . The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles , including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama . The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima . The first games made for the series were Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV ( as Versus XIII ) , with Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 ( as Agito XIII ) coming later . All three games went through delays . After XIII and Type @-@ 0 's releases , their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games . For later games , other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development . 
 As of 2015 , five titles have been released in the series , and two further titles , Final Fantasy XV and Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 Online , are in production . Individual games have generally received a positive reception , although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three XIII games . Reception of the mythos ' use in the released games has also been mixed : while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series , others were impressed by its scope and use . The series is complemented by works in related media , including companion books , novelizations , and manga .

After XIII @-@ 2 's Japanese release , two books were released detailing events not shown or described in the game : Fragments Before , released in December 2011 ; and Fragments After , released in June 2012 . Only Episode i has received an official English translation and release , as a pre @-@ order bonus for the game from American electronics store Best Buy . Lightning Returns was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game 's Japanese release in November 2013 , however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill . A three @-@ part novella exclusive to Famitsu Weekly magazine titled Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence : tracer of memories was released across June and July 2014 . It was written by Daisuke Watanabe , who handled the scripts for the XIII games , and takes place immediately after the ending of Lightning Returns . Reminiscence was later released online . 
 Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 received a manga adaptation illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa . It began publication in the November 2011 of Young Gangan and was collected into a single volume and released in April 2012 . The manga was translated into English and released as part of the western collector 's edition for Type @-@ 0 HD , available exclusively through Square Enix 's online store . A second manga following one of the game 's secondary characters , Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 Side Story : Reaper of the Icy Blade ( <unk> 氷剣の死神 , Fainaru Fantajī Reishiki Gaiden <unk> no Shinigami ) , began serialization in May 2012 . The latter manga was created by Shiozawa under direct supervision by Tetsuya Nomura . The manga ended in January 2014 , with a bonus chapter released in February of the same year . It will be released in the west in July 2015 , licensed by Yen Press . Two novels detailing an alternate version of Type @-@ 0 , titled Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 : Change the World ( ファイナルファンタジー零式 Change the World ) , were released in April and June 2012 . Agito received another Change the World novel adaptation focusing on two of the game 's supporting characters . Ultimania guides and companion books have been released for the majority of released games . 
 XV similarly had additional media released around it , forming a dedicated multimedia expansion dubbed the " Final Fantasy XV Universe " . The majority of its content fleshed out the background for XV 's plot , which would have required multiple video games under normal circumstances . An anime produced by Square Enix and A @-@ 1 Pictures , Brotherhood : Final Fantasy XV , details the backstories of the main cast and how they came to be journeying together . It is being distributed online through the months leading up to the game 's release . A CGI feature film produced by the same team as Advent Children , Kingsglaive : Final Fantasy XV , is set for release in 2016 prior to the game 's own release : it focuses on the main character 's father Regis <unk> Caelum , alongside original characters . While comparing the Final Fantasy XV Universe to the overall structure of Fabula Nova Crystallis , the game 's director defined it as an attempt to make the narrative of XV work in current times rather than attempting to " reinvent " the original concept . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The entries in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series share the same mythology , interpreted differently and referred to in varying degrees for each of the game worlds . The mythos ' deities hold similar roles in the games , but are not the same characters in a narrative sense . While the mythos is still present in XV , it was " disconnected " from the " framework " , with specific terminology being removed and its emphasis reduced to become a background element for the world and story . The universes of XIII , Type @-@ 0 and XV are unrelated to each other , though common elements and themes are present . The first is a common narrative theme of harmful interference by the mythos ' deities in the affairs of humans , and those humans ' choice of whether to accept or challenge the predetermined fates given to them . Tetsuya Nomura defined this theme as " a battle of the gods that lies behind each tale and gives it inspiration in a different way " . The second common element is the structure of the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe , which is divided in two : the mortal world , where humans live , and the afterlife or Unseen Realm ( <unk> , <unk> sekai , lit . " Invisible World " ) . 
 In the mythology , the god Bhunivelze ( <unk> , <unk> ) seizes control of the mortal world by killing his mother , the creator goddess Mwynn ( <unk> , <unk> ) , who vanishes into the Unseen Realm . Believing that the mortality of the world is Mwynn 's curse , Bhunivelze creates three new deities to search for the gate to the Unseen Realm so he can control both worlds . The first deity , Pulse ( <unk> , <unk> ) , is tasked with terraforming the world ; the second deity , Etro ( <unk> , <unk> ) , is discarded because of her resemblance to Mwynn ; the third deity , Lindzei ( <unk> , <unk> ) , acts as his protector . Bhunivelze then enters a deep sleep , while Lindzei and Pulse carry out their missions . Distraught at being abandoned , Etro kills herself , and humans are born from her blood . Once in the Unseen Realm , Etro finds Mwynn being consumed by a force called chaos , which threatens to destroy reality . As Mwynn fades , she tasks Etro with protecting the balance between the worlds . Etro gives humans pieces of chaos that become their " hearts " . Because humans held chaos within them , they maintained the balance through their death and reincarnation . Since then , humans have either worshiped or feared Pulse and Lindzei , and refer to Etro as the goddess of death . 
 A recurring race in the games are god @-@ like beings created by Pulse and Lindzei to act as their servants in the mortal world . In the original mythos and the XIII games , the demigods are called fal 'Cie / <unk> / . They take the form of crystal @-@ powered mechanical beings in the XIII games . In the universe of Type @-@ 0 , they are both semi @-@ sentient crystals and humanoid beings living among the people . The fal 'Cie have the ability to imbue chosen humans with magical powers and assign them a task to complete either willingly or unwillingly . XIII and Type @-@ 0 refer to these people as l 'Cie / <unk> / and the task given to them as a Focus . In the worlds of XIII and Type @-@ 0 , there are two possible outcomes for l 'Cie : once their Focus is fulfilled , they can go into ' crystal stasis ' , transforming into a crystal statue , and gain eternal life , but if they fail they become mindless crystalline monsters . In Type @-@ 0 , l 'Cie are chosen by the crystal of their country , and given great power to fulfill their assigned Focus , but lose their memories if emotionally unstable . While not referred to as such using the original terminology , humans imbued with magic exist , one of them being the main protagonist <unk> . 
 A common element not related to the mythos , themes or plots of the series is the use of Latin in the games ' titles or worlds , often as key words to describing themes and story points : the series ' title translates as ' The New Tale of the Crystal ' , ' Agito ' roughly translates as " to put into motion " , while ' Versus ' translates as both " to turn around " and " against " , which were described as representing key narrative concepts . ' Agito ' was kept within the Type @-@ 0 universe with both an in @-@ universe concept and the title of its prequel . ' Versus ' was used in early trailers for XV after its re @-@ reveal in 2013 , carrying the tagline ' A World of the Versus Epic ' . Commenting on the high use of Latin in XV prior to its public name change , Nomura stated that he wanted a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people " won 't be able to understand and yet appreciate " , desiring a sense of general equality .

 The concept for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series originated while Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 and the original Kingdom Hearts were being completed . Discussing what to do after the completion of Final Fantasy XII , Nomura , Shinji Hashimoto and Yoshinori Kitase decided to build upon the idea of multiple games connected by a single " central theme " . This came from the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII , a multimedia subseries featuring the world and characters of Final Fantasy VII . Whereas the common link in the Compilation was VII , the three chose to use " the tale of new crystals " for the new series , with the mythos connecting the games rather than an overarching narrative . Another key idea behind the mythos was to ease the production of future Final Fantasy games by providing an established mythos . Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima started writing the original mythology for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series in 2003 , finishing it by February 2004 . During his work , he received creative input from game producers Hashimoto and Kitase , as well as Nomura , Motomu Toriyama and Hajime Tabata . Nojima wrote a series bible about the mythology , explaining concepts such as the fal 'Cie and l 'Cie and the feelings of the gods who created them . This bible became the basis for a video animated by Yusuke Naora 's art team to showcase the Fabula Nova Crystallis story in 2011 . 
 The individual directors are allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games . When referring to this freedom , Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology ; a mythology with common themes and deities , but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories . Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos ' deities and their direct relations to the world . Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the human side of the story . Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type @-@ 0 , while Nomura created a modern @-@ day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV , referring far less to the mythos ' terminology . Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries . In a 2007 interview , Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings : an expansive brand on which to build multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance . The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Final Fantasy XIII began development in February 2004 . It began as a title for the PlayStation 2 under the codename " Colors World " , however it was moved onto PlayStation 3 after the positively received Crystal Tools engine demo in 2005 and the delayed release of XII . The original titles in the series were XIII and Versus XIII . Agito XIII was conceived later , when Tabata was looking for a new project after finishing Before Crisis : Final Fantasy VII . Originally titled Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII , the three titles were announced at E3 2006 : Agito XIII was a mobile phone title similar to Before Crisis and the other two were PS3 exclusives . XIII was developed by team members who had also previously worked on Final Fantasy VII , VIII and X , Agito XIII was handled by staff from Before Crisis , while Versus XIII 's development was headed by the team behind the console Kingdom Hearts games . XIII and Versus XIII were intended to form the core of the series , with future games each being a " facet " of XIII . 
 Agito XIII and Versus XIII both began production in 2006 . By 2008 , Agito XIII had been moved onto the PlayStation Portable , then later renamed Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 . The stated reason for the change of title was that XIII and Type @-@ 0 shared little besides the core mythos . The title change also resulted in the " XIII " numeral being dropped from the series title as it " would have been an issue " . Late in its development , XIII also changed from being an exclusive when an Xbox 360 version was announced , significantly delaying its release . A port for Microsoft Windows was considered , but not followed up due to platform @-@ specific concerns and the company 's view of the video game market . Later , all three XIII games would receive PC ports through Steam . As early as 2007 , Square Enix considered re @-@ branding Versus XIII as a numbered entry in the main series due to the rapidly growing scale of the project . The game was eventually re @-@ branded in 2011 , though it still used the subseries ' mythos . The game was also moved fully onto eighth generation consoles and developed using the company 's new Luminous Studio engine . The PS3 version was abandoned due to concerns about the console 's continued viability . Type @-@ 0 's western release was delayed due to the flagging PSP market in western territories . A high @-@ definition port to the same platforms as XV was co @-@ developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive , and was eventually announced for a western release . It was developed with the intention of boosting console sales prior to the latter 's release . XV eventually had help from multiple developers , including HexaDrive , <unk> Entertainment , Avalanche Studios and Umbra . 
 After the release of Final Fantasy XIII , the creators wanted to expand on the game 's setting and tell more stories about the characters , so XIII @-@ 2 and Lightning Returns were developed . For these games , Japanese developer tri @-@ Ace was brought in to help with the games ' design and graphics . The three games and their respective tie @-@ in media were referred to as the " Lightning Saga " by Square Enix staff after the games ' central character . Alongside that , Tabata created Agito around his original ideas for Type @-@ 0 as a mobile title . Agito acted as both a prequel to Type @-@ 0 and an alternate story set within its world . The game was co @-@ developed by mobile game developer <unk> K. K. Later , Chinese developer Perfect World were brought in to help with Type @-@ 0 Online . A trademark for Final Fantasy <unk> XIII hinted at another entry , but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew . While there was speculation that Fabula Nova Crystallis would end with Lightning Returns , Kitase repeatedly stated that there was still room for further titles beyond the XIII universe . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos has received mixed reactions from gaming sites . Hardcore Gamer 's Brady Hale called the series " anything but ordinary " in the variety of games it featured . In an article concerning the 25th Anniversary event for the Final Fantasy series , Joystiq 's Ben Gilbert called the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos " occasionally bizarre and often beautiful " . In 2014 , Jeremy Parish of USGamer said that the series was " much ado about nothing " , stating that since the games shared a large amount of themes and plot points with the main series , there seemed little reason for a distinction . TechnoBuffalo 's Ron Duwell , in an article concerning a documentary video on XV , called the series " overly ambitious " , but felt that it was worth Fabula Nova Crystallis " [ imploding ] upon itself " if XV fulfilled its promises . 
 Speaking about the XIII games in particular , Parish suggested that their mixed reactions influenced the title changes of other games in the original series , giving the teams a chance to give those games more of their own identity . He also felt that the decision to expand the XIII storyline into multiple games " probably worked out just as well " . The presentation of the mythos and its terms received mixed reactions in XIII , resulting in the production team toning down their use for XIII @-@ 2 . Siliconera writer Spencer Yip , in his review of Lightning Returns , commented that the story and pace of the game was " muddled " by the mythos . In 2016 , RPGFan writer Mike Salbato wrote a retrospective of the XIII games and their version of Fabula Nova Crystallis : he felt that the lack of specific references to the mythos in XIII had harmed general comprehension , and that a reliance on foreknowledge made its sequels difficult to play as standalone titles . In contrast , the portrayal of the mythos in Type @-@ 0 was praised by RPG Site 's Erren Van Duine in an import review of the title , with him saying that " elements such as l 'Cie and fal 'Cie are handled in much more interesting ways " . 
 Final Fantasy XIII was positively received in Japanese magazines , garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation . In the west , the game was praised for its graphics , battle system , and music , but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure . XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadar 's 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards . XIII @-@ 2 received a positive reception overall , gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation , and high scores from most western sites . Common points of praise were its non @-@ linear nature , improved battle system and graphics , while the main points of criticism were its story and characters , which were often called weak , confusing or both . Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews , with its combat being highly praised , its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses , and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed . 
 Type @-@ 0 had a highly positive reception in Japan , with it garnering near @-@ perfect scores in Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation . Import reviews were also fairly positive , sharing many points of praise with the Japanese reviews . Type @-@ 0 HD also received a positive reception in the west , with main praise going to the story , characters and action @-@ based gameplay . Other aspects came in for criticism , such as elements of the graphics upgrade , the real @-@ time strategy segments , and the localization . Western previews of Agito have also been positive , with critics agreeing that it looked good on the platform and worked well from a gameplay standpoint .

 = SMS Baden = 
 SMS Baden was a Bayern @-@ class dreadnought battleship of the German Imperial Navy built during World War I. Launched in October 1915 and completed in March 1917 , she was the last battleship completed for use in the war ; two of her sisters — Sachsen and Württemberg — were incomplete when the war ended . The ship mounted eight 38 @-@ centimeter ( 15 in ) guns in four twin turrets , displaced 32 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 31 @,@ 700 long tons ; 35 @,@ 500 short tons ) at full combat load , and had a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . Along with her sister Bayern , Baden was the largest and most powerfully armed battleship built by the Imperial Navy . 
 Upon commissioning into the High Seas Fleet , Baden was made the fleet flagship , replacing Friedrich der Grosse . Baden saw little action during her short career ; the only major sortie in April 1918 ended without any combat . Following the German collapse in November 1918 , Baden was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow by the British Royal Navy . On 21 June 1919 , Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the fleet . However , British sailors in the harbor managed to board Baden and beach her to prevent her sinking . The ship was refloated , thoroughly examined , and eventually sunk in extensive gunnery testing by the Royal Navy in 1921 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Baden was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Wörth in 1912 , under the fourth and final Naval Law , which was passed that year . Construction began at the Schichau @-@ Werke dockyard in Danzig under construction number 913 . The ship was laid down on 20 December 1913 and launched on 30 October 1915 . After fitting @-@ out , sea trials were conducted ; the ship was commissioned into service on 14 March 1917 . She had cost the Imperial German Government 49 million Goldmarks . Baden 's two <unk> , Sachsen and Württemberg , both lay incomplete at the end of World War I and were subsequently scrapped , leaving Baden the last battleship built for the Imperial Navy . 
 Baden was 179 @.@ 4 m ( 588 ft 7 in ) long at the waterline , and 180 m ( 590 ft 7 in ) long overall . She had a draft of between 9 @.@ 3 – 9 @.@ 4 m ( 30 ft 6 in – 30 ft 10 in ) . Baden displaced 28 @,@ 530 metric tons ( 28 @,@ 080 long tons ) at her designed displacement , which did not include a full load of combat supplies , fuel , and other operational necessities ; at full combat load , she displaced up to 32 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 31 @,@ 700 long tons ) . Baden 's displacement was more than 3 @,@ 000 t ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ) greater than that of the preceding König @-@ class ships , making her the largest battleship built by the Imperial Navy . Baden was powered by three sets of Schichau steam turbines , which were rated at 34 @,@ 521 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 742 kW ) , and produced a maximum of 55 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 41 @,@ 390 kW ) . Designed speed was 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , but Baden achieved a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 1 knots ( 40 @.@ 9 km / h ; 25 @.@ 4 mph ) . 
 She was armed with eight 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns arranged in four twin gun turrets : two superfiring turret pairs fore and aft of the superstructure . Baden and her sister Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber ; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 11 or 12 inch ) guns . Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns , six 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) guns and five 60 cm ( 23 @.@ 6 in ) underwater torpedo tubes , one in the bow and two on each beam . Upon commissioning , she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1 @,@ 129 enlisted men .

 After her commissioning into the High Seas Fleet , Baden was placed in the role of flagship for the commander of the fleet , Admiral Franz von Hipper , a position she held until the end of the war . At the end of August 1917 , Baden took Kaiser Wilhelm II to visit the fortified island of Helgoland ; the ship was escorted by the battlecruiser Derfflinger and the light cruisers Emden and Karlsruhe . After the conclusion of the visit , Baden returned the Kaiser to Cuxhaven . The ship struck the sea bottom outside Cuxhaven , though no major damage was done .

 In late 1917 , light forces of the High Seas Fleet began interdicting British convoys to Norway . On 17 October the light cruisers Brummer and Bremse intercepted one of the convoys , sinking nine of the twelve cargo ships and the two escorting destroyers before turning back to Germany . On 12 December , four German destroyers ambushed a second British convoy of five cargo vessels and two British destroyers . All five transports were sunk , as was one of the destroyers . Following these two raids , Admiral David Beatty , the commander of the Grand Fleet , detached battleships from the battle fleet to protect the convoys . The German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) was now presented with an opportunity for which it had been waiting the entire war : a portion of the numerically stronger Grand Fleet was separated and could be isolated and destroyed . Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper planned the operation : the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group , along with light cruisers and destroyers , would attack one of the large convoys , while the rest of the High Seas Fleet would stand by , ready to attack the British dreadnought battleship squadron . 
 At 05 : 00 on 23 April 1918 , the German fleet departed from the Schillig roadstead . Hipper , aboard Baden , ordered wireless transmissions be kept to a minimum , to prevent radio intercepts by British intelligence . At 06 : 10 the German battlecruisers had reached a position approximately 60 kilometers ( 37 mi ) southwest of Bergen when the battlecruiser Moltke lost her inner starboard propeller , which severely damaged the ship 's engines . The crew effected temporary repairs that allowed the ship to steam at 4 kn ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) , but it was decided to take the ship under tow . Despite this setback , Hipper continued northward . By 14 : 00 , Hipper 's force had crossed the convoy route several times but had found nothing . At 14 : 10 , Hipper turned his ships southward . By 18 : 37 , the German fleet had made it back to the defensive minefields surrounding their bases . It was later discovered that the convoy had left port a day later than expected by the German planning staff . 
 On 24 May , Baden again steamed to Helgoland , this time to take the commander in chief of the fleet , Admiral Reinhard Scheer , and Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden to visit the island . Only Karlsruhe joined the ship on this voyage . 
 = = = Wilhelmshaven mutiny = = = 
 As the fleet flagship , Baden was to have taken part in a final fleet action days before the Armistice , an operation which envisioned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sortieing from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet . In order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany , Admirals Hipper and Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , whatever the cost to the fleet . Consequently , on 29 October 1918 , the order was given to depart from Wilhelmshaven to consolidate the fleet in the Jade roadstead , with the intention of departing the following morning . However , starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Thüringen mutinied . 
 Early on the 30th , the crew of Helgoland , which was directly behind Thüringen , joined in the mutiny . Both ships surrendered after two torpedo boats arrived and threatened to open fire , and the battleships ' crews were taken ashore and incarcerated . The mood of Baden 's crew was reported as " dangerous " . The rebellion then spread ashore ; on 3 November , an estimated 20 @,@ 000 sailors , dock workers , and civilians fought a battle against the authorities in Kiel in an attempt to secure the release of the jailed mutineers . Meanwhile , on 9 November , the Socialists ' red flag was hoisted aboard Baden , which finally convinced Hipper and Scheer to abandon the plan . 
 = = = Scapa Flow = = = 
 Baden was not originally intended to be surrendered under the terms of the Armistice , but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen , which lay incomplete and could not put to sea . As a result , instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 , Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919 . The Royal Navy inspected the ship on 9 January , but many of the technical instruments , including gunnery equipment , had been removed before the ship left Germany . 
 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty that ended the war . A copy of The Times informed Rear Admiral von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919 , the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty . Von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired . To prevent this , he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers ; at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Baden was the last major warship to begin the scuttling process , and British forces in the harbor managed to secure the ship and run it aground before it could sink in deeper water . She was the only capital ship not successfully sunk in the scuttling . The ship was refloated in July , after which she was towed to the British naval base at Invergordon . 
 = = = British service = = = 
 After the ship arrived in Invergordon , Baden was carefully examined by Royal Navy technicians . Naval engineers inspected the hull , including the screws , bilge keels , and rudders , to determine the water resistance of the hull form . The ship was found to have been approximately as efficient as the British Revenge @-@ class battleships . The ship 's armor system was extensively investigated ; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May – 1 June 1916 . 
 The main battery turrets and ammunition magazines were also the subject of intense scrutiny ; among the tests conducted was a trial to see how fast the magazines could be flooded — the result was 12 minutes . The gunnery school HMS Excellent ran loading trials on the main battery guns . It was found that the guns could be prepared to fire in 23 seconds , 13 seconds faster than in the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships . The ship 's watertight bulkhead and underwater protection systems also particularly interested the inspection team ; they paid close attention to the ship 's pumping and counter @-@ flooding equipment . Commander W M Phipps Hornby , who lived on board Baden for weeks during the examination , wrote to the naval historian Arthur Marder in 1969 that it was his " considered opinion — which I know coincided with that of others engaged on the same job — that , considered as a fighting machine , anyhow on balance the Baden was markedly in advance of any comparable ship of the Royal Navy " . 
 After the inspection was concluded , it was determined to expend Baden as a gunnery target . In January 1921 the first round of gunnery tests was ordered . The gunners at HMS Excellent fired the new armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells that had been introduced after the Battle of Jutland . This round of tests was used to determine the most efficient ratio of explosives in the detonator caps ; the shells fired at Jutland had a tendency to fragment when striking heavy armor rather than penetrate . The monitor HMS Terror moored some 500 yd ( 460 m ) away from Baden to fire her 15 in ( 38 cm ) guns from point @-@ blank range . Baden was made to list to starboard by the removal of coal and armor from the port side , to simulate the effect of a shell striking armor from a plunging angle . The forward @-@ most gun turret had by this time been removed . Terror fired 17 shells of various types into the ship . The Royal Navy concluded after these tests that the new shells were sufficiently powerful to penetrate heavy armor , and were much more effective than the previous versions that had been employed at Jutland . Following the tests , heavy seas caused the ship to sink in the shallow water ; after three months she was again raised and docked for repairs . The ship was readied for a second round of testing by August 1921 . 
 The second series of tests was scheduled for 16 August 1921 . The monitor HMS Erebus fired a mix of shell types into Baden with her 15 in guns . This time , the shells did not perform as well against Baden 's heavy armor ; one of the AP shells failed to explode and two semi @-@ AP shells appear to have broken up on impact . Six aerial bombs were also detonated on the ship , though they had been placed on board and were detonated remotely . The bombs did not perform as well as had been expected . Immediately following the second round of gunnery trials , Baden was scuttled . The ship sank in Hurd Deep in a depth of approximately 180 m ( 600 ft ) . 
 The most important finding of the trials on Baden was that the 7 @-@ inch ( 18 cm ) thick medium armor was completely useless against large @-@ caliber shells . As a result , the British navy adopted the " all or nothing " armor pioneered by the United States Navy . The " all or nothing " armor theory consisted of protecting the ship 's vitals with extremely heavy armor , while leaving the rest of the ship completely unprotected . This system was used on Britain 's first post @-@ war class of battleships , the Nelson class .

By road Aalborg is 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) southwest of Frederikshavn , and 118 kilometres ( 73 mi ) north of Aarhus . 
 The earliest settlements date to around AD 700 . Aalborg 's position at the narrowest point on the Limfjord made it an important harbour during the Middle Ages , and later a large industrial centre . Architecturally , the city is known for its half @-@ timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants . Budolfi Church , now a cathedral , dates from the end of the 14th century and Aalborghus Castle , a royal residence , was built in 1550 .

A major exporter of grain , cement , and spirits , its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power , Aalborg Industries , and Aalborg Portland . These companies have become global producers of wind turbine rotors , marine boilers and cement . 
 With its theatres , symphony orchestra , opera company , performance venues , and museums such as Aalborg Historical Museum and the Aalborg Museum of Modern Art , Aalborg is an important cultural hub . The Aalborg Carnival , held at the end of May , is one of the largest festivals in Scandinavia , attracting some 100 @,@ 000 people annually .

 = = History = = 
 The area around the narrowest point on the Limfjord attracted settlements as far back as the Iron Age leading to a thriving Viking community until around the year 1000 in what has now become Aalborg . In the Middle Ages , royal trading privileges , a natural harbour and a thriving herring fishing industry contributed to the town 's growth . Despite the difficulties it experienced over the centuries , the city began to prosper once again towards the end of the 19th century when a bridge was built over Limfjord and the railway arrived . Aalborg 's initial growth relied on heavy industry but its current development focuses on culture and education . 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 Aalborg traces its history back over a thousand years . It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord . The sites of what were two settlements and a burial ground can be seen on Lindholm Høje , a hill overlooking the city . These large settlements , one from the 6th @-@ century Germanic Iron Age , the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries , evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord as a result of the traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north . 
 The first mention of Aalborg under its original name <unk> or <unk> is found on coins from c . 1040 , the period when King Harthacnut ( <unk> ) settled in the area . In c . 1075 , Adam of Bremen reported that <unk> , as he called it in German , was an important harbour for ships sailing to Norway . In Valdemar 's Danish Census Book from 1231 it was called <unk> , possibly meaning " the fort by the stream " as in Old Norse all meant a stream or current and bur or burgh a fort or a castle . The Church of Our Lady in Aalborg was originally built in the early 12th century but was demolished during the Reformation . Grey Friar Convent , on the east side of <unk> , was probably built around 1240 ; it was documented in 1268 when it was a Franciscan Convent of the Order of Friars Minor , but like many other Roman Catholic monasteries and convents was shut down in 1530 as a result of the Reformation . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 Aalborg 's earliest trading privileges date from 1342 , when King Valdemar IV received the town as part of his huge dowry on marrying <unk> of Schleswig . The privileges were extended by Eric of Pomerania in 1430 and by Christopher of Bavaria in 1441 . The town prospered , becoming one of the largest communities in Denmark . Its prosperity increased when the <unk> and trade association <unk> <unk> Laug was established in 1481 , facilitating trade with the Hanseatic League , especially from 1516 when Christian II granted it a monopoly in salting Limfjord 's herring . The king frequently visited the town , where he held court and stayed in the old Aalborghus . The herring fishery linked Aalborg to the East coast of England , across the North Sea , both in commercial competition and cultural exchange . During the Middle Ages a number of important institutions were established in Aalborg , including Budolfi Cathedral in the late 14th century and the Hospital of the Holy Ghost , a monastery and nunnery founded in 1451 to help those in need . It was converted into a hospital during the Reformation and is still in use today as a nursing home for the elderly . 
 In 1530 a large part of the town was destroyed by fire , and in December 1534 it was stormed and plundered by the king 's troops after a peasants ' revolt known as the Count 's Feud led by Skipper Clement . It resulted in the death of up to 2 @,@ 000 people . The Reformation in 1536 brought about the demolition of the town 's two monasteries . As a result of the Reformation , Aalborg became a Lutheran bishopric in 1554 . 
 = = = 17th to 19th centuries = = = 
 From the 1550s to the 1640s , as a result of increased foreign trade , Aalborg enjoyed great prosperity , second only to that of Copenhagen . The population grew in parallel with the development of many fine buildings in the city as merchants benefitted from their shipping routes from Norway to Portugal . In 1663 , the city suffered yet another serious fire , which destroyed the tower of Budolfi Church . 
 During the second half of the 18th century , Aalborg entered a further period of prosperity . In Erik Pontoppidan 's Danske Atlas ( Danish Atlas ) it was described as " after Copenhagen , the best and most prosperous market town in Denmark " . The population grew from 4 @,@ 160 in 1769 to 5 @,@ 579 in 1801 . In 1767 , the second newspaper ever published in Denmark appeared in the city . 
 After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814 , Aalborg lost its important role as the country 's centre for Norwegian trade . Its former prosperity also suffered as a result of difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange ( which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord ) in the 1825 North Sea storm . The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city . In the mid @-@ 19th @-@ century , Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland . Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn . In 1865 , the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed , and in 1869 , the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later . The harbour facilities were also improved , making Aalborg Denmark 's second port . Aalborg became the country 's main producer of tobacco products and spirits , followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement . By 1901 , the population had increased to almost 31 @,@ 500 . 
 = = = 20th century industrialisation = = = 
 Around the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of decisions taken by the municipality , many of the city 's half @-@ timbered houses were torn down . They were replaced by hundreds of modern buildings , completely changing the look of the city . Factories with smoking chimneys became ever more prevalent in the outskirts . Among the most important were De Danske Spritfabrikker ( spirits and liquors ) , De <unk> <unk> ( textiles ) , the East Asiatic Company ( trading ) , Dansk <unk> ( building materials ) and C.W. Obel 's tobacco factory ( established in 1787 ) . Aalborg Portland run by F.L. <unk> was one of several cement factories operating in 1913 , together employing some 800 workers . By the 1930s , Aalborg was being promoted as " Denmark 's new centre for industry and workers " . <unk> continued with additional thoroughfares cutting through the city . The port facilities were also improved with the help of a dredger and the opening of new docks . In 1933 , Christian X inaugurated a new bridge over Limfjord to replace the fragile pontoon crossing . 
 Aalborg Airport , officially opened in 1938 because of the success of the cement industry , had in fact operated flights to Copenhagen since 1936 . During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940 , the airport was captured by German paratroopers on the night of the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway . On 13 August 1940 , a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war . One turned back because of fuel problems , but all of the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and / or flak batteries within 20 minutes . After the war , the Royal Air Force destroyed all the German facilities including planes , hangars and equipment but left the passenger facilities intact . 
 By 1960 , Aalborg had become known as the " city of smoking chimneys " with half of the inhabitants working in industry or manufacturing . Ten years later , Aalborg 's population had grown to around 97 @,@ 000 inhabitants . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 The significance of Aalborg 's industry began to decline in the 1970s , precipitating a fall in the city 's population until about 1990 when it again began to increase . By the year 2000 , the service and education sectors accounted for about 60 percent of the workforce , partly as a result of the founding of Aalborg University in 1974 . Since 1970 , Aalborg and the northern suburb of Nørresundby have become a major administrative centre , thanks in part to the offices of the Region Nordjylland established in the east of the city . In addition to large industrial companies including Aalborg Portland , the only cement @-@ producing company in the country , and the building products company <unk> , many small and medium @-@ sized enterprises have been established . The telecommunications and information technology sector has developed with the support of Aalborg University and the North Jutland knowledge park <unk> . 
 The First European Conference on Sustainable Cities and Towns took place in Aalborg in 1994 . It adopted the Aalborg Charter , which provides a framework for the delivery of local sustainable development and calls on local authorities to engage in Local Agenda 21 processes . The Fourth European Sustainable Cities and Towns Conference , held in Aalborg in 2004 , adopted the more binding Aalborg Commitments on local sustainable development . The commitments have now been signed by 650 local authorities while over 2 @,@ 500 have signed the earlier Aalborg Charter .

 The city centre , dating from the Middle Ages , lies on a series of clay banks between the former streams of <unk> and <unk> , which used to run into the sound . Despite effective drainage , the main streets , including <unk> , still run east to west while the side streets run north to south . The Budolfi Church and the old town hall line Gammeltorv , the old market square .

 The city cemetery , the <unk> park and the modern art museum , Kunsten , are in the modern commercial and administrative area around the railway station to the west . Beyond this , <unk> has become a residential district with a number of large villas and detached houses . The city 's main development area is now to the east of the centre although in addition to the university and new areas of housing , it still contains the shipping harbor , <unk> , and the cement factory . The waterfront to the northeast of the centre is being transformed from a harbour into a recreational area with the Utzon Center and Musikkens Hus .

 Off the northwestern side of the city in the sound is the island of Egholm , reached via ferry . The island , with a population of 55 as of 2013 , covers an area of 6 @.@ 05 square kilometres ( 2 @.@ 34 sq mi ) and consists mainly of farmland although there are still a few <unk> areas of salt marshes and woodland . Dikes have been built along the coastline to protect the island from flooding . The Kronborg Forest on the island , covering an area of 17 hectares ( 42 acres ) , was acquired by the municipal government in 1945 . A restaurant in the vicinity was established in 1918 but rebuilt in 1946 following a fire .

 <unk> Ane Gade ( literally Virgin Anne 's Street ) is one of the most famous streets in Aalborg if not in Denmark . Popular for its cafés and restaurants during the day , it is even busier at night with its clubs , discos and bars . During the 1990s , the street was infamously a ' hang out ' of two biker gangs who were at war for some years all over Scandinavia . As the bikers disappeared it became increasingly popular for people of all ages . The pedestrian hubs of Nytorv Square and John F. Kennedy Square in the central city area are also part of the cityscape .

 = = Religion = = 
 = = = Lutheranism = = = 
 The principal religion in Aalborg as in the rest of Denmark is Christianity . Aalborg is the seat of a bishop within the Lutheran State Church of Denmark . The cathedral of this bishopric is the Budolfi Church , originally built no later than 1132 by Viborg 's Bishop Eskil . This church was considerably smaller than the current one , as it was merely a parish church . The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century , on the grounds of the former church , and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399 . The church was named after St Botolph , an English abbot and saint . The church is constructed in the Gothic style . In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and , after consideration , St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg . Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church , the Abbey of Our Lady , converted from a Benedictine nunnery . 
 = = = = Churches = = = = 
 The present Budolfi Church , which has the status of a cathedral , dates from the end of the 14th century , although at least two earlier churches stood on the same spot . Built in the Gothic style , it consists of a nave flanked by two aisles , a tower , and a porch . After the original tower was destroyed by fire in 1663 , the striking new Baroque tower , based on that of an earlier Copenhagen city hall , was completed in 1779 . The church has 16th @-@ century frescoes and an intricately carved early Baroque altarpiece from 1689 created by <unk> Jensen . 
 Abbey of Our Lady ( Vor Frue Kirke ) was designed in 1878 by J.E. <unk> in the Neo @-@ Romanesque style . The original Church of Our Lady from the early 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it was old and unstable , but the 12th @-@ century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen . The carved pulpit dates to around 1581 . 
 As a result of the considerable population increase from the end of the 19th century , a number of new churches were built in various styles . Next to Aalborg Hall , Ansgar 's Church with its tall tower was built in 1929 to a design by <unk> August Paludan in a modern Baroque style . St Mark 's Church ( Sankt Markus Kirke ) , completed in 1933 , was designed by Einar <unk> . Its tower is crowned by an imposing spire . The Biblical figures known as the Johannes Group ( based on Christ 's meeting with John the Baptist in Matthew , Chapter 3 ) sculpted by Bertel Thorvaldsen are displayed around the interior . The Margrethe Church with its steeply sloping roof reaching 22 m ( 72 ft ) is the work of Carlo <unk> and <unk> Sørensen . Bent <unk> designed some of the artefacts in the church including the crucifix over the altar .

 Aalborg 's cemeteries have a history dating to the end of the Middle Ages . Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård ( St George 's Cemetery ) was on the corner of <unk> and <unk> . The site was chosen in a district outside the city as it provided isolation for those affected by the plague , many of whom died in the neighbouring hospice , Sankt Jørgens <unk> . In 1794 , a new cemetery was opened in <unk> , immediately to the south of Sankt Jørgens Kirkegård . It was further extended in 1804 , 1820 and 1870 . It is now known as Aalborgs <unk> Kirkegård ( meaning " common cemetery " ) and contains the graves of many of the city 's most notable citizens .

 = History of KFC = 
 KFC ( Kentucky Fried Chicken ) was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders , an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin , Kentucky , during the Great Depression . Sanders identified the potential of restaurant franchising , and the first " Kentucky Fried Chicken " franchise opened in Salt Lake City , Utah in 1952 . KFC popularized chicken in the fast @-@ food industry , diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger . Branding himself " Colonel Sanders " , the founder became a prominent figure of American cultural history , and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising . The company 's rapid expansion made it too large for Sanders to manage , so in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown , Jr. and Jack C. Massey . 
 KFC was one of the first fast @-@ food chains to expand internationally , opening outlets in England , Mexico and Jamaica by the mid @-@ 1960s . Throughout the 1970s and 80s , KFC experienced mixed success domestically , as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business . In the early 1970s , KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein , which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate , which later sold the chain to PepsiCo . The chain continued to expand overseas , and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China . 
 In 1997 , PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants , which changed its name to Yum ! Brands in 2002 . Yum has proved a more focused owner than Pepsi , and although KFC 's number of outlets have declined in the US , the company has continued to grow in Asia , South America and Africa . The chain has expanded to 18 @,@ 875 outlets across 118 countries and territories , with 4 @,@ 563 outlets in China alone , KFC 's largest market . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Harland Sanders was born in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville , Indiana . His father died in 1895 , and to make ends meet his mother took work at a canning plant . As the eldest child at the age of five , Sanders was left to care for his two siblings . When he turned seven his mother taught him how to cook . After leaving the family home at age 13 , Sanders pursued several professions including railroad worker and insurance salesman , with mixed success . In 1930 , he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin , a small city on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains . By June , he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table , serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers . 
 In 1934 , Sanders took over the lease of the Pure Oil filling station on the other side of the road , due to its greater visibility for motorists . He then began to sell fried chicken . To improve his skills , Sanders took an eight @-@ week restaurant @-@ management course at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration . By 1936 , his business had proved successful enough for him to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon . In 1937 , Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats , and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street , the Sanders Court & Café . 
 Sanders was dissatisfied with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan , but he did not want to deep fry . Although a much faster process , in Sanders ' opinion it produced dry and crusty chicken that was unevenly cooked . On the other hand , if he prepared the chicken in advance of an order , there was sometimes waste at the end of the day . In 1939 , the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market , predominantly designed for steaming vegetables . Sanders bought one and modified it into a pressure fryer , which he then used to prepare chicken . The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying , yet , in Sanders ' opinion , retained the quality of pan @-@ fried chicken . In July 1940 , Sanders finalized what came to be known as his Original Recipe of 11 herbs and spices . Although he never publicly revealed the recipe , he admitted to the use of salt and pepper , and claimed that the ingredients " stand on everybody 's shelf " . 
 After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby , Sanders began to dress the part , growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat ( later switching to a white suit ) , a string tie , and referring to himself as " Colonel " . His associates went along with the title change , " jokingly at first and then in earnest " , according to biographer Josh <unk> . 
 = = Early franchisees = = 
 The Sanders Court & Café generally served travelers , so when the route planned in 1955 for Interstate 75 bypassed Corbin , Sanders sold his properties and traveled the US to market his chicken concept to restaurant owners . Independent restaurant owners would pay four cents on each chicken sold as a franchise fee ( later increased to five cents ) , in exchange for Sanders ' " secret blend of herbs and spices " , his recipe and method , and the right to advertise using his name and likeness . In 1952 he had already successfully franchised his chicken recipe to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake , Utah , the operator of one of the largest restaurants in the city . 
 Don Anderson , a sign painter hired by Harman , coined the name " Kentucky Fried Chicken " . Sanders adopted the name because it distinguished his product from the deep @-@ fried " Southern fried chicken " product found in restaurants . Harman claimed that in his first year of selling " Kentucky Fried Chicken " , his restaurant sales more than tripled , with 75 percent of the increase coming from the sale of fried chicken . In Utah , a product from Kentucky was exotic and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality . 
 As a franchise @-@ led operation , KFC 's success depended on the work of the early franchisees , and Harman has been described as the " virtual co @-@ founder " of the chain by Sanders ' biographer . Harman trademarked the phrase " It 's finger lickin ' good " , which was eventually adopted as a slogan across the entire chain . In 1957 Harman bundled 14 pieces of chicken , five bread rolls and a pint of gravy into a cardboard bucket , and offered it to families as " a complete meal " for US $ 3 @.@ 50 ( around US $ 30 in 2014 ) . He first test @-@ trialled the packaging as a favor to Sanders , who had called on behalf of a Denver franchisee who did not know what to do with 500 cardboard buckets he had bought from a traveling salesman . 
 By 1956 , Sanders had six or eight franchisees , including Dave Thomas , who eventually founded the Wendy 's restaurant chain . Thomas developed the rotating red bucket sign , was an early advocate of the take @-@ out concept that Harman had pioneered , and introduced a bookkeeping form that Sanders rolled out across the entire KFC chain . Thomas sold his shares in 1968 for US $ 1 million ( around US $ 7 million in 2013 ) , and became regional manager for all KFC restaurants east of the Mississippi before founding Wendy 's in 1969 . 
 In 1956 , Sanders moved the company headquarters from Corbin to Shelbyville , Kentucky , which offered superior transport links through which he could distribute his spices , pressure cookers , take @-@ out cartons and advertising material to franchisees . 
 = = Sale by Sanders and rapid growth = = 
 KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry , diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger . In 1960 the company had around 200 franchised restaurants ; by 1963 this had grown to over 600 , making it the largest fast food operation in the United States . In 1963 , Sanders met John Y. Brown , Jr , a young Kentucky encyclopaedia salesman , who explained that he was keen to join the company . Sanders instead proposed the sale of the company , as business skills did not come naturally to him , and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives . 
 Lacking sufficient funds himself , Brown convinced the financier Jack C. Massey to provide 60 percent of the acquisition capital , and provided a major contribution himself , with smaller contributions from franchise holder Pete Harman and company officials Lee Cummings and Harlan Adams . Sanders then began to have doubts about selling the company , as some members of his family were against it . The group acquired the company in 1964 for US $ 2 million ( around US $ 15 million in 2013 ) . The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company 's quality controller and trademark . 
 Massey and Brown introduced standardization to the fragmented company . After visiting Pete Harman 's operations in Utah , they began to implement the stand @-@ alone take @-@ out model across the entire chain . Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items so that they could concentrate on KFC products . The restaurants were re @-@ branded with a distinctive red @-@ and @-@ white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas . The roll @-@ out of freestanding stores accelerated the company 's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees . 
 Despite selling the company , Sanders retained significant moral authority over executives and franchisees , and made his feelings clear when he disagreed with corporate decisions . When Massey moved company headquarters from Kentucky to Nashville , Tennessee , Sanders was quoted as saying , " This ain 't no <unk> Tennessee Fried Chicken , no matter what some slick , silk @-@ suited son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch says " . He believed that the company had reneged on their contract with him when they opened operations in Canada , arguing that the contract had granted him the exclusive rights to operate there . KFC was forced to renegotiate with Sanders regarding the Canadian activities , as he owned $ 1 @.@ 5 million worth of stock and was using it to prevent Massey from listing the company publicly until his points of issue were addressed . Brown and Massey claimed that Sanders only had the rights to process chicken in Canada . After they renegotiated the contract to guarantee Sanders exclusive rights over Canada , he sold his stock to them , and the company went public in 1966 . After going public , the company bought out its 600 franchisees , and directly operated them itself . Later that year , Massey resigned from day @-@ to @-@ day management of the company ( although he remained as chairman ) , and Brown announced that headquarters would be moved to Louisville , Kentucky . 
 By 1967 , KFC had become the sixth largest restaurant chain in the US by sales volume , and 30 percent of sales were take @-@ out . Brown felt that the company had to expand quickly , or else emerging rivals such as Church 's Chicken would steal the company 's lead ; 863 outlets were opened in 1968 . The company 's growth pushed its stock value to " stratospheric " levels , according to Reuters , and in 1969 it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Meanwhile , KFC entered into ventures with other companies . Brown believed that the Colonel Sanders brand could be used to market anything , and launched the " Kentucky Roast Beef " restaurant chain , and " Colonel Sanders Inns " motels . The two ventures quickly failed , although the roast beef chain had 100 outlets by 1970 . That same year , KFC entered a joint venture with the California @-@ based fish and chips chain H. Salt Esquire , which proved more successful , but was sold off in 1980 . 
 Massey resigned as chairman of the company in March 1970 , and Brown took over his role . The chain had reached 3 @,@ 000 outlets in 48 different countries by 1970 , but expansion was often chaotic and poorly executed . When he was promoted to regional manager , Dave Thomas complained that the company had become too " corporate " , sent him " a lot of Mickey Mouse memos " and that Brown lacked motivational skill . A member of KFC senior management described the international strategy as " throwing some mud against the map on the wall , and hoping some of it would stick . " The first outlet in Japan was opened after just two weeks preparation , and it proved to be a costly failure , losing $ 400 @,@ 000 during its opening month and wasting more chicken than it sold . Operational problems became clear in July 1971 , after the company reported its first ever profit loss from the prior six @-@ month period .

 Once too large for Sanders to manage , Kentucky Fried Chicken grew to overwhelm John Y. Brown as well . In July 1971 , Brown sold the company to the Connecticut @-@ based Heublein , a packaged food and drinks corporation , for US $ 285 million ( around US $ 1 @.@ 6 billion in 2013 ) . Brown personally gained around $ 35 million from the sale . Reuters opined that the takeover probably saved the company from disaster . Heublein planned to increase KFC 's volume with its sales and marketing expertise . 
 Meanwhile , Church 's Chicken began taking KFC 's market share by offering indoor seating and its " Crispy Chicken " product . KFC introduced its own " Extra Crispy Chicken " in 1972 . The introduction of barbecue spare ribs in 1973 caused " tremendous " operating problems . After the product was launched there was a shortage of pork , which pushed prices beyond what customers were willing to pay . When management withdrew the product , they realized that fried chicken sales had been decreasing . Meanwhile , Sanders increasingly regretting selling the company , and his relationship with the new owners had soured . He began to complain of the company 's declining food quality to the media : 
 My God , that gravy is horrible ! They buy tap water for 15 @-@ 20 cents a thousand gallons and then they mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste ... And another thing . That new crispy recipe is nothing in the world but a damn fried <unk> stuck on some chicken . 
 The outburst prompted a KFC franchisee in Bowling Green , Kentucky , to unsuccessfully attempt to sue Sanders for libel . In 1973 , Heublein attempted to sue Sanders after he opened a restaurant in Shelbyville , Kentucky , under the name of " Claudia Sanders , the Colonel 's Lady Dinner House " . In retaliation , Sanders attempted to sue Heublein for US $ 122 million ( around US $ 570 million in 2013 ) over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop , and for hindering his ability to franchise restaurants . A Heublein spokesman described it as a " nuisance suit " . In 1975 , Heublein settled out of court with Sanders for US $ 1 million ( around US $ 4 million in 2013 ) , and allowed his restaurant venture to go ahead under the reworked name : " Claudia Sanders Dinner House " . 
 Heublein had no previous experience in the operation of fast food outlets . <unk> led KFC to fail in such overseas markets as Hong Kong , which the company abandoned in 1975 after two years in operation . Sanders continued to attack Heublein publicly , and in 1976 complained that the company " doesn 't know what it 's doing " and that it was " downright embarrassing " to have his image associated with such a poor quality product . The 800 company @-@ owned stores had become unprofitable by 1978 . 
 Heublein promoted Michael A. Miles to run the chain in 1977 and Miles is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back @-@ to @-@ basics formula . Miles refurbished the stores , and introduced indoor seating and drive @-@ thru windows . Electronic tills produced daily customer counts , inventories and profit and loss statements , so that problems could be identified quickly . KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s , particularly in Japan , Australia and the United Kingdom . Miles also lured Sanders back , and listened to his recommendations for the business . Subsequent changes resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980 . 
 Sanders died in 1980 from pneumonia at the age of 90 , having continued to travel 200 @,@ 000 – 250 @,@ 000 miles a year up to this time , largely by car , promoting his product . By branding himself as " Colonel Sanders " , Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history , and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising . 
 There were 5 @,@ 800 KFC outlets worldwide by 1983 , located across 55 different countries . That year , General Cinema Corporation acquired 18 percent of Heublein , who , fearing a hostile takeover , approached R. J. Reynolds , the tobacco firm , to act as a white knight and acquire the company for $ 1 @.@ 3 billion . That year , Michael Miles resigned as chairman of KFC to take the role of CEO at Kraft Foods , and Richard Mayer took over his role . Reynolds had to contend with the introduction of Chicken McNuggets across the McDonald 's chain in 1983 ; KFC introduced its own brand of chicken nuggets , called " Kentucky Nuggets " in 1985 . In 1984 , Reynolds dedicated $ 168 million for capital expansion at KFC . 
 = = Acquisition by PepsiCo = = 
 In July 1986 , Reynolds sold KFC to PepsiCo for a book value of $ 850 million ( around US $ 1 @.@ 8 billion in 2013 ) . At the time , PepsiCo had interests in soft drinks and snacks , and also owned the restaurant chains Pizza Hut and Taco Bell . Reynolds divested KFC in order to pay off debt related to its recent purchase of Nabisco and to concentrate on its tobacco and packaged food business . It was anticipated that PepsiCo would bring their merchandising expertise to the company . Dan <unk> of Adweek believed that the chain had been suffering from corporate neglect , menu stagnation and mixed marketing messages ; Nancy <unk> of Advertising Age felt that the chain had been " smartly revived " by R. J. Reynolds . KFC chairman Richard Mayer was of the opinion that Reynolds had treated their restaurants division as a " hobby " . 
 PepsiCo 's acquisition was seen by some analysts as a means for the company to increase its soft drinks sales . PepsiCo chairman D. Wayne Calloway denied that soft drink preference was a factor in the KFC takeover . KFC management had previously given franchisees the freedom to sell any soft drinks they wanted , but PepsiCo stated that it hoped it could convince them to stock Pepsi products . Before the takeover , only 1 @,@ 000 of the 6 @,@ 500 KFC outlets sold Pepsi Cola , and PepsiCo switched 1 @,@ 800 company @-@ owned stores to their own soft drinks with immediate effect . The purchase of KFC by PepsiCo led to some fast food competitors switching from Pepsi to Coca @-@ Cola . One of the first to switch was Wendy 's , whose chairman , Robert Barney , stated , " [ PepsiCo 's ] interests are now in conflict with Wendy 's and we will not support a company that is trying to make our customers its customers . " Burger King , which had switched from Coca @-@ Cola to PepsiCo in 1983 , returned to Coca @-@ Cola in 1990 , citing the growth of the PepsiCo chains as a " large factor " in the switch . By 1998 , the majority of KFC franchisees had agreed to stock PepsiCo soft drink products . 
 In November 1987 , KFC became the first Western restaurant chain in China , with an outlet in Beijing . In 1989 , first quarter sales at KFC rose 30 percent to US $ 280 million . In July , president and CEO Richard Meyer left KFC in order to become the CEO at Kraft Foods , and was replaced by John Cranor III . 
 = = = International growth and franchisee disputes under John Cranor III = = = 
 In August 1989 , Cranor proposed amendments to the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees : PepsiCo could take over weak franchises , existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets , and PepsiCo would have the right to increase royalty fees . The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees , who countered with a lawsuit , and the issue was not resolved until 1996 . PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees , who it believed were holding back the firm 's growth , while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners . 
 Cranor spent $ 42 million restructuring the company 's operations worldwide . He invested an additional $ 50 million to refurbish outlets and $ 20 million on a new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen , drive @-@ through window , manager 's office and company headquarters . Cranor also expanded the chain into non @-@ traditional locations , beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton , Ohio . Between 1986 and 1991 , the chain built a further 2 @,@ 000 outlets to bring its total number to 8 @,@ 500 , and sales grew from $ 3 @.@ 5 to $ 6 @.@ 2 billion . The chain had to contend with the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious . KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain , as well as with Burger King , which had just introduced the BK Broiler , a grilled chicken burger . Delays in product development , cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own . 
 In March 1991 the KFC name was officially adopted , although the chain was already widely known by that initialism . The change was advised by the Schechter Group brand consultancy agency . Research demonstrated that 80 percent of customers already associated the " KFC " initials with Kentucky Fried Chicken . A spokesman for the chain said that it represented its diversified menu , which was moving away from solely fried products . Kyle Craig , president of KFC US , admitted the change was an attempt to distance the chain from the unhealthy connotations of " fried " . In 1994 , Milford Prewitt praised the " crafty and well @-@ timed repositioning " in Nation 's Restaurant News . On the other hand , a 2005 editorial in Advertising Age stated , " the chain 's jettisoning of a venerable name — and distancing from the word fried — was ill @-@ conceived and damaging . It made a clear brand fuzzy . " 
 The early 1990s saw successful major products launched throughout the chain , including spicy " Hot Wings " ( launched in 1990 ) , popcorn chicken ( 1992 ) , and , outside the US , the " Zinger " , a spicy chicken fillet burger ( 1993 ) . In 1993 , rotisserie style chicken , under the name " Colonel 's Rotisserie Gold " , was introduced at over 30 percent of US outlets . However , despite a $ 100 million investment in marketing , the product failed to gain sales traction . The launch of skinless chicken , designed to appeal to health @-@ conscious customers , failed ; customers disliked the unfamiliar texture , and the product resulted in increased overheads , which contributed to a 37 percent decline in operating profits in 1991 . 
 In June 1991 , Singapore was chosen for the launch of the first ever KFC breakfast menu . Products included chicken , omelettes and scrambled eggs , sold under the " Colonel 's Country Breakfast " banner . Singapore was chosen for the launch due to the growth of the breakfast market in that country . 
 While the US division struggled , becoming the weakest part of PepsiCo 's restaurants division , elsewhere sales boomed , with particular success in Japan . By 1992 , almost half of company turnover came from outside the US . By 1993 , KFC in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 22 percent of all KFC sales . John Cranor announced , " We 're looking at almost unlimited opportunity for growth in Asia " . By 1993 , KFC was the leading Western fast food chain in South Korea , China , Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia , and was second to McDonald 's in most other Asian markets , including Japan and Singapore . Overseas operations often flourished while local management ignored or even defied orders from Louisville headquarters .

 By 1994 , KFC had a total of 9 @,@ 407 outlets worldwide , including 5 @,@ 149 outlets in the US , and over 100 @,@ 000 employees . That year , the chain began to struggle after competitors such as McDonald 's introduced value menu offerings . After a disappointing set on quarterly earnings , Cranor left the company in January 1994 . In his wake , two executives with marketing backgrounds were charged with reviving the company . Roger Enrico was appointed as the CEO of PepsiCo Worldwide Restaurants , and David C. Novak was appointed President of KFC in North America . 
 In 1995 , Novak introduced two successful new products — Crispy Strips ( breaded strips of chicken ) and the chicken pot pie — the chain 's first major new product launches in almost two years . Novak credits an improved , more " open " relationship with franchisees for the introduction of the two new items : Crispy Strips were invented by an Arkansas franchisee , and the pot pie was similarly developed alongside franchisees . Meanwhile , less popular items , such as corn muffins , were removed from the menu . At the same time , Enrico scaled back the increasing competition between KFC and its sister companies , Taco Bell and Pizza Hut ; Taco Bell had begun offering its own chicken products , and KFC had attacked Pizza Hut in its marketing . 
 In 1996 the company repaired its relationship with its franchisees by immediately dropping the most contentious of the contract terms that had been proposed by chairman John Cranor five years previously . The 1976 contract was restored , including the 1 @.@ 5 mile outlet exclusivity zone , while the parent company gained greater control over national advertising . Novak also axed the Colonel 's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non @-@ fried item called the Tender Roast . Tender Roast was served by piece , as with the fried chicken , in contrast with the rotisserie product , which had been sold in quarter , half or whole chicken portions . Afterwards , Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America . As a result of his success at KFC North America , Novak became President and CEO of the entire KFC organization in 1996 .

 In August 1997 , PepsiCo spun off its poorly performing restaurants division as a public company valued at US $ 4 @.@ 5 billion ( around US $ 6 @.@ 5 billion in 2013 ) . Although KFC had been doing well , Pizza Hut and Taco Bell had been under @-@ performing . One PepsiCo executive admitted , " restaurants weren 't our schtick " . The new company , named Tricon Global Restaurants , had 30 @,@ 000 outlets and annual sales of US $ 10 billion ( around US $ 14 billion in 2013 ) at the time , making it second only to McDonald 's in global sales . 
 Since the turn of the 21st century , fast food has been criticised for its animal welfare record , its links to obesity and its environmental impact . Eric Schlosser 's book Fast Food Nation ( 2002 ) and Morgan Spurlock 's film Super Size Me ( 2004 ) reflected these concerns . Since 2003 , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) has protested KFC 's choice of poultry suppliers worldwide with the Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign . PETA have held thousands of demonstrations , sometimes in the home towns of KFC executives , and CEO David Novak was soaked in fake blood by a protester . KFC President Gregg <unk> said PETA mischaracterized KFC as a poultry producer rather than a purchaser of chickens . In 2008 , Yum ! stated : " [ As ] a major purchaser of food products , [ Yum ! ] has the opportunity and responsibility to influence the way animals supplied to us are treated . We take that responsibility very seriously , and we are monitoring our suppliers on an ongoing basis . " 
 Tricon was renamed Yum ! Brands in May 2002 . In that year , the chain had to contend with Burger King 's launch of the Chicken Whopper , as well as fried chicken offerings from the Domino 's and Papa John 's pizza chains . Within three months , the Chicken Whopper became Burger King 's most successful launch of all time , with sales of 50 million . In September 2002 , KFC sales were down 10 percent against the previous year . From 2002 to 2005 , KFC experienced three years of weak sales , when underinvestment in product development left the brand looking " tired and poorly positioned " , according to Restaurant Research , an independent consultancy . A roast chicken product line introduced in 2004 proved unsuccessful , and the worldwide avian flu scare of 2005 temporarily decreased sales by as much as 40 percent . KFC responded in March 2005 by adding a cheap , small chicken burger to the menu called the " <unk> " . It proved to be one of the chain 's most successful product launches to date , with over 100 million in sales . In international markets , KFC introduced the " <unk> " , a meal @-@ sized wrap in a box . KFC also began a makeover of the US brand image , bringing back the full " Kentucky Fried Chicken " name at some outlets and returning portraits of Colonel Sanders to prominence . 
 In 2009 , KFC International launched the <unk> ( <unk> in some markets ) line of frozen beverages . The product was an attempt to introduce a between @-@ meals snack to KFC , and was marketed towards teenagers . In April 2010 , the Double Down sandwich was launched . Criticised as an unhealthy product , it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun . It has proved to be a success for the company , with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013 . In September 2012 , the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US . 
 By December 2013 , there were 18 @,@ 875 KFC outlets in 118 countries and territories around the world . KFC is the second largest restaurant chain in the world by sales after McDonald 's . 
 In April 2014 , Yum ! announced that first quarter KFC sales had risen by 11 percent in China , following a 15 percent fall in 2013 . 
 In July 2014 , Chinese authorities closed down the Shanghai operations of the OSI Group , amidst allegations that it had supplied KFC with expired meat . Yum ! immediately terminated its contract with the supplier , and stated that the revelation had led to a significant decline in sales . 
 = McGill University = 
 McGill University is an English @-@ language public research university in Montreal , Canada . It was officially founded by royal charter issued by King George IV in 1821 . The University bears the name of James McGill , a prominent Montreal merchant from Scotland whose bequest in 1813 formed the university 's precursor , McGill College . 
 McGill 's main campus is set at the foot of Mount Royal in Downtown Montreal , with the second campus situated near fields and forested lands in Sainte @-@ Anne @-@ de @-@ Bellevue , also on the Montreal Island , 30 kilometres ( 18 miles ) west of the main campus . All the academic units are organized into 11 main Faculties and Schools . The University is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States , and it is the only Canadian university member of the Global University Leaders Forum ( GULF ) , within the World Economic Forum , which is made up of 26 of the world 's top universities . 
 McGill offers degrees and diplomas in over 300 fields of study , with the highest average admission grade of any Canadian university . Most students are enrolled in the five larger Faculties , namely Arts , Science , Medicine , Engineering , and Management . Tuition fees vary significantly between in @-@ province , out @-@ of @-@ province , and international students , as well as between faculties . Scholarships are generous , yet highly competitive and relatively difficult to attain , compared to other institutions of higher learning in the country . 
 McGill counts among its alumni 12 Nobel laureates and 140 Rhodes Scholars , both the most in the country , as well as three astronauts , three Canadian prime ministers , thirteen justices of the Canadian Supreme Court , four foreign leaders , 28 foreign ambassadors , nine Academy Award winners , eleven Grammy Award winners , three Pulitzer Prize winners , and 28 Olympic medalists . Throughout its long history , McGill alumni were instrumental in inventing or initially organizing football , basketball , and ice hockey . McGill University or its alumni also founded several major universities and colleges , including the Universities of British Columbia , Victoria , and Alberta , the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry , the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , and Dawson College .

 = = = Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning = = = 
 The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning ( RIAL ) was created in 1801 under an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada - An Act for the establishment of Free Schools and the Advancement of Learning in this Province . 
 In 1816 the RIAL was authorized to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools , in Quebec City and in Montreal . This was a turning point for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation , the District Public Schools Act of 1807 , which showed the government 's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster . This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools . When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL . 
 The original two Royal Grammar Schools closed in 1846 and by the mid @-@ 19th century the RIAL lost control of the other 82 grammar schools it had administered . Its sole remaining purpose was to administer the McGill bequest on behalf of the private college . The RIAL continues to exist today ; it is the corporate identity that runs the university and its various constituent bodies , including the former Macdonald College ( now Macdonald Campus ) , the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Victoria College ( the former women 's college turned residence ) . Since the revised Royal Charter of 1852 , The Trustees of the RIAL comprise the Board of Governors of McGill University .

 James McGill , born in Glasgow , Scotland on 6 October 1744 , was a successful English- and French @-@ speaking merchant in Quebec , having matriculated into Glasgow University in 1756 . Between 1811 and 1813 , he drew up a will leaving his " Burnside estate " , a 19 @-@ hectare ( 47 @-@ acre ) tract of rural land and 10 @,@ 000 pounds to the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning . 
 Upon McGill 's death in December 1813 , the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning , established in 1801 by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada , added the establishing of a University pursuant to the conditions of McGill 's will to its original function of administering elementary education in Lower Canada . 
 As a condition of the bequest , the land and funds had to be used for the establishment of a " University or College , for the purposes of Education and the Advancement of Learning in the said Province . " The will specified that a private , constituent college would be required to bear his name and the school must be established within 10 years of his death ; otherwise the bequest would revert to the heirs of his wife . 
 On March 31 , 1821 , after protracted legal battles with the <unk> family ( the heirs of his wife ) , McGill College received a royal charter from King George IV . The Charter provided that the College should be deemed and taken as a University , with the power of conferring degrees .

 Though McGill College received its Royal Charter in 1821 , it was inactive until 1829 when the Montreal Medical Institution , which had been founded in 1823 , became the college 's first academic unit and Canada 's first medical school . The Faculty of Medicine granted its first degree , a Doctor of Medicine and Surgery , in 1833 ; this was also the first medical degree to be awarded in Canada . 
 The Faculty of Medicine remained the school 's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced teaching in the newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing ( Dawson Hall ) . The university also historically has strong linkage with The Canadian Grenadier Guards , a military regiment in which James McGill served as the Lieutenant @-@ Colonel . This title is marked upon the stone that stands before the Arts building , from where the Guards step off annually to commemorate Remembrance Day . 
 The Faculty of Law was founded in 1848 which is also the oldest of its kind in the nation . 48 years later , the school of architecture at McGill University was founded . 
 Sir John William Dawson , McGill 's principal from 1855 to 1893 , is often credited with transforming the school into a modern university . He recruited the aid of Montreal 's wealthiest citizens ( eighty percent of Canada 's wealth was then controlled by families who lived within the Golden Square Mile area that surrounded the university ) , many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings . Their names adorn many of the campus 's prominent buildings . 
 William Spier designed the addition of West Wing of the Arts Building for William Molson , 1861 . Alexander Francis Dunlop designed major alterations to the East Wing of McGill College ( now called the Arts Building , McGill University ) for Prof. <unk> and the Science Dept . , 1888 . This expansion of the campus continued until 1920 . Buildings designed by Andrew Taylor , include the Redpath Museum ( 1880 ) , Macdonald Physics Building ( 1893 ) , the Redpath Library ( 1893 ) , the Macdonald Chemistry Building ( 1896 ) , the Macdonald Engineering Building ( 1907 ) — now known as the Macdonald @-@ Stewart Library Building , and the Strathcona Medical Building ( 1907 ) — since renamed the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building . 
 In 1900 , the university established the MacLennan Travelling Library . McGill University Waltz composed by Frances C. Robinson , was published in Montréal by W.H. Scroggie , c 1904 . 
 In 1885 , the university 's Board of Governors formally adopted the use of the name " McGill University " . In 1905 , the university acquired a second campus when Sir William C. Macdonald , one of the university 's major benefactors , endowed a college in Sainte @-@ Anne @-@ de @-@ Bellevue , 32 kilometres west of Montreal . Macdonald College , now known as the Macdonald Campus , opened to students in 1907 , originally offering programs in agriculture , household science , and teaching . 
 George Allan Ross designed the Pathology Building , 1922 – 23 ; the Neurological Institute , 1933 ; Neurological Institute addition 1938 at McGill University . Jean Julien Perrault ( architect ) designed the McTavish Street residence for Charles E. Gravel , which is now called David Thompson House ( 1934 ) . 
 = = = = Women 's education = = = = 
 Women 's education at McGill began in 1884 , when Donald Smith , also known as Lord Strathcona , began funding separate lectures for women , given by university staff members . The first degrees granted to women at McGill were conferred in 1888 . In 1899 , the Royal Victoria College ( RVC ) opened as a residential college for women at McGill . Until the 1970s , all female undergraduate students , known as " <unk> , " were considered to be members of RVC . Beginning in the autumn of 2010 , the newer Tower section of Royal Victoria College is a co @-@ ed dormitory , whereas the older West Wing remains strictly for women . Both the Tower and the West Wing of Royal Victoria College form part of the university 's residence system . 
 = = = = McGill in the Great War = = = = 
 McGill University played a meaningful role in the Great War . Many students and alumni enlisted in the first wave of patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914 , but in the spring of 1915 — after the first wave of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault , the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman , was faced with a desperate shortage of troops . When he reached out to his friends at home for support , over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks , and many more would serve as soldiers throughout the war . On their return to Canada after the war , Major George McDonald and Major George Currie formed the accounting firm McDonald Currie , which later became one of the founders of Price Waterhouse Coopers . Captain Percival Molson was killed in action in July 1917 . Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour . 
 The War Memorial Hall ( more generally known as Memorial Hall ) is a landmark building on the campus of McGill University . At the dedication ceremony the Governor General of Canada ( Harold Alexander , 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis ) laid the cornerstone . Dedicated on October 6 , 1946 , the Memorial Hall and adjoining Memorial Pool honour students who had enlisted and died in the First World War , and in the Second World War . In Memorial Hall , there are two Stained Glass Regimental badge World War I and World War II Memorial Windows by Charles William Kelsey c . 1950 / 1 . 
 A war memorial window ( 1950 ) by Charles William Kelsey in the McGill War Memorial Hall depicts the figure of St. Michael and the badges of the Navy , Army and the Air Force . A Great War memorial window featuring Saint George and a slain dragon at the entrance to the Blackader @-@ <unk> Library of Architecture and Art is dedicated to the memory of 23 members of the McGill Chapter of Delta Upsilon who gave their lives in the Great War . Six other windows ( 1951 ) by Charles William Kelsey on the west wall of the memorial hall depict the coats of arms of the regiments in which the McGill alumni were members . 
 There is a memorial archway at Macdonald College , two additional floors added to the existing Sir Arthur Currie gymnasium , a hockey rink and funding for an annual Memorial Assembly . A Book of Remembrance on a marble table contains the names of those lost in both World Wars . On 11 November 2012 the McGill Remembers web site launched ; the University War Records Office collected documents between 1940 @-@ 1946 related to McGill students , staff and faculty in the Second World War .

 McGill was instrumental in founding several major universities and colleges . It established the first post @-@ secondary institutions in British Columbia to provide degree programs to the growing cities of Vancouver and Victoria . It chartered Victoria College in 1903 , an affiliated junior college of McGill . It served as a two @-@ year college offering first and second @-@ year courses in arts and science , until it became today 's University of Victoria . British Columbia 's first university was incorporated in Vancouver in 1908 as the McGill University College of British Columbia . The private institution granted McGill degrees until it became the independent University of British Columbia in 1915 . 
 Dawson College began in 1945 as a satellite campus of McGill to absorb the anticipated influx of students after World War II . Many students in their first 3 years in the Faculty of Engineering took courses at Dawson College to relieve the McGill campus for the later two years for their degree course . Dawson eventually became independent of McGill and evolved into the first English CEGEP in Quebec . Another CEGEP , John Abbott College , was established in 1971 at the campus of McGill 's Macdonald College . 
 Both founders of the University of Alberta , Premier Alexander Cameron Rutherford of Alberta and Henry Marshall Tory , were also McGill alumni . In addition , McGill alumni and professors , Dr. William Osler and Dr. Howard Atwood Kelly , were among the four founders and early faculty members of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . Osler eventually became the first Physician @-@ in @-@ Chief of the new Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland , USA in 1889 . He led the creation of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1893 . Other McGill alumni founded the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in the 1880s .

 McGill 's main campus is situated in downtown Montreal at the foot of Mount Royal . Most of its buildings are situated in a park @-@ like campus located north of Sherbrooke Street and south of Pine Avenue between Peel and Aylmer streets . The campus also extends west of Peel Street for several blocks , starting north of Doctor Penfield ; the campus also extends east of University Street , starting north of Pine Avenue , an area that includes McGill 's Percival Molson Memorial Stadium and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital . The community immediately east of University Street and south of Pine Avenue is known as the McGill Ghetto , where a large number of students reside . The campus is near the Peel and McGill Metro stations . A major downtown boulevard , McGill College Avenue , leads up to the Roddick Gates , the university 's formal main entrance . All of the major university buildings were constructed using local grey limestone , which serves as a unifying element . 
 The university 's first classes were held in at Burnside Place , James McGill 's country home . Burnside Place remained the sole educational facility until the 1840s , when the school began construction on its first buildings : the central and east wings of the Arts Building . The rest of the campus was essentially a cow pasture , a situation similar to the few other Canadian universities and early American colleges of the age . 
 The university 's athletic facilities , including Molson Stadium , are located on Mount Royal , near the residence halls and the Montreal Neurological Institute . The Gymnasium is named in honour of General Sir Arthur William Currie . 
 In 2012 , Travel + Leisure rated McGill 's campus as one of the 17 most beautiful university campuses in the world . 
 = = = = Residence = = = = 
 McGill 's residence system houses approximately 3 @,@ 100 undergraduate students and some graduate students . With the exception of students returning as " floor fellows " or " dons " , few McGill students live in residence ( known colloquially as " <unk> " ) after their first year of undergraduate study , even if they are not from the Montreal area .

Francophone students , whether from Quebec or overseas , now make up approximately 18 percent of the student body . 
 Although the language of instruction is English , since its founding McGill has allowed students to write their thesis in French , and since 1964 students in all faculties have been able to submit any graded work in either English or French , provided that the objective of the class is not to learn a particular language . The University has a bilingual language policy and charter . 
 In 1969 , the nationalist McGill français movement demanded that McGill become francophone , pro @-@ nationalist , and pro @-@ worker .

Protesters saw English as the privileged language of commerce . McGill , where Francophones comprised only three percent of the students , could be seen as the force maintaining economic control by Anglophones of a predominantly French @-@ speaking province . However , the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position .
