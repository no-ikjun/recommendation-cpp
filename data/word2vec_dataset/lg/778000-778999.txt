 The following four works are popularly attributed to Tulsidas – 
 Hanuman Chalisa ( हनुमान <unk> ) , literally , Forty Verses to Hanuman , is an Awadhi work of 40 <unk> and two Dohas in obeisance to Hanuman . Popular belief holds the work to be authored by Tulsidas , and it contains his signature , though some authors do not think the work was written by him . It is one of the most read short religious texts in northern India , and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays . It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of Samadhi at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar . 
 Sankatmochan <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ् <unk> ) , literally Eight verses for Hanuman , the <unk> of Afflictions , is an Awadhi work of eight verses in the <unk> metre , devoted to Hanuman . It is believed to have been composed by Tulsidas on the occasion of the founding of the Sankatmochan Temple in Varanasi . The work is usually published along with Hanuman Chalisa . 
 Hanuman <unk> ( हनुमान <unk> ) , literally The Arm of Hanuman , is a Braja work of 44 verses believed to have been composed by Tulsidas when he suffered acute pain in his arms at an advanced age . Tulsidas describes the pain in his arms and also prays to Hanuman for freedom from the suffering . The work has two , one , five and 36 verses respectively in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> metre . 
 Tulsi Satsai ( <unk> <unk> ) , literally Seven Hundred Verses by Tulsidas , is a work in both Awadhi and Braja and contains 747 Dohas divided in seven <unk> or cantos . The verses are same as those in Dohavali and Ramagya Prashna but the order is different . 
 = = Doctrine = = 
 The philosophy and principles of Tulsidas are found across his works , and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas . Tulsidas ' doctrine has been described as an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism . At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas , Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas , Vedas , <unk> , Tantra and Smriti . Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka <unk> elaborates on Tulsidas ' <unk> as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world <unk> . 
 = = = Nirguna and Saguna Brahman = = = 
 As per Tulsidas , the Nirguna Brahman ( quality @-@ less impersonal absolute ) and Saguna Brahman ( personal God with qualities ) are one and the same . Both , Saguna ( qualified Brahman ) and <unk> ( or Nirguna - unqualified Brahman ) are <unk> ( unspeakable ) , <unk> ( unfathomable ) , <unk> ( without beginning , in existence since eternity ) and Anupa ( without parallel ) ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ब ् रह ् म <unk> । <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ॥ ) . It is the devotion ( Bhakti ) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality @-@ less , formless , invisible and unborn , to become Saguna Brahman with qualities . Tulsidas gives the example of water , snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three , but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form . Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water , while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses . In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas , Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna ( as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism ) or Saguna ( as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism ) . Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa , to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow . Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama , the Saguna Brahman . Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal , he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind . Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir . In several of his works , Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha . In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas , Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu 's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood . However , such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas . Tulsidas , in none of his works , has ever mentioned Kabir . 
 = = = The name of Rama = = = 
 At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas , there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama . As per Tulsidas , repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation , Karma , and Puja are ineffective . He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power , glory and majesty of the name of Rama . In a couplet in the Gitavali , Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain . In his view , the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter . In a verse in the Dohavali , Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart , the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue , as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket . He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God , and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama . 
 = = = Rama as Brahman = = = 
 At several places in Tulsidas ' works , Rama is seen to be the higher than Vishnu and not as an avatar of Vishnu , which is the general portrayal of Rama . 
 In the episode of the delusion of Sati in Ramcharitmanas , Sati sees many a Shiva , Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet . When Manu and <unk> perform penance , they crave to see that Supreme Lord " from a part of whose being emanate a number of <unk> , Brahmas and <unk> . " Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva come to them many times tempting them with a boon , but Manu and <unk> do not stop their penance . They are finally satisfied only by the appearance of Rama , on whose left side is Sita , from a part of whom are born " countless <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . " In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand , the trio of Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork , while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama . In the <unk> , Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva can create , preserve and destroy by the might of Rama . In the <unk> , Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama , in which Shiva is the consciousness , Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence . As per Tulsidas , Rama is not only an avatar , but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama . Thus , Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of Vishnu . 
 In the opinion of Urvashi <unk> , the Rama of Tulsidas is an amalgamation of Vishnu who takes avatars , Vishnu in the abode of <unk> Sagara , Brahman and the Para manifestation of the Pancharatra . Macfie concludes that Tulsidas makes a " double claim " , i.e. Rama is an incarnation of both Vishnu and Brahman . In the words of Lutgendorf , Tulsidas ' Rama is at once " Valmiki 's exemplary prince , the cosmic Vishnu of Puranas , and the transcendent brahman of the <unk> . " 
 = = = Vedanta , World and Maya = = = 
 In the <unk> of Ramcharitmanas , Tulsidas says that Rama is knowable by Vedanta . 
 As per Tulsidas , Rama is the efficient and material cause ( <unk> and <unk> ) of the world , which is real since Rama is real . In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas , Tulsidas says that the animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama , and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama . Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world is real according to Tulsidas , in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja . However , at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali , Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is <unk> ( false or unreal ) . Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas ' opinion the world is unreal as per the <unk> doctrine of Adi Shankara , while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the <unk> doctrine of Ramananda . Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas ' view , the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya . Its visible form is transient , which is what Tulsidas means by <unk> . 
 In the Vinayapatrika , Tulsidas says that the world in itself is neither true ( Satya ) , nor false ( <unk> ) , nor both true and false together ( <unk> ) – one who casts aside all these three illusions , knows oneself . This has been interpreted to mean that as per Tulsidas , the entire world is a Lila of Rama . At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas , Tulsidas performs <unk> Vandana ( obeisance to all beings ) in which he bows down to the world also , saying it is " pervaded by " or " born out of " Sita and Rama . As per some verses in Ramcharitmanas and Vinaypatrika , when a Jiva ( living being ) knows the Self , Maya and Rama , it sees the world as being pervaded by Rama . 
 In the Balkand episode of the marriage of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila , Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state ( <unk> ) , sleep with dreams ( Swapna ) , dreamless sleep ( <unk> ) and the fourth self @-@ conscious state ( Turiya ) . The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity ( <unk> ) of the four states – Vishva , Taijasa , Prajna and Brahman . Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in the mind of a Jiva , so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion . 
 Tulsidas identifies Maya with Sita , the inseparable energy of Rama which takes avatar along with Rama . In his view , Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya . Vidya Maya is the cause of creation and the liberation of Jiva . Avidya Maya is the cause of illusion and bondage of the Jiva . The entire world is under the control of Maya . Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes , this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta . 
 = = = Views on other Hindu deities = = = 
 As per Tulsidas , there is no incompatibility between devotion to Rama and attachment to Shiva . Tulsidas equates the Guru as an incarnation of Shiva , and a considerable part of the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas is devoted to the narrative of Shiva including the abandonment of Sati , the penance of Parvati , the burning of Kamadeva and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva . In addition , Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon . The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh , Sarasvati , Parvati , Shiva , the Guru , Valmiki and Hanuman . At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika , he bows to Ganesh , Surya , Shiva , Devi , Ganga , Yamuna , Varanasi and Chitrakoot , asking them for devotion towards Rama . 
 = = = Bhakti = = = 
 The practical end of all his writings is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the greatest means of salvation and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths , a salvation which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste as to Brahmins . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 From his time , Tulsidas has been acclaimed by Indian and Western scholars alike for his poetry and his impact on the Hindu society . Tulsidas mentions in his work Kavitavali that he was considered a great sage in the world . <unk> <unk> , one of the most acclaimed philosophers of the Advaita Vedanta tradition based in Varanasi and the composer of <unk> , was a contemporary of Tulsidas . On reading the Ramcharitmanas , he was astonished and composed the following Sanskrit verse in praise of the epic and the composer . 
 <unk> , a devotee of Krishna and a contemporary of Tulsidas , called Tulsidas as Sant Shiromani ( the highest jewel among holy men ) in an eight @-@ line verse extolling Ramcharitmanas and Tulsidas . Abdur Rahim <unk> , famous Muslim poet who was one of the <unk> ( nine @-@ gems ) in the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar , was a personal friend of Tulsidas . Rahim composed the following couplet describing the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas – 
 The historian Vincent Smith , the author of a biography of Tulsidas ' contemporary Akbar , called Tulsidas the greatest man of his age in India and greater than even Akbar himself . The Indologist and linguist Sir George Grierson called Tulsidas " the greatest leader of the people after the Buddha " and " the greatest of Indian authors of modern times " ; and the epic Ramcharitmanas " worthy of the greatest poet of any age . " The work Ramcharitmanas has been called " the Bible of North India " by both nineteenth century Indologists including Ralph Griffith , who translated the four Vedas and Valmiki 's Ramayana into English , and modern writers . Mahatma Gandhi held Tulsidas in high esteem and regarded the Ramcharitmanas as the " greatest book in all devotional literature " . The Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi ' Nirala ' called Tulsidas " the most fragrant branch of flowers in the garden of the world 's poetry , blossoming in the creeper of Hindi " . Nirala considered Tulsidas to be a greater poet than Rabindranath Tagore , and in the same league as Kalidasa , Vyasa , Valmiki , Homer , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Shakespeare . Hindi <unk> Hazari Prasad Dwivedi wrote that Tulsidas established a " sovereign rule on the kingdom of Dharma in northern India " , which was comparable to the impact of Buddha . <unk> J. <unk> , author of the book Love and God and Social Duty in <unk> , says that if Tulsidas was born in Europe or the Americas , he would be considered a greater personality than William Shakespeare . In the words of the archaeologist F. R. <unk> , who translated Vinaypatrika and Kavitavali into English , " for people of a large part of North India Tulsidas claims reverence comparable to that accorded to Luther as translator of the Bible into the native German " . <unk> also mentions that the work Ramcharitmanas has been compared to not only the Ramayana of Valmiki , but the Vedas themselves , the Bhagavad Gita , the Kuran and the Bible . Ernest Wood in his work An Englishman <unk> Mother India considered the Ramcharitmanas to be " superior to the best books of the Latin and Greek languages . " Tulsidas is also referred to as <unk> , meaning the highest jewel among devotees . 
 Specifically about his poetry , Tulsidas has been called the " emperor of the metaphor " and one who excels in similes by several critics . The Hindi poet <unk> Upadhyay ' <unk> ' said of Tulsidas – 
 The Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma said commenting on Tulsidas that in the turbulent Middle Ages , India got light from Tulsidas . She further went on to say that the Indian society as it exists today is an edifice built by Tulsidas , and the Rama as we know today is the Rama of Tulsidas . 
 = Non @-@ intervention in the Spanish Civil War = 
 During the Spanish Civil War , several countries followed a principle of non @-@ intervention , to avoid any potential escalation and possible expansion of the war to other nations , which would result in the signing of the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement in August 1936 and the setting up of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee , which first met in September . Primarily arranged by the French and British governments , important members of the committee also included the Soviet Union , Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany . Ultimately , the committee had the support of 24 nations . 
 A plan to control materials coming into the country was put forward in early 1937 , effectively subjecting the Spanish Republic to international isolation , but was mocked by German and Italian decisive and immediate support for the rebel faction . The subject of volunteers was also much discussed , with little result ; although agreements were signed late on in the war , these were made outside the Committee . Efforts to stem the flow of war materials to Spain were largely unsuccessful , with foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War proving instrumental to its outcome . Nazi Germany , Italy , and the Soviet Union consistently broke the agreement they had signed , France occasionally so . Britain remained largely faithful to it . 
 = = Non @-@ Intervention Agreement = = 
 Non @-@ intervention , and with it the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement , had been proposed in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom . It was part of a policy of appeasement , aimed at preventing a proxy war – with Italy and Nazi Germany supporting Franco 's Nationalist Coalition right at the onset of the conflict and the Soviet Union supporting the Republican faction four months later – from escalating into a major pan @-@ European conflict . 
 On 3 August 1936 , Charles de <unk> , French ambassador to Italy , presented the French government 's non @-@ intervention plan ; Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it . The British , however , accepted the plan in principle immediately . The following day , it was put to Konstantin von Neurath , the foreign minister of Nazi Germany by André François @-@ Poncet . The German position was that such a declaration was not needed , but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe , so long as the USSR was present . It was mentioned at the meeting of the French with Neurath that both countries were already supplying the parties in the war , France the Republicans and Germany the Nationalists . A similar approach was made by the French to the Soviet Union . On 6 August , Ciano confirmed Italian support in principle . Despite a Pravda claim that 12 @,@ 145 @,@ 000 roubles had already been sent by Russian workers to Spain , the Soviet government similarly agreed in principle , so long as Portugal was included , and so long as Germany and Italy stopped aid immediately . 
 On 7 August 1936 , France unilaterally declared non @-@ intervention . Draft declarations had been put to the German and Italian governments . Such a declaration had already been accepted by the United Kingdom , Belgium , the Netherlands , Poland , Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union , which renounced all traffic in war material , direct or indirect . The Portuguese Foreign Minister , <unk> Monteiro , was also asked to accept , but held his hand . An ultimatum was put to Yvon Delbos by the British : halt French exports to Spain , or Britain would not be obliged to act under the Treaty of Locarno if Germany invaded ; on 9 August , exports were duly suspended . However , collections for food , clothing and medical supplies to the Spanish Republicans continued . On 9 August , the Germans informed the British that ' no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will ' , which was blatantly false . During the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish Republican Navy one German Junkers was captured when it came down in Republican territory , and explained as ' merely a transport aircraft ' . Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non @-@ Intervention Pact . Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August , unless her border was threatened by the war . 
 There was popular support in both countries for the plan , although whilst in the United Kingdom the socialist Labour Party was strongly in favour , the political left in France wanted to directly aid the Republicans . The Labour Party would reject non @-@ intervention in October 1937 . The British Trades Union Congress was split . A report called the ' Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Breaches of the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement in Spain ' was drawn up in London , sponsored by Comintern , and headed by respectable figures . Both the British and French governments were aware of the First World War . France was reliant on British support in general . Léon Blum , the French prime minister , believed that support for the Republic would have led to a fascist takeover in France and ultimately no change in Spain . 
 On 5 August 1936 , the United States had made it known that it would follow a policy of non @-@ intervention , but did not announce it officially . This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under @-@ Secretary of State Sumner Welles . Five days later , the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force ; the response was negative . It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts , including one by the Organization of American States . Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans . On 15 August , the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain . Neurath also agreed to the pact , and suggested that volunteers ( many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades ) be included . Italy similarly agreed , signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France . Although a surprising reversal of views , it has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway . Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely , and bring Europe to the brink of war , or to abandon them . On the 24th , Germany signed . 
 The Soviet Union was keen not to be left out . On 23 August 1936 , it agreed to the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement , and this was followed by a decree from Stalin banning exports of war material to Spain , thereby bringing the USSR into line with the Western Powers . Soviet foreign policy considered collective security against German fascism a priority and the Comintern had agreed a similar approach in 1934 . It walked a thin line between pleasing France and not being seen to hinder the World revolution and communist ideals . This was also the time of the first significant trials of the Old Bolsheviks in Russia . Soviet press and opposition groups were entirely against non @-@ intervention ; Soviet actions could hardly have been further from the goal of spreading the revolution . 
 It was at this point that the Non @-@ Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement , but the double @-@ dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent . It also removed the need for a declaration of neutrality ( which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled ) , and had little legal standing . In Britain , part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany 's and Italy 's preparedness for war . 
 = = Non @-@ Intervention Committee = = 
 The ostensible purpose of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee ( 1936 – 1939 ) was to prevent personnel and matériel reaching the warring parties of the Spanish Civil War , as with the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement . 
 The Committee first met in London on 9 September 1936 and was attended by representatives of solely European countries , and did not include Switzerland ( whose policy of neutrality prohibited even inter @-@ governmental action ) . It was chaired by the British W. S. Morrison . The meeting was concerned mostly with procedure only . Charles Corbin represented the French , Italy by Dino Grandi , and the Soviets by Ivan Maisky . Germany was represented by Ribbentrop ( with Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck as deputy ) but left the running to Grandi , although they found working with him difficult ; Portugal , whose presence had been a Soviet requirement , was not represented . There was little hope in the committee , since the British and French would have been aware of the continued shipment of arms to the Nationalists from Italy and Germany . Britain protested twice to the Italians , once in response to Italian aircraft landing in Majorca , the other pre @-@ emptively over any significant change in the Mediterranean . Stanley Baldwin , British prime minister , and Blum attempted to halt global exports to Spain , believing it in Europe 's best interests . Soviet aid to the Republic was threatened in the Committee . It began once it was clear the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement was not preventing Italian and German aid to the Nationalists . 
 The second meeting took place on 14 September 1936 . It established a subcommittee to be attended by representatives of Belgium , Britain , Czechoslovakia , France , Germany , Italy , the Soviet Union and Sweden , to deal with the day @-@ to @-@ day running of non @-@ intervention . Among them , though , the United Kingdom , France , Germany and Italy dominated , perhaps worryingly so . Soviet non @-@ military aid was revived , but not military aid . Meanwhile , the 1936 meeting of the League of Nations began , beset not only with the Spanish problem , but also with the review of the Abyssinia Crisis . It was much weakened , but still spoke out in favour of worldwide peace . There , Anthony Eden convinced Monteiro to have Portugal join the Non @-@ Intervention Committee . Álvarez del <unk> spoke out against the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement , claiming it put the rebel Nationalists on the same footing as the Republican government ; that as the official government , the Republic had the right to buy arms . On 28 September , Portugal was represented on the Committee for the first time ; the Earl of Plymouth replaced W.S. Morrison as British representative . Conservative , he often adjourned meetings – to the benefit of the Italians and Germans – and the Committee was accused of an anti @-@ Soviet bias . In Geneva , Maxim Litvinov once again confirmed Soviet support , based on the suggestion it would avoid war . However , the Soviet government remained hostile to the idea , and supported Álvarez 's view that non @-@ intervention was illegal . 
 On 12 November 1936 , significant changes were put in place to the functioning of the committee , with the ratification of plans to post observers to Spanish frontiers and ports to prevent breaches of the agreement . This had been delayed by Italian and German demands that air transport be included , which was perhaps a delaying tactic given the impossibility to doing so effectively . Russian military aid now being transported to Spain did not go unnoticed . France and Britain became split on whether to recognise Franco 's forces as a belligerent as the British wanted , or to fail to do as the French wanted . On 18 November , this was subsumed by the news that the Italian and German governments had recognised the Nationalists as the true government of Spain . A British bill preventing exports of arms to Spain by British ships from anywhere was signed . Yvon Delbos requested mediation ; at the same time , the Republic appealed to the Council of the League of Nations for assistance . Franklin Roosevelt , also approached , ruled out US interference with the words ' [ there should be ] no expectation that the United States would ever again send troops or warships or floods of munitions and money to Europe ' . On 4 December , France and Britain approached Italy , Germany , Russia and Portugal to request mediation . An armistice would be called , a commission sent to Spain , and , after a plebiscite , a government featuring those uninvolved in the war ( such as Salvador de Madariaga ) would be established . The considerable number of German soldiers in Spain – at least 5 @,@ 000 – was now clear , but Italy and Germany were opposed to isolated discussion of the matter . 
 On 10 December 1936 , Álvarez put the Republic 's case to the League of Nations , further demanding that the League condemn Italy 's and Germany 's decision to recognise the Nationalists . He pointed to the risk of the Spanish war spreading , and suggested that the Non @-@ Intervention Committee was ineffective . This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard <unk> , the British and French representatives respectively , who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan . The League condemned intervention , urged its council 's members to support non @-@ intervention , and commended mediation . It then closed discussion on Spain , leaving it to the Committee . The mediation plan , however , was soon dropped . Britain and France continued to consider , and put forward , plans to prevent foreign volunteers , outside of the Committee . 
 On 6 January 1937 , the first opportunity after the winter break , both houses of Congress in the United States passed a resolution banning the export of arms to Spain . Those in opposition to the bill , including American socialists , communists and many liberals , suggested that the export of arms to Germany and Italy should be halted also under the Neutrality Act of 1935 , since foreign intervention constituted a state of war in Spain . Cordell Hull , continued to doubt the extent of German and Italian operations , despite evidence to the contrary . The Soviets met the request to ban volunteers on 27 December , Portugal on 5 January , and Germany and Italy on 7 January . Adolf Hitler authored the German declaration . On 10 January , a further request that volunteering be made a crime was made by Britain and France to Germany . There continued Germany uneasiness about the scale , limitations and outcomes of intervention in Spain . On 20 January , Italy put a moratorium on volunteers , and on the 25 January Germany and Italy agreed to support limitations to prevent volunteers , believing that supplies to the Nationalists were now sufficient . In that meeting , both the Germans and Italian spoke as if their men in Spain were genuine volunteers . The Spanish Civil War ( Non @-@ Intervention ) Act , 1937 was signed into law on 24 February by the Irish , and provided penalties for exporters of war material , and for service in the military forces of a belligerent , and restricted travel to Spain . Soviet war aid continued to reach Spain through the Mediterranean . However , Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Russia continued to believe a European war was not in their best interests ; non @-@ intervention , however , would have left both sides with the possibility of defeat , which Germany , Italy and Russia in particular were keen to avoid . 
 = = = Control plan = = = 
 Observers were posted to Spanish ports and borders , and both Ribbentrop and Grandi were told to agree to the plan , significant shipments already having taken place . Portugal would not accept observers , although it did agree to personnel attached to the British Embassy in Lisbon . The cost of the scheme was put at £ 898 @,@ 000 ; Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Russia would each pay 16 % ; the other 20 % would be met by the other 22 countries . Zones of patrol were assigned to each of the four nations ; an International Board was set up to administer the scheme . The setting up of the scheme took until April . For the Republicans , this seemed like adding insult to injury – the wholesale transfer of arms to the Nationalists would now be policed by the very countries supplying them . Despite accusations that 60 @,@ 000 Italians were now in Spain , and Grandi 's announcement that he hoped no Italian volunteer would leave until the war was over , the German delegation appears to have hoped the control plan was effective . There were Italian assurances that Italy would not break up non @-@ intervention . 
 In May 1937 , the Committee noted two attacks on the patrol 's ships in the Balearic islands by Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft , the first on the Italian cruiser Barletta and the second on German pocket battleship Deutschland . It iterated calls for the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain , condemned the bombing of open towns , and showed approval of humanitarian work . Germany and Italy said they would withdrawn from the Committee , and from the patrols , unless it could be guaranteed there would be no further attacks . Early June saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols . Italian reticence of operations in Spain , however , was dropped . By contrast , it continued to be a crime in Germany to mention German operations . Following attacks ( attributed to Republicans by Germany , but denied ) on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June , Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols , but not from the Committee . This prompted the Portuguese government to remove British observers on the Spain – Portugal border . 
 Discussions about patrols remained complicated . Britain and France offered to replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections , but the latter powers believed these patrols would be too partial . Germany and Italy requested that land controls be kept , and belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists , so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval patrols . The French considered abandoning border controls , or perhaps leaving non @-@ intervention . However , the French were reliant on the British , who wished to continue with patrols . Britain and France thus continued to labour over non @-@ intervention ; whilst they judged it effective , some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July . The air route had not been covered . The Nationalists ' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks . On 9 July , the Dutch Ambassador suggested that Britain draft a compromise . Lord Plymouth did , called the ' compromise plan for the control of non @-@ intervention ' . Naval patrols would be replaced by observers in ports and ships , land control measures would be resumed . Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal . The French were furious , considering that Britain was moving towards Germany and Italy . Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights ; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first . 
 = = = Conference of Nyon and onwards = = = 
 It culminated in a period during 1937 when all the powers where prepared to give up on non @-@ intervention . Ciano complained to his government that Italian forces in Italy were ready but not being used ; the Soviet Union was not prepared to discuss belligerent rights ; Delbos was considering proposing mediation by Roosevelt and the Pope , whilst simultaneously preparing French war plans ; Britain 's new Prime Minister , Neville Chamberlain , saw securing a friendship with the Italian Benito Mussolini as a top priority . Eden confided he wished Franco to win , so Italian and Germany involvement would be scaled back ; Chamberlain considered Spain a troublesome complication to be forgotten . By the end of July 1937 , the Committee was in deadlock , and the aims of a successful outcome to the Spanish Civil War was looking unlikely . Unrestricted Italian submarine warfare began on 12 August . The British Admiralty believed that a significant control effort was the best solution , of four which were put forward , in response to attacks on British shipping . On 27 August it was decided by the Committee that naval patrols did not justify their expense and would be replaced , as planned , with observers at ports . 
 The Conference of Nyon was arranged in September 1937 for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline by the British , despite appeals by Italy and Germany that the Committee handle the piracy and other issues the conference was to discuss . It decided that French and British fleets patrol the areas of sea west of Malta , and attack any suspicious submarines . Warships that attacked neutral shipping would be attacked . On 18 September , Juan Negrín requested that the League of Nations ' Political Committee examine Spain . He also demanded an end to non intervention . Eden claimed that non @-@ intervention had stopped European war . The League did report on the Spanish situation , noting the ' failure of non @-@ intervention ' . On 6 November , the Committee met once again , with the plan to recognise the Nationalists as belligerents once significant progress had been made was finally accepted , down in part to Eden 's patience . The Nationalists accepted on 20 November , the Republicans on 1 December . The former suggested 3 @,@ 000 would be a reasonable number ; this was , in reality the number of sick and unreliable Italians Franco wished to withdraw . This was countered by British suggestions fifteen or twenty thousand might be enough . These talks were subsumed by bilateral Anglo @-@ Italian discussions . In trying to protect non @-@ intervention in the Anglo @-@ Italian meetings , which he grudgingly did , Eden would end up resigning from his post in the Foreign Office . On 17 March 1938 , France reopened the border to arms traffic to the now weakened Republic . Between mid @-@ April and mid @-@ June , 21 British seamen were killed by attacks on British shipping in Spanish waters , as well as several Non @-@ Intervention Committee observers . 
 On 27 June , Maisky agreed to the sending of two commissions to Spain , to enumerate foreign volunteer forces , and to bring about their withdraw . It was estimated to cost £ 1 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 to £ 2 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 , borne by member countries of the Committee . The Nationalists wished to prevent the fall of the favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom , and so were seen to accept the plan . With much bemoaning , the Republicans also accepted the plan . The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first , then withdrawals of 10 @,@ 000 from each side after , which amounted to a rejection of the plan . Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain . Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades , a majority of whom were now Spaniards , at the last meeting of the League of Nations , thereby showing his contempt for the Non @-@ Intervention Committee . Similarly , Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo @-@ Italian agreement , not through the Committee . 
 Britain and France recognised the Nationalist government on 27 February 1939 . Clement Attlee criticised the way it had been agreed , calling it ' a gross betrayal ... two and a half years of hypocritical pretence of non @-@ intervention ' . 
 = Simca Vedette = 
 The Simca Vedette is a large car , manufactured from 1954 to 1961 by the French automaker Simca , at their factory in Poissy , France . It was marketed with different model names according to trim and equipment levels . The Vedette was Simca 's largest model at that time and it spawned a more economical version , the Simca Ariane . 
 Simca acquired the Poissy factory from Ford France ( Ford Société Anonyme Française , the French subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company ) , along with the model line , in 1954 . The Vedette was therefore initially still marketed as the Ford Vedette . 
 The Vedette was manufactured in Poissy until 1961 and the Ariane until 1963 . After that , production continued in Brazil , where the Vedette finally evolved into the Simca <unk> , following Simca 's takeover by Chrysler . 
 = = Origins and launch = = 
 In the early 1950s , Henri Théodore Pigozzi was looking to expand the manufacturing operations of his Simca company , which was enjoying much success at the time , thanks to the popular Aronde . At the same time , Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary , Ford SAF , which had a factory in Poissy , close to Paris , where it had been manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette . The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion . The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time . These points attracted Pigozzi , who decided to take over the entire factory , along with the rights to the cars manufactured there . 
 The cars appeared at the Paris Motor Show in October 1954 on the Ford France stand , but there was no mention of the Ford name on the covers of the brochures offered to potential customers . The name " Ford " appeared just once , in very small print , on the final page , presumably in order to avoid confusing customers who would be expected to call the cars " <unk> " from 1 December 1954 , the date set for the formal hand @-@ over of the business . In export markets the name change was less immediate , and even in adjacent Belgium , in January 1955 at the Brussels Motor Show the cars were still appearing on the stand of the Belgian Ford importer , sharing the space with models imported from Ford of Britain . 
 = = First generation = = 
 The acquisition by Pigozzi took place in July 1954 , just when Ford was poised to launch its new , modern Vedette , with a four @-@ door saloon body of " American " style , much like the contemporary British Fords or <unk> . The car was powered by an unusually small <unk> cc <unk> V8 engine called Aquillon in France , derived from Ford 's Flathead engine family , whose displacement positioned the car into the " 13 CV " French tax class . Equipped with a two @-@ barrel Zenith @-@ Stromberg <unk> carburetor , it produced 75 to 84 hp ( 56 to 63 kW ) . Power was transferred to the rear live axle through a three @-@ speed manual transmission with column shift . The Vedette had independent front suspension ( by MacPherson struts ) and drum brakes on all four wheels . 
 As with the Aronde , Simca marketed different trim levels of the Vedette under different model names , this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history . The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon , the mid @-@ level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and , at the top of the range , the Simca Vedette Régence . An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof , called <unk> The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets , including the Netherlands and Germany , until 1956 . As the new model caught on , Simca was able to increase production from the 150 daily achieved during Ford 's ownership of the factory to 250 cars a day . 
 Pigozzi maintained a schedule of year @-@ to @-@ year model revisions , much like US manufacturers . For 1956 , an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line @-@ up and the whole range was revised . A new license plate holder was added to the front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler . A peculiar addition was a pedal @-@ operated windscreen washer , while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer , also known as a ' trip meter ' , for measuring partial distances . The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests ( Versailles in the rear only , Régence in front and rear ) , while the Trianon was simplified , losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor . In 1957 , an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added , along with better brakes and more direct steering . The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen , while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design . Fender @-@ mounted V8 badges were introduced but , although the whole range featured the same V8 engine , the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly .

 After three years in production , the <unk> were given new names and a new , elongated body , with a more ornate front end and large tailfins , making the cars even more American @-@ looking than before . This was part of a styling trend shown by most large European cars of that period , which were , to some extent , inspired by American styling , as tailfins appeared on Peugeots , <unk> , BMC models ( <unk> Farina @-@ styled ) , Fords and even Mercedes @-@ Benz cars of that era . The engine was uprated to 84 hp ( 63 kW ) ( now called Aquillon 84 ) but the fiscal qualification of the car remained unchanged . Using the new body , the Versailles was replaced by Simca Vedette Beaulieu and the Régence by the Chambord , while the estate retained the Vedette Marly name . 
 The three @-@ year @-@ old body of the previous Vedette nevertheless continued in production but it lost its V8 2 @.@ 4 @-@ litre engine . In April 1957 , fitted with the 1 @.@ 3 L Aronde engine , the old body now clothed a new model in the Simca range , the Simca Ariane . Later , in October 1957 , a V8 version of the old bodied car , with the Aquillon 84 engine , and badged as the Ariane 8 , joined the range , replacing the Trianon . 
 1959 brought a new option , the Rush @-@ Matic automatic transmission , which featured two modes : Rush ( fully automatic ) and Road ( manual gear selection ) . The same year , assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil . Also during 1959 , a new top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line model joined the Vedette range , the Présidence , featuring a luxurious interior , a <unk> ( a European first ) and a continental kit . French coachbuilder <unk> built two 2 @-@ door Présidence convertibles for a governor of one of the French colonies . <unk> had another order the next year , to build two four @-@ door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle . The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960 , but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year , when they received new seats , new chrome decor , and the engine was fitted with a new anti @-@ vibration crankshaft . 
 French production of the V8 @-@ engined cars ended in the summer of 1961 , by when 173 @,@ 288 had been produced , although a Simca Chambord was exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October of that year , suggesting that Simca still had some stock of the cars to clear . The small @-@ engined 4 @-@ cylinder Ariane , of which 166 @,@ 363 were produced , survived until 1963 . 
 The model was continued for longer in Brazil , where it was marketed with the 2 @.@ 4 @-@ litre V8 under a variety of names like " <unk> " , " Jangada " , and " <unk> " . It was eventually replaced by a version with new <unk> , called the Simca <unk> .

 = Cutzinas = 
 Cutzinas or <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) was a Berber tribal leader who played a major role in the wars of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire against the Berber tribes in Africa in the middle of the 6th century , fighting both against and for the Byzantines . A staunch Byzantine ally during the latter stages of the Berber rebellion , he remained an imperial vassal until his murder in 563 by the new Byzantine governor . 
 = = Life = = 
 Cutzinas was of mixed stock : his father was a Berber , while his mother came from the Romanized population of North Africa . Following the reconquest of North Africa by the East Roman ( Byzantine ) Empire in the Vandalic War ( 533 – 534 ) , several uprisings by the native Berber tribes occurred in the North African provinces . Cutzinas is mentioned by the eyewitness historian Procopius of Caesarea as one of the leaders of the rebellion in the province of Byzacena , alongside <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In spring 535 , however , the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine military commander Solomon in the battles of Mammes and Mount <unk> , and Cutzinas was forced to flee west to Mount Aurasium in Numidia , where he sought the protection of the local Berber ruler , Iaudas . 
 Cutzinas disappears from the record until 544 , by which time , according to the epic poem Iohannis of the Roman African writer Flavius Cresconius Corippus , he was an ally of the Byzantines and a friend of Solomon . In that year , the Berber rebellion , suppressed by Solomon after his pacification of the tribes of Mount Aurasium in 540 , flared up again in Tripolitania and quickly spread to Byzacena , where the Berbers rose up under the leadership of Antalas . This time , Cutzinas opposed the revolt , and brought his own people , the " <unk> " ( the reading of the name is uncertain ) on the side of the Byzantine military . 
 In 544 , Solomon was killed in battle , and over the next year the Byzantine position in Africa crumbled before the rebels . In late 545 , Cutzinas and Iaudas joined Antalas in a march against Carthage , the capital and main stronghold of the Byzantine government in Africa . Cutzinas secretly agreed with the Byzantine governor , Areobindus , to betray Antalas , when battle was joined ; Areobindus , however , revealed this to Guntharis , a Byzantine commander who was in turn in contact with Antalas and planned to betray Areobindus himself . To gain time to prepare , Guntharis advised Areobindus to take Cutzinas ' children hostage ; in the event Guntharis launched an uprising in Carthage which the thoroughly unwarlike Areobindus failed to suppress , resulting in his execution and the usurpation of the governorship by Guntharis . After his plans were revealed by Guntharis to Antalas , Cutzinas changed sides once more and allied himself with Guntharis , giving his mother and son as hostages . Along with the Armenian commander Artabanes , he was sent to pursue Antalas , scoring a victory over the rebel forces near Hadrumetum . 
 In winter 546 / 7 , when the new Byzantine governor and commander @-@ in @-@ chief , John Troglita , arrived in Africa , Cutzinas and his followers joined him , and participated in the expedition that saw the defeat and submission of Antalas . Shortly after , Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita . In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan . Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces , but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas , who had once more risen in revolt . In the same winter , Cutzinas quarreled with another pro @-@ Byzantine Berber leader , Ifisdaias . Their dispute threatened to spill over into open armed conflict , but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two . 
 In spring 548 , he participated once more in Troglita 's campaign , according to Corippus at the head of no less than 30 @,@ 000 men , divided into units a thousand strong under a Berber dux each . This number possibly also includes Byzantine troops placed under Cutzinas ' command as well . During the campaign , Cutzinas and the other Berber leaders were crucial in suppressing a near @-@ mutiny of the Byzantine troops due to Antalas ' scorched earth strategy . The Berbers ' steadfast support enabled Troglita to overcome the crisis and lead his army against the forces of Carcasan and Antalas . Cutzinas fought in the ensuing Battle of the Fields of Cato , which was a decisive Byzantine victory : Carcasan fell , and the Berber revolt was crushed as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita . 
 After this , Cutzinas remained as a vassal chieftain , receiving regular pay from the Byzantine authorities . In January 563 , however , the new prefect of Africa , John <unk> , refused to hand over the money and had Cutzinas murdered , prompting an uprising from the latter 's children . 
 = David Greenglass = 
 David Greenglass ( March 2 , 1922 – July 1 , 2014 ) was an atomic spy for the Soviet Union who worked on the Manhattan Project . He was briefly stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and then worked at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico from August 1944 until February 1946 . He provided testimony that helped convict his sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law Ethel and Julius Rosenberg , who were executed for their spying activity . Greenglass served nine and half years in prison . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Greenglass was born in 1922 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City . His parents , Barnet and Tessie , were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria , respectively . He attended <unk> High School , and graduated in 1940 . He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute but did not graduate . 
 Greenglass married Ruth Printz in 1942 , when she was 18 years old . The two joined the Young Communist League shortly before Greenglass entered the U.S. Army in April 1943 . They had a son and a daughter . He worked as a machinist at Fort Ord , California , and then at the Mississippi Ordnance Plant in Jackson , Mississippi . In July 1944 , Greenglass was assigned to the secret Manhattan Project , the wartime project to develop the first atomic weapons . He was first stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , but was there for less than two weeks . In August 1944 he was sent to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico . In order to pass his security clearance , he disguised or omitted details of his communist associations , and had friends write glowing references . 
 Julius Rosenberg , who had married Greenglass ' sister , Ethel , in 1939 , had become an agent for the Soviet Union ( USSR ) , working under Alexander Feklisov . In September 1944 , Rosenberg suggested to Feklisov that he should consider recruiting his brother @-@ in @-@ law , David Greenglass , and his wife . On September , 21 , 1944 , Feklisov reported to Moscow : " They are young , intelligent , capable , and politically developed people , strongly believing in the cause of communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible . They are undoubtedly devoted to us ( the Soviet Union ) . " David wrote to his wife : " My darling , I most certainly will be glad to be part of the community project ( espionage ) that Julius and his friends ( the Russians ) have in mind . " 
 After Julius Rosenberg recommended his sister @-@ in @-@ law Ruth Greenglass to his NKVD superiors for the use of her apartment as a safe house for photography , the NKVD realized that David was working on the Manhattan Project . He was then recruited into Soviet espionage by Ruth at Rosenberg 's behest in November 1944 . Greenglass began to pass nuclear secrets to the USSR via the courier Harry Gold , and more directly with a Soviet official in New York City . According to the Venona project intercepts decrypted by the National Security Agency between 1944 and some time in the 1970s , Greenglass and his wife Ruth were given code names . David was codenamed " <unk> " ( " calibre " ) and Ruth " OSA " ( " wasp " ) . Greenglass turned down requests from the Los Alamos Laboratory ( and Rosenberg ) to work on the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atol because he wanted to be with Ruth . He was honorably discharged from the Army on February 29 , 1946 . Greenglass returned to Manhattan , where , with his brother Bernie , and Julius Rosenberg , he ran a small machine shop known as G & R Engineering . 
 On February 14 , 1950 , Ruth , who was pregnant with their second child , came too close to the gas heater in their Lower East Side apartment , and her nightgown caught on fire . Greenglass extinguished the blaze , but she suffered severe burns . She was taken to Gouverneur Hospital for skin grafts . He suffered second degree burns to his right hand . He was already aware that the UK and US intelligence agencies had discovered that a Los Alamos theoretical physicist , Klaus Fuchs , had spied for the USSR during the war . Through Fuchs ' confession , they found that one of his American contacts had been a man named Harry Gold from Brooklyn , New York . Gold had passed Fuchs ' information on to a Soviet agent , performing the role of courier , and Anatoli Yakovlev would then pass the information on to his controllers in the USSR . Through Gold , the FBI 's trail led to Greenglass and the Rosenbergs , who had allegedly also used Gold as a courier . When Fuchs was first captured , Julius allegedly gave the <unk> $ 5 @,@ 000 to finance an escape to Mexico . Instead , they went to the Catskills and used the money to seek legal advice . 
 = = Trial and aftermath = = 
 David Greenglass was arrested by the FBI for espionage in June 1950 and quickly implicated Julius Rosenberg . He explicitly denied his sister Ethel 's involvement when he testified before a grand jury testimony in August 1950 . In February 1951 , weeks before the trial , he changed his testimony to claim that Ethel had typed up his notes . He testified against his sister and her husband in court in 1951 as part of an immunity agreement . In exchange for that testimony , the government allowed Ruth to stay with their two children . She was named a co @-@ conspirator , but was never indicted . Greenglass told the court , " I had a kind of hero worship there with Julius Rosenberg and I did not want my hero to fail ... " 
 During subsequent testimony in 1951 , Greenglass related in detail the secrets he passed on to the Soviet Union . He falsely attributed passing the cross @-@ section drawing of the Atom Bomb to the Soviets to Julius and he also acknowledged passing other sketches through Gold . He described his work on the molds into which were poured the component of the explosive lenses of the Fat Man bombs used for the Trinity nuclear test and in the bombing of Nagasaki . At first this was a matter of difficulty for the prosecution , who wanted Greenglass to testify in open court about the secrets he had given — something which would by definition make them no longer " secret " . 
 The Atomic Energy Commission decided that the implosion concept could be declassified for the trial , and limited all discussion to the weapons used in World War II ( fearing that Greenglass may have seen prototypes for future weapons while at Los Alamos ) . As a result of a surprise defense motion that all testimony about the alleged " secret of the atomic bomb " be impounded , Federal Judge Irving Kaufman at first made all spectators and news reporters leave the room when Greenglass began testifying about his " secrets " . 
 Ten minutes later , Judge Kaufman invited the news reporters back in , asking them to use their discretion in reporting on Greenglass 's testimony . The Rosenberg 's defense attorney , Emanuel H. Bloch , attempted to convince the jury that his clients were concerned about issues of national security , but failed . Greenglass ' testimony , later seen to be crude and in the words of many scientists who examined it " worthless " , remained sealed until 1966 . He also testified that Rosenberg had stolen and given to the Russians a proximity fuze . 
 However , Aleksander Feklisov also claimed that Julius Rosenberg supplied him with a whole proximity fuze , which would corroborate at least this part of Greenglass ' testimony . During the trial , Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop business failure . Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass ' character and testimony . At Greenglass ' sentencing hearing , his attorney O. John Rogge repeatedly told the court his client deserved " a pat on the back " for his testimony and argued that a light sentence , no more than five years , would encourage others to follow his example . Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison . He was released after nine and a half years and reunited with his wife . 
 In March 1953 , three months before the Rosenbergs ' executions , he wrote a letter for his attorney to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess . He wrote : " if these two die , I shall live the rest of my life with a very dark shadow on my conscience " . He described his own testimony as " an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country , my family and myself " and explained how he now viewed its consequences : " Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me , and I took it deliberately . I could not believe that this would be the outcome . May God in His mercy change that awful sentence . " That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium @-@ 238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it . 
 = = Later years = = 
 After his release in 1960 , Greenglass and his family lived in New York City under an assumed name . For some years they lived at 130 – 73 228th Street in Laurelton , Queens , New York . In 1996 , Greenglass recanted his sworn testimony in an interview with The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister 's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife . At the trial , Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians , though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing , saying “ I frankly think my wife did the typing , but I don 't remember . ” Greenglass explained , " My wife is more important to me than my sister . Or my mother or my father , O.K. ? And she was the mother of my children . " When Roberts asked Greenglass if he would have done anything differently , he replied , " Never . " The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband 's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute . 
 In 2008 , when a group of academic historians sought the release of the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that indicted the Rosenbergs , Greenglass objected to the government 's release of his testimony . U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein declined to order the release of the testimony of Greenglass and other surviving witnesses who withheld their consent or could not be located . The grand jury testimony was finally released in July 2015 . Greenglass never mentioned involvement by his sister in Rosenberg 's delivery of atomic secrets to the Russians . 
 Greenglass died on July 1 , 2014 . His death was not publicly announced by his family and was only discovered on October 14 , 2014 , when The New York Times called the nursing home where he had been living under an assumed name .

 " Pork and Beans " is a song by the American alternative rock band Weezer , released on the group 's 2008 self @-@ titled album Weezer . It was released in digital form on April 24 , 2008 . The track debuted at number 19 on Billboard 's Modern Rock chart , and spent eleven weeks at number one . The song charted in many countries such as Canada , Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as the United States . 
 A music video of the song , which incorporated many YouTube celebrities and memes with the band , was premiered first on YouTube and was one of the most popular videos in the weeks following its release . The video won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 Rivers Cuomo , lead singer and guitarist for Weezer , wrote the song in reaction to a meeting with Geffen executives , who told the band members that they needed to record more commercial material . Cuomo remarked , " I came out of it pretty angry . But ironically , it inspired me to write another song . " Jacknife Lee produced the track with the band in early 2008 in what was the third and final recording session for the album . The many references to popular culture in the song are said to be a " statement of defiance " according to Internet reviewer David Ritter , who later describes it to be an " anti @-@ anthem anthem " that opens up a " broad space for critical exploration of what it means to be an aging band in the major label system " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to the director of the video for " Pork and Beans " , the song is about " the idea of being yourself , of being happy with who you are " . In the album notes , Cuomo compares this to Timbaland 's music , " It actually sounds like a Timbaland kind of production ; he has little baby crying type of sounds . " A reference is also made to Timbaland in the second verse with the line " Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart " . The song similarly refers to items such as <unk> and Oakley sunglasses . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The song has been generally well received by critics . Many reviewers were pleased with what they saw as a return @-@ to @-@ form sound reminiscent of the The Blue Album ( 1994 ) and Pinkerton ( 1996 ) albums . Pitchfork Media writer Marc Hogan gave the song a positive review and described the song as , " a catchy , self @-@ referential rocker , with the buzzsaw guitars and big choruses of Weezer 's glory days , and that familiar , self @-@ assured lameness . " Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a positive review , " That <unk> @-@ <unk> guitar hook is pure [ Weezer ] gold , so much so that I didn 't focus on Rivers Cuomo 's very clever lyrics at first . " Stereogum was also impressed with the song stating it was a " sweet , savory dose of self @-@ referential , self @-@ deprecating Weezer rock ... This stuff sounds very familiar in a good , good way . " NME described the song as having " [ Cuomo 's ] best chorus in ages " . However , Internet reviewer David Ritter speculated that the song was either " voided by the wholesale capitulation involved in going home and writing said commercial material " or " a calculated attempt to boost record sales by wrapping faux @-@ defiance in pretty paper , " going on to compliment its " Scorcho @-@ y acoustic guitar , " he then said that this , along with the " keyboard <unk> " and " squeals and squeaks " , has little effect on the song and that they barely register on top of the much more noticeable lead vocals and power chords . 
 In terms of chart performance , " Pork and Beans " is one of Weezer 's most successful singles in its 16 @-@ year career . The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks charts in only its third week on the charts . It became its ninth Top 10 hit on this chart and third number one overall and spent 11 weeks at number one , making it one of only 17 songs to ever sit at number one on that particular chart for 10 weeks or longer and one of three songs to have spent 11 weeks at number one . It also represented its fastest rising single ever , reaching number one after a mere 11 days after release . It debuted at number 39 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart , where it is peaked at number 25 and debuted in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 84 with 17 @,@ 000 downloads of the song on iTunes and peaked at number 64 .

 = The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton ( Philadelphia ) = 
 The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton is a luxury residential skyscraper in Center City in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . At 518 feet ( 158 m ) , the 48 @-@ story skyscraper is the tenth @-@ tallest building in Philadelphia , and the tallest residential tower in the city . The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991 . One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E / R Partners to the Arden Group the next year . Development of the site by the Arden Group , which owns the adjacent Ritz @-@ Carlton Philadelphia , was delayed for years as a result of a feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties . Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street , which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower . The feud began after Arden Group 's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower 's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton tower . This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each other 's towers . 
 After several redesigns , the feud was declared over , and construction on the Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton began on May 2 , 2006 . The blue glass skyscraper opened to residents in January 2009 . The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton features 270 condominiums and penthouses , which range in price from US $ 550 @,@ 000 to US $ 12 million . The high @-@ rise also features an underground parking garage , a fitness center , a pool , and a private garden and public plaza called Girard Park . 
 = = History = = 
 The Residences at the Ritz @-@ Carlton stands on the former site of the 38 @-@ story One Meridian Plaza . In February 1991 One Meridian Plaza was badly damaged by a fire that destroyed eight floors and killed three firefighters . Because of litigation over what to do with the burned skyscraper , it sat vacant for eight years until it was demolished in 1999 . 
 In 2000 the Arden Group settled with One Meridian Plaza 's owners E / R Partners to pay more than US $ 13 million for the site . In 1999 Arden sued E / R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners . E / R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount . Arden had already bought the adjacent Two Mellon Plaza in 1993 . Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire , Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz @-@ Carlton hotel in 2000 . Also adjacent to the south side of the One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street . Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three @-@ story shops and the eighteen @-@ story Morris Building , all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire . The buildings were demolished in 2000 . The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street . While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage . 
 = = = Feud = = = 
 Looking for a new headquarters Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties to work together and combine the properties into one building . The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites , but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided to move on with their own towers . As they sought to build competing condominium towers , the relationship between the two developers soon turned into a feud between the firm 's lead partners , Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties . In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50 @-@ story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site . At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows . He also said the tower was " snubbing his nose at the traditional zone of respect around City Hall . " Spencer filed a lawsuit to block construction of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street . Mariner appealed the ruling . 
 In 2004 Spencer and Mahoney announced that the feud was over and that plans for their towers would move forward . Spencer announced that Arden would build a 740 feet ( 230 m ) , 57 @-@ story luxury condominium tower called The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton . The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton would be more than 100 feet ( 30 m ) taller than the skyscraper Spencer criticized as too tall in 2003 . Spencer said " To develop a world @-@ class building , you need to get people high up in the air . " 
 However the feud quickly restarted as Mahoney criticized the design of The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton 's lower floors . The bulky floors were designed to contain a grand ballroom , health club , and 540 @-@ car parking garage . Mahoney says the design would unnecessarily lower the values of the condominiums on 21 of the lower floors of his building . Further redesigns to both buildings prevented any condominiums from facing a garage . However the feud continued with lively arguments to block each other plans in courtrooms and Philadelphia city agencies . Chairman of the zoning board , David L. Auspitz , called the feud the " Super Bowl of zoning battles " . 
 In July 2005 , Spencer announced a redesign of The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton shrinking the building from 57 floors to 44 floors . Among the facilities removed in the redesign were the ballroom and some of the parking . Afraid the high @-@ rise would miss the city 's hot condominium market , the redesign sidestepped the legal challenges because it would not need special approval by the Zoning Board to exceed a certain height . Mahoney vowed to continue fighting the building saying " If [ Spencer ] needs so much as a curb @-@ cut permit , we 're going to block it . " In March 2009 , Mahoney and Spencer reached an agreement that ended all legal challenges between the buildings . Now at 48 stories , The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton was far enough from Mahoney 's 1441 Chestnut Street that 1441 Chestnut Street had views of Philadelphia City Hall , while the 58 @-@ story 1441 Chestnut Street upper portion was redesigned in a way that allowed views on the south side of The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton .

 Construction began on May 2 , 2006 with a ceremony that featured Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell . By September 2006 one @-@ third of the buildings units had been sold . The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton was topped off in July 2008 , and the high @-@ rise opened for residents on January 13 , 2009 . The skyscraper was officially dedicated with a ceremony on June 8 , 2009 .

 The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton is a 48 @-@ story 518 feet ( 158 m ) -tall residential skyscraper owned by the Arden Group and its partners <unk> Group and Colgate Development . Financed through Lehman Brothers and designed by Handel Architects the rectangular skyscraper is the tenth tallest building in Philadelphia and is the tallest residential tower in the city . The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton has a blue glass curtain wall and the east side of the building is pointed allowing views of Philadelphia City Hall . The building features 270 one - three bedroom condominiums and penthouses that range between 890 square feet ( 83 m2 ) to 2 @,@ 045 square feet ( 190 m2 ) . The condominiums and penthouses range in price from US $ 550 @,@ 00 to US $ 12 million . 
 The building 's amenities include hotel services , a fitness club , and a 60 feet ( 18 m ) lap pool . The lobby features a restaurant named 10 Arts owned by chef Eric <unk> , who also owns a condo in the building . Between The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton and the Ritz @-@ Carlton Hotel is Girard Park . Girard Park is split into a gated garden for residents and a public space facing the street . A memorial for the three firefighters who died during the One Meridian Plaza fire was unveiled on October 21 , 2009 . Designed by the Philadelphia Fire Department , the memorial is located by the building 's entrance and contains the firefighters ' names on plaques . 
 The Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron says the glass skyscraper is a " shocking " contrast next to the white marble of the Ritz @-@ Carlton Hotel . Saffron said she liked the blue glass and that the " angled aluminum cap over the first floor is an especially sleek finish , and ties nicely into the aluminum bands that organize the facade into horizontals and verticals . " Her negative opinions of the building included the public space of Girard Park which she describe as a " barren , virtually unusable piece of concrete " . 
 = Maryland Route 528 = 
 Maryland Route 528 ( MD 528 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known for most of its length as Coastal Highway , the state highway runs 9 @.@ 04 miles ( 14 @.@ 55 km ) from the southern terminus of its companion route , unsigned Maryland Route 378 , in downtown Ocean City north to the Delaware state line at the northern edge of the resort town , where the highway continues as Delaware Route 1 ( DE 1 ) . MD 528 and MD 378 are the primary north – south streets of Ocean City , where they provide access to countless hotels , condos , restaurants , shops , and other businesses catering to tourists . These highways experience heavy seasonal traffic and provide access to hurricane evacuation routes , which include U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) , MD 90 , and DE 54 . Both Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in the late 19th century . MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue in 1927 and MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue in 1933 . MD 528 was extended north of 15th Street to the Delaware state line in 1939 . Both highways were rebuilt and widened in the 1950s . MD 528 was expanded to a six @-@ lane divided highway north of the one @-@ way pair in the late 1980s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 528 and MD 378 both have their southern termini at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and South 1st Street at the southern end of Ocean City north of the Ocean City Inlet . Baltimore Avenue continues south and then turns east toward a large municipal parking lot serving attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk , including <unk> 's Rides . From the southern terminus , MD 528 heads west on South 1st Street and then north as Philadelphia Avenue , while MD 378 heads north as Baltimore Avenue . The two state highways form a one @-@ way pair , with MD 378 carrying three lanes of northbound traffic and MD 528 carrying three lanes of southbound traffic . Both streets intersect South Division Street , which was the site of the railroad terminus in Ocean City and is currently the site of Sunset Park , and Worcester Street , which was the site of the first automobile bridge to the resort in 1916 . 
 MD 528 and MD 378 head north through the downtown area of Ocean City , where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street . North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one @-@ way eastbound , so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street , which is one @-@ way westbound and designated MD <unk> , to access US 50 west . MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street , which is one @-@ way westbound and designated MD 378B . MD 528 becomes two @-@ way at 9th Street . MD 378 continues north as a two @-@ lane street northbound to 15th Street , where the state highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528 . Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two @-@ way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street . 
 MD 528 continues north from 9th Street as a divided highway with two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound . The state highway gains a third lane northbound at MD 378 ( 15th Street ) . At 17th Street , MD 528 assumes its form for the remainder of its course to the Delaware state line : three lanes in each direction plus a continuous combined right turn and bus lane in both directions . After passing the Jolly Roger Amusement Park , MD 528 meets 33rd Street , which is one @-@ way westbound coming from the northern end of Baltimore Avenue . North of 33rd Street , MD 528 becomes Coastal Highway , the only through highway on the barrier island that is lined with numerous hotels and businesses . The state highway passes the Ocean City Convention Center at 40th Street and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 90 ( Ocean City Expressway ) at 62nd Street . MD 528 continues north past hotels , condos , and businesses in the northern part of Ocean City , passing the Gold Coast Mall at 112th Street . Farther north , the route reaches the Delaware state line at 146th Street , two blocks east of the Fenwick Island Light . Coastal Highway continues into Fenwick Island as DE 1 , which meets the eastern terminus of DE 54 one block north of the state line . 
 MD 528 is a part of the main National Highway System from US 50 to the Delaware state line . 
 = = History = = 
 Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in 1875 . Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street . The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street . Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s . MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue , which was paved from US 213 ( Worcester Street ) to 15th Street by 1927 . MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933 . MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939 . 
 In the 1940s , traffic in Ocean City increased so much there was a movement to make Baltimore and Philadelphia Avenues one @-@ way in the downtown area , a change that was implemented by 1948 . Traffic volume in Ocean City increased even more following the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952 , leading to expansion of the city 's north – south arterials . MD 378 was widened along its entire length in 1951 and 1952 . MD 528 was widened to four lanes along its entire length in 1953 and 1954 . Both state highways were extended to their present southern termini at that time . The first portion of MD 528 to be expanded to a divided highway was around the intersection with MD 90 ; the highway between 60th and 63rd Streets was reconstructed by 1978 . Two sections of six @-@ lane divided highway were completed around 1989 : from 25th Street to 65th Street , and from 85th Street to 122nd Street . By 1991 , MD 528 was divided highway from 25th Street to the Delaware state line . The segment of Philadelphia Avenue from 9th Street to 25th Street was changed from a five- to six @-@ lane highway with a center turn lane to a divided highway in 2001 . A pedestrian safety project aimed to reduce jaywalking will install a dune @-@ style fence in the median of MD 528 , with the first phase to take place between 41st Street / Convention Center Drive and MD 90 . Construction on the first phase is expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year .

 = = Plot = = 
 Harry Potter is a seemingly ordinary boy , living with his neglectful relatives , the Dursleys , in Surrey , England . On his eleventh birthday , Harry discovers from a mysterious stranger , Rubeus Hagrid , that he is actually a wizard , famous in the Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when Harry was only a baby . Voldemort killed Harry 's parents , but his attack on Harry rebounded , leaving only a lightning @-@ bolt scar on Harry 's forehead and rendering Voldemort powerless . Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . After buying his school supplies from the hidden London street , Diagon Alley , Harry boards the train to Hogwarts via the concealed Platform 9 ¾ in King 's Cross Station . 
 On the train , Harry meets Ron Weasley , a boy from a large but poor pure @-@ blood wizarding family , and Hermione Granger , a witch born to non @-@ magical parents . Once they arrive , Harry and all the other first @-@ year students are sorted between four houses : Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Because Slytherin is noted for being the house of darker wizards and witches , Harry convinces the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin . He ends up in Gryffindor , along with Ron and Hermione . Ron 's older brothers were all placed in Gryffindor as well : mischievous twins Fred and George , Percy , the prefect , Charlie ( who researches dragons in Romania ) and Bill ( who works for Gringotts Bank ) . 
 At Hogwarts , Harry begins learning wizardry and discovers more about his past and his parents . He gets recruited for Gryffindor 's Quidditch ( a sport in the wizarding world where people fly on broomsticks ) team as a Seeker , as his father was before him . One night , he , Ron , and Hermione discover a large three @-@ headed dog named Fluffy ( owned by Hagrid ) on a restricted floor in the school . They later find out Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher 's Stone , an item that can be used to grant its owner immortality . Harry concludes that his potions teacher , the unfriendly Severus Snape , is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort ( who Harry encounters in the Forbidden Forest where he , Ron , Hermione and Draco Malfoy are serving detention by helping Hagrid look for an injured unicorn after being caught wandering around at night ) to a human form . 
 After hearing from Hagrid that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music , Harry , Ron and Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape does . They face a series of tasks that are helping guard the stone , which include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil 's Snare , flying past a swarm of bird @-@ shaped flying keys and winning a violent , dangerous , life @-@ sized chess game . 
 After getting past the tasks , Harry discovers that it was really Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell who was trying to steal the stone , and that Snape was protecting Harry all along . Quirrell removes his turban and reveals Voldemort to be living on the back of his head . Voldemort attempts to convince Harry to give him the stone ( which Harry suddenly finds in his pocket as the result of an enchantment by the headmaster , Albus Dumbledore ) , by promising to bring his parents back from the dead , but Harry refuses . Quirrell attempts to kill him but Harry 's touch prevents Quirrell from hurting Harry and causes his hand to turn to dust . Quirrell then attempts to take the stone but Harry grabs his face , causing Quirrell to turn into dust and die . When Harry gets up , Voldemort 's spirit forms and passes through Harry , knocking him unconscious , before fleeing . 
 Harry wakes up in the school 's hospital wing , with Professor Dumbledore at his side . Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed , and that , despite Ron nearly being killed in the chess match , both Hermione and Ron are fine . The reason Quirrell burned at Harry 's touch was because when Harry 's mother died to save him , her death gave Harry a magical , love @-@ based protection against Voldemort . Harry , Ron and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances , and Neville Longbottom is rewarded for bravely standing up to them , winning Gryffindor the House Cup . Before Harry and the rest of the students leave for the summer , Harry realises that while all other students are going home , Hogwarts is truly his home . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Rowling insisted that the cast be kept British . Susie Figgis was appointed as casting director , working with both Columbus and Rowling in auditioning the lead roles of Harry , Ron and Hermione . Open casting calls were held for the main three roles , with only British children being considered . The principal auditions took place in three parts , with those auditioning having to read a page from the novel , then to improvise a scene of the students ' arrival at Hogwarts , and finally to read several pages from the script in front of Columbus . Scenes from Columbus ' script for the 1985 film Young Sherlock Holmes were also used in auditions . On 11 July 2000 , Figgis left the production , complaining that Columbus did not consider any of the thousands of children they had auditioned " worthy " . On 8 August 2000 , the virtually unknown Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger , respectively . 
 Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old British orphan raised by his unwelcoming aunt and uncle , who learns of his own fame as a wizard known to have survived his parents ' murder at the hands of the psychopathic dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he saw him in the BBC 's production of David Copperfield , before the open casting sessions had taken place , but had been told by Figgis that Radcliffe 's protective parents would not allow their son to take the part . Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis ' resignation . Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000 , when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of Stones in His Pockets in London . Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe 's parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion , and they agreed to let him play Harry . Rowling approved of Radcliffe 's casting , stating that " having seen [ his ] screen test I don 't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry . " Radcliffe was reportedly paid £ 1 million for the film , although he felt the fee was not " that important " . William Moseley , who was later cast as Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia series , also auditioned for the role . 
 Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley , Harry 's best friend at Hogwarts . He decided he would be perfect for the part " because [ he has got ] ginger hair , " and was a fan of the series . Having seen a Newsround report about the open casting he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the part . His attempt was successful as the casting team asked for a meeting with him . 
 Emma Watson as Hermione Granger , Harry 's other best friend and the trio 's brains . Watson 's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents and she had to do over five interviews before she got the part . Watson took her audition seriously , but " never really thought [ she ] had any chance of getting the role . " The producers were impressed by Watson 's self @-@ confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied . 
 John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick , the ghost of Hogwarts ' Gryffindor House . 
 Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid , a half @-@ giant and Hogwarts ' Groundskeeper . Coltrane was Rowling 's first choice for the part . Coltrane , who was already a fan of the books , prepared for the role by talking with Rowling about Hagrid 's past and future . Robin Williams was considered for the role . 
 Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick , the Charms Master and head of Hogwarts ' Ravenclaw House . 
 Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley , Harry 's Muggle ( non @-@ magical ) uncle . 
 Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore , Hogwarts ' Headmaster and one of the most famous and powerful wizards of all time . Harris initially rejected the role of Dumbledore , only to reverse his decision after his granddaughter stated she would never speak to him again if he did not take it . 
 Ian Hart as Quirinus Quirrell , the slightly nervous Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts , and also Lord Voldemort 's voice . David Thewlis auditioned for the part ; he would later be cast as Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . 
 John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander , the owner of <unk> , the finest wand producers in the wizarding world since 382 B.C. 
 Alan Rickman as Severus Snape , the Potions Master and head of Hogwarts ' Slytherin House . Tim Roth was the original choice for the role , but he turned it down for Planet of the Apes . 
 Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley , Harry 's Muggle aunt . 
 Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall , the Deputy Headmistress , head of Gryffindor and transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts . Smith was Rowling 's personal choice for the part . 
 Julie Walters as Molly Weasley , Ron 's caring mother . She shows Harry how to get to Platform 9 3 ⁄ 4 . Before Walters was cast , American actress Rosie O 'Donnell held talks with Columbus about playing Mrs. Weasley . 
 Rik Mayall was cast in the role of Peeves , a poltergeist who likes to prank students in the novel . Mayall had to shout his lines off camera during takes , but the scene ended up being cut from the film .

 In 1997 , producer David Heyman searched for a children 's book that could be adapted into a well @-@ received film . He had planned to produce Diana Wynne Jones ' novel The Ogre Downstairs , but his plans fell through . His staff at Heyday Films then suggested Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , which his assistant believed was " a cool idea . " Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros. and in 1999 , Rowling sold the company the rights to the first four Harry Potter books for a reported £ 1 million ( US $ 1 @,@ 982 @,@ 900 ) . A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British , nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore , and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such . Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she " didn 't want to give them control over the rest of the story " by selling the rights to the characters , which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non @-@ author @-@ written sequels . 
 Although Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the film , he declined the offer . Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film , with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter 's voice , or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well . Spielberg contended that , in his opinion , it was like " shooting ducks in a barrel . It 's just a slam dunk . It 's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts . There 's no challenge . " Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films and that " [ a ] nyone who thinks I could ( or would ) have ' veto @-@ ed ' [ sic ] him [ Spielberg ] needs their Quick @-@ Quotes Quill serviced . " Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead . 
 After Spielberg left , talks began with other directors , including : Chris Columbus , Terry Gilliam , Jonathan Demme , Mike Newell , Alan Parker , Wolfgang Petersen , Rob Reiner , Ivan Reitman , Tim Robbins , Brad Silberling , M. Night Shyamalan and Peter Weir . Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000 , and the choice was narrowed down to Silberling , Columbus , Parker and Gilliam . Rowling 's first choice director was Terry Gilliam , but Warner Bros. chose Columbus , citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision . Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours , stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes " to be bleak and dreary " but those set in the wizarding world " to be steeped in color , mood , and detail . " He took inspiration from David Lean 's adaptations of Great Expectations ( 1946 ) and Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) , wishing to use " that sort of darkness , that sort of edge , that quality to the cinematography , " taking the colour designs from Oliver ! and The Godfather . 
 Steve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay . He described adapting the book as " tough " , as it did not " lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books . " Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros. , which he " almost never read " , but Harry Potter jumped out at him . He went out and bought the book , and became an instant fan of the series . When speaking to Warner Bros. , he stated that the film had to be British , and had to be true to the characters . Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to " [ destroy ] her baby . " Rowling admitted that she " was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves , " but recalled her initial meeting with him : " The first time I met him , he said to me , ' You know who my favourite character is ? ' And I thought , You 're gonna say Ron . I know you 're gonna say Ron . But he said ' Hermione . ' And I just kind of melted . " Rowling received a large amount of creative control , an arrangement that Columbus did not mind . 
 Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over the 4 July 2001 weekend , making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out of the running . Due to time constraints , the date was put back to 16 November 2001 . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Two British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom , offering their assistance in securing filming locations , the use of Leavesden Film Studios , as well as changing the UK 's child labour laws ( adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on @-@ set classes more flexible ) . Warner Bros. accepted their proposal . Filming began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and concluded on March 23 , 2001 , with final work being done in July . Principal photography took place on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire 's <unk> railway station . Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland 's <unk> Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts ; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposal due to concerns about the film 's " pagan " theme . Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts , with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School . Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two @-@ week period ; these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes . Oxford University 's Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing , and Duke Humfrey 's Library , part of the Bodleian , was used as the Hogwarts Library . Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell , Berkshire . Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day , so payments to the street 's residents were correspondingly increased . For all the subsequent film 's scenes set in Privet Drive , filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios , which proved to have been cheaper than filming on location . London 's Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank , while Christ Church , Oxford was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room . London Zoo was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley , with King 's Cross Station also being used as the book specifies . 
 Because the American title was different , all scenes that mention the philosopher 's stone by name had to be re @-@ shot , once with the actors saying " philosopher 's " and once with " sorcerer 's " . The children filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork . They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff . Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as his eyes are blue , and not green like Harry 's , but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation . Upon consultation with Rowling , it was agreed that Harry could have blue eyes . 
 = = = Design and special effects = = = 
 <unk> Makovsky designed the costumes . She re @-@ designed the Quidditch robes , having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book , but deemed them " a mess . " Instead , she dressed the Quidditch players in " <unk> sweaters , 19th century fencing breeches and arm guards . " Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios , including Hogwarts Great Hall , basing it on many English cathedrals . Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes , Craig decided to build his own set , comprising Tudor , Georgian and Queen Anne architecture . 
 Columbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures , including Fluffy . Nick Dudman , who worked on Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace , was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics , with Jim Henson 's Creature Shop providing creature effects . John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times . The film features nearly 600 special effects shots , involving numerous companies . Industrial Light & Magic created Lord Voldemort 's face on the back of Quirrell , Rhythm & Hues animated Norbert ; and Sony Pictures Imageworks produced the film 's Quidditch scenes .

 John Williams was selected to compose the score . Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before recording it in London in August 2001 . One of the main themes is entitled " Hedwig 's Theme " ; Williams retained it for his finished score as " everyone seemed to like it " . 
 = = Differences from the book = = 
 Columbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct . Kloves described the film as being " really faithful " to the book . He added dialogue , of which Rowling approved . One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then @-@ unreleased Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix novel . 
 Several minor characters have been removed from the film version , most prominent among them the spectral History of Magic teacher , Professor Binns , and Peeves the poltergeist . The book 's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after , highlighting how non @-@ magical people react to magic . The film removes this , beginning with Professor Dumbledore , Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys ( although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day ) . Harry 's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg 's are cut from the film while the boa constrictor from Brazil in the zoo becomes a Burmese Python in the film . Some conflicts , such as Harry and Draco 's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin 's robe shop and midnight duel , are not in the film . Some of Nicolas Flamel 's role is changed or cut altogether . Norbert is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film ; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to Charlie Weasley 's friends . Rowling described the scene as " the one part of the book that she felt [ could easily ] be changed " . As such , the reason for the detention in the Forbidden Forest was changed : In the novel , Harry and Hermione are put in detention for being caught by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower after hours , Neville and Malfoy are given detention when caught in the corridor by Professor McGonagall . In the film , Harry , Hermione and Ron receive detention after Malfoy catches them in Hagrid 's hut after hours ( Malfoy however , is given detention for being out of bed after hours ) . Firenze the centaur , who is described in the book as being palomino with light blonde hair , is shown to be dark in the film . The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers .

 The film received positive reviews from critics , who praised its visuals and acting performances , but criticised its pace and for being too faithful to the book . The film garnered an 80 % " Fresh " rating on Rotten Tomatoes . Its consensus reads , " Being so faithful to the book is both the movie 's strength and weakness . The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book , so there is little room for surprises or discoveries . For Potter fans , what more can you ask for ? " . It has a score of 64 out of 100 at Metacritic representing " generally favourable reviews " . Roger Ebert called Philosopher 's Stone " a classic , " giving the film four out of four stars , and particularly praising the Quidditch scenes ' visual effects . Praise was echoed by both The Telegraph and Empire reviewers , with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film 's " stand @-@ out sequence " . Brian Linder of IGN.com also gave the film a positive review , but concluded that it " isn 't perfect , but for me it 's a nice supplement to a book series that I love " . Although criticising the final half @-@ hour , Jeanne <unk> of Palo Alto Online stated that the film would " enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers . " USA Today reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars , especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane 's portrayal of Hagrid , but criticised John Williams ' score and concluded " ultimately many of the book 's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation . " The sets , design , cinematography , effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter , although he deemed John Williams ' score " a great clanging , banging music box that simply will not shut up . " Todd McCarthy of Variety compared the film positively with Gone with the Wind and put " The script is faithful , the actors are just right , the sets , costumes , makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine . " Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post recalled that the film was " remarkably faithful , " to its literary counterpart as well as a " consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation . " 
 Richard Corliss of Time magazine , considered the film a " by the numbers adaptation , " criticising the pace and the " charisma @-@ free " lead actors . CNN 's Paul <unk> found that Columbus and Kloves " are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book , the so @-@ called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling 's head .

 = Sultanate of Singora = 
 The Sultanate of Singora was a heavily fortified port city in southern Thailand and precursor of the present @-@ day town of Songkhla . It was founded in the early 17th century by a Persian , Dato Mogol , and flourished during the reign of his son , Sultan Sulaiman Shah . In 1680 , after decades of conflict , the city was destroyed and abandoned ; remains include forts , city walls , a Dutch cemetery and the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah . An inscribed cannon from Singora bearing the seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah is displayed next to the flagpole at the Royal Hospital Chelsea , London . 
 The sultanate 's history was documented in accounts , letters and journals written by British and Dutch East India Company traders ; its destruction was discussed in books and reports authored by representatives of the French embassies to Siam in the mid 1680s . Sultan Sulaiman 's family history has also been chronicled : Princess Sri Sulalai , a consort of King Rama II and mother of King Rama III , was descended from Sultan Sulaiman ; present @-@ day descendants include the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand and a former Navy admiral . Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon include articles published in academic journals and letters written by General Sir Harry Prendergast , commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo @-@ Burmese war . 
 = = Early history = = 
 The Sultanate of Singora , sometimes known as Songkhla at Khao Daeng , was a port city in the deep south of Thailand and precursor of the present @-@ day town of Songkhla . It was located near the southern tip of the <unk> Phra peninsula , on and around the foothills of Khao Daeng Mountain in Singha Nakhon . British and Dutch East India Company traders called the city Sangora ; Japanese officials knew it as <unk> ; contemporary French writers used the names <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Singora was founded in the early 17th century by Dato Mogol , a Persian Muslim who accepted Siamese suzerainty and paid tribute to the Kingdom of Ayutthaya . The port was said to be ideal and able to accommodate more than 80 large vessels ; a network of overland and riverine routes expedited trans @-@ peninsular trade with the Sultanate of Kedah . Jeremias van Vliet , Director of the Dutch East India Company 's trading post in Ayuthaya , described Singora as one of Siam 's principal cities and a major exporter of pepper ; French traveller and gem merchant John Baptista Tavernier wrote about the city 's abundant tin mines . A Cottonian manuscript at the British Library discusses Singora 's duty @-@ free policy and viability as a hub for regional trade : 
 <unk> were not amiss to build a strong howse in Sangora which lyeth 24 Leagues <unk> of <unk> , under the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the King of Siam : In this place <unk> well the <unk> bee made to bring all <unk> together that you shall gather for the <unk> of the <unk> of Siam , Cochinchina , Borneo and <unk> our <unk> in Japan , as you shall gather according to the advises thereof , And hither to bring all such wares as wee shall gather from the <unk> places to bee sent to Bantam and <unk> : this howse <unk> found to bee verie Necessarie , for the charges <unk> too highe in <unk> besides inconveniences there ; which charges you shall spare at Sangora : there you pay no <unk> , <unk> a small gift to <unk> <unk> <unk> effect all here . 
 Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was succeeded by his eldest son , Sulaiman . A period of turmoil erupted ten years later when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam , King Prasat Thong , a usurper and tyrant . The queen withheld tribute and ordered attacks on <unk> ( present @-@ day Nakhon Si <unk> ) and <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> ) ; Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60 @,@ 000 men . Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help . The outcome of this request is not known , but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed . 
 = = Independence = = 
 In December 1641 Jeremias van Vliet left Ayuthaya and sailed to Batavia . He stopped en route at Singora in February 1642 and presented Sulaiman with a letter of introduction from the Phra <unk> ( known by the Dutch as the <unk> ) , the Siamese official responsible for foreign affairs . Sulaiman 's response sheds light on his attitude towards suzerainty : 
 On the 3rd of February the delegate van <unk> landed at Sangora and was received by the governor , who was angry at the <unk> 's letter , saying that his country was open to the Netherlanders without Siamese introduction and that the letter had not been necessary . This and other haughty acts displeased the Hon. van <unk> . 
 Later that year Sulaiman declared independence from Ayuthaya and appointed himself Sultan Sulaiman Shah . He modernised the port , ordered the construction of city walls and moats , and built a network of forts that spanned the harbour to the summit of Khao Daeng . Trade flourished : the city was frequented by Dutch and Portuguese merchants and enjoyed amicable relations with Chinese traders . Ayuthaya tried at least three times to reclaim Singora during Sulaiman 's reign ; each attack failed . One naval campaign ended in ignominy when the Siamese admiral abandoned his post . To help fend off overland assaults , Sulaiman assigned his brother , Pharisees , to strengthen the nearby town of Chai Buri in <unk> . 
 Sultan Sulaiman died in 1668 and was succeeded by his eldest son , Mustapha . A war with Pattani broke out soon after , but despite being outnumbered more than four to one , Singora rejected attempts at mediation by the Sultan of Kedah and trusted in its army of experienced soldiers and cannoneers . During the late 1670s Greek adventurer Constance <unk> arrived in Siam . He sailed to the country from Java on a British East India Company vessel and , heeding orders from his employer , promptly embarked on a mission to smuggle arms to Singora . His escapade ended in failure when he was shipwrecked . 
 = = Destruction = = 
 In 1679 Ayuthaya mounted a final offensive to quash the Singora rebellion . Samuel Potts , a British East India Company trader based in Singora , recorded the city 's preparations for war : 
 This King has fortified his City , gunned his Forts upon the hills , making all the provision he can for his defence , not knowing how soon the King of Siam will oppose him . 
 In a letter dated August 1679 Potts informed his East India Company colleague that the Siamese fleet had arrived and stressed the impending danger . The events that followed were decisive : in 1680 , after a siege lasting more than six months , Singora was destroyed and abandoned . Contemporary French sources document the city 's destruction and provide a wealth of detail . The head of the French East India Company 's operations in Ayuthaya described how Singora 's " <unk> bonne <unk> " had been razed after a war of more than thirty years ; a missionary working in Ayuthaya in the mid 1680s told how the King of Siam sent his finest ships to destroy the sultanate " de fond en <unk> " ( from top to bottom ) . Simon de la <unk> , France 's envoy to Siam in 1687 , recounted a story about a French <unk> who crept into the city one night and single @-@ handedly captured the sultan : 
 Some have upon this account informed me a thing , which in my opinion , will appear most incredible . ' Tis of a provincial named Cyprian , who is still at Surat in the French Company 's Service , if he has not quitted it , or if he is not lately dead : the name of his Family I know not . Before his entrance into the Companies service , he had served some time in the King of Siam 's Army in quality of <unk> ( ... ) Cyprian wearied with seeing the Armies in view , which attempted no persons life , <unk> 'd one night to go alone to the Camp of the Rebels , and to fetch the King of <unk> into his Tent . He took him indeed , and brought him to the Siamese General , and so terminated a War of above twenty years . 
 While <unk> 's account of life in 17th @-@ century Siam was well received by his contemporaries in France , the veracity of his tale about Cyprian and Singora 's demise has been questioned . An article published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland , for example , described it as " a story which might have passed in a romantic age , but it is too improbable for history " . In a memo dated 1685 a French East India Company official claimed that Singora was finally captured by means of a ruse . Thailand 's Ministry of Culture supports this version of events and discusses a spy who tricked his way into the city , enabling Siamese troops to enter and burn it to the ground . 
 = = Cession to France = = 
 In 1685 Siam attempted to cede Singora to France : the hope was that the French East India Company , supported by a garrison of troops , could rebuild the city , establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence . The city was offered to France 's envoy to Siam , the Chevalier de Chaumont , and a provisional treaty signed in December ; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession . The French , however , were not interested : Secretary of State for the Navy , the Marquis de <unk> , told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use , and asked for a trading post in Bangkok instead . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After Singora had been destroyed , Sultan Sulaiman 's sons were pardoned and assigned to new positions in Siam . Later generations of Sultan Sulaiman 's family were closely connected with Siamese royalty : two of Sulaiman 's descendants commanded armed forces led by Prince <unk> in the 1786 conquest of Pattani ; Princess Sri Sulalai , a consort of King Rama II and mother of King Rama III , was also descended from Sultan Sulaiman . Present @-@ day descendants include Admiral <unk> <unk> , a former Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Royal Thai Navy ; General Chavalit <unk> , the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand ; and a family of silk weavers at the Muslim village of <unk> in Surat Thani . 
 = = = The forts at Khao Daeng = = = 
 Thailand 's Ministry of Culture details the remains of fourteen forts on and around Khao Daeng Mountain . Forts 4 , 8 and 9 are well preserved and characterise the sultanate 's military architecture : fort 4 can be reached by ascending a flight of steps that starts behind the archaeological information centre , fort 8 is accessible via a stairway near the Sultan Sulaiman Shah mosque , fort 9 sits atop a small motte near the main road leading from Singha Nakhon to Ko Yo Island . Forts 5 and 6 occupy the upper slopes of the mountain and offer panoramic views of Lake Songkhla and the Gulf of Thailand . The two pagodas on the summit of Khao Daeng were built on the base of fort 10 during the 1830s to commemorate the suppression of rebellions in Kedah . 
 In her book In the Land of Lady White Blood : Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History , Lorraine <unk> discussed a manuscript from Wat Phra Kho in <unk> Phra . The manuscript ( which in <unk> 's opinion dates from the late 17th century ) consists mainly of an illustrated map about ten metres long that depicts Sultan Sulaiman 's forts at Khao Daeng . A microfilm of this manuscript , made by American historian David Wyatt , is kept at the Cornell University Library . 
 = = = The tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah = = = 
 Located in a Muslim graveyard about 1 km north of Khao Daeng , the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah is housed in a small , Thai @-@ style pavilion surrounded by large trees . The cemetery is mentioned in the Sejarah <unk> Melayu Patani ( History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani ) , a Javi account drawn mostly from the Hikayat Patani . The text describes Sultan Sulaiman as a Muslim raja who died in battle and the cemetery as " full of nothing but jungle " . The tomb is an object of pilgrimage in the deep south of Thailand , where Sultan Sulaiman is revered by Muslims and Buddhists alike . 
 = = = The Dutch cemetery = = = 
 About 300 metres from the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman is a Dutch cemetery known locally as the <unk> Graveyard . The cemetery is located within the grounds of a PTT petroleum complex ; permission is needed to gain access . In 1998 an investigation of the cemetery was conducted using ground @-@ penetrating radar . The survey yielded detailed <unk> showing subsurface lime coffins that belonged to Singora 's 17th @-@ century Dutch community . A paper discussing these findings was presented to the IV meeting of the Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society in Barcelona , September 1998 . 
 = = The Singora cannon in London = = 
 Following Singora 's destruction , Siamese troops seized and sent to Ayuthaya an inscribed cannon . The cannon remained there until it was captured during the Burmese @-@ Siamese war of 1765 – 1767 and transported to Burma . It was then taken by the British in the third Anglo @-@ Burmese war ( 1885 – 1887 ) and shipped to England . In 1887 it was presented to the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London and put on display next to the flagpole in the grounds of the Figure Court . The cannon bears eleven inscriptions , nine of which have been carved in Arabic characters and inlaid with silver . One inscription refers to the engraver , Tun Juma 'at Abu <unk> of Singora ; another is set within a circular arabesque design and reads " The seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah , the Victorious King " . 
 Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon 's journey to London include the <unk> <unk> ( the first official chronicle of Burma 's Konbaung Dynasty ) and reports written by General Sir Harry Prendergast , commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo @-@ Burmese war . The <unk> <unk> provides an inventory of weapons taken by the Burmese after the sack of Ayuthaya , noting that most guns were destroyed and only the finest pieces conveyed to Burma . Correspondence between General Prendergast and his superiors in India details ordnance seized during the Burma campaign and lists cannon sent as presents to Queen Victoria , the Viceroy of India , British governors of Madras and Bombay , the Royal Naval College in Greenwich , Portsmouth and Plymouth dockyards , and the Royal Hospital Chelsea . A letter at the Royal Hospital refers to the Singora cannon as a Burmese trophy gun received from the Government of India in October 1887 . 
 = Maryland Route 234 = 
 Maryland Route 234 ( MD 234 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known as Budds Creek Road , the state highway runs 19 @.@ 02 miles ( 30 @.@ 61 km ) from U.S. Route 301 ( US 301 ) in Allens Fresh east to MD 5 in Leonardtown . MD 234 is the primary east – west highway of southern Charles County and western St. Mary 's County , connecting the St. Mary 's County seat of Leonardtown and the communities of Clements , Chaptico , Budds Creek , Wicomico , and Newport with US 301 , which heads north to La Plata , the county seat of Charles County , and south to the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River . 
 MD 234 originally followed what is now MD 238 from Chaptico east to MD 5 at Helen . The Chaptico – Leonardtown portion of the highway was then designated as part of MD 237 . The original MD 234 was constructed in the early 1920s ; MD 237 was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s . MD 237 between Clements and Leonardtown was reconstructed around 1950 . The Chaptico – Clements section of MD 237 and MD 234 west of Chaptico were rebuilt around 1960 , projects that involved many relocations and several new bridges . At the conclusion of the project in 1961 , MD 234 was extended east over the former section of MD 237 to Leonardtown ; MD 238 was extended from Chaptico to Helen on what was previously MD 234 .

 MD 234 begins at a directional crossover intersection with US 301 ( Robert Crain Highway ) about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge , also known as the Potomac River Bridge . The state highway heads east as a two @-@ lane road that crosses over CSX 's Popes Creek Subdivision and passes through the hamlet of Allens Fresh . MD 234 crosses Allens Fresh Run , a tributary of the Wicomico River , as the stream flows out of the southern end of Zekiah Swamp , which is preserved within Zekiah Swamp Natural Environment Area . The state highway passes through the community of Newport , home of St. Mary 's Roman Catholic Church , and crosses Gilbert Swamp Run into the hamlet of Wicomico , which contains the historic home Sarum . MD 234 leaves Charles County by crossing over Budds Creek . 
 MD 234 curves southeast through the hamlet of Budds Creek , where the highway meets the southern end of MD 236 ( Thompson Corner Road ) and passes three motorsports facilities : Maryland International Speedway , Budds Creek Motocross , and Potomac Speedway . The state highway continues southeast , passing by Wicomico Shores Country Club and its associated residential area separated from the highway by a large tract of forest . MD 234 crosses Hayden Run and passes through Chaptico , where the highway intersects MD 238 at a roundabout ; MD 238 heads northeast as Chaptico Road and southwest as Maddox Road . The state highway passes another historic home , Deep Falls , on the way to Clements . At Clements , MD 234 intersects MD 242 ( Colton Point Road ) , which leads south to the site of Maryland 's First Landing at St. Clement 's Island . The state highway crosses Clements Creek and heads east through farmland , crossing Nelson Run right before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 5 ( Point Lookout Road ) on the western edge of Leonardtown . 
 = = History = = 
 MD 234 originally followed roughly its current course from Allens Fresh to Chaptico , then followed what is now MD 238 east to MD 5 at Helen . The highway between Chaptico and Leonardtown via Clements was MD 237 . MD 234 was constructed as a gravel road from Allens Fresh east to Newport around 1921 . The highway was extended east to the Charles – St. Mary 's county line in 1923 . The Chaptico – Helen road , as well as 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of road west of Chaptico , were also constructed in 1923 . The original course of MD 234 was completed when the gap between Chaptico and the county line at Budds Creek was filled in 1925 . MD 237 was started between Clements and Leonardtown in 1924 and between Chaptico and Clements in 1926 . By 1927 , there were two 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) sections of gravel east from Chaptico and east from Clements . Another section of highway west from Clements was built in 1928 . By 1930 , MD 237 was complete from Clements to Leonardtown . The gap between Chaptico and Clements was under construction in 1930 and completed in 1932 . 
 The first upgrade of MD 234 was a relocation at Allens Fresh Run , which included replacing a dangerous one @-@ way bridge over the stream , that was completed in 1933 . MD 237 was reconstructed with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951 , a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown . Reconstruction of MD 234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD 237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961 . MD 234 and MD 237 were significantly straightened out , leaving behind many sections of old alignment : <unk> School Road in Allens Fresh ; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport ; <unk> Store Road in Newport ; Plater Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico ; Stone Corner Lane , which is unsigned MD <unk> , and Reed Road in Budds Creek ; and Horse Shoe Road between Chaptico and Clements . The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run , Chaptico Creek , and Budds Creek . When the project was completed in 1961 , MD 234 assumed the course of MD 237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD 238 was extended over the segment of MD 234 between Chaptico and Helen . 
 The first roundabout in St. Mary 's County was installed at the intersection of MD 238 and MD 234 in Chaptico in 2007 . In September 2011 , MD 234 's bridge over Allens Fresh Run was washed out by flooding of the creek due to torrential rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee . Traffic was detoured over MD 236 , MD 6 , and US 301 until a temporary bridge was completed parallel to the damaged section in November 2011 . The Maryland State Highway Administration dismantled the damaged 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) long bridge and built a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) long replacement bridge in 2012 .

 = Calitoxin = 
 Calitoxin , also known as CLX , is a sea anemone neurotoxin produced by the sea anemone <unk> parasitica . It targets crabs and octopuses , among other invertebrates . Two isoforms ( CLX @-@ 1 and CLX @-@ 2 ) have been identified , both of which are formed from precursors stored in the stinging cells of the anemone . Once the toxin is activated and released , it causes paralysis by increasing neurotransmitter release at invertebrate neuromuscular junctions . Along with several other toxins derived from anemones , CLX is useful in ion channel research . Certain structural aspects of calitoxin are dissimilar from sea anemone toxins that also target the sodium ion channels . Other toxins resembling calitoxin function in completely different ways . 
 = = Source and discovery = = 
 Calitoxin is a highly potent neurotoxin produced by the sea anemone <unk> parasitica , which is stored in the nematocysts of stinging cells ( cnidocytes ) . This sea anemone is a species from the <unk> family and is present along the European coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea . The name calitoxin is derived from the organism from which the toxin was isolated . The toxin was isolated by a team of researchers in Naples , Italy from animals collected in the Bay of Naples . The team isolated the polypeptide through a series of <unk> until the <unk> had lost toxic activity . The resulting pellet was purified using the techniques liquid chromatography , gel filtration , and <unk> . The team then sequenced the purified polypeptide chain . They also published details on the toxin 's effects in vitro on crustacean tissue preparations , including nerve and muscle . Their findings were published in the journal Biochemistry in 1989 . 
 = = Structure and chemistry = = 
 The formula for calitoxin is <unk> . It has a molecular mass of <unk> <unk> and an isoelectric point at pH 5 @.@ 4 . The amino acid sequence is markedly dissimilar from other known sea anemones toxins . There are two known genes coding for two highly homologous <unk> — CLX @-@ 1 and CLX @-@ 2 . Both originate from a precursor peptide of 79 amino acids where the C @-@ terminus determines whether it will be the mature CLX @-@ 1 or CLX @-@ 2 . The activated toxins consist of 46 amino acids with three disulfide bonds . Researchers suspect that the toxins are stored as precursors in cnidocytes . Under the effects of some triggering stimulus , the precursor is modified and released in the active form . The patterning of cleavage sites targeted during maturation of the peptide suggest that the active quaternary structure might be a <unk> . 
 Calitoxin and other sea anemone toxins are used in studying ion channels , with potential applications in biomedical and physiology research . In the mature CLX , one base @-@ pair substitution is responsible for a single glutamic acid to lysine replacement in the coding region of CLX @-@ 2 , leading to the difference between the two isoforms . The structural organization of these two genes show a high degree of homology . This suggests that the two different peptides have the same biological function . This cannot yet be confirmed because only CLX @-@ 1 has been isolated from C. parasitica . Calitoxin has a very different sequence from another sodium channel binding sea anemone toxin , <unk> II , which is produced by the distantly related <unk> sulcata . A better understanding of these differences might offer insights about the function of particular amino acid residues . Despite markedly dissimilar gene sequences , CLX @-@ 1 affects crustacean axon potentials similar to two other classes of anemone toxins . Alternatively , certain aspects of the structure of the CLX genes are found in scorpion toxins as well as other sea anemone toxins that block potassium channels . 
 = = Target and activity = = 
 Calitoxin causes massive neurotransmitter release from the nerve terminals of the neuromuscular junction , which in turn causes a strong muscle contraction and even paralysis . The exact target of calitoxin has not yet been clarified ; since it has a similar action on the neuromuscular junction as <unk> sulcata toxins , calitoxin may slow down the inactivation of voltage @-@ gated sodium channels in motor neurons . Calitoxin has been tested for activity on the crab Carcinus <unk> . Purified toxin was injected into the hemocoel of the crab . The minimum dose of 0 @.@ 2 µg of toxin triggered muscle contractions in the crab , causing paralysis within 1 minute . The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) is unknown . 
 = = Function in nature = = 
 Sea anemones produce toxins , such as calitoxin , in their stinging cells ( cnidocytes ) . These cells contain organelles called nematocysts . When triggered , an envenomation response occurs . This can result in injury to target organisms , including capture of prey , defense against predatory organisms , or against aggressors from within their own species . In its natural setting , C. parasitica can establish a mutualistic relationship with the hermit crab <unk> <unk> . The sea anemone identifies shells inhabited by the hermit crab and attaches . C. parasitica provides protection for the hermit crab , by stinging or intimidating potential predators . Octopuses will avoid shells bearing C. parasitica . In return for the protection , the sea anemone gains an advantage in accessing a broader distribution of food sources , as the crab moves across the ocean floor . 
 = Americana ( film ) = 
 Americana is a 1983 American drama film starring , produced , edited and directed by David Carradine . The screenplay and story , written by Richard Carr , was based on a portion of the 1947 novel , The Perfect Round , by Henry Morton Robinson . The novel 's setting was originally post @-@ World War II , but the screenplay involved the post @-@ war experiences of a Vietnam War veteran , obsessed with restoring an abandoned carousel . 
 In 1981 , the film , won The People 's Choice Award at the Director 's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival . Financing the movie himself , Carradine shot most of the footage for the film , which was co @-@ produced by Skip Sherwood , in 1973 with a band of 26 people , mostly his family and friends , over the course of 18 days . Problems with financing and distribution kept the film from being released until 1983 . The film was well received by audiences , but met with primarily negative criticism . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A down on his luck , former Green Beret captain ( Carradine ) , freshly discharged from the Vietnam War , drifts into Drury , Kansas . There he finds a derelict merry @-@ go @-@ round that he decides to restore . " The symbolism of a man wanting to build something joyful after being part of the carnage and destruction of war , " surmised film critic , Charles Champlin . The people of the town have mixed reactions : some support his efforts while others hinder them . Among his supporters are two local business men : a hardware store owner , played by Barbara Hershey 's father , Arnold Herzstein , and Mike , a gas station proprietor played by Michael Greene , who had guest @-@ starred on two episodes of Carradine 's television series , Kung Fu . Both men supply employment to the veteran as well as parts and tools for his endeavour . 
 Another helpful character is a young local girl , who watches the reconstruction efforts from afar , and scampers off when she is seen . The girl , played by Carradine 's real life domestic partner , Barbara Hershey , provides a tool box and some food . Detractors of the veteran 's efforts include a band of local teenagers , one of whom is played by John Blyth Barrymore , a personal friend of Carradine 's and a frequent guest star on Kung Fu . The protagonist is also harassed by the town 's sheriff , played by Carradine 's brother , Bruce . 
 When the town 's ruffians vandalize the half @-@ restored carousel , the captain <unk> his efforts . By this time he has found , to his displeasure , that Mike 's favorite pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights , and the two have a falling out . Mike refuses to make good on a promise of a much needed part for the carousel , unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog . The veteran reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog . After installing the last piece that completes the carousel 's restoration , he lays the dog 's body inside it , starts it up and walks away , while the townspeople look on . 
 = = Cast and crew = = 
 In addition to those previously mentioned , the film also featured Dan Haggerty , who starred in the television series , The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams . He provided the fighting dog , played the role of the dog 's trainer and worked on the set design and the actual restoration of the carousel . 
 Robert Carradine , David Carradine 's younger half @-@ brother , assisted with the camera work . Greg Walker , former Kung Fu stunt coordinator , served as stunt coordinator and played one of the town 's ruffians . Fran Ryan , whom Carradine met while they both worked on The Long Riders ( 1980 ) , played a colonel in a scene that was shot several years after the main body of footage . Claire Townsend , a United Artists ( UA ) executive who had helped finance the film , played a lieutenant . Rick Van Ness , who had scouted the location , had a role as a Grateful Dead fan who gives the hero a ride . He also served as production manager . 
 Calista Carradine , David 's daughter , sang the theme song , " Around " , during the opening credits . The haunting tune , which was written by David Carradine , was reprised at the end of the movie , with Carradine himself singing . Several members of the Drury , Kansas community appear in the film as themselves . Carradine 's own dog , Buffalo , is credited in the film playing a stray dog . 
 = = Inspiration and production = = 
 In 1969 , David Carradine and Barbara Hershey met , and began a romantic relationship , on the set of Heaven with a Gun ( 1969 ) . The movie 's writer , Richard Carr , had occasion to tell the couple what he referred to as a " bedtime story " . Carradine remembered it as " the merry @-@ go @-@ round " story . A few years later , after Carradine had experienced financial success with Kung Fu , he decided he wanted to make the story into a movie . He contacted Carr , who secured the rights to the Henry Morton Robinson novel , and began writing the screenplay . He told Carradine that the book contained a much more complicated story than the one he had told him . Carradine responded , " I want to make the bedtime story . " 
 Carradine formed an acting company that he called " ' Kansas Flyer ' , a metaphor for a check that bounces . " He acquired a broken @-@ down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles , and some broken horses in Kansas City . He and his entourage then headed for Drury , Kansas . The original working title of the film was Around . While exploring film title designs for the picture , Carradine came across a style called Americana . " I was trying to figure out what it would look like if it said Around . Suddenly , I said to myself , ' Why am I doing this , anyway ? It 's right here in front of me . ' I called up the title designer and told him I was changing the title to Americana . " 
 Carradine provided most of the financing for the project , which cost under 1 million dollars . He stated that the purpose of his other acting jobs was to pay for his independent projects , over which he would have artistic control . Carradine said he even sold his Kung Fu residuals to raise money for his own projects , and consequently gone into debt . He also sought advice from directors he had worked with , including Martin Scorsese and Ingmar Bergman . " ' The wonderful thing about working with good directors , ' Carradine admitted , ' is it gives me the opportunity to pick their brains for my own films . ' " Using his spare time to edit the film , in 1981 , Carradine finally had a finished project to take to film festivals . 
 There were setbacks with distribution , however . United Artists , which had ownership of the movie , changed hands and the new owners had no interest in the movie . Carradine bought the movie back from <unk> , and set out to find a distributor . The picture was picked up by Crown International , which specialized in teen exploitation films . Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled , Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes . 
 Another problem arose when a representative from the Motion Picture Association of America set the pictures rating at " R " ( restricted ) , explaining that the sound of the fighting dog 's spine being broken was too loud . Carradine said that he would change it . A few weeks later he submitted it again and received the " PG " ( parental guidance suggested ) rating he wanted , without having changed a thing . 
 = = Reception and release = = 
 The Los Angeles Times film critic , Charles Champlin , explained that the Director 's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival " came into being as one of the consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968 . It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World , independent and frequently angry films on social themes . " He further explained that Carradine 's Americana was " an ideal selection for the fortnight . " In fact , the film won the People 's Choice Award there in 1981 . Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City , Utah . This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival . Carradine said of the audience 's reaction to the film , " Well , they laughed in all the right places , and they applauded at the end , so I guess it went alright . " He also said , " Americana swept the festival and I came very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers . " However , the Associated Press described Americana 's reception in Utah as " quiet " . 
 The moment of truth for the film came when it opened in New York City on October 21 , 1983 . Carradine had discussed Americana with film critic Kirk Honeycutt . Upon hearing of Carradine 's death in 2009 , Honeycutt recalled the discussion , remembering that he was " most impressed . " He explained , " I got an assignment from The New York Times to do a profile on Carradine the filmmaker " . Honeycutt 's profile was planned to coincide with the film 's opening at the Embassy 72d Street theater and the East Side Cinema , in New York City . Carradine commented that when he <unk> at the premiere to promote the film , he noticed that the poster and advertisement that he had made for the occasion had been replaced with " inferior ones " . He also said that the film received standing ovations at both venues . 
 However , negative reviews , like the one from New York Times film critic , Janet Maslin , killed the publication of Honeycutt 's piece . Maslin said of the final scene of the movie , " Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America , not to mention about dogs and merry @-@ go @-@ rounds , has been said better elsewhere . " Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey 's character " moronic " , and referred to the film as " twaddle . " Freeman said it was " fraught with symbolism . Or maybe it is just fraught " . He further said of the film , " Actually , it 's about David Carradine , of whom the less said the better " . The Kokomo Tribune called the story " pointless " . When Carradine read the reviews , he went back to the hotel bathroom and threw up . " ' It wasn 't just that the critics didn 't like the picture ; they were angry at me for making it , ' Carradine said . ' I 'll never figure that out . ' " 
 = Soviet cruiser Molotov = 
 Molotov ( Russian : <unk> ) was a Project 26bis Kirov @-@ class cruiser of the Soviet Navy that served during World War II and into the Cold War . She supported Soviet troops during the Siege of Sevastopol , the Kerch @-@ Feodosiya Operation and the amphibious landings at Novorossiysk at the end of January 1943 . 
 The ship was extensively modernized between 1952 and 1955 . She was renamed Slava ( Russian : <unk> , Glory ) in 1957 after Vyacheslav Molotov fell out of favour . Slava was reclassified as a training ship in 1961 before being sold for scrap in 1972 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Molotov and her sister Maxim Gorky had heavier armor and were slightly improved from the first two Kirov @-@ class cruisers of Project 26 , and were thus designated Project 26bis . 
 She was 187 meters ( 614 ft ) long at the waterline , 191 @.@ 4 meters ( 628 ft ) long overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 66 meters ( 57 ft 11 in ) and a draft between 5 @.@ 87 to 6 @.@ 3 meters ( 19 ft 3 in to 20 ft 8 in ) . She displaced 8 @,@ 177 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 048 long tons ) at standard load and 9 @,@ 728 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 574 long tons ) at full load . 
 Her steam turbines produced a total of 129 @,@ 750 shaft horsepower ( 96 @,@ 750 kW ) during her sea trials , reaching a maximum speed of 36 @.@ 72 knots ( 68 @.@ 01 km / h ; 42 @.@ 26 mph ) , just shy of her designed speed of 37 knots , mainly because she was overweight by 900 metric tons ( 890 long tons ) . Molotov normally carried 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ) of fuel oil , 1 @,@ 660 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 630 long tons ) at full load and 1 @,@ 750 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 720 long tons ) at overload . This gave her a range of 4 @,@ 220 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 820 km ; 4 @,@ 860 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Molotov carried nine 180 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) 57 @-@ calibre B @-@ 1 @-@ P guns in three electrically powered MK @-@ 3 @-@ 180 triple turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of nine single 100 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) 56 @-@ calibre B @-@ 34 anti @-@ aircraft guns fitted on each side of the rear funnel . Her light AA guns consisted of six semi @-@ automatic 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) 21 @-@ K AA guns and four DK 12 @.@ 7 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) machine guns . Six 533 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) 39 @-@ Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings .

 By 1943 three of Molotov 's 45 mm semi @-@ automatic guns were replaced with twelve fully automatic 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 70 @-@ K AA guns with one thousand rounds per gun and two extra DK machine guns . Her aircraft catapult was removed in 1942 to make room for more light AA guns . 
 In 1943 an improved ZK @-@ 1a catapult was fitted and successfully test @-@ launched a Supermarine Spitfire fighter . However , in 1947 the concept was abandoned and the catapult was removed .

 Molotov was laid down at the Marti South , Nikolayev on 14 January 1937 , launched on 4 December 1939 and was completed on 14 June 1941 . As the only ship in the Soviet Navy with radar Molotov remained in Sevastopol for the initial period of Operation Barbarossa to provide air warning . The advance of German troops into the Crimea in late October 1941 forced her to transfer to Tuapse where she continued to provide air warning . However , the ship did bombard German troops near Feodosiya with nearly 200 180 mm shells on 9 November before returning to Tuapse . Molotov helped to carry the 386th Rifle Division from Poti to Sevastopol between 24 and 28 December 1941 . While off @-@ loading troops on 29 December her stern was damaged by German artillery and she shelled Axis positions in retaliation , firing 205 180 mm and 107 100 mm shells . The ship evacuated 600 wounded upon her departure on 30 December . 
 Molotov reprised her role as a transport during the first week of January . Her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in Tuapse when she was thrown against the jetty on 21 – 22 January 1942 . The ship spent most of the next month under repair , although her bow could not be straightened ; the residual damage reduced her speed by several knots . She made a number of bombardment sorties in support of Soviet troops on the Kerch Peninsula until 20 March when she returned to Poti for more permanent repairs . On 12 June Molotov transported <unk> men of the 138th Rifle Brigade to Sevastopol , shelling German positions while unloading . She evacuated 1065 wounded and 350 women and children as she departed . On 14 – 15 June the ship returned , carrying <unk> reinforcements in company with other ships , bombarded German positions again , and evacuated <unk> wounded and refugees . On 2 August , while returning from another bombardment mission near Feodosiya , 20 metres ( 66 ft ) of her stern was blown off by Heinkel He 111 torpedo bombers of 6 . / KG 26 acting in concert with Italian MAS torpedo boats . The damage reduced her speed to 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and Molotov had to be steered by her engines . Molotov was under repair at Poti until 31 July 1943 and used the stern of the incomplete Chapayev @-@ class cruiser Frunze , the rudder of the incomplete cruiser <unk> , the steering gear from the cruiser Kaganovich and the steering sensor from the submarine L @-@ 25 . The loss of three destroyers to German air attack on 6 October 1943 resulted in Stalin 's order that forbade the deployment of large naval units without his express permission ; this meant the end of Molotov 's active participation in the war . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 Molotov was refitted in November 1945 to repair the last of her wartime damage . She suffered a fire in the shell handling room for Turret # 2 on 5 October 1946 that had to be extinguished by flooding the magazine and handling room at the cost of 22 dead and 20 wounded . The ship served as the test bed for the radars intended for the Chapayev and Sverdlov @-@ class cruisers during the late 1940s . Molotov 's postwar modernization began in 1952 and lasted until 28 January 1955 . 
 As part of this modernization Molotov received a radar suite composed of Gyuys for air search , Rif for surface search , Zalp for main @-@ armament gunnery and Yakor ' for anti @-@ aircraft gunnery . All of her light anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced by eleven twin gun water @-@ cooled 37 mm V @-@ 11 mounts and her 100 mm guns were reinstalled on fully powered B @-@ <unk> mountings . Her anti @-@ aircraft fire @-@ control system was replaced by a Zenit @-@ 26 with SPN @-@ 500 stabilized directors . In addition she lost her torpedo tubes , anti @-@ submarine weapons , boat cranes and all remaining aircraft equipment . This cost 200 million rubles , between half and three @-@ quarters the cost of a new Project <unk> Sverdlov @-@ class cruiser . 
 On 29 October 1955 the ship participated in rescue efforts after an explosion sank the ex @-@ Italian battleship Novorossiysk . Five of her own men were lost when the battleship capsized almost three hours after the explosion . She was renamed Slava on 3 August 1957 after Vyacheslav Molotov was purged from the government after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year . She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 3 August 1961 . Slava was deployed to the Mediterranean between 5 – 30 June 1967 to show Soviet support of Syria during the Six @-@ Day War . She returned to the Mediterranean between September – December 1970 where the ship assisted the Kotlin @-@ class destroyer <unk> after the latter 's collision with the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal on 9 November 1970 . Slava was sold for scrap on 4 April 1972 . 
 = Goalkeeper ( water polo ) = 
 In water polo , the goalkeeper occupies a position as the last line of defense between the opponent 's offence and their own team 's goal , which is 2 @.@ 8 m2 ( 30 sq ft ) . 
 The goalkeeper is different from other people on their team ; they possess certain privileges and are subject to different restrictions from those of field players . As well as this , they must possess different skills from those of the fielders . 
 Goalkeepers often have longer playing careers than field players because they swim far less . 
 In water polo , the goalkeeper is commonly known as the goalie or keeper and may also be known as the man / woman in the cage . 
 = = History = = 
 The position of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated . At that time , the object of the game was to touch the ball on the opponent 's end of the pool . The goalkeeper would wait at the end of the pool until an opposing player approached the goal , when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player , for example , by dunking their head . 
 A change occurred in the game and the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s , when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts , spaced about 10 feet apart , at each end of the pool . At the same time , the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal . This change in the rules was brief . To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping , the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water . 
 The basic functions of the goalie position have changed little over the last century , but there have been changes affecting the style of play . In the 1940s , Hungary introduced a new technique called the eggbeater kick that enables goalkeepers to maintain a stable balance in the water . 
 = = Rules = = 
 Inside the 5 m ( 16 ft ) area , the goalkeeper is the only person on the team permitted to touch the ball with two hands , touch the bottom of the pool and punch the ball with a clenched fist . Although the goalkeeper may not advance beyond the half @-@ way line , they may attempt shots at the other goal . 
 Any goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team . The goalkeeper can also be temporarily ejected from the game for twenty seconds if they prevent a likely goal ( for example , by splashing ) . If the goalkeeper pushes the ball under the water in the 5 m ( 16 ft ) area , instead of being a free throw to the other team , it is a penalty . A penalty is also awarded to the other team if the goalkeeper pulls down from the crossbar of the goal to prevent a goal . 
 Unless reserve , all goalkeepers caps are numbered 1 and contrast with their team 's colour to distinguish their position . Reserve goalkeepers have differently numbered caps depending on the governing body ; they are shown in the table below . 
 = = = Rule variations = = = 
 Below is a table showing the major differences of rules and regulations for water polo goalkeepers between the three largest governing bodies : FINA , NCAA and NFHS . 
 = = Responsibilities and techniques = = 
 In water polo , field players possess entirely different skills and responsibilities to the goalkeeper . 
 = = = Responsibilities = = = 
 The primary role of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal . After saving the ball , the goalkeeper has the responsibility to keep possession of the ball in order to stop opposing players regaining possession . They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal , their hands are near or above the surface of the water . They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball , often starting the team 's counterattack . 
 The goalkeeper is the only player who may block a penalty and because 63 @.@ 7 % of penalties are goals , the goalkeeper has a massive role in this area but failure to be in the correct position at a penalty is an exclusion foul . At a penalty shootout , the goalkeeper 's job is critical and will largely determine the outcome of the match . If the goalkeeper is excluded during the course of the penalty shootout , then one of the other five players in the pool may take their place . The goalkeeper 's hips should be high at a penalty shot to give them extra height . The goalkeeper should do one of two things at a penalty shot : 
 Stay in the middle of the goal , raise themself up high and spread arms wide to eliminate the possibility of shots towards the centre of the goal 
 Move to one side of the goal as a guess to where the shooter will place the ball . 
 Moreover , goalkeepers should have leadership . They should inform field players of information , such as unmarked players and the time of the game clock and give instructions to the field players . Because of this , they may sometimes be known as the coach in the water . 
 When a man down , goalkeepers have extra responsibility . It is easier for the other team to continue to shoot , making the goalkeeper very worn out . <unk> said that with a man down the goalkeeper had " The highest possible intensity " . 
 = = = Body part techniques = = = 
 Most of the time , goalkeepers do low @-@ intensity work ( treading water without too much effort ) but when they do work ( for example , when they have a man down or are in the ready position ) it is very intense . 
 Goalkeepers must be able to perform the eggbeater kick to a high standard . Before the eggbeater kick , goalkeepers would use breaststroke which meant that they could not stay up for very long and players found it easier to score . By using the eggbeater kick , goalkeepers can raise their bodies high enough in the water to be able to block shots at the goal for longer periods of time . This can be used conjunctively with sculling , in which the goalkeeper keeps their hands closed ( with the fingers together ) and moves them forwards and backwards . 
 The easiest way for the goalkeeper to block shots is for them to block the ball with either their hands or arms . Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball , thus being an advantage . Sports involving quick reactions may be helpful , as these help the goalkeeper 's reflexes which is a crucial skill . 
 = = = = Body part work = = = = 
 In order to improve , there are a variety of drills designed to improve the goalkeeper 's skill . 
 To start with , there are drills to help improve the goalkeeper in the water . These range from simple exercise ( such as jumping as high out of the water as possible with two hands ) to drills not specifically used in water polo ; rather they are used to improve the goalkeeper 's core muscles ( such as catching a ball dropped from the side into the water ) . 
 As the goalkeeper must be able to swim quickly for short distances , to improve they can practice exercises such as swimming quickly and then immediately stopping without touching the sides . It is important for the goalkeeper to swim both <unk> and freestyle - the <unk> helping with the eggbeater kick and the freestyle helping with the swimming in the match . 
 Moreover , at the start of the game it is vital for the goalkeeper to stretch for 15 minutes . 
 = = = Blocking techniques = = = 
 As blocking the ball is the primary role of the goalkeeper , they must have good knowledge of blocking techniques . 
 As the goalkeeper has the choice of how many hands they want to use , the decision should be made of what they want to do . A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper 's body , and normally stopped with one in other circumstances . This is because one @-@ handed saves can go to the ball faster . 
 Goalkeepers should be wary of <unk> , lob shots and skip or bounce shots . <unk> is where players fake shots , leading keepers to come out of the water too early . This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy . The lob shot is where a field player attempts to put the ball over where the goalkeeper 's hands can reach . This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal . The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it , as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot . The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water . It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go . 
 Most shots are saved with the arms or the hands , but goalkeepers are known to save shots with their faces and even feet .

 = Saved from the Titanic = 
 Saved from the Titanic is a 1912 American silent motion picture short starring Dorothy Gibson , an American film actress who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15 , 1912 . It is the first film about the tragedy , premiering in the United States just 29 days after the event . 
 Gibson had been one of around 28 people aboard the first lifeboat to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship . On returning to New York , she co @-@ wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself . The plot involves her recounting the story of the disaster to her fictional parents and fiancé , with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs , Titanic 's sister ship Olympic and the ship 's captain , Edward Smith . To add to the film 's authenticity , Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night of the disaster . The filming took place in a New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor . 
 The film was released internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews , though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy so soon after the event . It is now regarded as a lost film , as the last known prints were destroyed in a studio fire in March 1914 . A few printed stills are now all that is known to survive of it . It is also the last film that Dorothy Gibson ever made , as she suffered a mental breakdown after completing it . 
 = = Gibson 's voyage on the Titanic = = 
 The 22 @-@ year @-@ old Gibson was a passenger aboard Titanic 's maiden voyage , joining the ship at Cherbourg in France on the evening of April 10 . She had been on vacation in Europe with her mother when her employers , the Éclair Film Company , recalled her to New York to participate in a new production . On the evening of the sinking , she was playing bridge ( this would have been bridge whist , a predecessor to today 's game ) in a first @-@ class saloon before retiring to the cabin that she shared with her mother . The game was later credited with saving the lives of the players who had stayed up late to finish it , despite it being ( as one American writer put it ) " a violation of the strict Sabbath rules of English vessels . " The collision with the iceberg at 11 : 40 pm sounded to Gibson like a " long , drawn , sickening <unk> " . After going to investigate , she fetched her mother when she saw Titanic 's deck beginning to list as water flooded into the ship 's boiler rooms . 
 Two of the bridge players , Frederic Seward and William Sloper , accompanied Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats . The group boarded lifeboat no . 7 , the first to be launched . Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12 : 40 am , just over an hour after the collision . The lifeboat 's plug could not be found , causing water to gush in until , as Gibson later put it , " this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men . " Around 1 @,@ 500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank , throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia . As they struggled in the water , Gibson heard what she described as a " terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones . " The sinking deeply affected her ; according to Sloper , she became " quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us could hear her , " I 'll never ride in my little grey car again . " " The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6 : 15 am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York . 
 = = Production = = 
 Only a few days after she returned to New York , Gibson began work on a film based on the disaster . The impetus may have come from Jules Brulatour , an Éclair Film Company producer with whom she was having an affair . According to Billboard magazine he sent " specially chartered tugboats and an extra relay of cameramen " to film the arrival of Carpathia . The footage was spliced together with other scenes such as Titanic 's Captain Edward Smith on the bridge of the RMS Olympic , Titanic 's sister ship , images of the launch of Titanic in 1911 and stock footage of icebergs . On April 22 , the resulting newsreel was released as part of the studio 's Animated Weekly series . It was an enormous success with sold @-@ out showings across America . President William Howard Taft , whose friend and military aide Archibald Butt was among the victims of the disaster , received a personal copy of the film . 
 The success of the newsreel appears to have convinced Brulatour to capitalize further with a drama based on the sinking . He had a unique advantage – a leading actress who was a survivor and eyewitness to what had happened . Gibson later described her decision to participate as an " opportunity to pay tribute to those who gave their lives on that awful night . " Jeffrey Richards suggests that it was more likely that Brulatour persuaded her that the disaster offered an opportunity to advance her career . The filming took place at Éclair 's studio in Fort Lee , New Jersey and aboard a derelict transport vessel in New York Harbor . It was completed in only a week and the entire process of filming , processing and distribution took only half the time normally required for a one @-@ reel film – a sign of the producers ' eagerness to get the film onto screens while news of the disaster was still fresh . The film was only ten minutes long but this was typical of the time , as feature films had not yet become the norm . Instead , a program typically consisted of six to eight short films , each between ten and fifteen minutes long and covering a range of genres . Although newsreels were the main vehicle for presenting current events , dramas and comedies also picked up on such issues . There was very little footage of Titanic herself , which hindered the ability of newsreels to depict the sinking ; however , the disaster was an obvious subject for a drama . 
 Gibson was plainly still traumatized – a reporter from the Motion Picture News described her as having " the appearance of one whose nerves had been greatly shocked " – and she was said to have burst into tears during filming . To add to the film 's air of authenticity , she even wore the same clothes that she was rescued in . Nonetheless , as well as starring as " Miss Dorothy " – herself , in effect – Gibson is said to have co @-@ written the script , which was based around a fictionalized version of her own experiences . Her parents and ( fictional ) fiancé , Ensign Jack , are shown waiting anxiously for her return after hearing news of the disaster . She arrives safely back home and recounts the events of the disaster in a long flashback , illustrated with newsreel footage of Titanic and a mockup of the collision itself . Titanic sinks but Dorothy is saved . When she concludes her story , her mother urges Dorothy 's fiancé to leave the navy as it is too dangerous a career . Jack ultimately rejects the mother 's advice , deciding that he must do his duty to flag and country . Dorothy 's father is moved by his patriotism and the film ends with him blessing the marriage . 
 The film 's structure aimed to promote its story 's authenticity and credibility through the integration of newsreel footage and the presence of a genuine survivor as the " narrator " . Audiences had previously seen survivors of disasters only as <unk> " objects " shown as part of a story told by someone else . Gibson , by contrast , was a survivor given voice as the narrator of what was ostensibly her personal story . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Saved from the Titanic was released in the United States on May 14 , 1912 and was also released internationally , in the United Kingdom as A Survivor of the Titanic and in Germany as Was die Titanic sie <unk> ( " What the Titanic Taught Her " ) . It attracted a positive review in Motion Picture World of May 11 , 1912 , which described Gibson 's performance as " a unique piece of acting in the sensational new film @-@ play of the Éclair Company ... [ which is ] creating a great activity in the market , for the universal interest in the catastrophe has made a national demand . " The review went on : 
 Miss Gibson had hardly recovered from her terrible strain in the wreck , when she was called upon to take part in this new piece , which she constructed as well . It was a nerve @-@ racking task , but like actresses before the footlights , this beautiful young cinematic star valiantly conquered her own feelings and went through the work . A surprising and artistically perfect reel has resulted . 
 The Moving Picture News commended the film 's " wonderful mechanical and lighting effects , realistic scenes , perfect reproduction of the true history of the fateful trip , magnificently acted . A heart @-@ stirring tale of the sea 's greatest tragedy depicted by an eye @-@ witness . " However , some criticized the questionable tastefulness of portraying a disaster that had so recently occurred . " Spectator " in the New York Dramatic Mirror condemned the venture as " revolting " : 
 The bare idea of undertaking to reproduce in a studio , no matter how well equipped , or by re @-@ enacted sea scenes an event of the appalling character of the Titanic disaster , with its 1 @,@ 600 victims , is revolting , especially at this time when the horrors of the event are so fresh in mind . And that a young woman who came so lately , with her good mother , safely through the distressing scenes can now bring herself to commercialize her good fortune by the grace of God , is past understanding ...

 Saved from the Titanic is now considered a lost film , as the only known prints were destroyed in a fire at Éclair Studios in March 1914 . Its only surviving visual records are a few production stills , printed in the Moving Picture News and Motion Picture World , showing scenes of the family and a still of Dorothy standing in front of a map of the North Atlantic pointing to the location of the Titanic . Frank Thompson <unk> the film as one of a number of " important movies that disappeared " , noting that it was unique for having " an actual survivor of the Titanic playing herself in a film " while wearing " the very clothes . . . in which she abandoned ship " : 
 [ T ] hat all this was committed to film within days of the disaster is enough to make any Titanic enthusiast sigh with frustration . No matter what melodramatic <unk> found its way into the film – and the synopsis suggests that there was plenty – Saved from the Titanic is an irreplaceable piece of Titanic lore . 
 It was also Dorothy Gibson 's last film , as the effort of making it appears to have brought on an existential crisis for her . According to a report in the Harrisburg Leader , " she had practically lost her reason , by virtue of the terrible strain she had been under to graphically portray her part . "

 After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 and working in advertising for three years , Langan joined Granada Television 's drama serials department where she script edited daytime soap operas . From there , she transferred to Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she developed the acclaimed television series Cold Feet , and other one @-@ off comedies . In 2000 , she left Granada to become a freelance producer , and produced the romantic comedy series Rescue Me for the BBC . She returned to Granada in 2002 , where she produced the acclaimed dramas The Deal ( 2003 ) and Dirty Filthy Love ( 2004 ) .

 In 2006 , Langan became an executive producer at BBC Films , developing features such as The Other Boleyn Girl ( 2008 ) and The Duchess ( 2008 ) . In April 2009 , she was appointed Creative Director of BBC Films , giving her control of a £ 12 million annual budget and which projects are commissioned for development . By 2010 , Langan had led BBC Films to a record 13 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards , which included In the Loop ( 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( 2009 ) and An Education ( 2009 ) .

 Christine Langan was born in January 1965 in Edmonton , London , England . Her mother and father , a dinner lady and a bricklayer respectively , already had three children . Growing up , Langan became interested in television production after seeing Lew Grade 's name in the credits of several programmes . She attended a Catholic grammar school and read English at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . 
 After graduating from Cambridge University in 1987 , Langan spent three years working as a copywriter for an advertising company . She also contributed film reviews to BBC Radio 2 's Cinema 2 programme . In 1990 , Langan began her career in film production as an assistant developer for Tessa Ross at British Screen . The following year , she responded to an advertisement for a script editor at Granada Television 's drama serials department , located in Manchester . She was hired by David Liddiment , and worked mainly on Granada 's daytime soap operas .

 In 1993 , Langan returned to London to work for Andy Harries at Granada 's newly created comedy department , where she script @-@ edited September Song , the television adaptation of An Evening with Gary Lineker , and the second series of Rik Mayall Presents . In 1995 , she was associate producer on The Perfect Match , a one @-@ off comedy drama written by former BBC radio producer Mike Bullen . The Perfect Match was broadcast in September 1995 , and shortly afterwards , Harries asked Langan to develop more ideas from Bullen . 
 They devised Cold Feet , another one @-@ off comedy drama based on the love lives of Bullen himself and his friends . Langan produced Cold Feet , guiding Bullen through his script drafts , and hiring Father Ted director Declan Lowney to shoot it . Cold Feet was broadcast in March 1997 as one of four Comedy Premieres on ITV ( two others of which Langan script edited ) . It received poor ratings and little critical reaction . However , in May 1997 , it won the Rose d 'Or at the Montreux International Television Festival . ITV Network Centre commissioned a series of Cold Feet in August , which Langan also produced . For the series , Langan tried to achieve a written and visual style that differed from regular sitcoms by avoiding " one @-@ liners and quick laughs " and hiring directors who had done little television work before . Cold Feet premiered as a series in November 1998 , and Langan stayed until the third series in 2000 . She and Bullen received a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2000 . Also in 1998 , Langan worked on her first feature film , script editing the Parker Posey @-@ led The Misadventures of Margaret . 
 In 1999 , Langan was made an executive producer in the department . She oversaw several productions , including Passion Killers ( 1999 , starring Ben Miller ) , Safe as Houses ( 2000 , starring Ricky Tomlinson ) , and the pilot episode of David Nicholls ' I Saw You ( 2000 , starring Paul Rhys and Fay Ripley ) . In 2000 , Langan was offered a position at the BBC 's drama department , which had been rearranged that year . The trade magazine Broadcast reported the BBC had made a " substantial offer " to her . Granada 's director of programmes Grant Mansfield countered the BBC 's bid by offering Langan the position of deputy controller of drama , operating under Andy Harries , who had recently been appointed controller of the same department . Langan accepted neither offer , and instead became a freelance producer after her contract with Granada expired . 
 As a freelancer , Langan developed three more episodes of I Saw You for Granada . Her only other project was producing David Nicholls ' romantic comedy series Rescue Me with Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC One . As well as producing it , she made her credited directorial debut on the final episode . The six @-@ part series , starring Sally Phillips , was broadcast in 2002 . It was not a ratings success , and the BBC did not commission a second series . 
 = = = Granada drama = = = 
 In September 2002 , Langan signed a new contract to develop new projects at Granada 's combined drama , film and comedy department . Her first production was the romantic comedy television film Watermelon , starring Anna Friel . At the end of 2002 , she began developing Peter Morgan 's The Deal , a dramatisation of the political rise of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . Although initially giving full backing , the ITV network backed out during pre @-@ production . Channel 4 picked up the film from Granada , and it was broadcast in September 2003 . The Deal was presented with the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama in 2004 . The same year , she produced the one @-@ off drama Dirty Filthy Love , which was also nominated for the BAFTA for Best Single Drama . 
 In 2005 , Langan 's feature debut Pierrepoint was released at major film festivals . Based on the life of British hangman Albert Pierrepoint ( played by Timothy Spall ) , Pierrepoint got Langan a nomination for the Carl Foreman Award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007 . 2006 saw the theatrical release of The Queen , a feature film follow @-@ up to The Deal , that focused on the impact the death of Diana , Princess of Wales had on Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II . Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal , and Helen Mirren played Elizabeth . The film was produced by Granada in co @-@ operation with the ITV network , and was released in late 2006 to critical acclaim . In 2007 , it won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . Of Langan 's work on Pierrepoint and The Queen , a Variety writer said , " both pics are a tribute to her tactful skill at working with tricky but talented writers and directors to take stories that could easily have been confined to the small screen and give them real cinematic depth and breadth " . 
 = = = BBC Films = = = 
 In September 2006 , Langan made a low @-@ key departure from Granada to take up a position as an executive producer with BBC Films . Although approached to join BBC Films some years before , only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to " concentrate more exclusively on film " . She immediately began overseeing editing work on The Other Boleyn Girl , which was already in post @-@ production . She also began developing The Damned United , a film based on David Peace 's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United A.F.C. in 1974 . The film was adapted by Peter Morgan , executive produced by Andy Harries , and starred Michael Sheen as Clough . On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects , Langan said , " The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time , energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends — The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends " . 
 Following David M. Thompson 's announcement that he would be retiring from the post of head of BBC Films in September 2007 , Langan was widely expected to take over his duties . Confirmation was made the following month when she was appointed Commissioning Editor of the company , taking over the day @-@ to @-@ day duties of BBC Films and reporting to Jane Tranter , the Controller of Fiction at the BBC . When Tranter transferred to a BBC Worldwide position in Los Angeles in 2009 , the BBC decided not to fill the Controller of Fiction vacancy with a single person . Instead , the responsibilities were divided between four people ; Langan became Creative Director of BBC Films , responsible for " editorial strategy and commissioning " , and also joined the BBC Fiction board . 
 By 2010 , Langan was overseeing a £ 12 million annual budget at BBC Films , and had executive produced high @-@ profile films such as In the Loop ( Armando Iannucci , 2009 ) , Fish Tank ( Andrea Arnold , 2009 ) , and An Education ( Lone Scherfig , 2009 ) . BBC Films received 13 nomination at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards , described in the London Evening Standard as a record number . In 2010 , Langan also executive produced The Special Relationship — the final part of Peter Morgan 's " Blair trilogy " — and StreetDance , the first British feature film to be made in 3D . The Guardian recognised Langan 's achievements at BBC Films by ranking her at number 36 in its inaugural Film Power 100 list in September 2010 . 
 Through 2011 , Langan executive produced Ralph Fiennes ' directorial debut Coriolanus , the Marilyn Monroe biopic My Week with Marilyn , and Lynne Ramsay 's adaptation of Lionel Shriver 's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin . The project was in development hell since 2007 until Langan realised BBC Films was trying to get too big a budget to make it with . Ramsay rewrote the script in 2010 to allow a lower budget .

 Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London ( UCL ) . After they formed under the name <unk> , Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish . Will Champion joined as a drummer and backing vocalist , completing the performing line @-@ up . Creative Director Phil Harvey is often referred to as the official fifth member by the band . The band renamed themselves " Coldplay " in 1998 , before recording and releasing three EPs : Safety in 1998 , Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999 , and The Blue Room in the same year . The Blue Room was their first release on a major label , after signing to Parlophone . 
 They achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single " Yellow " in 2000 . This was followed by their debut album Parachutes released the same year , which was nominated for the Mercury Prize .

Their next release , X & Y , the best @-@ selling album worldwide in 2005 , was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release , though some critics felt that it was inferior to its predecessor . The band 's fourth studio album , Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends ( 2008 ) , was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely positive reviews , earning several Grammy Award nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards . On 24 October 2011 , they released their fifth studio album , Mylo Xyloto , which received mixed to positive reviews , topped the charts in over 34 countries , and was the UK 's best @-@ selling rock album of 2011 . On 16 May 2014 , they released their sixth album , titled Ghost Stories , which also received mixed to positive reviews and topped the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries .

 Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London ( UCL ) in September 1996 . The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band , ultimately forming a group called <unk> . Guy Berryman , a classmate of Martin and Buckland , later joined the group . By 1997 , the group , who had renamed themselves Starfish , performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs . Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey , who was studying classics at the University of Oxford , to be the band 's manager . Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group . The band 's line @-@ up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties . Champion had grown up playing piano , guitar , bass , and tin whistle ; he quickly learned the drums ( despite having no previous experience ) . The band finally settled on the name " Coldplay " which was suggested by Tim Crompton , a local student who had been using the name for his group . 
 By 1997 Martin had met then Classics student Tim Rice @-@ Oxley . During a weekend at Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano . Martin , finding Rice @-@ Oxley to be talented , asked him to be Coldplay 's keyboard player but Rice @-@ Oxley refused as his own band , Keane , was already active . Days after , this event would shape the second line @-@ up of Keane and keep Coldplay 's unaltered , thus leaving both bands as quartets . In 1998 , the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP . Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends ; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public . In December of that year , Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda . Their first release was the three @-@ track Brothers and Sisters EP , which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999 . 
 After completing their final examinations Coldplay signed a five @-@ album contract with Parlophone in early 1999 . After making their first appearance at Glastonbury the band went into the studio to record a third EP , titled The Blue Room . Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October and the single " Bigger Stronger " received BBC Radio 1 airplay . The recording sessions for The Blue Room were tumultuous . Champion was briefly fired from the band , but Martin later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out , and because of his guilt , went on a drinking binge . Eventually , the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact . Inspired by bands like U2 and R.E.M. , Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy . Additionally , the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs . 
 = = = Parachutes ( 1999 – 2001 ) = = = 
 The band initially planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks . However , tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April – May 2000 . The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios , Matrix Studios , and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson , although the majority of Parachutes ' tracks were recorded at Liverpool 's Parr Street Studios ( where they accessed three studio rooms ) . The mixing process on all songs for the album was done by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York . During that period , they played on the Carling Tour , which showcased up @-@ and @-@ coming acts . 
 After releasing three EPs without a hit song , Coldplay had their first Top 40 hit with the lead single from Parachutes , " Shiver " , which was released in March 2000 and peaked at number 35 position on the UK Singles Chart . June 2000 was a pivotal moment in Coldplay 's history : the band embarked on their first headlining tour , including a showing at the Glastonbury Festival . The band also released the breakthrough single " Yellow " . It was Coldplay 's first release to reach the top five , rising to number four on the UK Singles Chart . " Yellow " and " Shiver " were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000 . The former was later released as a single in United Kingdom on 26 June 2000 . In the United States , the song was released as the lead single from the then @-@ untitled debut album . In October 2000 , the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets . 
 Coldplay released their first studio album , Parachutes , on 10 July 2000 in the United Kingdom via their record label , Parlophone . The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart . It was released on 7 November 2000 by record label Nettwerk in North America . The album has been made available on various formats since its initial release ; both Parlophone and Nettwerk released it as a CD in 2000 , and it was also released as a cassette by US label Capitol in 2001 . In the following year , Parlophone issued the album as an LP . Four singles were released from Parachutes , including " Shiver " and " Yellow " , and enjoyed popularity in the UK and US . The third single was " Trouble " , which reached number 10 in the UK charts . It was released more than a year later in the US , and , although it did not make the Billboard Hot 100 , it reached number 28 in the Alternative Songs chart . In December 2001 , the band released a limited @-@ edition CD , Mince Spies , featuring a remix of " Yellow " and the Christmas song " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas " . It was pressed to 1 @,@ 000 copies , and was issued only to fans and journalists . 
 Parachutes was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in September 2000 . Having found success in Europe , the band set their sights on North America , by releasing the album there in November 2000 , and started the US Club Tour in February 2001 . At the 2001 Brit Awards in February , Coldplay earned awards for Best British Group , and Best British Album . Although Parachutes was a slow @-@ burning success in the United States , it eventually reached double @-@ platinum status . The album was critically well received and earned a Best Alternative Music Album honours at the 2002 Grammy Awards . Chris Martin claimed , after the release of Parachutes , that the album 's success was intended to elevate the band 's status to the " biggest , best band in the world . " After single @-@ handedly managing the band until early 2001 , Phil Harvey resigned from his role due to the stress of performing a role usually requiring a team of people . Harvey then took on the role of " creative director " and is often referred as the official fifth member by the band , while Dave Holmes took over as the band 's manager .

 After the success of Parachutes , Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head , once again with Ken Nelson producing . Since the band had never stayed in London before , they had trouble focusing . They decided to relocate in Liverpool , where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes . Once there , vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording . " In My Place " was the first song recorded for the album . The band released it as the album 's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album , following a " strange period of not really knowing what we were doing " three months after the success of Parachutes . According to Martin " one thing kept us going : recording ' In My Place ' . Then other songs started coming . " 
 The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album . Some of their new material , including " In My Place " and " Animals " , was played live while the band was still touring Parachutes . The album 's title was revealed through a post on the band 's official website . The album was released in August 2002 and spawned several popular singles , including " In My Place " , " Clocks " , and the ballad " The Scientist " . The latter was inspired by George Harrison 's All Things Must Pass , which was released in 1970 . 
 Coldplay toured from June 2002 to September 2003 for the A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour . They visited five continents , including co @-@ headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival , <unk> and Rock Werchter .

At the 2003 Brit Awards held at Earls Court , London , Coldplay received awards for Best British Group , and Best British Album . On 28 August 2003 , Coldplay performed " The Scientist " at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City , and won three awards .

At that time the band covered The Pretenders ' 1983 song " 2000 Miles " ( which was made available for download on their official website ) . " 2000 Miles " was the top selling UK download that year , with proceeds from the sales donated to Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns . A Rush of Blood to the Head won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards . At the 2004 Grammy Awards , Coldplay earned Record of the Year for " Clocks " .

 Coldplay spent most of 2004 out of the spotlight , taking a break from touring and releasing a satire music video of a song from a fictional band titled The <unk> while recording their third album . X & Y was released in June 2005 in UK and Europe . This new , delayed release date had put the album back into the next fiscal year , actually causing EMI 's stock to drop . It became the best @-@ selling album of 2005 with worldwide sales of 8 @.@ 3 million . The lead single , " Speed of Sound " , made its radio and online music store debut on 18 April and was released as a CD on 23 May 2005 . X & Y entered the album charts of 20 countries at the number one position and was the third @-@ fastest selling album in UK chart history . 
 Two other singles were released that year : " Fix You " in September and " Talk " in December . Critical reaction to X & Y was mostly positive , though slightly less enthusiastic than that of its predecessor . The New York Times critic Jon Pareles described Coldplay as " the most insufferable band of the decade " , whereas NME awarded the album 9 / 10 calling it " Confident , bold , ambitious , <unk> with singles and impossible to contain , ' X & Y ' doesn 't reinvent the wheel but it does reinforce Coldplay as the band of their time " . Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common . Chris Martin later revealed that the reviews that ranged from mixed to negative , note @-@ worthy for their remarks on comparing them to U2 , made him feel " liberated " . 
 From June 2005 to July 2006 , Coldplay went on their Twisted Logic Tour , which included festival dates like Coachella , Isle of Wight Festival , Glastonbury and the Austin City Limits Music Festival . In July 2005 , the band appeared at Live 8 in Hyde Park , where they played a rendition of The Verve 's " Bitter Sweet Symphony " with Richard Ashcroft on vocals .

 = = = Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends ( 2006 – 09 ) = = = 
 In October 2006 , Coldplay began work on their fourth studio album , Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends , with producer Brian Eno . Taking a break from recording , the band toured Latin America in early 2007 , performing in Chile , Argentina , Brazil , and Mexico . After recording in churches and other venues in Latin America and Spain during their tour , the band said the album would likely reflect Hispanic influence . The group spent the rest of the year recording with Eno . 
 Martin described Viva la Vida as a new direction for Coldplay : a change from their past three albums , which they have referred to as a " trilogy " . He said the album featured less falsetto as he allowed his voice 's lower register to take precedence . Some songs , such as " Violet Hill " , contain distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones . 
 " Violet Hill " was confirmed as the first single , with a radio release date of 29 April 2008 . After the first play , it was freely obtainable from Coldplay 's website from 12 : 15 pm ( GMT + 0 ) for one week ( achieving two million downloads ) , until it became commercially available to download on 6 May .

 Coldplay began their Viva la Vida Tour in June , with a free concert at Brixton Academy in London . This was followed two days later by a 45 @-@ minute performance that was broadcast live from outside BBC Television Centre . Released in late 2008 , " Lost !

After performing the opening set on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground , Coldplay headlined a sold @-@ out concert later that same night . Sound Relief is a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods . On 4 December 2008 , Joe Satriani filed a copyright infringement suit against Coldplay in the United States District Court for the Central District of California . Satriani 's suit asserted that the Coldplay song " Viva la Vida " includes " substantial original portions " of the Satriani song " If I Could Fly " from his 2004 album , Is There Love in Space ? . The Coldplay song in question received two Grammy Awards for " Song of the Year . " The band denied the allegation . An unspecified settlement was ultimately reached between the parties .

 Martin once proclaimed the band 's music as " limestone rock " in comparison to " hard rock " . The band 's music has been called " meditative " and " blue romantic " ; it " [ reflects ] on their emotions " and Martin " endlessly examine [ s ] his feelings " . 
 Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post @-@ Britpop bands . In the late 1990s , the EPs released by the band had characteristics of dream pop , setting them apart from later studio albums . The tone of the band 's first studio album , Parachutes , was described as melodic pop with " distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion " but also being " exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive " . Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like U2 , Oasis , Radiohead and Travis . The band acknowledges the Scottish alternative rock band , Travis , as a major influence on their earlier material . 
 In their second studio album A Rush of Blood to the Head , the band drew inspiration from artists like Echo & the Bunnymen , Kate Bush , George Harrison and Muse . The songs in it were considered to contain " lush melodies and a heartbreak " and that they had a " newfound confidence . " The music on their third release X & Y has been considered to be " ruminations on Martin 's doubts , fears , hopes , and loves . " It was particularly influenced by the artists Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk . 
 In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends , the group 's style was moving towards art rock , being influenced by the bands Blur , Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine . The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras , honky @-@ tonk pianos and further so . Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war @-@ induced Viva la Vida and expands the spectrum to include electronic and acoustic elements . Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose . 
 Regarding the band 's wide international success , Parlophone 's president Miles Leonard has stated that one of their " secrets " is that they have never sounded like a parochial UK artist , saying : " Some bands are very proud to be British , but sometimes come across as being very ‘ British ’ . Coldplay never aspire to that ; on one hand they sound British but on the other they sound like a huge global artist . " In 2011 Coldplay were hailed as ' rock statesmen ' . 
 = = Activism and commercial endorsements = = 
 Despite their worldwide popularity , the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media , refusing its use for product endorsements . In the past , Coldplay turned down multi @-@ million dollar contracts from Gatorade , Diet Coke , and Gap , who wanted to use the songs " Yellow " , " Trouble " , and " Don 't Panic " respectively . According to frontman , Chris Martin , " We wouldn 't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs ' meanings like that . " The song " Viva la Vida " was featured in a commercial for the iTunes Store , advertising its exclusive availability of the single as a digital download on iTunes . Additionally , Chris Martin appeared at an Apple Inc . Special Event on 1 September 2010 , playing a number of songs , and also thanked Apple for their assistance in marketing " Viva la Vida " .

He has been on trips with Oxfam to assess conditions , has appeared in its advertising campaign , and is known for wearing a " Make Trade Fair " wristband during public appearances ( including at Coldplay concerts ) . The band were also filmed for Make Poverty History , clicking their fingers . 
 During the early years , Coldplay became widely known in the media for giving 10 per cent of the band 's profits to charity , which they continue to do . Bassist Guy Berryman said , " You can make people aware of issues . It isn 't very much effort for us at all , but if it can help people , then we want to do it . " The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to charity , according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay 's website . Martin spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US , UK and other forces during the Teenage Cancer Trust show at London 's Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003 , where he encouraged the sell @-@ out crowd to " sing against war " . He would later endorse the US Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 respectively . 
 In June 2009 , Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday , a food campaign started by Paul McCartney which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week . From 17 and 31 December 2009 , Coldplay auctioned a quantity of significant band memorabilia , including their first guitars . Proceeds went to Kids Company , a charity which helps vulnerable children and young people in London . A month later in January 2010 , Coldplay performed a slightly modified version of " A Message " , entitled " A Message 2010 " , at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon special , raising money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake . 
 In 2011 Coldplay endorsed the song " Freedom for Palestine " by posting a link to the video . In less than a day 12 @,@ 000 comments were made on that post . Some threatened to boycott the band , and a Facebook group was created that demanded an apology to Israel . The link to the song was eventually removed from their Facebook wall . According to Frank Barat of <unk> , the link was not removed by Coldplay , but by Facebook after " thousands of people ( and computer generated posts ) reported it as abusive . " 
 Album Artists ( <unk> ) staged an exhibition of art from Mylo Xyloto at Proud Gallery in Camden to support the charity Kids Company in November — December 2012 . The exhibition raised over £ 610 @,@ 000 for the children 's charity which supports disadvantaged children in London . In November 2014 , Martin joined the charity group Band Aid 30 , performing alongside current British and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa — this was the second time Martin has contributed to a Band Aid recording having performed in the 2004 version ( Band Aid 20 ) .

 Sydney Cecil Newman , OC ( April 1 , 1917 – October 30 , 1997 ) was a Canadian film and television producer , who played a pioneering role in British television drama from the late 1950s to the late 1960s . After his return to Canada in 1970 , Newman was appointed Acting Director of the Broadcast Programs Branch for the Canadian Radio and Television Commission ( CRTC ) and then head of the National Film Board of Canada ( NFB ) . He also occupied senior positions at the Canadian Film Development Corporation and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , and acted as an advisor to the Secretary of State . 
 During his time in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s , he worked first with the Associated British Corporation ( ABC , now Thames Television ) , before moving across to the BBC in 1962 , holding the role of Head of Drama with both organisations . During this phase of his career , he was responsible for initiating two hugely popular television programmes , the spy @-@ fi series The Avengers and the science @-@ fiction series Doctor Who , as well as overseeing the production of groundbreaking social realist drama series such as Armchair Theatre and The Wednesday Play . 
 The Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Newman as " the most significant agent in the development of British television drama . " His obituary in The Guardian declared that " For ten brief but glorious years , Sydney Newman ... was the most important impresario in Britain ... His death marks not just the end of an era but the laying to rest of a whole philosophy of popular art . " 
 In Quebec , as commissioner of the NFB , he attracted controversy for his decision to suppress distribution of several politically sensitive films by French Canadian directors .

 = = = Early life and the NFB = = = 
 Born in Toronto , Newman was the son of a Russian @-@ Jewish immigrant father who ran a shoe shop . After studying at Ogden Public School , which he left at the age of thirteen , he later enrolled in the Central Technical School , studying art and design subjects . He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist , specialising in drawing film posters . However , he found it so difficult to earn enough money to make a living from this profession that instead , he switched to working in the film industry itself . In 1938 , he travelled to Hollywood , where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work . However , he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit . Returning to his native country , in 1941 , he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada . He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB . 
 During the Second World War the head of the NFB , John Grierson , promoted Newman to film producer , working on documentaries and propaganda films , including Fighting Norway , which he directed . In 1944 he was made executive producer of Canada Carries On , a long @-@ running series of such films . In 1949 Grierson again assisted Newman 's career , entering him into television , then a new industry , on a one @-@ year attachment to NBC in New York City . His assignment there was to compile reports for the Canadian government on American television techniques , focusing on dramas , documentaries and outside broadcasts . 
 = = = CBC Television = = = 
 One of Newman 's reports on outside broadcasting was seen and admired by executives at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) , and in 1952 he joined the Corporation as their Supervising Director of Features , Documentaries and Outside Broadcasts . There he was involved in producing not only some of the earliest television editions of Hockey Night in Canada , but also the first Canadian Football League game to be shown on television . After his experience of seeing the production of television plays in New York , he was eager to work in drama despite , by his own admission , " knowing nothing about drama . " He was nonetheless able to persuade his superiors at CBC to make him Supervisor of Drama Production in 1954 . In this position he encouraged a new wave of young writers and directors , including Ted Kotcheff and Arthur Hailey , and oversaw shows such as the popular General Motors Theatre . 
 Writing in 1990 , the journalist Paul Rutherford felt that during his time at the CBC in the 1950s , Newman had been a " great champion of both realistic and Canadian drama . " He felt that Newman " came to fulfil the role of the drama impresario with the vision to push people to develop a high @-@ quality and popular style of drama . " 
 Several of the General Motors Theatre plays , including Hailey 's Flight into Danger , were purchased for screening by the BBC in the United Kingdom . The productions impressed Howard Thomas , who was the managing director of Associated British Corporation ( ABC ) , the franchise holder for the rival ITV network in the English Midlands and the North at weekends . Thomas offered Newman a job with ABC as a producer of his own Saturday night thriller series , which Newman accepted , moving to Britain in 1958 . In 1975 the Head of Drama at the CBC , John Hirsch , noted that the tendency of so many writers and directors having followed Newman to the UK in the 1950s and never having returned to work in Canada had a detrimental impact on the standard of subsequent Canadian television drama . 
 = = Associated British Corporation = = 
 Soon after Newman arrived in the UK , ABC 's Head of Drama Dennis Vance was moved into a more senior position with the company , and Thomas offered Newman his position , which the Canadian quickly accepted . He was , however , somewhat disparaging of the state in which he found British television drama . " At that time , I found this country to be somewhat class @-@ ridden , " he reminisced to interviewers in 1988 . " The only legitimate theatre was of the ' anyone for tennis ' variety , which on the whole gave a condescending view of working @-@ class people . Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays and invariably about the upper classes . I said , ' Damn the upper classes : they don 't even own televisions ! ' " 
 Newman 's principal tool for shaking up this established order was a programme which had been initiated before he had arrived at ABC , Armchair Theatre . This anthology series was networked nationally across the ITV regions on Sunday evenings , and in 1959 was in the top ten of the ratings for 32 out of the 37 weeks it was broadcast , with audiences of over 12 million viewers . Newman used the strand to present plays by writers such as Alun Owen , Harold Pinter and Clive Exton , also bringing over associates from Canada such as Charles <unk> and Ted Kotcheff . Writing in 2000 , the television historian John <unk> stated that " Newman 's insistence that the series would use only original material written for television made Armchair Theatre a decisive moment in the history of British television drama . " 
 In 1960 Newman devised a thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon , starring Ian Hendry . Although Police Surgeon was not a success and was cancelled after only a short run , Newman took Hendry as the star , and some of the ethos of the programme , to create a new series ( not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed ) called The Avengers . Debuting in January 1961 , The Avengers became an international success , although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman 's initial set @-@ up , veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller . 
 Newman 's great success at ABC had been noted by the British Broadcasting Corporation , whose executives were keen to revive their own drama department 's fortunes in the face of fierce competition from ITV . In 1961 the BBC 's Director of Television , Kenneth Adam , met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC . He accepted the position , eager for a new challenge , although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962 , after which he immediately began work with the BBC . 
 = = BBC = = 
 = = = Arrival and impact = = = 
 There was some initial resentment to his appointment within the Corporation , as he was an outsider and he was also earning more than many of the executives senior to him , although still substantially less than he had been paid at ABC . As he had done at ABC , he was keen to shake up the staid image of BBC drama and introduce new outlets for the kitchen sink drama and the " Angry Young Men " of the era . He also divided the drama department into three separate divisions — series , serials and plays . 
 In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam initiated the new anthology series The Wednesday Play , a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre , which had great success and critical acclaim with plays written and directed by the likes of Dennis Potter , Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach . The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions , such as Cathy Come Home , a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script , which dealt with the issue of homelessness . There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme , who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact ; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production , but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse . 
 Shaun Sutton was one of the drama producers who worked under Newman at the BBC , and later succeeded the Canadian as Head of Drama . He later wrote that Newman " galvanised television drama ... [ He created ] a climate in which boldness paid . " In contrast , Don Taylor , who was a director in the drama department at the time , later claimed that he felt Newman was unsuited to the position of Head of Drama , writing : " To put it brutally , I was deeply offended that the premier position in television drama , at a time when it really was the National Theatre of the Air , had been given to a man whose values were entirely commercial , and who had no more than a layman 's knowledge of the English theatrical tradition , let alone the drama of Europe and the wider world . " 
 Newman 's biography at the Museum of Broadcast Communications website points out that much of the work Newman is credited for at the BBC was little different from that which had been undertaken by his predecessor Michael Barry , who " also attracted new young original writers ... and hired young directors ... However , it was the newness and innovation which Newman encouraged in his drama output that is most significant : his concentration on the potential of television as television , for a mass not a middlebrow audience . " The academic Madeleine <unk> @-@ Kavanagh has criticised some of the eulogistic views of Newman 's time at the BBC , writing that : " When archive and press material emanating from the 1964 – 65 period is examined , an interesting gap appears between what Newman seemed likely to accomplish and what he finally did accomplish ... Also relevant to the mythology that has sprung up around Newman is the fact that his favoured dramatic material was interpreted by some as being rather less radical than it seemed . " 
 = = = Doctor Who = = = 
 In 1963 he initiated the creation of the science fiction television series Doctor Who . The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having " created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme " , and by The Times newspaper as " quintessential to being British " . Newman had long been a science @-@ fiction fan : " [ U ] p to the age of 40 , I don 't think there was a science @-@ fiction book I hadn 't read . I love them because they 're a marvellous way — and a safe way , I might add — of saying nasty things about our own society . " 
 When Controller of BBC Television Donald <unk> alerted Newman of the need for a programme to bridge the gap between the sports showcase Grandstand and pop music programme Juke Box Jury on Saturday evenings , he decided that a science @-@ fiction drama would be the perfect vehicle for filling the gap and gaining a family audience . Although much work on the genesis of the series was done by Donald Wilson , C. E. Webber and others , it was Newman who created the idea of a time machine larger on the inside than the out and the character of the mysterious " Doctor " , both of which remain at the heart of the programme . He is also believed to have come up with the title Doctor Who , although actor and director Hugh David later credited this to his friend Rex Tucker , the initial " caretaker producer " of the programme . 
 After the series had been conceived , Newman initially approached Don Taylor and then Shaun Sutton to produce it , although both declined . He then decided on his former production assistant at ABC , Verity Lambert , who had never produced , written or directed , but she readily accepted his offer . As Lambert became the youngest — and only female — drama producer at the BBC , there were some doubts as to Newman 's choice , but she became a success in the role . Even Newman clashed with her on occasion , however , particularly over the inclusion of the alien Dalek creatures on the programme . Newman had not wanted any " bug @-@ eyed monsters " in the show , but he was placated when the creatures became a great success . Later in the show 's run , in 1966 he took a more hands @-@ on role again in the changeover between the First and Second Doctors . 
 In the 2007 Doctor Who episode " Human Nature " , the Doctor ( in human form as " John Smith " ) refers to his parents Sydney and Verity , a tribute to both Newman and Lambert . Verity Newman , a character in the 2010 episode The End of Time , is also named after them . A similar acknowledgement had appeared in the show 's original run : in " The Powerful Enemy " , the first episode of the 1965 story The Rescue , in order to hide the fact that one character is actually another character in disguise , the role is credited to the non @-@ existent actor " Sydney Wilson " , an amalgam of the names of Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson . 
 = = = Other work and departure = = = 
 Newman also had success with more traditional BBC fare such as the costume drama The Forsyte Saga in 1967 , a Donald Wilson project on which Newman had not initially been keen . However , it became one of the most acclaimed and popular productions of his era , watched by 100 million people in 26 countries . After also initiating other popular series such as Adam Adamant Lives ! , at the end of 1967 Newman 's five @-@ year contract with the BBC came to an end , and he did not remain with the Corporation . Instead , he returned to the film industry , taking a job as a producer with Associated British Picture Corporation . " I want to get away from my executive 's chair and become a creative worker again , " he told The Sun newspaper of his decision . 
 However , the British film industry was entering a period of decline , and none of Newman 's projects ever went into production . ABPC was taken over by EMI , and at the end of June 1969 , Newman was dismissed from the company , later describing his eighteen months there as " a futile waste . " Despite being offered an executive <unk> by the BBC , keen to regain his services on the very day he left ABPC , Newman decided to return to Canada . He left the UK on January 3 , 1970 , leading The Sunday Times to comment that " British television will never be the same again . " 
 = = Return to Canada = = 
 = = = Chairman of the NFB = = = 
 His first post upon returning to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission ( CRTC ) in Ottawa , where he battled Canada 's private broadcasters , especially CTV , over new Canadian content regulations . This lasted for only a few months , before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner , the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada , returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s . In this role , he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from the fact that he did not speak French , at a time when the NFB 's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers . Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long , while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture . 
 Newman was able to improve the NFB 's relations with broadcaster CBC , securing prime time television slots for several productions , although he was criticised by some filmmakers for allowing the CBC to screen NFB films with commercial interruptions . He also moved the NFB entirely over to color film production . However , the Toronto Star 's Martin Knelman felt that Newman was " mired in political warfare and administrative chaos " . He was responsible for censoring or banning several productions , including Arcand 's On est au coton and Gilles Groulx 's 24 heures ou plus . These films were concerned , respectively , with the conditions of textile factory workers and critiquing consumer society . Such censorship or banning resulted in some critics attacking Newman for being anti working @-@ class and pro @-@ capitalist . 
 Newman had a mixed record with French @-@ language films . He defended Pierre Perrault 's Un pays sans bon <unk> ! to a committee of parliament in 1971 , but the same year personally rejected the release of Michel Brault 's film about the October Crisis , Les <unk> . This was despite the fact that the film had already been approved by the board 's French @-@ language committee , and it was not eventually released until Brault personally released it in 1974 . 
 Newman himself had been regarded as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis , and armed guards had patrolled the headquarters of the NFB . Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes , such as Groulx 's 24 heures ou plus , at such a tense political time , worried about what the Canadian public would think . Although it was Newman 's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman 's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions , it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner . 
 When Newman 's contract with the NFB came to an end in 1975 , it was not renewed . Film historian Gerald <unk> claims that by this point , the NFB was " an almost @-@ forgotten institution " due to " the stupor that had overtaken it . " The writer Richard Collins felt that " the very experiences that enabled [ Newman ] to recognize the nature of the NFB 's problem and the need for a change of diction and reorientation to the tastes of Canadians had left him out of touch with Canada . " For his part , Newman felt that the NFB 's French program had not made enough effort to communicate with people in English Canada or to make films that were relevant to " the ordinary men , who have no particular axe to grind . " 
 Newman went on to become a Special Advisor on Film to the Secretary of State , and from 1978 until 1984 he was Chief Creative Consultant to the Canadian Film Development Corporation . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Newman was awarded the Order of Canada in 1981 , the country 's highest civilian honour . Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae , to whom he had been married since 1944 . His main reason for going back to the UK was to attempt , unsuccessfully , to produce a drama series about the Bloomsbury Group for the new Channel 4 network . 
 In 1986 , the then Controller of BBC One , Michael Grade , unhappy with the current state of Doctor Who , wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had any ideas for reformatting the series , which was at the time struggling in the ratings . Newman wrote back to Grade on October 6 that year with a set of detailed proposals and a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer . Grade suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama , Jonathan Powell , for lunch to discuss the Canadian 's ideas . Newman and Powell did not get on well , however , and nothing came of their meeting . He was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator . Acting Head of Series & Serials Ken <unk> , to whom Newman 's request had been referred , wrote to him that " Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so . " 
 Newman returned to Canada again in the 1990s , where he died of a heart attack in Toronto in 1997 . He was survived by his three daughters , and by his new partner Marion McDougall . 
 = = Portrayal in fiction = = 
 In September 2003 , a version of Newman played by actor Ian Brooker appeared in the straight @-@ to @-@ CD radio play Deadline , written by Rob Shearman and released by Big Finish Productions . The play was set in a world in which Doctor Who had never been created , existing only in the imagination and memories of fictional writer Martin Bannister , played by Derek Jacobi . As part of the plot of the play , Bannister was unable to clearly remember whether Newman had been Canadian or Australian , with the Newman character 's accent changing according to Bannister 's varying memories . 
 For the fiftieth anniversary of Doctor Who in 2013 , BBC television commissioned a dramatisation of the events surrounding the creation of the series , entitled An Adventure in Space and Time and written by Mark Gatiss . Newman was portrayed by Brian Cox .

 Mass Effect 2 is an action role @-@ playing game in which the player controls Commander Shepard . Shepard 's gender , appearance , history and combat @-@ training are determined by the player before the game begins . The game features a variety of quests that the player must complete in order to progress . These quests usually involve the player interacting with characters and fighting enemies in combat missions . During the missions , Shepard is assisted by two AI squad members that the player can indirectly control through orders . Combat takes place in real @-@ time , but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use . Upon completing a quest , the player is awarded with experience points . If a sufficient amount of experience is obtained , the player can develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad . 
 Mass Effect 2 : Overlord unfolds in a less linear manner than other assignments found in the game due to its focus on exploration . The pack introduces five new missions and some of them can be completed in a different order . The missions are located on a planet that the player must explore using a hovering vehicle called Hammerhead . Aboard the Hammerhead , the player may transition from one mission to another and gather items such as mineral resources used to research numerous in @-@ game upgrades . The Hammerhead has the ability to jump over obstacles to reach certain areas and is also armed with a gun that the player can use to destroy hostile targets over the planet . At certain points in the game , the player may also encounter mini @-@ bosses that must be defeated . Overlord also adds one armor upgrade and two achievements that are awarded for completing specific tasks . The first achievement is obtained by collecting numerous data packets that are scattered across the planet , while the second achievement is unlocked by completing Overlord .

 In Mass Effect 2 : Overlord , elite human soldier Commander Shepard is sent on a mission to investigate an allied research base that has gone silent . The base is located on the surface of an Earth @-@ like planet called <unk> . Upon arriving at the facility , Shepard is informed that an experimental virtual intelligence has gone rogue and is ordered to destroy an antenna inside a transmission dish before the virtual intelligence uploads a program off @-@ planet . Shepard successfully destroys the antenna and is then met by Dr. Gavin Archer , the scientist that is responsible for the situation . Archer explains that they were trying to gain influence over a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called geth by interfacing a human mind with a virtual intelligence . In the process , the virtual intelligence overpowered the test subject 's mind , Archer 's brother David , and has evolved into a virus . 
 Although the virtual intelligence is kept in lockdown in another research station , Archers tells Shepard that he / she needs to manually override security from two other facilities to gain access to it and shut it down . Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked , Shepards proceeds to the main server room . Shepards eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world , but in the process the virus infects Shepard 's cybernetic implants . Shepard awakens in a virtual reality and heads to the central core room , where they manage to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy . Afterwards , the virtual reality goes away and David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth , begging for help . Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going . Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother .

 Mass Effect 2 : Overlord was developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts . During development of Mass Effect 2 , Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company 's overall philosophy . The pack was announced to be in development on May 13 , 2010 . BioWare executive producer Casey Hudson stated that Overlord was the " biggest downloadable content pack yet " and confirmed that they would not introduce more squad members to the game like they did with previous packs . For the pack , the developers wanted to focus on exploration and vehicle platforming , similar to that found in Mass Effect 2 's earlier downloadable content pack Firewalker . Since vehicle exploration was a feature of the original Mass Effect , Hudson called Overlord " a throwback to how some of the exploration worked in [ the previous game ] . " The pack was released on June 15 , 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 . Like Mass Effect 2 's other downloadable content packs Kasumi - Stolen Memory and Lair of the Shadow Broker , Overlord is freely included in the PlayStation 3 version of the game , which was released on January 18 , 2011 . The soundtrack was composed by Christopher Lennertz .

 Mass Effect 2 : Overlord received positive reviews from critics . Reviewer Erik Brudvig of IGN described Overlord as " one of the best series of missions that the franchise has yet seen . " Similarly , reviewer Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer opined that the pack " never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long , leavening the expected duck @-@ and @-@ cover combat with <unk> exploration and a dash of environmental puzzling , all wrapped up in a story that builds to a satisfying and pathos @-@ heavy finale . " GameSpot 's Kevin VanOrd credited the on @-@ foot action , stating that " a few of the larger environments let you take on [ enemies ] from multiple angles , which are a nice change from the straight @-@ on encounters that typify most of Mass Effect 2 's battles . " He also praised the final boss battle , which was said to exceed that of the main game . 
 Critics generally praised the vehicular sections of the mission . Eurogamer felt that the Hammerhead " responds well to the terrain , with just the right mix of weight and bounciness . " IGN considered it an improvement over the Mako carrier featured in the original Mass Effect . Brad Gallaway of GameCritics , who gave the main game a mixed review , was satisfied with its inclusion and felt that BioWare " managed to incorporate all of the various aspects of Mass Effect together in a way [ he ] felt was largely lacking in the core adventure and the previous add @-@ ons . " Game Revolution 's Eduardo Reboucas stated similar pros , but admitted that jumping on platforms with the Hammerhead goes against the nature of the game . Likewise , VanOrd felt that the Hammerhead goes underutilized due to its exclusive use in the content . Some reviewers also criticized the simplistic vehicular combat , comparing it unfavorably with that of the original Mass Effect . 
 VanOrd gave high marks to the pack 's frightening atmosphere , stating that " haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension , and the dark interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet 's surface . " The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game . Critics also highlighted very positively the story . Eurogamer opined that the ending was effective and unexpected , while VanOrd remarked that the ending cutscene " features some uncomfortable images that will linger in your mind even after you 've returned to the [ main game ] . " Despite evaluating the pack 's short length , VanOrd concluded that Overlord " is one downloadable delight Mass Effect 2 fans shouldn 't miss . " 
 = George Lansbury = 
 George Lansbury , PC ( 22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940 ) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935 . Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929 – 31 , he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests , his main causes being the promotion of social justice , women 's rights and world disarmament . Originally a radical Liberal , Lansbury converted to socialism in the early 1890s , and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices . His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which , except for a short period of doubt , sustained him through his life . Elected to parliament in 1910 , he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women 's suffrage , and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action . 
 In 1912 Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper , and became its editor . Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance , and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution . These positions contributed to Lansbury 's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918 . He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar , and went to prison with 30 fellow @-@ councillors for his part in the Poplar " rates revolt " of 1921 . 
 After his return to parliament in 1922 , Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924 , although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929 – 31 . After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 Lansbury did not follow his leader , Ramsay MacDonald , into the National Government , but stayed with the Labour Party . As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election , Lansbury became the party 's leader . His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party , and when his position was rejected at the 1935 party conference he resigned the leadership . He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament .

 George Lansbury was born in <unk> in the county of Suffolk on 22 February 1859 . He was the third of nine children born to a railway worker , also named George Lansbury , and Anne , née Ferris . George senior 's job involved the supervision of railway construction gangs ; the family was often on the move , and living conditions were primitive . Through his progressive @-@ minded mother and grandmother , young George became familiar with the names of great contemporary reformers — Gladstone , Richard Cobden and John Bright — and began to read the radical Reynolds 's Newspaper . By the end of 1868 the family had moved into London 's East End , the district in which Lansbury would live and work for almost all his life . 
 The essayist Ronald Blythe has described the East End of the 1860s and 1870s as " stridently English ... The smoke @-@ blackened streets were packed with illiterate multitudes [ who ] stayed alive through sheer birdlike ebullience " . Interspersed with spells of work , Lansbury attended schools in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel . He then held a succession of manual jobs , including work as a coaling contractor in partnership with his elder brother , James , loading and unloading coal wagons . This was heavy and dangerous work , and led to at least one near @-@ fatal accident . During his adolescence and early manhood Lansbury was a regular attender at the public gallery at the House of Commons , where he heard and remembered many of Gladstone 's speeches on the main foreign policy issue of the day , the " Eastern Question " . He was present at the riots which erupted outside Gladstone 's house on 24 February 1878 after a peace meeting in Hyde Park . Shepherd writes that Gladstone 's Liberalism , proclaiming liberty , freedom and community interests was " a heady mix that left an indelible mark " on the youthful Lansbury . 
 George Lansbury senior died in 1875 . That year young George met 14 @-@ year @-@ old Elizabeth Brine , whose father Isaac Brine owned a local sawmill . The couple eventually married in 1880 , at Whitechapel parish church , where the vicar , J. Franklin Kitto , had been Lansbury 's spiritual guide and counsellor . Apart from a period of doubt in the 1890s when he temporarily rejected the Church , Lansbury remained a staunch Anglican until his death . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 In 1881 the first of Lansbury 's 12 children , Bessie , was born ; another daughter , Annie , followed in 1882 . Seeking to improve his family 's prospects , Lansbury decided that their best hopes of prosperity lay in emigrating to Australia . The London agent @-@ general for Queensland depicted a land of boundless opportunities , with work for all ; seduced by this appeal , Lansbury and Bessie raised the necessary passage money , and in May 1884 set sail with their children for Brisbane . 
 On the outward passage the family experienced illness , discomfort and danger ; on one occasion the ship came close to foundering during a monsoon . On arrival at Brisbane in July 1884 , Lansbury found that contrary to the London agent 's promises , there was a <unk> of labour and work was hard to find . His first job , breaking stone , proved to be too physically punishing ; he moved to a better @-@ paid position as a van driver , but was sacked when , for religious reasons , he refused to work on Sundays . He then contracted to work on a farm some 80 miles inland , to find on arrival that his employer had misled him about living conditions and terms of employment . For several months the family lived in extreme squalor before Lansbury secured release from the contract . Back in Brisbane , he worked for a while at the newly built Brisbane cricket ground . As a keen follower of the game he hoped to see the visiting English touring team play but , as Lansbury 's biographer Raymond Postgate records , " he learned that cricket watching was not a pleasure for workmen " . 
 Throughout his time in Australia Lansbury sent letters home , revealing the truth about conditions facing immigrants . To a friend he wrote in March 1885 : " Mechanics are not wanted . Farm labourers are not wanted ... Hundreds of men and women are not able to get work ... The streets are foul day and night , and if I had a sister I would shoot her dead rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth " . In May 1885 , having received from Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home , the <unk> left Australia for good .

 On his return to London , Lansbury took a job in Brine 's timber business . In his spare time he campaigned against the false <unk> offered by colonial emigration agents . His speech at an emigration conference at King 's College in London in April 1886 impressed delegates ; shortly afterwards , the government established an Emigration Information Bureau under the Colonial Office . This body was required to provide accurate information on the state of labour markets in all the government 's overseas possessions . 
 Having joined the Liberal Party shortly after his return from Australia , Lansbury became first a ward secretary and then general secretary for the Bow and Bromley Liberal and Radical Association . His effective campaigning skills had been noted by leading Liberals , including Samuel Montagu , the Liberal MP for Whitechapel , who persuaded the young activist to be his agent in the 1885 general election . Lansbury 's handling of this election campaign prompted Montagu to urge him to stand for parliament himself . Lansbury declined this , partly on practical grounds ( MPs were then unpaid and he had to provide for his family ) , and partly on principle ; he was becoming increasingly convinced that his future lay not as a radical Liberal but as a socialist . He continued to serve the Liberals , as an agent and local secretary , while expressing his socialism in a short @-@ lived monthly radical journal , Coming Times , which he founded and co @-@ edited with a fellow @-@ dissident , William Hoffman . 
 = = = London County Council elections , 1889 = = = 
 In 1888 Lansbury agreed to act as election agent for Jane Cobden , who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council ( LCC ) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division . Cobden , an early supporter of women 's suffrage , was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden . The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors ( <unk> ) , a new women 's rights group , had proposed Cobden as the candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst for Brixton . Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate : housing for the poor , ending of sweated labour , rights of public assembly , and control of the police . Specific questions of women 's rights were largely avoided during the campaign . On 19 January 1889 both women were elected ; these triumphs were , however , short @-@ lived . Sandhurst 's qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex , and her subsequent appeal was dismissed . Cobden was not immediately challenged , but in April 1891 , after a series of legal actions , she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties . Lansbury urged her , during the hearings , to " go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant " . Cobden did not follow this path . A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among MPs of any party ; women were not granted this right until 1907 . 
 Lansbury was offended by his party 's lukewarm support for women 's rights . In a letter published in the Pall Mall Gazette he made an open call to Bow and Bromley 's Liberals to " shake themselves free of party feeling and throw the energy and ability they are now wasting on minor questions into ... securing the full rights of citizenship to every woman in the land " . He was further disillusioned by his party 's failure to endorse the eight @-@ hour maximum working day . Lansbury had formed the view , expressed some years later , that " Liberalism would progress just as far as the great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress " . By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury 's political home ; most of his current associates were avowed socialists : William Morris , Eleanor Marx , John Burns and Henry Mayers Hyndman , founder of the Social Democratic Federation ( SDF ) . Nevertheless , Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election agent for John Murray MacDonald , the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley . He saw his candidate victorious in the July 1892 General Election ; as soon as the result was declared , Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF . 
 = = Socialist reformer = = 
 = = = Social Democratic Federation = = = 
 Lansbury 's choice of the SDF , from several socialist organisations , reflected his admiration for Hyndman , whom he considered " one of the truly great ones " . Lansbury quickly became the federation 's most tireless propagandist , travelling throughout Britain to address meetings or to demonstrate solidarity with workers involved in industrial disputes . Around this time , Lansbury temporarily set aside his Christian beliefs and became a member of the East London Ethical Society . One factor in his disillusion with the Church was the local clergy 's unsympathetic approach to poor relief , and their opposition to collective political action . 
 In 1895 Lansbury fought two parliamentary elections for the SDF in Walworth , first a by @-@ election on 14 May , then the 1895 general election two months later . Despite his energetic campaigning he was heavily defeated on each occasion , with tiny proportions of the vote . After these dismal results , Lansbury was persuaded by Hyndman to give up his job at the sawmill and become the SDF 's full @-@ time salaried national organiser . He preached a straightforward revolutionary doctrine : " The time has arrived " , he informed an audience at Todmorden in Lancashire , " for the working classes to seize political power and use it to overthrow the competitive system and establish in its place state cooperation " . Lansbury 's time as SDF national organiser did not last long ; in 1896 , when Isaac Brine died suddenly , Lansbury thought that his family duty required him to take charge of the sawmill , and he returned home to Bow . 
 In the general election of 1900 a pact with the Liberals in the Bow and Bromley constituency gave Lansbury , the SDF candidate , a straight fight against the Conservative incumbent , William Guthrie . Lansbury 's cause was hindered by his public opposition to the Boer War at a time when war fever was strong , while Guthrie , a former soldier , stressed his military credentials . Lansbury lost the election , though his total of 2 @,@ 258 votes against Guthrie 's 4 @,@ 403 was considered creditable by the press . This campaign was Lansbury 's last major effort on behalf of the SDF . He became disenchanted by Hyndman 's inability to work with other socialist groups , and in about 1903 resigned from the SDF to join the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) . At around this time , Lansbury rediscovered his Christian faith and rejoined the Anglican Church . 
 = = = Poor Law guardian = = = 
 In April 1893 Lansbury achieved his first elective office when he became a Poor Law guardian for the district of Poplar . In place of the traditionally harsh workhouse regime that was the norm , Lansbury proposed a programme of reform , whereby the workhouse became " an agency of help instead of a place of despair " , and the stigma of poverty was removed . Lansbury was one of a minority socialist bloc which was often able , through its energy and commitment , to win support for its plans . 
 Education for the poor was one of Lansbury 's major concerns . He helped to transform the Forest Gate District School , previously a punitive establishment run on quasi @-@ military lines , into a proper place of education that became the Poplar Training School , and was still in existence more than half a century later . At the 1897 annual Poor Law Conference Lansbury summarised his views on poor relief in his first published paper : " The Principles of the English Poor Law " . His analysis offered a Marxist critique of capitalism : only the reorganisation of industry on collectivist lines would solve contemporary problems . 
 Lansbury added to his public duties when , in 1903 , he was elected to Poplar Borough Council . In the summer of that year he met Joseph Fels , a rich American soap manufacturer with a penchant for social projects . Lansbury persuaded Fels , in 1904 , to purchase a 100 @-@ acre farm at <unk> , in Essex , which was converted into a labour colony that provided regular work for Poplar 's unemployed and destitute . Fels also agreed to finance a much larger colony at <unk> Bay in Suffolk , to be operated as a government scheme under the Local Government Board . Both projects were initially successful , but were undermined after the election of a Liberal government in 1906 . The new Local Government minister was John Burns , a former SDF stalwart now ensconced in the Liberal Party who had become a firm opponent of socialism . Burns encouraged a campaign of propaganda to discredit the principle of labour colonies , which were presented as money @-@ wasting ventures that pampered idlers and scroungers . A formal enquiry revealed irregularities in the operation of the scheme , though it exonerated Lansbury . He retained the confidence of his electorate and was easily re @-@ elected to the Board of Guardians in 1907 . 
 In 1905 Lansbury was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Poor Laws , which deliberated for four years . Lansbury , together with Beatrice Webb of the Fabian Society , argued for the complete abolition of the Poor Laws and their replacement by a system that incorporated old age pensions , a minimum wage , and national and local public works projects . These proposals were embodied at the Commission 's conclusion in a minority report signed by Lansbury and Webb ; the majority report was , according to Postgate , " an ill @-@ considered jumble of suggestions ... so preposterously inadequate that no attempts were ever made to implement it . " Most of the minority 's recommendations in time became national policy ; the Poor Laws were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1929 . 
 = = National prominence = = 
 = = = Campaigner for women 's suffrage = = = 
 In the general election of January 1906 Lansbury stood as an independent socialist candidate in Middlesbrough , on a strong " votes for women " platform . This was his first campaign based on women 's rights since the LCC election of 1889 . He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels , who agreed to meet his expenses . The local ILP leadership was committed by an electoral pact to support the Liberal candidate , and could not endorse Lansbury , who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote . The campaign had been managed by Marion Coates Hansen , a prominent local suffragist . Under Hansen 's influence Lansbury took up the cause of " votes for women " ; he allied himself with the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , the more militant of the main suffragist organisations , and became a close associate of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family . 
 The Liberal government elected in 1906 with a large majority showed little interest in the issue of women 's suffrage ; when they lost their parliamentary majority in the general election of January 1910 they were dependent on the votes of the 40 @-@ odd Labour members . To Lansbury 's dismay , Labour did not use this leverage to promote votes for women , instead giving the government virtually unqualified support to keep the Conservatives out of power . Lansbury had failed to win election as Labour 's candidate at Bow and Bromley in January 1910 ; however , the continuing political crisis which developed from David Lloyd George 's controversial 1909 " People 's Budget " led to another general election in December 1910 . Lansbury again fought Bow and Bromley , and this time was successful . 
 Lansbury found little support in his fight for women 's suffrage from his parliamentary Labour colleagues , whom he dismissed as " a weak , flabby lot " . In parliament , he denounced the prime minister , H. H. Asquith , for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists : " You are beneath contempt ... you ought to be driven from public life " . He was temporarily suspended from the House for " disorderly conduct " . In October 1912 , aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues , Lansbury resigned his seat to fight a by @-@ election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women 's suffrage . He lost to his Conservative opponent , who campaigned on the slogan " No Petticoat Government " . Commenting on the result , the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women . 
 Out of parliament , on 26 April 1913 Lansbury addressed a WSPU rally at the Albert Hall , and openly defended violent methods : " Let them burn and destroy property and do anything they will , and for every leader that is taken away , let a dozen step forward in their place " . For this , Lansbury was charged with incitement , convicted and , after the dismissal of an appeal , sentenced to three months ' imprisonment . He immediately went on hunger strike , and was released after four days ; although liable to rearrest under the so @-@ called " Cat and Mouse Act " , he was thereafter left at liberty . In the autumn of 1913 , at the invitation of Fels , Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday . On his return , he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper , the Daily Herald . 
 = = = War , Daily Herald and Bolshevism = = = 
 The Daily Herald began as a temporary bulletin during the London printers ' strike of 1910 – 11 . After the strike ended , Lansbury and others raised sufficient funds for the Herald to be relaunched in April 1912 as a socialist daily newspaper . The paper attracted contributions from distinguished writers such as H. G. Wells , Hilaire Belloc , G. K. Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw , some of whom , Blythe notes , " weren 't socialists at all but simply used [ the paper ] as a platform for their personal literary anarchy . " Lansbury contributed regularly in support of his various causes , in particular the militant suffrage campaign , and early in 1914 assumed the paper 's editorship . 
 Before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , the Herald took a strong anti @-@ war line . Addressing a large demonstration in Trafalgar Square on 2 August 1914 , Lansbury blamed the coming conflict on capitalism : " The workers of all countries have no quarrel . They are ... exploited in times of peace and sent out to be massacred in times of war " . Lansbury 's position was at odds with that of most of the Labour movement , which allied itself with the wartime coalition governments of Asquith and , from 1916 , Lloyd George . In the prevailing jingoistic mood , numerous readers looked to the Herald — reduced by wartime economies to a weekly format — to present a balanced news perspective , untainted by war fever and chauvinism . During the winter of 1914 – 15 , Lansbury visited the Western Front trenches . He sent eye @-@ witness accounts to the paper , which supported calls for a negotiated peace with Germany in line with President Woodrow Wilson 's later " peace note " of January 1917 . The paper also gave sympathetic coverage to conscientious objectors , and to Irish and Indian nationalists . 
 Lansbury used the pages of the Daily Herald to welcome the February 1917 revolution in Russia as " a new star of hope ... arisen over Europe " . At an Albert Hall rally on 18 March 1918 he hailed the spirit and enthusiasm of " this Russian movement " , and urged his audience to " be ready to die , if necessary , for our faith " . When the war ended in November 1918 , Lloyd George called an immediate general election , correctly calculating that victory euphoria would keep his coalition in power . In this <unk> climate , candidates such as Lansbury who had opposed the war found themselves unpopular , and he failed to retake his Bow and Bromley seat . 
 The Herald re @-@ emerged as a daily paper in March 1919 . Under Lansbury 's direction it maintained a strong and ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War . In February 1920 Lansbury travelled to Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders . He published an account : What I Saw in Russia , but the impact of the visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources , a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury : " We have received no Bolshevist money , no Bolshevist paper , no Bolshevist bonds " . Unknown to Lansbury , the allegations had some truth which , when exposed , caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment . By 1922 the Herald 's financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations . Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress ( TUC ) , although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925 .

 Throughout his national campaigns , Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and Poor Law guardian , and between 1910 and 1913 served a three @-@ year term as a London County Councillor . In 1919 he became the first Labour mayor of Poplar . Under the then @-@ existing financial system for local government , boroughs were individually responsible for poor relief within their boundaries . This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar , where rates revenues were low and poverty and unemployment , always severe , were exacerbated in times of economic recession . Under this system , Postgate argues , " The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility , as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council " . In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations , the council was required to levy precepts to pay for services provided by bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police . Lansbury had long argued that a degree of rates equalisation across London was necessary , to share costs more fairly . 
 At its meeting on 22 March 1921 the Poplar Council resolved not to make its precepts and to apply these revenues to the costs of local poor relief . This illegal action created a sensation , and led to legal proceedings against the council . On 29 July the thirty councillors involved marched in procession from Bow to the High Court , headed by a brass band . Informed by the judge that they must apply the precepts , the councillors would not budge ; early in September , Lansbury and 29 fellow @-@ councillors were imprisoned for contempt of court . Among those sentenced were his son Edgar and Edgar 's wife , Minnie . 
 The defiance of the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy , and the publicity embarrassed the government . Several other Labour @-@ controlled councils ( including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader Clement Attlee ) threatened similar policies . After six weeks ' incarceration the councillors were released , and a government conference was convened to resolve the matter . This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury : the passage of the Local Authorities ( Financial Provisions ) Act , which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs . As a result , the rates in Poplar fell by a third , and additional revenues of £ 400 @,@ 000 was gained by the borough . Lansbury was hailed as a hero ; in the 1922 general election he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7 @,@ 000 , and would hold it for the rest of his life . The term " <unk> " , always identified closely with Lansbury , became part of the political lexicon , applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society .

 In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister , Andrew Bonar Law , resigned for health reasons . In December his successor , Stanley Baldwin , called another election in which the Conservatives lost their majority , with Labour in a strong second place . King George V advised Baldwin , as leader of the largest party , not to resign his office until defeated by a vote in the House of Commons . Defeat duly occurred on 21 January 1924 , when the Liberals decided to throw in their lot with Labour . The king then asked Labour 's leader , Ramsay MacDonald , to form a government . Lansbury caused royal offence by publicly implying that the king had colluded with other parties to keep Labour out , and by his references to the fate of Charles I. Despite his seniority , Lansbury was offered only a junior non @-@ cabinet post in the new government , which he declined . He believed that his exclusion from the cabinet followed pressure from the king . At the 1923 Labour Party conference , while declaring himself a republican , Lansbury opposed two motions calling for the abolition of the monarchy , deeming the issue a " distraction " . Social revolution , he said , would one day remove the monarchy . 
 MacDonald 's administration lasted less than a year before , in November 1924 , the Liberals withdrew their support ; Blythe comments that the first Labour government had been " neither exhilarating nor competent " . According to Shepherd , MacDonald 's chief priority was to show that Labour was " fit to govern " , and he had thus acted with conservative caution . The December general election returned the Conservatives to power ; Lansbury maintained that Labour 's cause " marches forward irrespective of electoral results " . After the defeat Lansbury was briefly touted as an alternative party leader to MacDonald , a proposition he rejected . In 1925 , free from the Daily Herald , he founded and edited Lansbury 's Labour Weekly , which became a mouthpiece for his personal creed of socialism , democracy and pacifism until it merged with the New Leader in 1927 . Before the General Strike of May 1926 , Lansbury used the Weekly to instruct the Trades Union Congress ( TUC ) on preparations for the coming struggle . However , when the strike came the TUC did not want his assistance ; among the reasons for their distrust was Lansbury 's continuing advocacy for the right of communist organisations to affiliate to the Labour Party — he privately opined that British communists on their own " couldn 't run a whelk @-@ stall " . 
 Lansbury continued his private campaigns in parliament , saying " I intend on every occasion to ... hinder the progress of business " . In April 1926 he and 12 other opposition MPs prevented a vote in the House of Commons by obstructing the voting lobbies ; they were temporarily suspended by the Speaker . During frequent clashes in the House with Neville Chamberlain , the Minister of Health responsible for Poor Law administration and reform , Lansbury referred to the " Ministry of Death " , and called the minister a " <unk> Napoleon " . However , within the Labour Party itself , Lansbury 's status and popularity led to his election as the party 's chairman ( a largely titular office ) in 1927 – 28 . Lansbury also became president of the International League Against Imperialism , where among his fellow executive members were Jawaharlal Nehru , Mme. Sun Yat @-@ sen and Albert Einstein . In 1928 , short of money following the failure of the family business , Lansbury published his autobiography , My Life , for which he received what he termed " a fairly generous cheque " from the publishers , Constable & Co . 
 = = = Cabinet minister , 1929 – 31 = = = 
 In the 1929 general election Labour emerged as the largest party , with 287 seats — but without an overall majority . Once again , MacDonald formed a government dependent on Liberal support . Lansbury joined the new cabinet as First Commissioner of Works , with responsibilities for historic buildings and monuments and for the royal parks . This position was widely regarded as a sinecure ; nevertheless , Lansbury proved an active minister who did much to improve public recreation facilities . His most notable achievement was the Lido on the Serpentine and the Long Water in Hyde Park , according to the historian A. J. P. Taylor " the only thing which keeps the memory of the second Labour government alive " . Lansbury 's duties brought him into frequent contact with the King , who as Ranger of the royal parks insisted on regular consultation . Contrary to expectations the two formed a cordial relationship . 
 The years of the MacDonald 's second government were dominated by the economic depression that followed the Wall Street Crash of October 1929 . Lansbury was appointed to a committee , chaired by J.H. Thomas and including the youthful Oswald Mosley , charged with finding a solution to unemployment . Mosley produced a memorandum which called for a large @-@ scale programme of public works ; this was rejected by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Snowden , on grounds of cost . At the end of July 1931 the May Committee , appointed in February to investigate government spending , prescribed heavy cuts , including a massive reduction in unemployment benefit . 
 During August , in an atmosphere of financial panic and a run on the pound , the government debated the report . MacDonald and Snowden were prepared to implement it , but Lansbury and nine other cabinet ministers rejected the cut in unemployment benefit . Thus divided , the government could not continue ; MacDonald , however , did not resign as prime minister . After discussions with the opposition leaders and the king he formed a national all @-@ party coalition , with a " doctor 's mandate " to tackle the economic crisis . The great majority of Labour MPs , including Lansbury , were opposed to this action ; MacDonald and the few who followed him were expelled from the party , and Arthur Henderson became leader . MacDonald 's move was broadly welcomed in the country , however , and in the general election held in October 1931 the national government was returned with an enormous majority . Labour was reduced to 46 members ; Lansbury was the only senior member of the Labour leadership to retain his seat .
