 <unk> Khana was built by Shah Jahan in 1633 in the north of the <unk> Bagh . It was the residence of the royal ladies of the court . The plinth and door frames are made of marble with a curvilinear roof . In the northwest of <unk> Khana , lies a watch tower called Kala Burj . It was used as a summer pavilion . The topmost storey was built and used as bar during the British era . Its eave is interlocked with brick work . 
 <unk> Khana was constructed under the supervision of <unk> Khan during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir . It was used as the entrance gate to the fort by the clerks . Besides , the fort also houses separate bath for royal men and women .

 In 1980 , Government of Pakistan nominated the fort for inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage Site based on the criteria i , ii , and iii together with the Shalimar . In the fifth meeting session held in Sydney in October 1981 , the World Heritage Site committee added both the monuments to the list . However , in 2000 , Pakistan sent a letter to the organization to include both the sites in List of World Heritage in Danger and sought help to restore the damaged part of the outer walls and hydraulic works of Shalamar Gardens . After years of extensive renovation and restoration work , they were removed from the list in June 2012 . 
 = Kepler @-@ 14b = 
 Kepler @-@ 14b is an extrasolar planet in orbit around the primary star of the binary Kepler @-@ 14 system . It is currently the only planet known to exist in this star system . Kepler @-@ 14b is 8 @.@ 4 times the mass of Jupiter and has a radius 1 @.@ 14 times that of Jupiter , and it orbits its host star every 6 @.@ 79 days . It was discovered by NASA @-@ led Kepler mission , which noted the planet as a planetary candidate as early as March 2009 , around the same time as the discovery of the first five planets discovered by Kepler ( Kepler @-@ 4b to Kepler @-@ 8b ) . However , the team was unable to confirm the planet until extensive follow @-@ up observations , as high @-@ resolution imaging resolved the star Kepler @-@ 14 as a closely orbiting binary system . The Kepler team would have not noticed that Kepler @-@ 14 was a binary star based solely on initial radial velocity measurements ( a standard method for confirming a planet 's existence ) , and found that if they had not realized this , their data on Kepler @-@ 14b would have been very inaccurate . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 NASA 's Kepler spacecraft , which was launched in March 2009 , collected photometric data continuously over a four @-@ month period in a small area of sky , using a <unk> Schmidt telescope . When the data collected during this period was analyzed , 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150 @,@ 000 stars ; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars , in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star . Because the data collected on the transits of KOI @-@ 98 ( later known as Kepler @-@ 14b ) seemed very clearly to indicate a planet , Kepler identified KOI @-@ 98 early on in its mission . Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow @-@ up Program for a follow @-@ up investigation . 
 The Fibre @-@ fed Échelle Spectrograph ( FIES ) on the Canary Islands ' Nordic Optical Telescope was operated in October 2009 , using Doppler spectroscopy to gather information that would accompany the gathered photometric observations . The High Resolution Échelle Spectrometer ( HIRES ) at the W.M. Keck Observatory was also utilized . Use of the WIYN Observatory for speckle imaging found that the host star of KOI @-@ 98 was actually a close @-@ knit binary star , which complicated the analysis . A November 2009 operation of the ARIES instrument on the MMT Observatory and the July 2010 use of the <unk> near @-@ infrared camera on the Palomar Observatory 's 200 inch Hale telescope used adaptive optics to confirm WIYN 's findings . Although suspected as a planet early on , KOI @-@ 98 was not included when Kepler @-@ 4b , Kepler @-@ 5b , Kepler @-@ 6b , Kepler @-@ 7b , and Kepler @-@ 8b were published , as further investigation was still required . 
 Scientists investigated the possibility that the transit signal detected by Kepler was actually due to a third star in the system that eclipsed its sister stars . However a bisector analysis of the spectra of KOI @-@ 98 's star ruled out that hypothesis . 
 On August 7 , 2010 , the Infrared Array Camera aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope was used to find the centroid , the point in space around which both of the Kepler @-@ 14 stars orbit . Analysis of the collected data determined which component of the binary star system was the site of the transit signal , and , additionally , that the transit signal came from the primary star in the system ( as opposed to the fainter , less prominent star ) . 
 Using the spectral data collected by HIRES and FIES , the Kepler team derived the characteristics of the host star . The HIRES and FIES results agreed on every aspect of the star that had been derived except for the star 's radial velocity . With the stellar parameters known , the Kepler team interpreted the Spitzer data to confirm that Kepler @-@ 14b was indeed a planet . 
 = = Host star system = = 
 Kepler @-@ 14 is a binary star system , which means that it is actually composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space . The system is composed of a primary star , Kepler @-@ 14A , and a dimmer companion star , Kepler @-@ 14B . When the stars were observed , while searching for the planet Kepler @-@ 14b , the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star . The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid . The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs ( 3 @,@ 196 light years ) from Earth . 
 Kepler @-@ 14b 's host star is the primary ( A ) component of the Kepler @-@ 14 binary system . However , because the binary system is so closely knit , it was impossible at the time of Kepler @-@ 14b 's discovery to distinguish the characteristics of each individual star . If the Kepler @-@ 14 system was an individual star , it would be an F @-@ type star . With an apparent magnitude of 12 @.@ 12 , the star system is not visible from Earth with the naked eye . Kepler @-@ 14 's combined results resemble that of a star that is 1 @.@ 512 solar masses and 2 @.@ 048 solar radii . Its <unk> age , or its age as determined by the rate at which a star spins , is estimated at 2 @.@ 2 billion years , far younger than the Sun . It is also hotter , with an effective temperature of <unk> K. With a metallicity of 0 @.@ 12 , Kepler @-@ 14 has 132 % more iron than the amount measured in the Sun . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 14b is the sole planet discovered in the Kepler @-@ 14 system to date . The planet orbits the primary star in the Kepler @-@ 14 binary system . Kepler @-@ 14b is estimated to have 8 @.@ 40 Jupiter masses and 1 @.@ 136 Jupiter radii . In other words , the planet is 8 @.@ 4 times more massive than Jupiter , but only 1 @.@ 136 times Jupiter 's size . This equates to a high density , which is measured at 7 @.@ 1 g cm − 3 . According to the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia , which calculated Kepler @-@ 14b 's eccentricity independently , Kepler @-@ 14b has a slightly irregular orbit , with an orbital eccentricity of 0 @.@ 035 . Kepler @-@ 14b takes approximately 6 @.@ 79 days to orbit its host star . The mean distance from its host star is about 8 @.@ 213 times the measured radius of Kepler @-@ 14 . 
 The authors of Kepler @-@ 14b 's discovery paper noted that , had they not discovered that Kepler @-@ 14 was indeed a binary system , the parameters for Kepler @-@ 14b would have been extremely inaccurate . They noted that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements might not have accounted for the possibility that their host stars were binary systems ; the only way that this was definitely known in the case of Kepler @-@ 14 was through the use of high @-@ resolution imaging . If the less prominent portion of the Kepler @-@ 14 binary system had not been detected , Kepler @-@ 14b 's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60 % , and its radius too small by about 10 % . 
 = Dundee United F.C. = 
 Dundee United Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in the city of Dundee . Formed in 1909 , originally as Dundee Hibernian , the club changed to the present name in 1923 . United are nicknamed The Terrors or The Tangerines and the supporters are known as Arabs . 
 The club has played in tangerine kits since the 1960s and have played at the present ground , Tannadice Park , since their foundation in 1909 . United were founder members of the Scottish Premier League ( SPL ) in 1998 and were ever @-@ present in the competition until it was abolished in 2013 to make way for the new Scottish Premiership which is the top division of the current SPFL structure . 
 Domestically , the club has won the Scottish Premier Division on one occasion ( 1982 – 83 ) , the Scottish Cup twice ( 1994 and 2010 ) and the Scottish League Cup twice ( 1979 and 1980 ) . United appeared in European competition for the first time in the 1966 – 67 season , going on to appear in Europe in 14 successive seasons from 1976 . They also reached the European Cup semi @-@ finals in 1984 and the UEFA Cup final in 1987 . The club has a 100 % record in four matches against Barcelona in competitive European ties .

 The club was formed as Dundee Hibernian in 1909 , playing from the outset at Tannadice Park . They were voted into the Scottish Football League in 1910 . After being saved from going out of business in October 1923 , the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal . Between 1925 and 1932 United were promoted and then relegated three times , winning the Second Division title in 1925 and 1929 . The club achieved little other success until Jerry Kerr became manager in 1959 . Kerr 's team won promotion in his first season in charge and became established in the top flight , where they remained until 1995 . Kerr strengthened the playing squad with Scandinavian imports and United qualified for European competition in 1966 , going on to eliminate Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup holders Barcelona on their European debut . 
 = = = Jim McLean era ( 1971 – 1993 ) = = = 
 Jim McLean took over from Kerr in 1971 and his youth policy led to the most successful era in the club 's history . United won the Scottish League Cup in 1979 and 1980 and then the Premier Division title in 1982 – 83 . 
 The club were also successful in Europe , reaching the European Cup semi @-@ finals in 1984 and the 1987 UEFA Cup Final . , the latter featuring another elimination of Barcelona . Despite losing to IFK Gothenburg in the final , the club won a FIFA Fair Play Award . McLean retired as manager in 1993 , but remained as club chairman . 
 = = = Since 1993 = = = 
 United won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1994 under McLean 's successor Ivan <unk> , but were relegated in 1995 , returning a year later . Eddie Thompson purchased the club from Jim McLean in 2002 and invested heavily in the team , but with little progress made until Craig Levein became manager in 2006 and successfully restructured the youth system . Shortly after Levein 's departure , the club won the Scottish Cup for a second time in 2010 under the management of Peter Houston . In 2013 , Jackie McNamara took charge of the club , and despite steering the Arabs to two reasonably successful season , his third season in charge saw his sides form drastically dip . He was succeeded by Mixu Paatelainen in October . Despite the managerial change , Paatelainen couldn 't make a significant improvement to the team 's form , and on 2 May 2016 , United were relegated to the Scottish Championship after a 2 @-@ 1 defeat away to local rivals Dundee , facing their first relegation from the top flight since 1995 . 
 = = Colours and badge = = 
 For a complete pictorial history of playing kit , see the Historical Football Kits site . 
 United 's playing kit consists of tangerine shirts and black shorts , first used when the team played under the Dallas Tornado moniker in the United Soccer Association competition of 1967 , which they were invited to participate in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world . After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr , the colour would soon be adopted as the club 's own in 1969 to give the club a brighter , more modern image . The new colour was paraded for the first time in a pre @-@ season friendly against Everton in August . 
 When originally founded as Dundee Hibernian , they had followed the example of other clubs of similar heritage by adopting the traditionally Irish colours of green shirts and white shorts . By the time the club became Dundee United in 1923 , the colours had been changed to white shirts and black shorts as they sought to appeal to a wider cross @-@ section of the community . These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969 , sometimes using plain shirts , but also at various times including Celtic @-@ style broad hoops , Queen 's Park @-@ style narrow hoops and an Airdrie @-@ style " V " motif . 
 The present club badge was introduced in 1993 , and saw the previous lion rampant design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours . To mark the club 's centenary in 2009 , a special version of the badge with an added " 1909 2009 Centenary " logo has been introduced for the duration of the 2009 – 10 season , along with additional green trim on the badge , representing Dundee Hibernian 's colours . 
 Previously , the lion had been represented on a simpler shield design . Although this " classic " version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956 , it had never appeared on the players ' strip prior to 1983 . Since 1959 , various other designs had been worn on the shirts , incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters <unk> , often on a circular badge . 
 The club first introduced shirt sponsorship in the 1985 – 86 season when future chairman Eddie Thompson 's VG chain sponsored the club in the first of a two @-@ year deal . A six @-@ year association with Belhaven then ensued with a <unk> 1993 – 94 season . Rover began a two @-@ year deal early in time for the 1994 Scottish Cup final , sponsoring the club until the end of the 1995 – 96 season . Telewest took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson 's Morning , Noon and Night started sponsoring the club in 2002 . This association continued until 2006 when Anglian Home Improvements began a two @-@ year deal with an optional third year . At the same time , Ole International became the first shorts sponsors . JD Sports ' <unk> Sportswear brand sponsored the club in the 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 seasons . United 's shirt sponsor since the 2010 – 11 season has been Calor Gas . 
 United have had a number of official kit suppliers , including Adidas , Hummel and , from June 2009 , Nike .

 Dundee United 's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park , located on Tannadice Street in the <unk> area of the city . It is situated a mere 170 yards ( 160 m ) away from Dens Park , home of rivals Dundee ; The club has only ever played one home fixture at another venue . This was a League Cup tie against Rangers in March 1947 , when despite snow rendering Tannadice Park unplayable , the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens Park . 
 Tannadice is currently an all @-@ seater with a capacity of 14 @,@ 223 . The Main Stand , built in 1962 , was the first cantilever to be constructed at a Scottish football ground . For long periods of its history , only a small proportion of the ground contained seated accommodation . In the late 1980s the ground had 2 @,@ 252 seats out of a total capacity of 22 @,@ 310 . 
 The comparative age and proximity of their stadiums has led to various discussions about the possibility of both Dundee clubs moving to a new , purpose @-@ built shared stadium . The most recent proposal was put forward as part of Scotland 's bid to jointly host the UEFA Euro 2008 championship , with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium . With planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park , special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal , as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing . Following Scotland 's failed bid to host the tournament , the scheme was shelved , although it was resurrected in June 2008 , following doubts about joint @-@ host Ukraine 's ability to stage Euro 2012 , and the SFA 's keenness to act as an alternative host .

 Dundee United 's first trophy came in 1925 , when they won the 1924 – 25 Division Two championship . After two seasons in the top tier , they were relegated , but they won the Division Two title for a second time in 1928 – 29 . Immediate relegation followed and the club finished runners @-@ up in 1931 – 32 . Another runners @-@ up spot was claimed in 1959 – 60 , in manager Jerry Kerr 's first season , and from then club remained in the top division for the next 35 @-@ years . Under Jim McLean 's management , the club won the Premier Division title for the only time , in 1982 – 83 , resulting in European Cup football the following season . The title win was United 's last league success , although they finished runners @-@ up in the First Division in 1995 – 96 , after nearly avoiding relegation the previous season , and in third place in their first season back in the Premier Division . 
 = = = Cups = = = 
 The club had to wait several decades before their first realistic chance at cup silverware , when they began the first of a six @-@ game losing streak of Scottish Cup Final appearances in 1974 , losing 3 – 0 to Celtic . Towards the end of the 1970s , things began to change , with three successive appearances in the League Cup Final . United won their first major trophy with a 3 – 0 replay victory over Aberdeen in the 1979 – 80 Scottish League Cup Final . The club reached both cup finals in the following season ; while they retained the League Cup by winning 3 – 0 against rivals Dundee , United lost out again in the Scottish Cup with a replay defeat to Rangers . United reached a third consecutive League Cup Final in 1981 – 82 , but failed to make it a hat @-@ trick of wins as they lost 2 – 1 to Rangers . 
 United suffered the agony of reaching three out of four Scottish Cup finals in the mid @-@ 1980s , only to lose them all by a single goal . First came a 2 – 1 defeat to Celtic in 1984 – 85 , compounded by a 1 – 0 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season ; then a 1 – 0 defeat in extra time to St Mirren in 1986 – 87 ; and finally , a last @-@ minute 2 – 1 loss against Celtic the following year , despite being a goal ahead . A three @-@ year gap ensued before the 1990 – 91 Scottish Cup final , which pitted Jim McLean against his brother Tommy , at Motherwell . The final was won 4 – 3 by ' Well , with United again losing in extra time . The sixth Cup Final loss was also the club 's fifth final appearance in eleven years . 
 These defeats in cup finals at Hampden Park led to the Scottish football media claiming that United suffered from a Hampden hoodoo , as they had failed to win ten cup finals played at the ground between 1974 and 1991 . When the club reached the 1994 Scottish Cup Final , manager Ivan <unk> dismissed talk of the hoodoo , even though opponents Rangers were strong favourites to complete a domestic treble in the 1993 – 94 season . United broke the supposed hoodoo and won the Scottish Cup for the first time when Craig Brewster 's goal gave them a 1 – 0 win . 
 Eleven years passed until the next Scottish Cup final appearance , when United lost 1 – 0 to Celtic in 2005 . Sandwiched in the middle of these appearances was a defeat on penalties to Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Challenge Cup ( when United failed to concede a goal in the whole competition ) and a 3 – 0 defeat to Celtic in the 1997 Scottish League Cup Final . United then lost the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2 – 2 after extra time . Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010 , under the guidance of manager Peter Houston , when First Division side Ross County were defeated 3 – 0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup Final . David Goodwillie scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals . 
 United 's 10th appearance in the Scottish Cup final came in 2014 , but the team lost 2 – 0 to St Johnstone at Celtic Park . The Tangerines reached the League Cup final the following year , but lost to Celtic in the final .

 The club 's first experience of Europe came in 1966 – 67 when , helped by a clutch of Scandinavian players , United defeated Fairs Cup holders F.C. Barcelona both home and away . Although Juventus proved too strong in the next round with a 3 – 1 aggregate victory , United made headlines and were asked to compete as Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association league in North America during the summer of 1967 . After their only Premier Division championship win , the team reached the resulting semi @-@ final of the European Cup in 1984 , losing 3 – 2 on aggregate to Roma . In 1987 , the club went one better , reaching the final of the UEFA Cup .

 Dundee United have received national and international acclaim for their " United for Kids " ( or <unk> ) scheme , which began in 2005 following a suggestion from an exiled supporter .

These kids , who can be accompanied by their carers free @-@ of @-@ charge , would otherwise be unable to attend football matches . Since the scheme began , several hundred children and their carers have received free season tickets . Dundee Council 's social work department have stated that the scheme has brought joy to the lives of many orphans , abused and battered children and others from disadvantaged backgrounds . All donations to <unk> are now handled by Dundee United 's " United for All " official charity – a secure link to make donations can be found on the club 's website . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 Dundee United 's traditional rivals are Dundee , with whom they compete in the Dundee derby . The fixture was lacking a competitive element for a number of years until Dundee 's return to the top flight of the Scottish game in 2012 . A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that both clubs ' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another . 
 In spite of their rivalry , the two sides previously contemplated ground @-@ sharing as part of the SFA 's unsuccessful bid to host Euro 2008 . Perhaps one of their most notable meetings was in the 1980 Scottish League Cup Final played at Dens Park when United won 3 – 0 to claim their second League Cup in successive seasons . 
 Another intense fixture is that of the New Firm derby between United and North @-@ East rivals Aberdeen F.C .. The match itself became one of fierce competition due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the stewardship of United 's Jim McLean and Aberdeen 's Alex Ferguson . Despite the relative lack of trophies in the years ahead , the derby has endured and continues to be one of the most eagerly awaited fixtures of the Scottish season . 
 United also share a rivalry with St Johnstone due to the relatively close proximity of Dundee and Perth , known as the Tayside derby . The most notable meeting between the two sides was in the 2014 Scottish Cup Final , when Saints came out on top after a 2 – 0 victory at Celtic Park in the Tangerines ' tenth final appearance .

 = Canadian heraldry = 
 Canadian heraldry is the cultural tradition and style of coats of arms and other heraldic achievements in both modern and historic Canada . It includes national , provincial , and civic arms , noble and personal arms , ecclesiastical heraldry , heraldic displays as corporate logos , and Canadian heraldic descriptions . 
 Derived mainly from heraldic traditions in France and the United Kingdom , Canadian heraldry also incorporates distinctly Canadian symbols , especially native flora and fauna , references to the First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of Canada , and uniquely Canadian elements such as the Canadian pale , derived from the Canadian flag . A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms , and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists . 
 In 1988 , governance of both personal and corporate heraldry in Canada was <unk> from the heraldic authorities in England and Scotland , with the formation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority , which now has exclusive jurisdiction over granting awards of arms in Canada . Coats of arms are used throughout Canada by all levels of government , in many cases including royal insignia as a mark of authority , as in the recently granted arms of the House of Commons and the Senate , and of Parliament as a combined body . Use of armorial bearings is not limited to governmental bodies ; all citizens of Canada have the right to petition for an award of arms , as do other entities including businesses and religious institutions . The granting of arms is regarded as an honour from the Queen of Canada , via her Viceroy , the Governor General of Canada , and thus are bestowed only on those whom the Chief Herald has deemed worthy of receiving a grant of arms . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the arrival of Europeans , the Aboriginal peoples of Canada used symbolic artwork to denote their allegiance to a particular clan or <unk> <unk> , and to show legendary and religious themes . For the West Coast peoples this would be done with carvings on totem poles , carvings integrated into longhouses and smaller wooden objects like boxes , masks , and canoes . For Plains people the Plains hide painting tradition painted images onto tipis , shields , and other animal @-@ hide objects . 
 The history of European @-@ style heraldry in Canada began with the raising of the Royal Arms of France by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534 , when he landed on Canadian soil at what is now known as the Gaspé Peninsula . From the beginning of the settlement of Canada until the Treaty of Paris in 1763 , armorial bearings were largely either brought from France or awarded by the French crown . A notable exception is the Coat of Arms of Nova Scotia , awarded in 1625 by Charles I ( making it the oldest coat of arms in the Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom ) , in use until 1868 , when it was replaced by a new achievement . The original was later rediscovered , and replaced the 1868 version in 1929 . The present @-@ day Coat of Arms of Newfoundland and Labrador was granted to a private company shortly after that of Nova Scotia , although it did not enter use as the region 's arms until the 1920s . The Coat of Arms of the Hudson 's Bay Company was first used in 1671 ( although no record of the original grant exists , and it was not registered with the College of Arms in London until 1921 ) , and has been in continual use with minor cosmetic changes to the official depiction ever since . 
 Upon ratification of the Treaty of Paris , the British Crown confirmed the French awards of arms . Between 1763 and 1867 , the year of Canadian Confederation , there is little evidence of much heraldic activity . After Confederation , however , heraldry in Canada became more widespread , including grants of arms to the provinces , various educational institutions , municipalities , and individuals . In the immediate post @-@ Confederation period , arms were granted to New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Ontario , and Quebec , although not to the country as a whole . In the period between the Treaty of Paris and Confederation , the Arms of the United Kingdom had served as the emblem of authority within Canada . 
 From 1763 until 1988 , heraldry in Canada was under the authority of the College of Arms in London and the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh . In the late 1980s , the Queen issued Letters Patent creating the Canadian Heraldic Authority . 
 = = Modern heraldry = = 
 = = = Official = = = 
 Before the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority , Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom : either the College of Arms in London or , if of Scottish descent , the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh . This process was quite lengthy — and costly . In addition , the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols . In time , many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians . 
 As early as 1967 , plans were reportedly in the works to transfer overview of heraldry from the College of Arms in the UK to Canada . The push for a wholly Canadian heraldic system came largely from the Heraldry Society of Canada ( now the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada ) almost from its inception , though it was not seen as a priority by successive national governments . In 1986 , Vicki Huntington , a politician from British Columbia , forwarded a brief written by the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada calling for the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority to a staff member in then @-@ Secretary of State David Crombie 's office . Mr. Crombie had his department organise a meeting in Ottawa the following year , to which many national and international heraldic experts were invited . The meeting concluded with " a strong recommendation to government that an Authority be created . " 
 Two years later , on 4 June 1988 , then @-@ Governor General Jeanne Sauvé authorised the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority , made possible by letters patent signed by Queen Elizabeth II , on the advice of her Canadian Privy Council , and presented by her son , Prince Edward . As a result , Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority . Canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms . Additionally , all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade @-@ Marks Act . 
 = = = State and national = = = 
 The Royal Arms of Canada are the official coat of arms of the Canadian monarch and thus also of Canada . They incorporate many distinctive Canadian elements such as the maple leaves , and the reference to the French Royal Arms in the fourth quarter which replace or add to those derived from the British . 
 The arms are used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives , including the Prime Minister and Cabinet , the Speaker of the House of Commons , most courts ( including the Supreme Court ) , and , formerly , Parliament . It is also present on all denominations of Canadian paper currency , and on the cover of Canadian passports . Since 1962 , a banner of the arms , defaced with a variant of the Queen 's cypher , has formed the Royal Standard of Canada , for use by the Canadian sovereign . The personal flag of the Governor General has featured the crest of the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981 . 
 On 15 February 2008 , the House of Commons was granted its own heraldic symbol following a request by Commons Speaker Peter Milliken to the Canadian Heraldic Authority . The new symbol for Parliament is a badge of the escutcheon in the Arms of Canada superimposed on the mace used by the House of Commons as a symbol of its authority derived from the Crown . The Senate was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008 , using its own mace . Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada , superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in saltire . 
 In June 2008 , MP Pat Martin introduced a motion into the House of Commons calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada 's First Nations , Inuit and Métis peoples . 
 = = = Provincial = = = 
 In much the same way that there is a national coat of arms , each province and territory possesses its own unique arms ; Saskatchewan 's is known formally as Her Majesty 's Arms in Right of Saskatchewan . The year after Confederation , Queen Victoria issued Royal Warrants assigning arms to Canada 's original four provinces : Quebec , Ontario , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick . 
 Each provincial coat of arms includes specific local symbolism ; most also include symbolism derived from the coats of arms of the United Kingdom , France , or both . Since 1868 , each province and territory within Canada has been granted arms through warrants either from the monarch directly or from the Governor General , or has assumed them through other means . 
 Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador , each province and territory bears at least some elements from its coat of arms upon its flag . The flags of British Columbia , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms , while Alberta , Manitoba , Ontario , Saskatchewan , the Northwest Territories , and the Yukon each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags , with other design elements . The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours . The shield of the arms of each province , on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves , the whole surmounted by a crown , forms the main element of the flag of the Lieutenant @-@ Governor of that province . The exceptions are Nova Scotia , which uses the Union Flag defaced with the shield of Nova Scotia , surrounded by green maple leaves , and Quebec , which uses the shield on a white circle with the provincial motto inscribed below . 
 = = = Municipal = = = 
 The use of armorial bearings among Canadian cities is inconsistent , because many of them have been assumed and brought into force by local governmental authorities , rather than granted from the Crown . Many municipal coats of arms either awarded or confirmed by the Canadian Heraldic Authority may be found within the Public Register of Arms , though the online version of the Register is not complete . 
 = = = Personal = = = 
 In Canada , every citizen has the right to petition the Crown for a grant of arms . Canadians who have been appointed to the Order of Canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including the ribbon of the Order , or should they already be armigerous , to encircle their extant arms with the ribbon . Amongst others , all members of the Privy Council are entitled to supporters in their arms , as are the Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate , Companions of the Order of Canada , Commanders of the Orders of Military Merit , Merit of the Police Forces , and of the Royal Victorian Order . 
 = = Unique Canadian elements and practices = = 
 = = = Aboriginal and First Nations symbolism = = = 
 Due to the history of Canada , heraldry in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements . The Coat of Arms of Nunavut , for example , includes elements such as an <unk> , a <unk> , and an igloo , all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area , while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens , a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation . In addition , some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield , a reference to a drumhead ; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In many systems of heraldry , the arms of each living person must be unique . English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father 's arms and from each other since the 13th century ; this is now normally done by the system of marks or <unk> set up by the early Tudor herald John <unk> . Canada adds a unique series of <unk> for use by female children who inherit arms . As in other heraldic systems , these cadency marks are not always used ; in any case , when the heir succeeds ( in Canada , this is normally the first child , whether male or female , according to strict primogeniture ; however , the grantee may choose another person as heir ) , the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms . 
 <unk> 
 = = = Charges , <unk> , and divisions of the field = = = 
 The Canadian pale , a pale division amounting to half the entire field , derived from the Canadian flag , is widely used in Canadian heraldry , while the Canadian fess , a similar horizontal division , has been used once . The term érablé , referring to maple leaves , is often used in Canadian arms . For example , as a tressure érablé in the arms of the Monarchist League of Canada , coronets érablé in the arms of Sudbury and Canada 's National History Society , and as a partition much like engrailed or <unk> . Canadian animals and birds , both real and fantastical , have also been widely used in arms , including the mythical raven @-@ bears in the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority . 
 = = = Status of women = = = 
 In both the English and the Scottish systems of heraldry , from which the Canadian draws many of its practices , a woman does not inherit or transmit arms unless she is an heraldic heiress , that is , a daughter of an armiger who has no sons . In Canadian heraldry , by contrast , women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers ( if any ) . Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs , regardless of gender . This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which guarantee , among other things , freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex . 
 = = = United Empire Loyalists = = = 
 Those who are descended from the citizens loyal to the British Crown who fled the United States during and shortly after the revolution are known in Canada as United Empire Loyalists , and are entitled to the use of special coronets within their arms , if arms are granted to them . There are two versions of the Loyalist coronet : the civil , which is made up of alternating oak and maple leaves , and the military , made up of maple leaves alternating with crossed swords ; the latter is reserved for use by the families of those who served in the British military during the revolution . Proof of Loyalist heritage must be provided to the Canadian Heraldic Authority before permission is granted to use the coronet in arms . Unlike the common use of coronets in heraldry , the Loyalist coronet denotes no rank of nobility or royalty , but instead alludes to ancestral allegiance . 
 = = Obtaining arms = = 
 All citizens of Canada , as well as corporate bodies , may petition the Crown for an award of arms . For an individual to obtain a grant of arms , a petition must be sent to the Chief Herald , providing a biography , references , and completed application forms . If the grant is approved , the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award . Upon completion of this process , the grant documents , in the form of letters patent , are created and provided to the grantee . The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork ; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms . For corporations and institutions the process is similar . 
 Those individuals and institutions who are already armigerous through recognised heraldic authorities worldwide may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered . There is no cost associated with application for registration , and it takes less time , approximately three months , than application for a new award of arms , which takes approximately twelve to fourteen months . 
 = Kenneth Grant = 
 Kenneth Grant ( 23 May 1924 – 15 January 2011 ) was an English ceremonial magician and prominent advocate of the Thelemite religion . A poet , novelist , and writer , he founded his own Thelemite organisation , the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis – later renamed the Typhonian Order – with his wife Steffi Grant . 
 Born in Ilford , Essex , Grant developed an interest in occultism and Asian religion during his teenage years . After several months serving in India with the British Army amid the Second World War , he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of the Aleister Crowley , the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904 . Crowley instructed Grant in his esoteric practices , initiating him into his own occult order , the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) . When Crowley died in 1947 , Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Britain , and was appointed as such by the American head of the O.T.O. , Karl Germer . Founding the London @-@ based New Isis Lodge in 1954 , Grant added to many of Crowley 's Thelemite teachings , bringing in extraterrestrial themes and influences from the work of H.P. Lovecraft . This was anathema to Germer , who expelled Grant from the O.T.O. in 1955 , although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962 . 
 In 1949 , Grant befriended the occult artist Austin Osman Spare , and in ensuing years helped to publicise Spare 's artwork through a series of publications . During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism , exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic . He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra , incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic . On Germer 's death in 1969 , Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O. ; this title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry , who took control of the O.T.O. Grant 's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis , operating from his Golders Green home . In 1959 he began publishing on the subject of occultism , and proceeded to author the Typhonian Trilogies , as well as a number of novels , books of poetry , and publications devoted to propagating the work of Crowley and Spare . 
 Grant 's writings and teachings have proved a significant influence over other currents of occultism , including chaos magic , the Temple of Set and the Dragon Rouge . They also attracted academic interest within the study of Western esotericism , particularly from Henrik Bogdan and Dave Evans . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and Aleister Crowley : 1924 – 1947 = = = 
 Grant was born on 23 May 1924 in Ilford , Essex , the son of a Welsh clergyman . By his early teenage years , Grant had read widely on the subject of Western esotericism and Asian religions , including the work of prominent occultist Helena Blavatsky . He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do so in a visionary dream he experienced in 1939 ; he spelled its name variously as A <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> . Aged 18 , in the midst of the Second World War , Grant volunteered to join the British Army , later commenting that he hoped to be posted to British India , where he could find a spiritual guru to study under . He was never posted abroad , and was ejected from the army aged 20 due to an unspecified medical condition . 
 Grant was fascinated by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley , having read a number of his books . Eager to meet Crowley , Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley 's publishers , asking them to give him his address ; however , the publisher had moved address themselves , meaning that they never received his letter . He also requested that Michael Houghton , proprietor of Central London 's esoteric bookstore Atlantis Bookshop , introduce him to Crowley . Houghton refused , privately remarking that Grant was " mentally unstable . " Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he didn 't wish to " incur evil karma " from introducing the young man to Crowley , but later suggested that it was because Houghton desired him for his own organisation , The Order of Hidden Masters , and thereby didn 't want him to become Crowley 's disciple . Persisting , Grant wrote letters to the new address of Crowley 's publishers , asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself . These resulted in the first meeting between the two , in autumn 1944 , at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire . 
 After several further meetings and an exchange of letters , Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant . Now living in relative poverty , Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money , instead paying him in magical instruction . In March 1945 , Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood , a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living . He continued living there with Crowley for several months , dealing with the old man 's correspondences and needs . In turn , he was allowed to read from Crowley 's extensive library on occult subjects , and performed ceremonial magic workings with him , becoming a high initiate of Crowley 's magical group , the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) . Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK , writing in his diary , " value of Grant . If I die or go to the USA , there must be a trained man to take care of the English O.T.O. " However , they also argued , with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London . On one occasion Crowley shouted at him : " You are the most consummate <unk> that the world has yet known . And this at 20 ! " 
 Grant 's family disliked that he was working for no wage , and pressured him to resign , which he did in June 1945 , leaving Netherwood . Crowley wrote to Grant 's father , stating that he was " very sorry to part with Kenneth " and that he felt that Grant was " giving up his real future . " To David Curwen , an O.T.O. member who was another of his correspondents , Crowley related his opinion that " I may have treated him too severely . " Crowley put Curwen in contact with Grant , with Grant later claiming that he learned much from Curwen , particularly regarding the Kaula school of Tantra ; in his later writings he made reference to Curwen using his Order name of Frater Ani <unk> . Although they continued to correspond with one another , Crowley and Grant never met again , for the former died in December 1947 . Grant attended Crowley 's funeral at a Brighton crematorium , while accompanied by his new wife , Steffi . 
 = = = The New Isis Lodge and Austin Osman Spare : 1947 – 1969 = = = 
 Steffi Grant introduced herself to the occult artist Austin Osman Spare in 1949 , having learned about him while she was modelling for Herbert Budd , a tutor at St. Martin 's School of Art who had studied alongside Spare . Steffi purchased two of Spare 's artworks , which she gave to Kenneth as a present for his twenty @-@ fifth birthday . She subsequently introduced her husband to Spare . At the time , Spare had fallen into poverty , living in obscurity in a South London flat . Although making some money as an artist and art tutor , he was largely financially supported by his friend Frank Letchford , whom he affectionately referred to as his " son " . There was some animosity between Letchford and Grant , although it is apparent that Spare preferred the former , having known him for 12 years longer , and placing him first in his will . Grant desired a closer relationship , and in 1954 began signing his letters to Spare " thy son . " Letchford claimed that Spare often told the Grants " white lies ... to boost a flagging ego . " Grant 's first published work represented a brief " appreciation " of Spare 's work that was included in a catalogue for the artist 's exhibition held at Temple Bar in London in 1949 . 
 Grant had continued studying Crowley 's work , and a year after Crowley 's death was acknowledged as a Ninth Degree member of the O.T.O. by Karl Germer , Crowley 's successor as Head of the O.T.O. Grant then successfully applied to Germer for a charter to operate the first three O.T.O. degrees and run his own lodge , which was granted in March 1951 . As this would mean that his lodge would be the only chartered O.T.O. body in England at the time , Grant believed that it meant that he was now head of the O.T.O. in Britain . Germer put Grant in contact with Wilfred Talbot Smith , an English Thelemite based in California who had founded the Agape Lodge , knowing that Smith was the only man who had practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree work . Smith was eager to help , and wrote at length on his experiences in founding a lodge , although he was made uneasy by Grant 's magical seal of " <unk> " for reasons that have never been ascertained , and their correspondence soon petered out . 
 Grant began restructuring the system of the O.T.O. by augmenting its grading structure with that of Crowley 's other occult order , the A ∴ A ∴ . This attempt failed , as Grant 's attentions were increasingly drawn into his founding and running of the New Isis Lodge . The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial " Sirius / Set current " upon which the lodge was to be based . In this manifesto , Grant claimed that a new energy was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with Nuit , a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley 's Thelemic holy text , The Book of the Law . Germer however deemed it " blasphemy " that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit ; on 20 July 1955 , Germer issued a " Note of Expulsion " expelling Grant from the O.T.O. 
 Grant however ignored Germer 's letter of expulsion , continuing to operate the New Isis Lodge under the claim that he had powers from the " Inner Plane " . Upon learning of Grant 's expulsion , Smith feared that the O.T.O. would split up into warring factions much as the Theosophical Society had done following the death of Blavatsky . Grant 's Lodge continued to operate until 1962 . According to Grant , the group consisted of about thirty members , and met every seventh Friday at the lodge 's premises , which for a while were in the basement of Curwen 's furrier 's store at Melcombe Street , near to Baker Street in central London . During the period in which he worked with the lodge he claimed to have received two important texts from preternatural sources , the Wisdom of S <unk> and <unk> or The Book of the Spider . 
 From 1953 to 1961 Grant immersed himself in the study of Hinduism , becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi . He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher , Lord Kusuma Haranath , and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three @-@ volume Lord Haranath : A Biography by <unk> Ramakrishna Sastri . He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay @-@ based The Call Divine , as well as for Richard Cavendish 's Man , Myth & Magic . Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as At the Feet of the Guru in 2005 . Grant believed that the O.T.O. ' s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion , in doing so relying heavily on Curwen 's ideas about tantra . 
 After Spare 's death , Grant began to focus more on his own writing career . From 1959 to 1963 , Grant privately published the Carfax Monographs , a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments , each at a limited print run of 100 . Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi , reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant 's subsequent publications . The Carfax Monographs would eventually be assembled together and re @-@ released as Hidden Lore in 1989 . In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems , Black to Black and Other Poems . During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels , although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012 . 
 = = = Typhonian O.T.O. and growing fame : 1970 – 2011 = = = 
 In 1969 , Grant co @-@ edited The Confessions of Aleister Crowley for publication with Crowley 's literary executor John Symonds . Over the coming years he edited – often with Symonds – a range of Crowley writings for republication , resulting in the release of The Magical Record of the Beast 666 ( 1972 ) , Diary of a Drug Fiend ( 1972 ) , Moonchild ( 1972 ) , Magick ( 1973 ) , Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law ( 1974 ) and The Complete Astrological Writings ( 1974 ) . The release of these publications has been described as being " instrumental in the revival of interest in Crowley " . 
 At this point , Grant began describing himself as the <unk> ( Outer Head of the Order ) of the O.T.O. , claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked . A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor , a Typhonian O.T.O. member . In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation , the Typhonian O.T.O. , which produced its first official announcement in 1973 . Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley , Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree ; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development . 
 In 1972 , Frederick Muller Limited published the first book in Grant 's " Typhonian Trilogies " series , The Magical Revival , in which he discussed various events within the history of Western esotericism while also encouraging future interest in the subject . He followed this with a sequel published in 1973 , Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God , in which he examined Crowley 's sex magical practices and the Tantra . This was followed in 1975 by Cults of the Shadow , which brought the first Typhonian Trilogy to an end with a discussion of the Left Hand Path in magic , making reference to both Crowley and Spare 's work , as well as to Voodoo and Tantra . That same year , Grant also published Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare , a collection of his late friend 's images based on 20 years of research . The volume did not sell well , with much of the stock being <unk> , although became a rare collector 's item in later years . Grant had begun work on the book many years before , and had agreed for 500 copies to be published by <unk> Press Ltd in 1967 , although at the last minute the project was cancelled . He had also authored new introductions for re @-@ releases of two of Spare 's works , a 1973 publication of The Anathema of <unk> and a 1975 release of The Book of Pleasure . 
 In 1977 , Grant began the second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden , in which he discussed some of his own personal magical ideas , outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark , dense realm that he variously called ' Universe B ' and ' the Tunnels of Set ' , conceived as a ' dark side ' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life . Grant made connections between this realm and the <unk> deities of H.P. Lovecraft 's horror fiction . The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites , and starkly divided opinion . The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time , and introduced Grant 's thoughts on the relevance of <unk> and insectoid symbolism for occultism . This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller , who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984 , while te publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year . His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time . 
 In 1989 , Grant began his relationship with Skoob Books Limited , a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in Bloomsbury , central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles under the leadership of Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson . In 1991 , Skoob Books published Grant 's Remembering Aleister Crowley , a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries , photographs , and letters . From 1989 to 1994 , Skoob reissued a number of Grant 's earlier books , and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies , Hecate 's Fountain , in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic . The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies , Outer Gateways , followed in 1994 , discussing Grant 's ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world , with reference to the work of Crowley , Spare , and Lovecraft . It ends with the text of The Wisdom of S <unk> , a work that Grant claimed he had received <unk> from a supernatural source . 
 After Skoob Books closed its esoteric publishing division , in 1996 Grant transferred the publishing rights of his books to two companies , Starfire Publishing – which decided to bring out his trilogies and novellas – and <unk> Limited , which published his work on Spare . In 1997 Starfire published Grant 's first novel , Against the Light : A Nightside Narrative , which involved a character also named " Kenneth Grant " . He asserted that the work was " quasi @-@ autobiographical " , but never specified which parts were based on his life and which were fictional . In 1998 , Starfire published a book co @-@ written by Grant and his wife Steffi , titled <unk> Speaks ! Encounters with Austin Osman Spare , in which they included 7 years ' worth of diary entries , letters , and photographs pertaining to their relationship with the artist . The following year , the next volume in the Typhonian Trilogies , Beyond the Mauve Zone was published , explaining Grant 's ideas on a realm known as the Mauve Zone that he claimed to have explored . A book containing two novellas , <unk> and the Darker Strain , was published in 2000 , while the final volume of the Typhonian Trilogies , The Ninth Arch , was published in 2003 . It offered further Qabalistic interpretations of the work of Crowley , Spare , and Lovecraft , and the text of another work that Grant claimed had been given to him from a supernatural source , Book of the Spider . That same year , Grant also published two further volumes of fictional stories , Gamaliel and Dance , Doll , Dance ! , which told the story of a vampire and a Tantric sex group , and The Other Child , and Other Tales , which contained six short stories . 
 Grant died on 15 January 2011 after a period of illness . He was survived by his wife .

 While highlighting Grant 's reclusive character , the historian Dave Evans noted that Grant was " certainly unique " in the history of British esotericism because of his " close dealings " with Crowley , Spare , and Gardner , the " three most influential Western occultists of the 20th century . " The occultist and comic book author Alan Moore thought it " hard to name " any other living individual who " has done more to shape contemporary western thinking with regard to Magic " than Grant , thinking him " a schoolboy gone berserk on brimstone <unk> . " 
 In 2003 , the historian of Western esotericism Henrik Bogdan expressed the view that Grant was " perhaps ( the ) most original and prolific English author of the post @-@ modern occultist genre . " Although based in Thelema , his Typhonian tradition has been described as " a bricolage of occultism , Neo @-@ Vedanta , Hindu tantra , Western sexual magic , Surrealism , ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis " . Although membership of Grant 's own occult groups remained small , his Typhonian Thelema represented a significant influence over various other occult groups and currents . They included chaos magic , as well as the Temple of Set , the Dragon Rouge , and Andrew D. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . 
 The occultist Peter <unk> discussed Grant 's work in his 2013 book , The Dark Lord . Here , he asserted that Grant 's importance was in attempting to create " a more global character for Thelema " by introducing ideas from Indian Tantra , <unk> , and Afro @-@ Caribbean syncretic religions .

 = Ottoman ironclad Mesudiye = 
 Mesudiye ( Ottoman Turkish : Happiness ) was a central @-@ battery ironclad of the Ottoman Navy , one of the largest ships of that type ever built . She was built at the Thames Iron Works in Britain between 1871 and 1875 . Mesudiye had one sister ship , though she was purchased by the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS Superb . Her primary armament consisted of twelve 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) guns in a central armored battery . 
 Mesudiye was poorly maintained for most of her career , including a twenty @-@ year long period between the Russo @-@ Turkish War in 1877 – 78 and the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 . As a result , she was in very poor condition by the late 1890s , which prompted a major reconstruction of her into a pre @-@ dreadnought design type vessel in Genoa . The ship 's armament was overhauled , though the gun turrets that were to have mounted 230 mm ( 9 in ) guns never received the weapons . A new propulsion system was also installed , which significantly improved performance . 
 The ship saw extensive action during the First Balkan War in 1912 – 13 , including the battles of Elli and Lemnos in December 1912 and January 1913 , respectively . During the latter engagement , she was badly damaged by a Greek shell and forced to withdraw . Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Mesudiye was moored at Nara to protect the minefields that blocked the entrance to the Dardanelles . On the morning of 13 December , the British submarine HMS B11 passed through the minefields and torpedoed Mesudiye , which quickly sank . Most of the crew survived , however , and many of her guns were salvaged and used to strengthen the defenses of the Dardanelles . A battery of these guns , named Mesudiye in honor of the ship , helped to sink the French battleship Bouvet in March 1915 .

Several ironclad warships were ordered in the 1860s and 1870s , primarily from British and French shipyards . Despite the shortage of funds , by the late 1870s , the Ottomans had acquired a fleet of thirteen large ironclads and nine smaller armored warships . Mesudiye was designed by Edward Reed , who based the design on the recently build British ironclad HMS Hercules . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 Mesudiye was 101 @.@ 02 meters ( 331 ft 5 in ) long , and she had a beam of 17 @.@ 98 m ( 59 ft 0 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 9 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 8 @,@ 938 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 797 long tons ; 9 @,@ 852 short tons ) as originally built . Her hull was constructed with iron , and was fitted with a ram bow . She had a crew of 700 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by a single horizontal , two @-@ cylinder compound engine , with steam provided by eight coal @-@ fired box boilers . The boilers were trunked into a pair of funnels located amidships . The engines were rated at 7 @,@ 431 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 541 kW ) and produced a top speed of 13 @.@ 7 knots ( 25 @.@ 4 km / h ; 15 @.@ 8 mph ) . By 1884 , decades of poor maintenance had reduced her top speed to 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She carried 600 t ( 590 long tons ; 660 short tons ) of coal . Although intended to operate primarily via her steam engine , Mesudiye was also fitted with three masts and a barque rig . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Mesudiye was armed with a main battery of twelve RML 10 inch 18 ton guns , all mounted in a central battery . Six were on each side , with four on the broadside , one angled forward and the other angled rearward . She was also equipped with three RML 7 inch guns , all on the upper deck , with two forward and one aft . In 1891 , six 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) quick @-@ firing guns ( QF ) and six 25 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 00 in ) QF guns were installed . 
 Armor protection consisted of iron plate ; the armored belt had a maximum thickness of 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) in the central portion of the ship , where it protected machinery and ammunition magazines , and was reduced on either end , first to 127 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) and then to 76 mm . The thickest part of the belt extended 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) below the waterline and 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above the line , and was composed of three strakes . The middle strake was the thickest , the upper strake was reduced slightly to 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) , and the lower one was 9 in ( 230 mm ) and tapered to 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The gun battery was protected by another two strakes of armor , the lower being 254 mm thick and the upper reduced to 178 mm ( 7 @.@ 0 in ) . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Mesudiye was ordered in 1871 and was laid down at the Thames Iron Works shipyard in London the following year . She was launched on 28 October 1874 and was commissioned in December 1875 for sea trials . She had one sister ship , <unk> , which was renamed Hamidiye while under construction . She was purchased by the Royal Navy before completion and commissioned as HMS Superb . Mesudiye and Superb were the largest casemate ironclads ever built . In September 1876 , Mesudiye became the flagship of the Ottoman Black Sea Squadron , though she did not see action in the Russo @-@ Turkish War that broke out in April 1877 . 
 After the Ottoman defeat , the fleet was laid up at the Golden Horn and left largely unattended for the following twenty years . During this period of inactivity , Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the <unk> @-@ i <unk> shipyard on the Golden Horn . At the start of the Greco @-@ Turkish War in February 1897 , Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat , as were most of the other major warships of the fleet . On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise , which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships ' crews . 
 = = = Reconstruction = = = 
 Following the end of the war , the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program . The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships , including Mesudiye . Requests for proposals were sent to foreign shipyards , and in October 1898 the Gio . Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa requested permission to survey the ship and the ironclad Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik . Both vessels were accordingly sent to Genoa in January 1899 , arriving on the 28th , though Ansaldo only received the contract for Mesudiye . Mesudiye was rebuilt into a pre @-@ dreadnought type vessel . 
 The modernization involved radical reconstruction of the hull ; the bow and stern were cut down to make room for a pair of gun turrets , each mounting a single 230 mm ( 9 in ) 40 @-@ caliber gun manufactured by Vickers . The turrets had 230 mm thick armored faces , though they never received their guns ; wooden dummy guns were installed in their place . A battery of twelve 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) 45 @-@ caliber QF guns was installed in place of the old rifled muzzle @-@ loaders , and sixteen 76 mm QF guns were added in an upper battery . Mesudiye also received ten 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns and a pair of 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns . 
 A large superstructure was built amidships , with a new conning tower , which was given 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) of armor plating . Displacement rose to 9 @,@ 120 t ( 8 @,@ 980 long tons ; 10 @,@ 050 short tons ) normally and 9 @,@ 710 t ( 9 @,@ 560 long tons ; 10 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full load . The ship 's propulsion system was also completely replaced . Two triple @-@ expansion engines were installed , along with sixteen coal @-@ fired Niclausse boilers . The two screw propellers overlapped , so the port side screw was placed slightly ahead of the starboard one . Performance improved to 11 @,@ 000 ihp ( 8 @,@ 200 kW ) and 17 kn ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . Her crew increased to 800 as a result of the modifications . On 15 March 1904 , Mesudiye completed sea trials and thereafter returned to Constantinople . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish and Balkan Wars = = = 
 In 1909 , she participated in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the Ottoman Navy in twenty years , part of a reform program initiated by a British naval mission to the Ottoman Empire . Starting in July 1911 , Mesudiye joined the two pre @-@ dreadnoughts Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis , four destroyers , and a torpedo boat for a series of exercises that culminated in the routine summer cruise to Beirut . The fleet was returning to Constantinople when the Italy declared war , starting the Italo @-@ Turkish War on 29 September 1911 . Mesudiye and the rest of the fleet moored at Nara on 2 October and returned to Constantinople the following day . Mesudiye was thereafter assigned to the Reserve Division , which also included the rebuilt ironclad Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik and the torpedo cruiser Berk @-@ i Satvet . She did not see action during the conflict , since the Ottoman fleet spent the war in port . This was in part due to the rising tensions in the Balkans that presaged the Balkan Wars ; the Ottomans kept their fleet in port so it could be prepared for the inevitable conflict . 
 In October 1912 , the Balkan League declared war on the Ottomans , a month before the Italo @-@ Turkish War ended . At the time , Mesudiye was moored off <unk> , a neighborhood in Constantinople , with the torpedo boats <unk> and <unk> , stationed as a guard ship . In December , the Ottoman fleet was reorganized , with Mesudiye joining the newly formed Battleship Division , under the command of Ramiz Naman Bey . The division also included Barbaros Hayreddin , Turgut Reis , and Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik . The ship was moved to Büyükçekmece on 15 November , where she joined the rest of the fleet . Two days later , Mesudiye and Barbaros Hayreddin conducted shore bombardments in support of the Ottoman troops holding the Çatalca Line ; the bombardments did not cause particularly significant material damage to the attacking Bulgarians , but it did boost Ottoman morale . 
 = = = = Battle of Elli = = = = 
 The ships took part in the Battle of Elli , the first Ottoman surface action involving major warships since the Russo @-@ Turkish War , on 16 December 1912 . The Ottoman fleet sortied from the Dardanelles at 9 : 30 ; the smaller craft remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north , hugging the coast . The Greek flotilla , which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and three Hydra @-@ class ironclads , sailing from the island of Lemnos , altered course to the northeast to block the advance of the Ottoman battleships . The Ottoman ships opened fire on the Greeks at 9 : 40 , from a range of about 15 @,@ 000 yd ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . Five minutes later , Georgios Averof crossed over to the other side of the Ottoman fleet , placing the Ottomans in the unfavorable position of being under fire from both sides . 
 At 9 : 50 and under heavy pressure from the Greek fleet , the Ottoman ships completed a 16 @-@ point turn , which reversed their course , and headed for the safety of the straits . The turn was poorly conducted , and the ships fell out of formation , blocking each other 's fields of fire . Barbaros Hayreddin , Turgut Reis , and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle , though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged . By 10 : 17 , both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles . When they approached the straits , Mesudiye and Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre @-@ dreadnoughts . The ships reached port by 13 : 00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa . 
 = = = = Battle of Lemnos = = = = 
 In late December , the Ottomans began a campaign of raids and patrols in the Aegean Sea against the islands that had been recently conquered by the Greeks . The Ottoman Army began planning to make a landing on Tenedos in late December , which had been captured by Greece earlier in the war . Mesudiye and the rest of the Battleship Division sortied from the Dardanelles on the morning of 4 January 1913 , but the operation was called off after the Greek fleet appeared . On 10 January , the fleet embarked on another offensive operation , this time to raid the island of Imbros . After a brief , inconclusive clash with Greek destroyers , the fleet again withdrew to the safety of the Dardanelles . Eight days later , another fleet operation began , which produced the Battle of Lemnos , the second major naval engagement of the war . Ottoman plan to lure the faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles . The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to draw the Greek cruiser into pursuit . Despite the threat posed by the cruiser , the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof . 
 The Ottoman fleet departed the Dardanelles at 8 : 20 on the morning of 18 January , and sailed toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . Barbaros Hayreddin led the line of battleships , with a flotilla of torpedo boats on either side of the formation . A long range artillery duel that lasted for two hours began at around 11 : 55 , when the Ottoman fleet opened fire at a range of 8 @,@ 000 m ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) . They concentrated their fire on the Greek Georgios Averof , which returned fire at 12 : 00 . At 12 : 50 , the Greeks attempted to cross the T of the Ottoman fleet , but Barbaros Hayreddin turned north to block the Greek maneuver . At around that time , Mesudiye took a serious hit that disabled three of her 150 mm guns ; this damage , coupled with boiler trouble , led the Ottoman commander to detach the ship and send her back to port . 
 On 5 February , Mesudiye supported operations off Şarköy in the Sea of Marmara , bombarding Bulgarian troops that had occupied the town . This was the last wartime operation conducted by the ship ; she did not participate in the amphibious assault on Şarköy three days later . The Ottoman fleet then spent the remaining months of the war in port , until the armistice ended the conflict in April . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 In late July 1914 , World War I broke out in Europe , though the Ottomans initially remained neutral . On 6 September 1914 , Mesudiye was sent to Nara to protect the minefields guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles . She was supported by the minelayer <unk> and the tug <unk> . Tensions between the Ottomans and a British fleet patrolling the entrance to the Dardanelles increased until 5 November , when Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire . 
 On the morning of 13 December , the British submarine B11 , commanded by Lieutenant Norman Holbrook , entered the Dardanelles . At around 11 : 30 , she spotted Mesudiye at anchor and fired a single torpedo from a distance of 750 m ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) . The torpedo hit the ship 's stern and caused serious damage ; Mesudiye 's guns briefly fired at B11 's periscope before the ship capsized and sank in shallow water . Casualties were light , with only 10 officers and 27 enlisted men killed in the attack . A salvage effort removed the 150 mm and 76 mm guns , which were used to strengthen the defenses of the Dardanelles . In the meantime , B11 successfully passed back through the Dardanelles and returned to port ; Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross for sinking Mesudiye . 
 Mesudiye 's salvaged 150 mm guns were installed as " Battery Mesudiye " in the Dardanelles . These guns played a role in the sinking of the French battleship Bouvet on 18 March 1915 , having hit the ship eight times — one of which disabled her forward turret — before she struck a mine and sank with very heavy loss of life . 
 = Marasmius sasicola = 
 Marasmius sasicola is a species of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture , Japan . First collected in 2000 , it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi . The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short , very thin black stems . Unlike in other , similar species , the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows . The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap , and all of them reach the stem . The flesh has no taste or odour . Found in June , the species grows on dead Sasa leaves , from which it takes its specific epithet . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Marasmius sasicola was first described by Haruki Takahashi ( 2002 ) in an article in Mycoscience , based on specimens collected from Ikuta <unk> Park , Kawasaki , Kanagawa Prefecture , Japan in 2000 and 2001 . The specific name sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species . The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa @-@ no @-@ <unk> . Within the genus Mycena , it probably belongs to the section Marasmius , and the subsection <unk> , due to characters of the stem , gills and pileipellis ( the outer @-@ most layer of the cap ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Marasmius sasicola produces mushrooms that have convex caps from 5 to 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter featuring folds or striations . The caps do not expand or flatten with age , and are dry and dull . The cap surface is covered in tiny grains which vanish as the mushrooms age . The caps of young mushrooms are coloured light brown , but paler at the cap margin ; as they mature , the caps become paler , approaching white when fully matured . The very thin , smooth stem measures between 2 and 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 and 0 @.@ 1 in ) in length by 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 01 to 0 @.@ 02 in ) thick . It connects to the centre of the cap , and is a dark brown to black colour . Mycelial cords cannot be seen at the base of the stem , which anchors itself into the substrate . The white gills can be adnexed ( attaching to the stem by only part of their depth ) to adnate ( attaching by their full depth ) . They are not at all crowded , with between 6 and 8 separate gills , all of which reach the stem . Each gill is up to 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) broad , though it is thinner at the edge . The mushrooms have a very thin layer of whitish flesh up to 0 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 in ) thick . The tough but flexible flesh lacks any odour or taste . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Marasmius sasicola produces colourless , ellipsoid basidiospores of between 8 and 10 by 4 to 6 micrometres ( μm ) . The spores have no ornamentation , are not amyloid and have thin cell walls . In his examinations , Takahashi did not observe any basidia , but he did describe the club @-@ shaped basidioles ( immature basidia ) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10 μm . The tightly packed cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of the gill ) form a sterile edge to the gill , and there are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the face of the gill ) . The pileipellis , the top layer of the cap , forms a hymeniderm , a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills . This is made up of club @-@ shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10 μm , with reddish @-@ brown , smooth cell walls up to 1 μm thick . The stipitipellis , the outermost layer of the stem , is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6 μm in width , which run parallel to one another . They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1 μm thick , and the septa ( the walls separating individual cells ) have clamp connections . 
 The flesh in the cap is made up of irregularly arranged cylindrical hyphae from 5 to 15 μm wide . They stain a dark reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent or Lugol 's solution . The flesh in the stem is made up of hyphae which run down the stem and measure 4 to 11 μm in thickness . The smooth cell walls are colorless , but again stain a dark reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent or Lugol 's solution . The septa have clamp connections .

 Marasmius sasicola is known from the lowland forests of Kanagawa Prefecture , Japan , and can be found in June . Mushrooms grow in large numbers close together , and grow from dead leaves of Sasa ( grass bamboo ) which have fallen . 
 = Don Revie = 
 Donald George " Don " Revie , OBE ( 10 July 1927 – 26 May 1989 ) was an England international footballer and manager . 
 A forward , he began his career with Leicester City in August 1944 , before winning a £ 19 @,@ 000 move to Hull City in November 1949 . He was sold on to Manchester City in October 1951 for a fee of £ 25 @,@ 000 , where he became the main focus of the " Revie Plan " which saw him named as FWA Footballer of the Year in 1954 – 55 after innovating the role of the first deep @-@ lying centre forward in England . He won the FA Cup in 1956 , having finished on the losing side in the 1955 final . He was bought by Sunderland for £ 22 @,@ 000 in October 1956 , before moving on to Leeds United in November 1958 for a £ 14 @,@ 000 fee . In total he scored 108 goals in 501 league and cup appearances in an 18 @-@ year professional career , also scoring four goals in six England appearances as well as winning representative honours for the Football League XI and the England B team . 
 In March 1961 , Revie was appointed player @-@ manager of Leeds United , then a Second Division club who had never previously won a major trophy . Under Revie 's management , Leeds became a major force in English football , winning the Second Division in 1963 – 64 , the First Division in 1968 – 69 and 1973 – 74 , the FA Cup in 1972 , the League Cup in 1968 , the FA Charity Shield in 1969 , and the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971 . Additionally , Leeds were First Division runners @-@ up five times , thrice FA Cup runners @-@ up and runners @-@ up in the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup and the European Cup Winners ' Cup . In July 1974 he accepted the job as England manager , but had an unsuccessful three years in the role before quitting in highly controversial circumstances to take up the management role with the United Arab Emirates . He later had spells in Middle Eastern club football with Al @-@ Nasr and Al @-@ Ahly . 
 As Leeds manager he was criticised for the physical and often negative approach of his teams , though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country . His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money @-@ obsessed , and unproven allegations of bribery and financial misconduct also tarnished his reputation . He retired in 1984 , but was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in May 1987 , which led to his death two years later . He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds , and has a stand named after him at Elland Road as well as a statue outside the ground .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Revie was born in Middlesbrough , North Riding of Yorkshire , on 10 July 1927 . His father , also named Donald , was a joiner who found himself frequently out of work during the Great Depression . His mother , a washerwoman , died of cancer when he was 12 . He played youth football for Newport Boys ' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts , who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson . He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home . This influenced his thinking in later life , and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs , on smaller pitches , so they would be more adept in control when progressing to a bigger football . 
 = = = Leicester City = = = 
 He signed as a professional footballer for Leicester City in August 1944 , choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City ; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer . Leicester originally thought him not good enough to turn professional , but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game . Smith instructed Revie that " When not in position , get into position ; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass ; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger ; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move . Soccer would then become easy . " He played in the wartime league , before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946 – 47 season , a 3 – 0 defeat to Manchester City , who would go on to win the Second Division that season . He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur 's Ron Burgess ; the injury could have ended his career , but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks . 
 Manager Johnny Duncan identified Revie as the player to build his team around for the 1947 – 48 and 1948 – 49 seasons , and though the Foxes fared poorly in the league they managed to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final . Revie scored the opening goal of the semi @-@ final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth , having being told pre @-@ match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker 's head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself to take advantage of the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball , leaving Revie with a simple conversion . However Revie suffered a nasal haemorrhage caused by a burst vein one week before the final , and the condition became so severe it would threaten his life and see him miss his first chance to play at Wembley . He could only listen on the radio as Leicester lost 3 – 1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final . Revie decided to leave Leicester after Duncan left the club , having already been dissatisfied with the club 's lack of progress in the league . 
 = = = Hull City = = = 
 In November 1949 he joined Second Division club Hull City for a transfer fee of £ 19 @,@ 000 . He chose to join the Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him due to the fact that Hull were managed by Raich Carter , who had been a great player before and after World War II . Carter did improve Revie 's game but was not a success as Hull manager , as City finished mid @-@ table in 1949 – 50 and 1950 – 51 , before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951 – 52 . Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player , and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing . As at Leicester , Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed . 
 = = = Manchester City = = = 
 Revie was sold to First Division side Manchester City for £ 25 @,@ 000 ( including a part @-@ exchange for Ernie Phillips , valued at £ 12 @,@ 000 ) in October 1951 . The Citizens struggled in the 1951 – 52 season , and then went on to finish just one place above the relegation zone in the 1952 – 53 campaign . Revie was often isolated from the rest of the team due to his lack of pace . The sale of Ivor Broadis then allowed Revie to drop deeper down the field , and allowed manager Les McDowall to put Revie in what eventually proved to be a pivotal role , introducing to English football the position of deep @-@ lying centre forward . This evolved into the so @-@ called " Revie Plan " , with Revie as the central figure . His role derived from the more traditional inside right position , and was based on the style of the successful Hungarian national team , and in particular <unk> <unk> , who invented the role . Revie devoted 20 pages to analysing and explaining the plan in his autobiography Soccer 's Happy Wanderer written in 1955 . 
 Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953 – 54 season , but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954 – 55 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities . The new tactic opened with a 5 – 0 defeat to Preston North End , but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside @-@ forward and the team clicked . Though the tactic was named after Revie , it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson , though Revie 's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level . City 's league title campaign fell away but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley , where they were beaten 3 – 1 by Newcastle United ; a first @-@ half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively . At the end of the season Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year . 
 McDowall fined Revie £ 27 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool , which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday . McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955 – 56 season , preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone . Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City , with Johnstone being moved to the wings . He provided the assist for Joe Hayes 's opening goal , and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager 's instructions at half @-@ time , with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3 – 1 victory ; Revie was named as Man of the Match . However the rift with his manager was not forgotten , and he was moved to right @-@ half in the 1956 – 57 campaign , leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road . 
 = = = Sunderland = = = 
 In October 1956 , Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £ 22 @,@ 000 fee . Poor results left the Black Cats facing relegation towards the end of the 1956 – 57 campaign , but a late seven @-@ game unbeaten run lifted them to safety , just one place above relegated Cardiff City . A financial scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray 's resignation . His replacement , Alan Brown , preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie . Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club 's history in the 1957 – 58 season , and Revie was dropped for the 1958 – 59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy . In September 1958 , he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club then he would have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor . 
 = = = Leeds United = = = 
 Revie returned to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £ 14 @,@ 000 fee . Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie 's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around , and appointed him as captain . Leeds avoided relegation in 1958 – 59 , but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959 – 60 campaign with the division 's worst defensive record . Revie recognised his playing days were coming to an end and relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin .

 In October 1953 he was called up to The Football League XI to face the League of Ireland XI at Maine Road , and scored a hat @-@ trick in a 9 – 1 victory .

He also scored during his second appearance on 2 April 1955 , a 7 – 2 victory over Scotland at Wembley Stadium . He made three further appearances that year , playing in defeats to France at the Stade Olympique Yves @-@ du @-@ Manoir and Wales at Ninian Park , and scoring once in a 5 – 1 win over Denmark at Idrætsparken .

He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels , and a change of kit from the traditional blue and yellow to an all @-@ white strip in the style of Real Madrid . He instilled a " family atmosphere " at Elland Road , making sure to take an interest in the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no " big egos " at the club . He showed trust in his players , leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch , even going so far as to tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable . He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats . Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions , such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites , based on his choice of strip colour . 
 Leeds struggled in the 1961 – 62 season , as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad was filled with journeymen pros ; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker , Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds . He developed a youth policy at the club , notable graduates of which would be Eddie Gray , Norman Hunter , Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney . He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but made sure he put in extra effort to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds , and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner 's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her . Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management . 
 After new investment at board level Revie was able to spend £ 25 @,@ 000 on Everton 's Scotland international Bobby Collins , who he installed as captain . Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams , forward Ian Lawson and left @-@ back Cliff Mason . He spent £ 53 @,@ 000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus , and though he proved not to be as effective as during his first spell at Leeds , Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £ 17 @,@ 000 profit within just a few months . Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962 – 63 , but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games at the end of the season proved too much for Leeds , who fell away to finish in fifth place . 
 United secure promotion as champions of the Second Division in 1963 – 64 , helped by the late signing of striker Alan Peacock from Middlesbrough for £ 53 @,@ 000 . However the overly physical approach typified by captain Collins earned Leeds a reputation as " dirty " that would shadow the club throughout Revie 's tenure as manager and continue to this day . Leeds adapted well to the First Division early in the 1964 – 65 campaign , but caused controversy in Collins 's return to Goodison Park as the game against Everton descended into a brawl and the referee ordered the players off the field after 35 minutes to prevent further violence . Leeds went on to maintain a strong title challenge , finishing second to rivals Manchester United on goal difference after failing to beat Birmingham City on the last day of the season . They also reached the final of the FA Cup , losing 2 – 1 to Liverpool at Wembley after extra @-@ time . 
 Revie felt he did not have to strengthen his squad for the 1965 – 66 campaign , and made no new signings . With Leeds in the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup he showed his gamesmanship , sending his team out against Italian club Torino wearing unfamiliar numbers in an attempt to confuse the Italian club 's tight man @-@ marking system . However Collins had his leg broken by Torino 's Fabrizio Poletti , meaning Revie had to partner Giles and Bremner in central midfield and sign Huddersfield Town winger Michael O 'Grady for £ 30 @,@ 000 . Although Collins would be missed the partnership of Giles and Bremner would prove highly effective . Leeds again finished second in the league , trailing Liverpool by six points . They reached the semi @-@ finals of the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup , losing on aggregate to Spanish side Real Zaragoza despite Revie ordering the fire brigade to flood the pitch before the replay at Elland Road . 
 Leeds struggled at the start of the 1966 – 67 season , though despite winning just three of their opening eleven games they went on to finish in fourth place . They reached the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup , losing 1 – 0 to Chelsea at Villa Park . They reached the final of the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup against Yugoslavian side <unk> Dinamo Zagreb , but were unable to scout the opposition due to Syd Owen having his flight cancelled on him ; Leeds lost 2 – 0 on aggregate and Revie was criticised for his negative tactics . 
 With his team coming close but failing to land a trophy he brought in a gypsy to lift a curse he believed had been placed on Elland Road so that there would be no bad luck for the 1967 – 68 season . A more practical measure he took to increase United 's fortunes was to nearly double the club 's record transfer to buy Sheffield United centre @-@ forward Mick Jones for £ 100 @,@ 000 , who would replace the frequently injured Peacock as the main striker . Soon after the purchase Leeds recorded a 7 – 0 victory over Chelsea , though ironically Jones was not on the score @-@ sheet . Revie 's first trophy would be the League Cup , as they eliminated Luton Town , Bury , Sunderland , Stoke City and Derby County to reach the final against Arsenal ; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of what was a dour and tense final as Revie told his players to " shut up shop " and defend their 1 – 0 lead . This success did not immediately translate into league and FA Cup success however , as they finished in fourth place and were beaten in the FA Cup semi @-@ finals by Everton . They instead reached a second successive Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup final , beating CA Spora Luxembourg ( Luxembourg ) , FK Partizan ( Yugoslavia ) , Hibernian ( Scotland ) , Rangers ( Scotland ) , and Dundee ( Scotland ) to reach the final against Hungarian club Ferencvárosi . Leeds won the first leg 1 – 0 , and a month later defended their lead with a 0 – 0 draw in Budapest , by which time Jimmy Greenhoff , a substitute in the first leg , had been sold to Birmingham City . 
 Having found success in both domestic and European cup competitions , Revie took the decision to focus exclusively on the league for the 1968 – 69 campaign . They went the rest of the season unbeaten in the league following a 5 – 1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October , and secured the title with a 0 – 0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield ; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to applaud the Liverpool supporters , who in turn applauded the Leeds team . His team set a number of records : most points ( 67 ) , most wins ( 27 ) , fewest defeats ( 2 ) , and most home points ( 39 ) ; a still @-@ unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season . 
 Revie strengthened his front line by breaking the British transfer record with a £ 165 @,@ 000 purchase of Allan Clarke from Leicester City , who would partner Mick Jones up front . This allowed him to sell O 'Grady to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £ 80 @,@ 000 and move Lorimer to a more attacking role . He targeted the treble in 1969 – 70 and came close to achieving his aim only to fail on all three fronts in a congested close season , finishing second in the league to Everton , losing the 1970 FA Cup Final to Chelsea ( after a replay ) , and exiting the European Cup with a semi @-@ final defeat to Celtic in front of a competition record crowd of 136 @,@ 505 at Hampden Park . 
 Rejecting a £ 100 @,@ 000 four @-@ year contract offer to manage Birmingham City , Revie instead elected to remain at Leeds and stick with the same squad for the 1970 – 71 campaign . Leeds and Arsenal soon pulled away from the rest of the pack , though it would be the Gunners who would claim the league title , finishing one point ahead of Leeds after the latter lost to West Bromwich Albion following a controversial offside goal in front of the Match of the Day television cameras late in the season . United were embarrassed in the FA Cup , being knocked out by Fourth Division side Colchester United in a famous " giant @-@ killing " . Leeds again found success in the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup though , beating Sarpsborg FK ( Norway ) , Dynamo Dresden ( East Germany ) , AC Sparta Prague ( Czechoslovakia ) , Vitória ( Portugal ) and Liverpool to reach the final against Juventus . They drew 2 – 2 at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino before claiming the trophy on away goals after a 1 – 1 draw at Elland Road . 
 The previous season 's defeat to West Bromwich Albion led to Revie criticising referee Ray Tinkler . As punishment , Leeds were forced to play their first four home games of the 1971 – 72 season at a neutral venue ; they played at Huddersfield 's Leeds Road and boasted four wins and two draws from the opening seven matches . Leeds played good football , particularly winning praise for their 7 – 0 and 6 – 1 wins over Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively , but again could only finish as runners @-@ up after a late collapse and final day defeat at Wolves , allowing Derby County to claim the title by a single point . Revie had attempted to strengthen his squad before the final run @-@ in with a £ 177 @,@ 000 bid for Asa Hartford , but the deal was cancelled by the medical team who spotted a heart defect in the attacker 's medical records . United reached the 1972 FA Cup Final after beating Bristol Rovers , Liverpool , Cardiff City , Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City , and lifted the trophy after a 1 – 0 victory over Arsenal in the final . 
 Looking for a successor to Jack Charlton , early in the 1972 – 73 season he signed Gordon McQueen from St Mirren for £ 30 @,@ 000 . He also spent £ 100 @,@ 000 on defender Trevor Cherry and £ 35 @,@ 000 on centre @-@ half Roy Ellam , both from Huddersfield Town , and started playing young Scottish forward Joe Jordan more regularly . Leeds again came close to a Treble , but their league title campaign tailed off and they finished third , some seven points behind champions Liverpool . They did reach the 1973 FA Cup Final to face Second Division Sunderland , but despite manager turned pundit Brian Clough 's remark that " there is no way Sunderland can beat Leeds " , United lost 1 – 0 . Leeds also reached the final of the European Cup Winners ' Cup against Italian club A.C. Milan at the <unk> Stadium , where they were beaten 1 – 0 following some controversial refereeing from Christos Michas which eventually saw Norman Hunter sent @-@ off after he reacted badly to being consistently fouled by pushing Gianni Rivera to the ground . In 2009 , Yorkshire and the Humber MEP Richard Corbett unsuccessfully petitioned the European Parliament to reverse the result of the match over allegations that Michas accepted a bribe from the Italian side . 
 Revie was offered a five @-@ year £ 100 @,@ 000 contract ( plus £ 50 @,@ 000 signing @-@ on fee ) by Everton in the summer , but remained with Leeds after the move broke down due to a new law introduced in Parliament that prevented wage rises to curb inflation . He chose to continue with largely the same line @-@ up for the 1973 – 74 season . He told his squad that the aim for the season would be to go unbeaten throughout the campaign . Though Leeds failed to achieve this as they lost three successive games in February / March , they did secure the title with a five @-@ point lead over Liverpool . Completely focused on the league , and finally accepting that he was asking too much of his players to try and win every competition he played weakened teams to allow an early exit from the UEFA Cup . He chose to take the job of England national football team manager ahead of leading a European Cup challenge at Leeds and breaking up the ageing team he had stuck with for many years , and though he was well loved at the club he was not popular with the Leeds boardroom members , who appointed Brian Clough , a fierce critic of Revie as his successor . Despite lasting just 44 days in the job , Clough spent more in transfer fees than Revie had in his 13 years at the club . 
 = = = England = = = 
 In July 1974 , Revie accepted the offer of the England manager 's job , succeeding Alf Ramsey and caretaker @-@ manager Joe Mercer . The Football Association , particularly Ted Croker , were impressed with Revie 's personality and ideas . He was a popular appointment with the press and supporters , noted journalist Brian Glanville wrote that " Revie was the obvious choice " . Revie attempted to build a relationship with the media , and also invited 81 prospective and established England players to a meeting in Manchester to make everyone feel included , where he announced that he would establish extra pay for international players as well as bonus payments for wins and draws . He held a meeting with Alan Hardaker , chairman of the Football League , but Hardaker had long resented Revie and was very reluctant to accept his proposal to rearrange league fixtures to benefit the England team . He also had difficult relationships with figures within the FA , most notoriously with chairman Sir Harold <unk> Thompson , who allegedly attempted to influence Revie 's team selections and undermine him publicly . As well as this he found difficulty in his attempts to introduce the Leeds traditions into the England camp , such as carpet bowls and bingo , which were met with resentment and disdain by some England internationals . Colin Todd stated that Revie was ill @-@ suited to the England job , with his strengths lying in the day @-@ to @-@ day contact found only in club management rather than the politics and committee meetings of international management . 
 For UEFA Euro 1976 , England were drawn in a tough qualification group including Czechoslovakia , Portugal and Cyprus , with only the winner progressing to the finals . England began the campaign well with a 3 – 0 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley , Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals . However a 0 – 0 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback , despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5 – 0 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2 – 0 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany . Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus , and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal . Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland , a 5 – 1 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974 – 75 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games . However , despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2 – 1 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics . A 1 – 1 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus . Czechoslovakia then went on to win the whole tournament . Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group , particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely , his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson , and his willingness to play players out of position also drew criticism . 
 With England unseeded , Revie was handed another difficult task in qualifying for the 1978 World Cup , their opponents being Italy , Finland and Luxembourg , with only the winner progressing to the finals . Just before the campaign began England suffered a <unk> defeat in Scotland to finish second in the 1975 – 76 British Home Championship . England made heavy work of both Finland and Luxembourg , winning 4 – 1 away and 2 – 1 at home against the Finns and 5 – 0 at home and 2 – 0 away against the Luxembourgers . The failure to inflict heavier defeats on these sides was ultimately the reason why Italy qualified for the finals on goal difference alone . England fell to a 2 – 0 defeat in Rome where Revie was criticised for his previously untested back four selection of Emlyn Hughes , Dave Clement , Roy McFarland , and Mick Mills ; he also played Trevor Brooking out of position and surprised many by selecting Stan Bowles ahead of Stuart Pearson . Sensing that he was disliked by FA chairman Sir Harold Thompson , and with further criticism coming his way after England could only finish third in the 1976 – 77 British Home Championship , Revie began to look for a way out . He missed a friendly with Brazil in Rio de Janeiro for what he claimed was a scouting assignment on the Italians , when in fact he had travelled to Dubai for contract negotiations with the United Arab Emirates . Revie asked for his contract with England to be cancelled , which the FA refused to do and the FA offered Revie their full support despite having already approached Bobby Robson to replace Revie . The game with Brazil ended in a 0 – 0 draw , and their tour of South America concluded with draws with Argentina and Uruguay . On 12 July 1977 , Revie revealed in an exclusive to the Daily Mail that he was quitting the England job to become manager of the UAE . The FA suspended Revie from football for ten years on a charge of bringing the game into disrepute ; Revie contested his suspension in a lawsuit against the FA , and the court overturned the suspension after ruling that the FA had overreached its powers . 
 " I sat down with my wife , Elsie , one night and we agreed that the England job no longer worth the aggravation . It was bringing too much heartache to those nearest to us . Nearly everyone in the country wants me out . So , I am giving them what they want . I know people will accuse me of running away , and it does sicken me that I cannot finish the job by taking England to the World Cup finals in Argentina next year , but the situation has become impossible . " 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 His contract at the United Arab Emirates ensured him a £ 340 @,@ 000 four @-@ year contract , though caused irreparable damage to his reputation in England . Selling the story to the Daily Mail also earned him £ 20 @,@ 000 , but only furthered the criticism that he was a " mercenary " . UAE finished sixth in the seven team 1979 Gulf Cup of Nations in Iraq , but it was his work in helping to improve the footballing facilities in the country in the long @-@ term that were more important , which helped the UAE qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup . He left the UAE coaching role in May 1980 as the UAE searched for an Arabic speaking manager . He returned to club management with Al @-@ Nasr of the UAE Arabian Gulf League , but was sacked in 1983 with the club sitting third in the league . The next year he had a brief stint with Egyptian Premier League club Al @-@ Ahly of Cairo , but did not settle in Egypt and returned home to England . He was approached to replace Alan Mullery as Queens Park Rangers manager by chairman Jim Gregory , but the deal was not completed and Revie never worked in football again . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Revie married Elsie , the niece of Leicester City manager Johnny Duncan , on 17 October 1949 and they had a son Duncan and daughter Kim . Elsie died of cancer on 28 March 2005 at the age of 77 . 
 He published an autobiography , Soccer 's Happy Wanderer , in 1955 . He was awarded with an OBE for his services to football . Just before departing from Leeds for the England job , Revie was a special guest on the TV guest show This Is Your Life . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 In the spring of 1986 Revie moved to Kinross , Scotland where he intended to retire , but he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in May 1987 . Revie publicly announced his illness in August of that year , and made his final public appearance on 11 May 1988 at Elland Road in a wheelchair , at a charity football match held to raise money into research into Motor Neurone Disease . He died in Murrayfield Hospital in Edinburgh on 26 May 1989 , aged 61 , and was cremated four days later at Warriston Crematorium in Edinburgh . Though his funeral was well attended by representatives of Leeds United , The Football Association did not send any officials to the funeral . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The family atmosphere Revie instilled at Elland Road ensured that many Leeds United players remained firm friends and fiercely loyal to Revie long after their playing days had ended ; his players also generally avoided financial , addiction or family problems , enjoying largely stable lives even after retirement . In May 2012 , a statue of Revie was unveiled outside Elland Road . The North Stand of Elland Road is formally known as the Revie Stand . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 = = = = " Dirty Leeds " = = = = 
 The combative nature of his teams earned United the moniker of " dirty Leeds " , as key player Eddie Gray admitted that " it was brutal stuff and , definitely win @-@ at @-@ all @-@ costs " . Alan Peacock said that one of the attractions for joining Leeds was that he would not have to play against them and " then they won 't be kicking me " . In 1963 Leeds were labelled by the Football Association 's own FA News as " the dirtiest [ team ] in the Football League . On more than one occasion referees had to order Leeds players off the pitch for a break mid @-@ match to break up mass brawls . His teams were also notorious for dour play and playing to defend 1 – 0 leads , though he did allow a more attacking style later in his career . Nevertheless the unpopularity and poor reputation stuck with Leeds throughout Revie 's time as manager and even was in evidence after his death . 
 One of Revie 's most notable critics was Brian Clough , who initially gave some degree of praise to Leeds following the 1969 – 70 season , commenting that ’ they have made the season ’ . However Clough ’ s attitude soon changed as the competition between their clubs intensified and over the course of subsequent seasons he would use his newspaper columns to attack Revie and Leeds , particularly in August 1973 in which he branded the Leeds players " cheats " and called for the club to be relegated to the Second Division on disciplinary grounds , though Clough would surprisingly succeed Revie as Leeds manager in an ill @-@ fated tenure that lasted only 44 days . In 2009 , Revie was portrayed by Colm Meaney in the film The Damned United , which focused on Clough 's ill @-@ fated 44 @-@ day reign as manager of Leeds United in 1974 following Revie 's departure for the England job . 
 " When people talk about Leeds being dirty , they forget that was the culture back then . You had to look after yourself . There were so many players around who would now be suspended all season long . We just made sure nobody ever managed to bully us . " 
 = = = = Allegations of financial misconduct = = = = 
 Revie 's reputation suffered in the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation . Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972 . The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake 's claims that Revie 's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe . Bremner sued for libel and won £ 100 @,@ 000 libel damages , along with legal costs , after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court . Wolves player Derek Dougan , who had scored against Leeds in the match in question , testified that he had heard no mention of the alleged bribes . 
 Additionally Bob Stokoe would later claim that while managing Bury in 1962 , Revie had offered him a bribe of £ 500 to " go easy " on his Leeds side who were at the time struggling against relegation to the Third Division and that he had become enraged when Revie responded to his refusal to accept the bribe by asking " in that case , may I speak to your players ? " . Alan Ball also alleged that Revie made an illegal approach for him , and despite pocketing the £ 300 bribe he instead signed for Everton instead of Leeds ; both men were charged with bringing the game into disrepute . The allegations of corruption earned him the nickname of " Don <unk> " . Though Mr Justice Cantley lifted the FA 's ten @-@ year ban on Revie , during his conclusion of the case the judge said that Revie " lacked candour " , was " greedy " and " prickly " , focused on " imagined wrongs " and his resignation as England manager showed a " sensational , outrageous example of disloyalty , breach of trust , discourtesy and selfishness " .

 = Scotty Davidson = 
 Allan McLean " Scotty " Davidson ( March 6 , 1892 – June 16 , 1915 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player and soldier . He was considered one of the top wingers of the game 's early years . He led his Kingston junior team to two Ontario Hockey Association championships in 1910 and 1911 , when he moved to Calgary for the 1911 – 12 season and led the Calgary Athletics senior team to the Alberta provincial championship . Davidson turned professional with the Toronto Blueshirts in 1912 and was among the National Hockey Association 's leading scorers the following two seasons . He captained Toronto to the Stanley Cup championship in 1914 . 
 Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Davidson volunteered with the Canadian Expeditionary Force ; he was the first professional hockey player to do so . He was killed in action while fighting in Belgium in 1915 . Hailed as a hero by his peers , Davidson was said to have been killed after refusing to retreat during a battle . He is commemorated on the Canadian National Vimy Memorial . Davidson was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950 . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Davidson was born and raised in Kingston , Ontario , and learned the game through his coach , James T. Sutherland . He first played in the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) senior division in 1908 – 09 where , as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , he led the league with eight goals in four games . He joined the Kingston Frontenacs of the OHA junior division in 1909 where he emerged as a top player in the league . He was known for his shooting ability and considered a strong <unk> . Davidson served as team captain , and led the Frontenacs to OHA junior titles in 1910 and 1911 . He was a standout in the 1911 championship , leading his team back from a 3 – 0 deficit to win the game . 
 After leaving the junior game , Davidson moved to Alberta where he played senior hockey for the Calgary Athletics . He scored three goals in four regular season games and added another three goals in three playoff games . The Athletics won the provincial championship , but were defeated by the Winnipeg Victorias for the Allan Cup . He returned to Ontario for the 1912 – 13 season when he was signed by the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . Davidson made his professional debut with Toronto in their season @-@ opening loss to the Montreal Canadiens , and finished his rookie season with 19 goals in 20 games . 
 The Blueshirts named him team captain for the 1913 – 14 season , and he responded by finishing in the top ten in NHA goals with 23 and second in assists with 13 . Tied atop the standings with the Montreal Canadiens after the regular season , the Blueshirts faced the Canadiens in a two @-@ game , total @-@ goal series for both the O 'Brien Cup , the NHA championship , and control of the Stanley Cup , the Canadian championship . Following a 2 – 0 loss at Montreal , Davidson played a key role in Toronto 's 6 – 0 victory in the return match . He scored two goals , including Toronto 's third which clinched the championship . The title represented the first time a team from Toronto won the Stanley Cup . 
 The Blueshirts then immediately faced the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association held in March 1914 . It was considered an unofficial challenge for the Stanley Cup as the Aristocrats failed to arrange the series with the Cup 's trustees . Toronto emerged with three consecutive victories to win the series that was on occasion violent – Davidson was involved in a fight late in the third game that touched off a melee involving most players for both teams . 
 = = Military career = = 
 When World War I broke out in 1914 , Davidson was the first professional hockey player to volunteer with the Canadian Expeditionary Force . He served with the Eastern Ontario Regiment of the Canadian Infantry , and attained the rank of lance @-@ corporal . Davidson earned the respect of his fellow soldiers who wrote of his bravery and fearlessness . He once rescued a wounded officer while fighting in France , and one account of his death asserts that he was shot in the back and killed while attempting to carry an injured soldier to safety . Another held that he died while on a bombing raid after refusing to retreat until he had spent his ammunition . He was said to have used his final grenade to kill a German officer before being killed himself . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 By the time he left hockey to fight in the war , Davidson was considered one of the top all @-@ around players in the NHA . Noted for his skating ability , it was said that he could skate faster backwards than most players could forwards . In 1925 , Maclean 's named him the top right wing when it determined its all @-@ star team of the game 's greatest players , an opinion shared by his former junior coach , who stated that he was " as good as any player to ever patrol a wing position " . 
 Davidson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950 , and is honoured by the International Hockey Hall of Fame . The Kingston Frontenacs erected a monument to his memory shortly after his death . He was 23 years old when he was killed , and his name is commemorated on the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France .

 = Russian gay propaganda law = 
 The Russian federal law " for the Purpose of Protecting Children from Information Advocating for a Denial of Traditional Family Values " , also known in English @-@ language media as the gay propaganda law and the anti @-@ gay law , is a bill that was unanimously approved by the State Duma on 11 June 2013 ( with just one MP abstaining — Ilya Ponomarev ) , and was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on 30 June 2013 . 
 The Russian government 's stated purpose for the law is to protect children from being exposed to content recognizing homosexuality as being a norm in society , under the argument that it contradicts traditional family values . The statute amended the country 's child protection law and the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses , to make the distribution of " propaganda of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships " among minors , an offense punishable by fines . This definition includes materials that " raises interest in " such relationships , cause minors to " form non @-@ traditional sexual predispositions " , or " [ present ] distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non @-@ traditional sexual relationships . " Businesses and organizations can also be forced to temporarily cease operations if convicted under the law , and foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported , or fined up to 5 @,@ 000 rubles and deported . 
 Supported by a number of far right @-@ wing groups and a majority of Russians surveyed , the passing of the law was met with criticism , primarily from the democratic world , the international community and global media . The statute was criticized for its broad and ambiguous wording ( including the aforementioned " raises interest in " and " among minors " ) , which many critics characterized as being an effective ban on publicly promoting the rights and culture of the LGBT community . The law was also criticized for leading to an increase and justification of homophobic violence , while the implications of the laws in relation to the then @-@ upcoming Winter Olympics being hosted by Sochi were also cause for concern , as the Olympic Charter contains language explicitly barring various forms of discrimination . 
 However , some felt that critics had overreacted to the law , noting that unlike some countries with stricter anti @-@ LGBT legislation , it did not criminalize same @-@ sex relationships , sexual activity , or being associated with pro @-@ LGBT organizations . 
 = = Background = = 
 Despite the fact that the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg have been well known for their thriving LGBT communities , there has been growing opposition towards gay rights among politicians since 2006 . The city of Moscow has actively refused to authorize gay pride parades , and former Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov supported the city 's refusal to authorize the first two Moscow Pride events , describing them as " satanic " and blaming western groups for spreading " this kind of enlightenment " in the country . Fair Russia member of parliament Alexander Chuev was also opposed to gay rights and attempted to introduce a similar " propaganda " law in 2007 . In response , prominent LGBT rights activist and Moscow Pride founder Nikolay Alexeyev disclosed on the television talk show К <unk> ! that Chuev had been publicly involved in same @-@ sex relationships prior to his time in office . 
 In 2010 , Russia was fined by the European Court of Human Rights under allegations by Alexeyev that cities were discriminating against gays by refusing to approve pride parades . Although claiming a risk of violence , the court interpreted the decisions as being in support of groups which oppose such demonstrations . In March 2012 , a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics , ruling that it would " undermine the security of Russian society " , and that it contradicted with public morality and policies " in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection . " In August 2012 , Moscow upheld a ruling blocking Nikolay Alexeyev 's requests for 100 years ' worth of permission to hold Moscow Pride annually , citing the possibility of public disorder . 
 The bill " On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development " introduced laws which prohibited the distribution of " harmful " material among minors . This includes content which " may elicit fear , horror , or panic in children " among minors , pornography , along with materials which glorify violence , unlawful activities , substance abuse , or self @-@ harm . An amendment to the law passed in 2012 instituted a mandatory content rating system for material distributed through an " information and telecommunication network " ( covering television and the internet ) , and established a blacklist for censoring websites which contain child pornography or content glorifying drug abuse and suicide . 
 The 2013 amendment , which added " propaganda of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships " as a class of harmful content under the law was , according to the Government of Russia , intended to protect children from being exposed to content that portrays homosexuality as being a " behavioural norm " . Emphasis was placed upon a goal to protect " traditional " family values ; bill author Yelena <unk> ( the chair of the Duma 's Committee on Family , Women , and Children , who has been described by some as a " moral crusader " ) , argued that " traditional " relations between a man and a woman required special protection under Russian law . The amendment also expanded upon similar laws enacted by several Russian regions , including Ryazan , Arkhangelsk ( who repealed its law shortly after the passing of the federal version ) , and Saint Petersburg . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Article 1 of the bill amended On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development with a provision classifying " propaganda of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships " as a class of materials that must not be distributed among minors . The term is defined as materials that are " [ aimed ] at causing minors to form non @-@ traditional sexual predispositions , notions of attractiveness of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships , distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non @-@ traditional sexual relationships , or imposing information about non @-@ traditional sexual relationships which raises interest in such relationships insofar as these acts do not amount to a criminal offence . " Article 2 makes similar amendments to " On basic guarantees for the rights of the child in the Russian Federation " , commanding the government to protect children from such material . 
 Article 3 of the bill amended the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with Article 6 @.@ 21 , which prescribes penalties for violations of the propaganda ban : Russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5 @,@ 000 rubles , and public officials can receive fines of up to 50 @,@ 000 rubles . Organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days . Foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported , or fined up to 5 @,@ 000 rubles and deported . The fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet .

 According to a survey conducted in June 2013 by the All @-@ Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion ( also known as VTsIOM ) , at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law . Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law , with Larry Jacobs , manager of the World Congress of Families , supporting its aim to " prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health . " President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then @-@ proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that " I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities ' rights . They 're people , just like everyone else , and they enjoy full rights and freedoms " . He went on to say that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it . As he put it , " Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia ? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms .... The same is true for sexual minorities : I can hardly imagine same @-@ sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya . Can you imagine it ? It would have resulted in human casualties . " Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia 's low birth rate , as same @-@ sex relationships do not produce children . In August 2013 , Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law , equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction . He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was " invented " by the Western media . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The passing of the law was met with major international backlash , especially from the Western world , as critics considered it an attempt to effectively ban the promotion of LGBT rights and culture in the country . Article 19 disputed the claimed intent of the law , and felt that many of the terms used within were too ambiguous , such as the aforementioned " non @-@ traditional sexual relationships " , and " raises interest in " . The organization argued that it " feasibly could apply to any information regarding sexual orientation or gender identity that does not fit with what the State considers as in @-@ line with ' tradition ' . " The use of the term " among minors " was also criticized , as it was unclear whether it refers to being in the presence of minors , or any place where minors could be present , arguing that " predicting the presence of children in any space , on @-@ line or off @-@ line , is quite impossible and is a variable that the proponent of any expression will rarely be in absolute control of . " 
 LGBT rights activists , human rights activists , and other critics stated that the broad and vague wording of the law , which was characterized as a ban on " gay propaganda " by the media , made it a crime to publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights , hold pride parades or similar demonstrations , state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships , or according to Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) president Chad Griffin , even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same @-@ sex partner in public . The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro @-@ LGBT message . 
 The legislation was also alleged to lead to an increase in homophobic violence in Russia by groups opposed to the LGBT rights movement ; Russian LGBT Network chairman Igor <unk> argued that the law " [ has ] essentially legalised violence against LGBT people , because these groups of hooligans justify their actions with these laws , " supported by their belief that gays and lesbians are " not valued as a social group " by the federal government . Reports surfaced of activity by groups such as ' Occupy <unk> ' and ' Parents of Russia ' , who lured alleged " paedophiles " into " dates " where they were tortured and humiliated . In August 2013 , it was reported that a gay teenager was kidnapped , tortured , and killed by a group of Russian Neo @-@ Nazis . Violence also increased during pro @-@ gay demonstrations ; on 29 July 2013 , a gay pride demonstration at Saint Petersburg 's Field of Mars resulted in a violent clash between activists , protesters , and police . 
 In January 2014 , a letter , co @-@ written by chemist Sir Harry Kroto and actor Sir Ian McKellen and co @-@ signed by 27 Nobel laureates from the fields of science and the arts , was sent to <unk> Putin urging him to repeal the propaganda law as it " inhibits the freedom of local and foreign LGBT communities . " In February 2014 , the activist group Queer Nation announced a planned protest in New York City outside the Russian consulate on 6 February 2014 , timed to coincide with the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics . The same day , gay rights group All Out similarly coordinated worldwide protests in London , New York City , Paris , and Rio de Janeiro . On 8 February 2014 , a flash mob was held in Cambridge , England featuring same @-@ sex couples embracing and hugging , as part of a video project known as " From Russia With Love " . 
 Writing for The Guardian , Marc Bennetts argued that criticism of the law by foreign outlets had ties to anti @-@ Russian sentiment ; describing their response as being " both hysterical and hypocritical " , he acknowledged that countries had been inconsistent on their treatment of other countries for their stances on LGBT rights . He noted that Russia 's laws did not ban LGBT relationships as a whole , and did not go as far as those in other countries , such as India — which had recently reinstated a ban on same @-@ sex sexual activity , and Nigeria , which criminalized same @-@ sex marriage with sentences of up to 14 years ' imprisonment , and membership in pro @-@ gay groups with up to 10 years ' imprisonment . In conclusion , he stated that " in reality , there is little the west can do to influence Russia , on gay rights or anything else . But to stand even a chance , criticism needs to be measured , accurate and , above all , consistent . There are enough reasons to disapprove of Putin 's authoritarian regime without resorting to hyperbole and falsehoods . "

 A number of protests were held against the law , both locally and internationally . Activists demonstrated outside New York City 's Lincoln Center at the opening night of the Metropolitan Opera on 23 September 2013 , which was set to feature Tchaikovsky 's opera Eugene Onegin . The protests targeted Tchaikovsky 's own homosexuality , and the involvement of two Russians in the production ; soprano Anna Netrebko and conductor Valery Gergiev , as they were identified as vocal supporters of Putin 's government . 
 On 12 October 2013 , the day following National Coming Out Day , a protest organized by at least 15 activists was held in Saint Petersburg . The protest site was occupied by a large number of demonstrators , some of whom were dressed as Russian Orthodox priests and Cossacks . In total , 67 protestors were arrested for creating a public disturbance . 
 Activists also called for a boycott of <unk> vodka , who had prominently branded itself as a Russian vodka ( going as far as to dub itself " [ the ] Mother of All <unk> from The Motherland of Vodka " in an ad campaign ) . However , its Luxembourg @-@ based parent company , <unk> , responded to the boycott effort , noting that the company was not technically Russian , did not support the government 's opinion on homosexuality , and described itself as a " fervent supporter and friend " of LGBT people .

 The first arrest made under the propaganda law occurred just hours after it was passed : 24 @-@ year @-@ old activist Dmitry Isakov was arrested in Kazan for publicly holding a sign reading " Freedom to the Gays and Lesbians of Russia . Down With Fascists and <unk> " , and ultimately fined 4 @,@ 000 rubles ( US $ 115 ) . Isakov had performed a similar protest in the same location the previous day as a " test " run , but was later caught in an altercation with police officers who targeted his pro @-@ gay activism , and arrested him for swearing . He would be released without charge , but pledged to return there the next day to show that he would " not be cowed by such pressure . " Isakov also claimed that he had been fired from his job at a bank as a result of the conviction . 
 In December 2013 , Nikolay Alexeyev and Yaroslav Yevtushenko were fined 4 @,@ 000 rubles ( US $ 115 ) for picketing outside a children 's library in Arkhangelsk with banners reading , " Gays aren 't made , they 're born ! " Their appeal was denied . Alexeyev later criticized Western media outlets for its " biased " coverage of his conviction . 
 In January 2014 , Alexander <unk> , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the Khabarovsk newspaper <unk> <unk> , was fined 50 @,@ 000 rubles ( US $ 1 @,@ 400 ) for publishing a news story discussing the teacher Alexander <unk> , who had been fired for self @-@ admittedly holding " rainbow flash mobs " in Khabarovsk with his students , and was subsequently attacked by right @-@ wing extremist groups because of his sexuality . The fine centred around a quote in the article by the teacher , who stated that his very existence was " effective proof that homosexuality is normal . " 
 Elena Klimova has been charged under the law multiple times for operating Children @-@ 404 — an online support group for LGBT youth on the social networking services <unk> and Facebook . The first of these charges was overturned in February 2014 , after a court ruled in consultation with a mental health professional that the group " helps teenagers exploring their sexuality to deal with difficult emotional issues and other problems that they may encounter " , and that these activities did not constitute " propaganda of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships " as defined under the law . In January 2015 , Klimova was sent to court for the same charges . They were overturned on appeal , only for the same court to convict <unk> and issue a fine of 50 @,@ 000 rubles in July 2015 , pending an appeal . 
 In May 2014 , it was revealed that in accordance with the propaganda law , the computer game The Sims 4 — a new instalment in a life simulation game franchise that has historically allowed characters to participate in same @-@ sex relationships , had been given a " 18 + " rating , allowing its sale to adults only . In contrast , the pan @-@ European ratings board PEGI has historically given The Sims games a " 12 " rating , while the German rating board USK had given The Sims 3 an even lower " 6 + " rating . 
 In November 2014 , one day after current Apple Inc . CEO Tim Cook publicly announced that he was proud of being gay , it was reported that an iPhone @-@ shaped memorial honoring Apple founder Steve Jobs had been removed from a Saint Petersburg university campus by its installer , the West European Financial Union [ <unk> ] , which issued a press release citing the law and noting that the memorial was in an area frequented by minors . However , the reports were later found to be a hoax , and the monument had actually been removed for maintenance . In September 2015 , Apple became the subject of an investigation by officials in Kirov for implementing emoji on its operating systems which depict same @-@ sex relationships , over whether they may constitute a promotion of non @-@ traditional sexual relationships to minors . <unk> later ruled that by themselves , emoji depicting same @-@ sex couples did not constitute a violation of the propaganda law , as whether they have a positive or negative connotation depends on their actual context and usage .

 The 2013 World Championships in Athletics , held at Moscow 's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013 , were overshadowed by comments and protests over the law by athletes . After winning a silver medal at the event , U.S. runner Nick <unk> stated that " whether you 're gay , straight , black , white , we all deserve the same rights . If there 's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it , I will , shy of getting arrested . " Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa <unk> painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest . However , Tregaro was forced to re @-@ paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated the rules of the IAAF . In response , she re @-@ painted them red as a symbol of love . Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro 's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country , stating in a press conference that " we have our law which everyone has to respect . When we go to different countries , we try to follow their rules . We are not trying to set our rules over there . We are just trying to be respectful . " After Isinbaeva 's remarks were characterized as being homophobic , she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media , and that she was against the discrimination of gays . 
 The implications of the law on Russia 's hosting of two major international sporting events ; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi ( where seven LGBT athletes , all female , were expected to compete ) and the 2018 FIFA World Cup , were called into question . In the case of the World Cup , FIFA had recently established an anti @-@ discrimination task force , and was also facing criticism for awarding the 2022 World Cup to the country of Qatar , where homosexuality is illegal ; in August 2013 , FIFA requested information from the Russian government on the law and its potential effects on the association football tournament . In the case of the Winter Olympics , critics considered the law to be inconsistent with the Olympic Charter , which states that " [ discrimination ] on grounds of race , religion , politics , gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement . " In August 2013 , the International Olympic Committee " received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games " , and also received word that the government would abide by the Olympic Charter . The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter , which forbids political protest , against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community at the Games . Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games , but warned LGBT attendees that they would still be subject to the law . 
 Athletes and supporters used the Olympics as leverage for further campaigns against the propaganda law . A number of athletes came out as lesbian , gay , or bisexual to spread awareness of the situation in Russia , including Australian snowboarder Belle Brockhoff , Canadian speed skater Anastasia <unk> , gold medal figure skater Brian Boitano , and Finnish swimmer Ari @-@ Pekka <unk> . There were also calls to boycott the Games , drawing comparisons to the Summer Olympics of 1980 in Moscow , the last time the Olympics were held on what is now Russian soil . A campaign known as Principle 6 was established in collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes , the organizations All Out and Athlete Ally , and clothing maker American Apparel , selling merchandise ( such as clothing ) with a quotation from the Olympic Charter to support pro @-@ LGBT organizations . Toronto advertising copywriter Brahm Finkelstein also began to market a rainbow @-@ coloured <unk> doll set known as " Pride Dolls " , designed by Italian artist Danilo Santino , to benefit the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association , organizers of the World <unk> . 
 Action was leveraged directly against Olympic sponsors and partners as well ; in late @-@ August 2013 , the Human Rights Campaign sent letters to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies , urging them to show opposition towards anti @-@ LGBT laws , denounce homophobic violence , ask the IOC to obtain written commitments for the safety of LGBT athletes and attendees , and oppose future Olympic bids from countries that outlaw support for LGBT equality . In February 2014 , prior to the games , a group of 40 human rights organizations ( including Athlete Ally , Freedom House , Human Rights Campaign , Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others ) also sent a joint letter to the Worldwide Olympic Partners , urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter , and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries . On 3 February 2014 , USOC sponsor AT & T issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games , becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws . Several major non @-@ sponsors also made pro @-@ LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games ; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic @-@ themed logo in the colours of the rainbow flag on its home page worldwide , while Channel 4 ( who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics ) adopted a rainbow @-@ coloured logo and broadcast a " celebratory " , pro @-@ LGBT advert entitled " Gay Mountain " on 7 February 2014 , alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti @-@ homophobia activist Ben Cohen . As part of its Dispatches series , Channel 4 had also broadcast a documentary during the week of the Opening Ceremony entitled Hunted , which documented the violence and abuse against LGBT people in Russia in the wake of the law . 
 = USS Maine ( BB @-@ 10 ) = 
 USS Maine ( BB @-@ 10 ) , the lead ship of her class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the 23rd state . Maine was laid down in February 1899 at the William Cramp & Sons shipyard in Philadelphia . She was launched in July 1901 and commissioned into the fleet in December 1902 . She was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and could steam at a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Maine served in the Atlantic for the entirety of her career with the North Atlantic Fleet , which later became the Atlantic Fleet ; during the early years of her service , she was the fleet flagship , until she was replaced in 1907 . Later that year , she joined the cruise of the Great White Fleet , though her heavy coal consumption prevented her from continuing with the fleet past San Francisco . After returning to the U.S. , she served as the 3rd Squadron flagship . During America 's participation in World War I from April 1917 to November 1918 , Maine was used as a training ship . She remained in active service until May 1920 , when she was decommissioned . The ship was ultimately sold for scrap in January 1922 and broken up for scrap under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty signed that year . 
 = = Description = = 
 Maine was 393 feet 11 inches ( 120 @.@ 07 m ) long overall and had a beam of 72 ft 3 in ( 22 @.@ 02 m ) and a draft of 24 ft 4 in ( 7 @.@ 42 m ) . She displaced 12 @,@ 846 long tons ( 13 @,@ 052 t ) as designed and up to 13 @,@ 700 long tons ( 13 @,@ 900 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) and twenty @-@ four coal @-@ fired Niclausse boilers , generating a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 561 officers and enlisted men , which increased to 779 – 813 . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 40 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 Mark 6 guns , which were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried six 3 @-@ inch / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull , eight 3 @-@ pounder guns , and six 1 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Maine carried two 18 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . 
 Maine 's main armored belt was 11 inches ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 8 inches ( 203 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets had 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides . Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery . The conning tower had 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) thick sides .

 Maine was built by the William Cramp & Sons shipyard in Philadelphia ; her keel was laid down on 15 February 1899 . The ship was launched on 27 July 1901 and commissioned into the fleet on 29 December 1902 . Maine operated with the North Atlantic Fleet starting in 1903 ; over the next four years , she took part in various peacetime training exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean . During this period she also steamed to the Mediterranean . She served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans . On 16 April 1907 , Evans transferred his flag to the newly commissioned battleship Connecticut . 
 Maine 's next significant action was the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world , which started with a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Hampton Roads . On 17 December , the fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America , making stops in Port of Spain , Rio de Janeiro , Punta Arenas , and Valparaíso , among other cities . After arriving in Mexico in March 1908 , the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice . The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas , stopping in San Francisco , where Maine was detached from the rest of the fleet . The ship 's boilers had proved to be badly inefficient , requiring excessive amounts of coal to keep up with the fleet . The battleship Alabama also left the fleet , owing to a cracked cylinder head . 
 Maine and Alabama crossed the Pacific independently , via Guam and the Philippines . After steaming through the Indian Ocean , they transited the Suez Canal and cruised the Mediterranean . They crossed the Atlantic and arrived back on the east coast of the United States in October 1908 , well ahead of the rest of the Great White Fleet . Following their arrival , Maine was assigned as the flagship of the 3rd Squadron , Atlantic Fleet , and operated off the east coast for the next several months . On 14 February , Maine , the new battleships New Hampshire , Mississippi , and Idaho , two armored cruisers and two scout cruisers were organized to meet the returning Great White Fleet . Maine and the rest of the squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Conway Hillyer Arnold , steamed out into the Atlantic and rendezvoused with the Great White Fleet on 17 February . The combined fleet arrived in Hampton Roads on the 22nd , where a large naval review was held for President Theodore Roosevelt to celebrate the journey . On 31 August 1909 , the ship was temporarily decommissioned at Portsmouth , New Hampshire . She returned to service on 15 June 1911 for duty with the Atlantic Fleet . 
 On 6 April 1917 , the United States declared war on Germany , entering World War I. During the war , Maine was employed as a training ship for engine room personnel , armed guards for merchant ships , and midshipmen from the US Naval Academy . On 11 November 1918 , Germany signed the Armistice that ended the conflict . Maine participated in a naval review held in New York on 26 December to celebrate the Allied victory . At the time , most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France . Maine and her sisters were not so employed , however , owing to their short range and small size , which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations . Maine instead remained on the east coast with the Atlantic Fleet . On 15 May 1920 , she was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was reclassified as BB @-@ 10 on 17 July . She was kept laid up for a year and a half before being sold on 23 January 1922 to J.G. <unk> and W.F. Cutler of Philadelphia , to be broken up for scrap . By 17 December 1923 , she had been disarmed in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty , which mandated significant reductions in naval strength . Maine was then scrapped .

 Philip Morrison ( November 7 , 1915 – April 22 , 2005 ) was a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . He is known for his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II , and for his later work in quantum physics , nuclear physics and high energy astrophysics . 
 A graduate of Carnegie Tech , Morrison became interested in physics , which he studied at the University of California , Berkeley , under the supervision of J. Robert Oppenheimer . He also joined the Communist Party . During World War II he joined the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago , where he worked with Eugene Wigner on the design of nuclear reactors . 
 In 1944 he moved to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico , where he worked with George Kistiakowsky on the development of explosive lenses required to detonate the implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . Morrison transported the core of the Trinity test device to the test site in the back seat of a Dodge sedan . As leader of Project Alberta 's pit crew he helped load the atomic bombs on board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . After the war ended , he traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project 's mission to assess the damage . 
 After the war he became a champion of nuclear nonproliferation . He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies . He was one of the few ex @-@ communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s , but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics . He published papers on cosmic rays , and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy . He was also known for writing popular science books and articles , and appearing in television programs . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Philip Morrison was born in Somerville , New Jersey , November 7 , 1915 , the only son of Moses Morrison and Tillie Rosenbloom . He had a younger sister , Gail . The family moved to Pittsburgh when he was two . He contracted polio when he was four , and as a result wore a <unk> on one leg , and spent his last years in a wheelchair . 
 Because of his polio , Morrison did not commence school until the third grade . On graduating from high school he entered Carnegie Tech , planning to major in electrical engineering . While there he became interested in physics . He earned his Bachelor of Science ( B.S. ) in 1936 . He then entered the University of California , Berkeley , where he earned his PhD in theoretical physics in 1940 under the supervision of J. Robert Oppenheimer , writing his thesis on " Three Problems in Atomic Electrodynamics " . 
 In 1938 , Morrison married Emily Kramer , a girl he had known in high school , and a fellow Carnegie Tech graduate . They divorced in 1961 . In 1965 he married Phylis Hagen . They remained together until Phylis died in 2002 .

 After he finished his Ph.D. Morrison took a position as an instructor at San Francisco State College . In 1941 he became an instructor at the University of Illinois . In December 1942 , with World War II raging around the globe , he was recruited by Robert F. Christy to join the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in January 1943 . There he worked with Eugene Wigner on the design of nuclear reactors . 
 Concerned about the danger from the German nuclear energy project , Morrison helped persuade the director of the Manhattan Project , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , to initiate the Alsos Mission in order to gather information on it . 
 With the work in Chicago winding down in mid @-@ 1944 , Morrison moved to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico as a group leader . His first task was to help determine how much plutonium a bomb would require . He calculated that 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) would be sufficient . He then worked with George Kistiakowsky on the explosive lenses required to detonate the implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . 
 Morrison transported the core of the Trinity test gadget to the test site in the back seat of a Dodge sedan . He was an eyewitness to the test on July 16 , 1945 , and wrote a report on it . A month later , as leader of Project Alberta 's pit crew , he helped load the atomic bombs on board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . After the war ended , Morrison and Robert Serber traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project 's mission to assess the damage .

 Morrison returned to Los Alamos , where he remained until 1946 . He turned down an offer from Ernest O. Lawrence to return to Berkeley , and instead accepted an invitation from Hans Bethe to join him at the physics faculty at Cornell University . 
 After surveying the destruction left by the use of the atom bomb in Hiroshima , Morrison became a champion of nuclear nonproliferation . He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies . He testified before Congress on the need for civilian control of nuclear energy , and participated in the Civil Rights Congress in New York and the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace in 1949 . That year , Life magazine included his image in a gallery of " America 's 50 most eminent dupes and fellow travellers " . 
 Morrison had joined the Communist Party while he was at Berkeley . The House Un @-@ American Activities Committee devoted four pages of a 1951 report to his activities , and in 1953 , he was called before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee . Theodore Paul Wright , the President of Cornell , was put under great pressure from board members and alumni to fire Morrison , but Bethe remained supportive , and Robert R. Wilson declared that Morrison had " demonstrated his patriotism by the distinguished role he played in the wartime development of the atomic bomb . " 
 Deane Malott , who became president of Cornell in 1951 , was much less sympathetic , and instructed Morrison to curtail all activities beyond his academic field . Morrison agreed to do so in 1954 . Nonetheless , he was one of the few ex @-@ communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s . 
 In 1999 , writer Jeremy Stone alleged that Morrison had been the Soviet spy Perseus , a charge that Morrison strongly and credibly rebutted . Stone accepted his rebuttal .

 Morrison co @-@ wrote a paper with Leonard I. Schiff in 1940 in which they calculated the gamma rays emitted by the process of K @-@ electron capture . Initially at Cornell after the war , Morrison continued working in nuclear physics , collaborating with Bethe on a textbook , Elementary Nuclear Physics ( 1952 ) , one of the early treatments of the relatively new field . 
 Following his political stances , Morrison 's attention began drifting towards the stars . In 1954 , he published a paper with Bruno Rossi and Stanislaw Olbert in which they explored Enrico Fermi 's theory of how cosmic rays travel through the galaxy . Morrison followed this up with a review of theories of the origins of cosmic rays in 1957 . A 1958 paper in Nuovo Cimento is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy . 
 In collaboration with Giuseppe <unk> , Morrison published a paper in 1959 proposing the potential of microwaves in the search for interstellar communications , a component of the modern SETI program . This was one of the first proposals for detecting extraterrestrial intelligence . He conceded that " The probability of success is difficult to estimate , but if we never search , the chance of success is zero . " 
 Morrison remained at Cornell until 1964 , when he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . He remained there for the remainder of his career , becoming Institute Professor in 1976 , and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986 . In 1963 , working in collaboration with a student of his , James <unk> , Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering , an important source of cosmic x @-@ rays and gamma rays . At MIT , Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi 's x @-@ ray group there , and also with Riccardo Giacconi 's group at nearby American Science and Engineering . Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration of the cosmos through its x @-@ ray and gamma ray emissions . In a 1960 paper , he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars . He returned to this in 1976 , applying his model to the radio galaxy Cygnus A.

 Morrison was known for his numerous books and television programs . He produced 68 popular science articles between 1949 and 1976 , ten in issues of Scientific American . He provided the narration and script for Powers of Ten in 1977 . With his wife , Phylis , they turned the same material into a coffee table book in 1982 . He also appeared as himself in the science documentary film Target ... Earth ? in 1980 . In 1987 , PBS aired his six part miniseries , The Ring of Truth : An Inquiry into How We Know What We Know , which he also hosted . In addition , he was a columnist and reviewer of books on science for Scientific American starting in 1965 . 
 In later life he was a critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative . He authored or co @-@ authored a number of books critical of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race , including Winding Down : The Price of Defense ( 1979 ) , The Nuclear Almanac ( 1984 ) , Reason Enough to Hope ( 1998 ) Beyond the Looking Glass ( 1993 ) .

 = Jack jumper ant = 
 The jack jumper ant ( Myrmecia pilosula ) , commonly known as the hopper ant , jumper ant or jumping jack , is a species of venomous ant native to Australia . Most commonly found in Tasmania and southeast Australia , it is a member of the genus Myrmecia , subfamily Myrmeciinae , and was formally described and named by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858 . This species is known for the ability to jump long distances . These ants are large ; workers and males are approximately the same size : 12 to 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) for workers , and 11 to 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 43 to 0 @.@ 47 in ) for males . The queen measures approximately 14 to 16 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 to 0 @.@ 63 in ) in length and is similar in appearance to workers , whereas males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles . 
 Jack jumper ants are primarily active during the day and live in open habitats , nesting in bushland , woodland and dry open forests , surrounded by gravel and sandy soil , which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas . They prey on small insects and use their <unk> stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom . Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper . The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year . Workers are gamergates , allowing them to reproduce with drones , whether or not a queen is present in the colony . The ant is a part of the Myrmecia pilosula species complex ; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes . 
 Their sting generally only causes a mild local reaction in humans ; however , it is one of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans , along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia . The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom ; the venom causes about 90 % of Australian ant allergies . In endemic areas , up to 3 % of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions ( increased heart rate , falling blood pressure , and other symptoms ) , which can lead to death on rare occasions . Between 1980 and 2000 , there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings , all of them in Tasmania . Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant 's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy ( desensitisation ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and common names = = 
 The specific name derives from the Latin word pilose , meaning ' covered with soft hair ' . The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI , under the binomial name Myrmecia pilosula from specimens he collected in Hobart in Tasmania . There , Smith described the specimens of a worker , queen and male . The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London . In 1922 , American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour , of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species . However , John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the subgenus Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the subgenus in 1943 . William Brown synonymised Promyrmecia due to the lack of morphological evidence that would make it distinct from Myrmecia and later placed the jack jumper ant in the genus in 1953 . 
 One synonym for the species has been published – <unk> ruginoda ( also titled Myrmecia ruginoda ) , described by Smith in the same work , and a male holotype specimen was originally described for this synonym . <unk> ruginoda was initially placed into the genera <unk> and Rhytidoponera , but it was later classified as a junior synonym of the jack jumper ant , after specimens of each were compared . The ant is a part of the Myrmecia pilosula species complex , a species group that was first defined by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery . The species complex is a monophyletic group , where the species are closely related to each other but their actual genetic relationship is distant . Members of this group include M. apicalis , M. <unk> , M. chrysogaster , M. croslandi , M. <unk> , M. dispar , M. elegans , M. <unk> , M. ludlowi , M. <unk> , M. occidentalis M. <unk> , M. rugosa and M. <unk> . Additional species that were described in this group in 2015 include M. <unk> , M. <unk> , M. <unk> and M. <unk> . 
 Their characteristic jumping motion when agitated or foraging inspires the common name " jack jumper " , a behaviour also shared with other Myrmecia ants , such as Myrmecia nigrocincta . This is the most common name for the ant , along with " black jumper , " " hopper ant " , " jumper ant " , " jumping ant " , " jumping jack " and " skipper ant " . It is also named after the jumping @-@ jack firecracker . The species is a member of the genus Myrmecia , a part of the subfamily Myrmeciinae . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like its relatives , the ant possesses a powerful sting and large mandibles . These ants can be black or blackish @-@ red in colour , and may have yellow or orange legs . The ant is medium @-@ sized in comparison to other Myrmecia species , where workers are typically 12 to 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) long . Excluding mandibles , jack jumpers measure 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) in length . The ant 's antennae , tibiae , tarsi and mandibles are also yellow or orange . <unk> ( hair ) on the ant is greyish , short and erect , and is longer and more abundant on their gaster , absent on their antennae , and short and suberect on their legs . The pubescence on the male is grey and long , and abundant throughout the ant 's body , but it shortens on the legs . The mandibles are long and slender ( measuring 4 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 17 in ) ) , and <unk> around the outer border . 
 The queen has a similar appearance to the workers , but its middle body is more irregular and coarser . The queen is also the largest , measuring 14 to 16 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 to 0 @.@ 63 in ) in length . Males are either smaller or around the same size as workers , measuring 11 to 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 43 to 0 @.@ 47 in ) . Males also have much smaller triangular mandibles than workers and queens . The mandibles on the male contain a large tooth at the centre , among the apex and the base of the inner border . Punctures ( tiny dots ) are noticeable on the head , which are large and shallow , and the thorax and node are also irregularly punctuated . The pubescence on the male 's gaster is white and yellowish . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Jack jumper ants are abundant in most of Australia , being among the most common bull ant to be encountered . The ants can be found in the south @-@ western tip of Western Australia , where it has been seen in the sand hills around Albany , Mundaring , Denmark and Esperance . The ant is rarely sighted in the northern regions of Western Australia . In South Australia , it is commonly found in the south @-@ east regions of the state , frequently encountered in Mount Lofty ( particularly the Adelaide Hills ) , <unk> , Hallett Cove and Aldgate , but it is not found in north @-@ western regions . There are dense populations on the western seaboard of Kangaroo Island . Jack jumpers are widespread throughout the whole of Victoria , but the species is uncommon in Melbourne . However , populations have been collected from the suburb of Elsternwick , and they are commonly found in the Great Otway Ranges , with many nests observed around Gellibrand . In New South Wales , nests are found throughout the entire state ( with the exception of north @-@ western New South Wales ) , but dense populations are mostly found in the Snowy Mountains , Blue Mountains and coastal regions . The ants are widespread in the Australian Capital Territory . In Queensland , the ants are only found along the south @-@ eastern coastlines of the state , where populations are frequently encountered in the Bunya Mountains , Fletcher , <unk> , Sunshine Coast , <unk> Mountain and <unk> , and have been found as far north as Rockhampton . The ant also resides in all of Tasmania , and their presence in the Northern Territory has not been verified . 
 Jack jumper ants live in open habitats , such as damp areas , forests , pastures , gardens and lawns , preferring fine gravel and sandy soil . Colonies can also be spotted around light bushland . Their preferred natural habitats include woodlands , dry open forests , grasslands and rural areas , and less common in urban areas . Their nests are mounds built from finely granular gravel , soil and pebbles , measuring 20 to 60 centimetres ( 8 to 24 in ) in diameter and can be as tall as half of a metre ( 20 in ) in height . Two types of nests for this species have been described : one being a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside , the other being a complex structure surrounded by a mound . These ants utilise the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat in a quick duration , providing the nest with solar energy traps . They decorate their nests with seeds , soil , charcoal , stones , sticks , and even small invertebrate corpses . They also camouflage their nests by covering leaf litter , debris and long grass over the nest . Nests can be found hidden under rocks , where queens will most likely form their colony , or around small piles of gravel instead . Their range in southern Australia , like other regional ant species , appears like that of a relict ant . Jack jumpers have been found in dry sclerophyll forests , at elevations ranging from 121 to 1 @,@ 432 metres ( 397 to 4 @,@ 698 ft ) , averaging 1 @,@ 001 metres ( 3 @,@ 284 ft ) . Rove beetles in the genus <unk> generally thrive in jack jumper nests and raise their brood within their chambers , and skinks have been found in some nests . 
 Populations are dense in the higher mountain regions of Tasmania . Widespread throughout the state , their presence is known on King Island , located north @-@ west from Tasmania . The ant prefers rural areas , found in warm , dry , open eucalypt woodlands ; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth . This environment also produces the ant 's food , which includes nectar and invertebrate prey . In suburban areas , this ant is found in native vegetation , and use rockeries , cracks in concrete walls , dry dirt and grass to build nests . One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson , Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations , while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point , do not . 
 Pest control of the jack jumper ant is successful in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats . Chemicals like <unk> , chlorpyrifos , <unk> and <unk> are effective against them . Spraying of <unk> into nests is an effective way of controlling nests if they are in a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity . Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies . The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Primarily diurnal , workers search for food during the day until dusk . They are active during warmer months , but are dormant during winter . Fights between these ants within the same colony is not uncommon . They are known for their aggression towards humans , attraction to movement and well developed vision , being able to observe and follow intruders from a metre ( 1 @.@ 1 yd ) away . This species is an accomplished jumper ants with leaps ranging from 2 to 3 inches ( 51 to 76 mm ) . William Morton Wheeler compared jack jumper ants to " Lilliputian cavalry galloping to battle " when disturbed , due to their jumping behaviour . He further wrote that they also made a ludicrous appearance as they emerge from their nests , in a series of short hops . 
 While no studies have established whether or not these ants contain alarm pheromones , its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones . If proven , this would explain their ability to attack en masse . Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum ( mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae ) . Although pollinia are often seen in the ants ' jaw , they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar @-@ rich plants before moving on , preventing pollen exchange . It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination . 
 = = = Prey = = = 
 Unlike many other ants that use scent to forage for food , jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey . Like other bull ants , they are solitary when they forage , but only workers perform this role . These ants are omnivores and scavengers , typically foraging in warmer temperatures . They deliver painful stings , which are effective in both killing prey and deterring predators . Jack jumpers have smooth stingers , and can thus sting indefinitely . Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters , partially due to their excellent vision ; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees . They also kill and eat other ants , such as carpenter ants ( Camponotus ) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions . Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders , and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance , usually with small insects and small arthropods . Jack jumper ants , alongside M. simillima , have been given frozen houseflies ( Musca domestica ) and blowflies ( Calliphoridae ) as food under testing conditions . The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land , particularly on Acacia shrubs , plants or trees . Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets . 
 Mature adult ants of this species mostly eat sweet substances , so dead insects are given to their larvae collected while foraging . However , larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size . Workers will mostly collect small insects , sap @-@ sucking insects along with the honeydew which is taken to their nest to feed their young . Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants ; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies . 
 = = = Predators and parasites = = = 
 Blindsnakes of the family Typhlopidae are known to consume Myrmecia broods , although smaller blindsnakes avoid them since they are vulnerable to their stings . Predatory invertebrates such as assassin bugs and redback spiders prey on jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants , and echidnas , particularly the short @-@ beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) hunt jack jumper ants , eating their larvae and eggs . Nymphs of the assassin bug species <unk> lemur lure these ants by trying to make the ant sting them . The jack jumper ant is a host to the parasite gregarines ( <unk> ) . Ants that host this parasite change colour from their typical black appearance to brown . This was discovered when brown jack jumpers were dissected and found to have <unk> spores , while black jack jumpers showed no spores . If it is present in large numbers , the parasite interferes with the normal darkening of the cuticles while the ant is in its pupal stage . The cuticle softens due to the gregarine parasite . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Like every ant , the life of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg . If the egg is fertilised , the ant will be a female ( diploid ) ; if not , it will become a male ( haploid ) . They develop through complete metamorphosis , meaning that they pass through a larva and pupa stage before emerging as an adult . <unk> that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching , allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation . Newborns can also eclose ( emerge from their pupa stage ) without assistance from other ants . Once born , jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks , an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for . 
 Based on observations of six worker ants , the average life expectancy of the jack jumper is around 1 @.@ 3 years , but workers were shown to live as little as 1 @.@ 12 years or as long as 1 @.@ 6 , with the queen living much longer than the workers at 10 years or more . This datum gives a life expectancy of 401 – 584 days , with an average of 474 days . Egg clumping is common , as observed in laboratory colonies . These clumps are often carried by worker ants , and these clumps would contain two to 30 eggs , without any larvae to hold them together . This confirms that eggs from jack jumper colonies do not always lie singly apart . George C. Wheeler and Jeanette Wheeler ( 1971 ) studied and described larvae collected from New South Wales and South Australia . They noted that very young larvae of the jack jumper were 2 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 094 in ) in length , with two types of body hair . They also described young larvae ( matured from very young larvae ) at 2 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 11 in ) , but with similar body characteristics to mature larvae , at 12 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 49 in ) . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Queens are polyandrous , meaning that queens will mate more than once ; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight , and the effective number of mates per queen ranges from 1 @.@ 0 to 11 @.@ 4 . Studies show that most queen ants will only mate with one or two males . If the number of available male mates increases , the number of effective matings per queen decreases . Colonies are polygynous , meaning that a colony may house multiple queens ; there are on average one to four queens per colony , and in multiple @-@ queen colonies , the egg @-@ laying queens are unrelated to one another . Based on a study , 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous ( 78 @.@ 57 % ) , showing that this is common in jack jumper colonies . When the queen establishes a nest after mating , she will hunt for food to feed her young , making her semi @-@ claustral . Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1 @,@ 000 . Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals . Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates , having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens . 
 Colonies are mainly polygynous with polyandrous queens , however , polyandry in jack jumper colonies is low in comparison to other Myrmecia ants , but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants . In 1979 , Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies , and although queens are unrelated to each other as mentioned previously , the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible . During colony foundation , there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens , although independent colony foundations can occur , as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly . Isolation by distance ( IBD ) patterns have been recorded , specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away . 
 As colonies closer to each other are more genetically similar , independent colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from . <unk> queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out , known as the nest @-@ site limitation hypothesis . Some queens could even try to return to their nests that they came from after nuptial flight , but end in another nest , in association that nests nearby will be similar to the queens birth nest . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 The jack jumper ant genome is contained on a single pair of chromosomes ( males have just one chromosome , as they are haploid ) . This is the lowest number known ( indeed possible ) for any animal , a number shared with the parasitic roundworm <unk> <unk> <unk> . Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex . The ant has nine polymorphic loci , which yielded 67 alleles .

 = = = History = = = 
 The earliest known account of ant sting fatalities in Australia was first recorded in 1931 ; two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings , possibly from the jack jumper ant or Myrmecia pyriformis . 30 years later , another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania . Historical and IgE results have suggested these two species or perhaps another species were responsible for all recorded deaths . 
 Between 1980 and 2000 , there have been four recorded deaths , all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock . All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 years old and had cardiopulmonary comorbidities . Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died . Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung . Prior to any desensitisation program being established , the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting . 
 Before venom immunotherapy , whole body extract immunotherapy was widely used due to its apparent effectiveness , and it was the only immunotherapy used on ants . However , fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation . Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective , and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use . Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986 , and before this , there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom . The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use . Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients , but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn . Venom immunotherapy was shown to reduce the risk of systemic reactions , demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant @-@ sting allergies . 
 In 2003 , Professor Simon Brown established the jack jumper desensitisation program , although the program is at risk of closure . Since the establishment of the program , no death has been recorded since 2003 . However , the ant may be responsible for the death of a Bunbury man in 2011 . 
 = = = Incidence = = = 
 The extent of the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas . Allergy prevalence rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas . These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia , due to a high proportion of the population having significant allergies to the ant 's sting . The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies , responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia , and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of honeybee stings . One in three million annually die of general <unk> in Australia alone . Over 90 % of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by the jack jumper . 
 The ant is notorious in Tasmania , where most fatalities have been recorded . In 2005 , over a quarter of all jack jumper sting incidents were sustained in Tasmania ; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476 @,@ 000 people . Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital . The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania , notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne , while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed . One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants . 
 = = = Venom = = = 
 The jack jumper ant and its relatives in the genus Myrmecia are among the most dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression ; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world 's most dangerous ant . The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species , such as <unk> chinensis , <unk> <unk> , and the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) . The retractable sting is located in their abdomen , attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac , which is where the venom is accumulated . Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers , which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims . Their venom contains haemolytic and eicosanoid elements and <unk> . It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity , which includes phospholipase A2 and B , hyaluronidase , acid and alkaline phosphatase . The venom of the ant also contains several peptides ; one being pilosulin 1 , which causes cytotoxic effects , pilosulin 2 , which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3 , which is known to be a major allergen . Other <unk> include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5 . The peptides have known molecular weights . The LD50 ( lethal dose ) occurs at a lower concentration than for <unk> , a peptide found in bee venom . Its LD50 value is 3 @.@ 6 mg / kg ( injected intravenously in mice ) . 
 Loss of cell viability in the jack jumper 's venom was researched through cytometry , which measures the proportions of cells that glow in the presence of fluorescent dye and 7 @-@ <unk> D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein – Barr B @-@ cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1 . Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1 . However , partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering cell viability ; the residue 22 N @-@ terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1 . 
 20 percent of jack jumper ants have an empty venom sac , so failure to display a sting reaction should not be interpreted as a loss of sensitivity . Substantial amounts of ant venom have been analysed to characterise venom components , and the jack jumper has been a main subject in these studies . An East Carolina University study which summarised the knowledge about ant stings and their venom showed that only the fire ant and jack jumper had the allergenic components of their venom extensively investigated . These allergenic components include peptides found as heterodimers , <unk> and pilosulin 3 . Only six Myrmecia ants , including the jack jumper , are capable of inducing IgE antibodies . Due to the vast differentiation of venom produced in each Myrmecia species , and other species sharing similar characteristics to the jack jumper ant , diagnosing which ant is responsible for an anaphylactic reaction is difficult . A review of a patients history with allergies while identifying a positive result of venom specific IgE levels helps to identify the species of ant that caused a reaction . 
 = = = Signs and symptoms = = = 
 Reactions to the ants sting show similar symptoms to fire ant stings ; namely local swelling which lasts for several days , and swelling of the lips , face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction . Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose , and hives or welts will begin to develop . Headaches , anxiety and flushing may also occur . Jack jumpers , bees and wasps are the most common causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings . People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings , similar to that from an electric shock . Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung . Localised envenomation occurs with every sting , but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times ( as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults ) . The heart rate increases , and blood pressure falls rapidly . Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung . Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms . This includes difficulty breathing and talking , the tongue and throat will swell up , and coughing , chest tightness , abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting may occur . Others may lose consciousness and collapse ( sometimes people may not collapse ) , and confusion . Children who get stung will show symptoms such as <unk> and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs . 
 In individuals allergic to the venom ( about 2 – 3 % of the population ) , a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock . In comparison to other insects such as the western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) and the European wasp ( Vespula germanica ) , their rates are only 1 @.@ 4 % and 0 @.@ 6 % . The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant , Western honeybee and European wasp are 12 % , 7 % and 2 % . The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes , but the maximum period is around three hours . The ant allergy does not disappear ; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re @-@ stung . Approximately 70 percent of patients with a history of systemic reaction to the ant 's sting have another reaction when stung again . In comparison , systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50 % and 25 % . About half of these reactions were life @-@ threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting . Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare ; 2 @.@ 9 % of 600 residents from semi @-@ rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant 's sting , according to a questionnaire . The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years . 
 In 2011 , an Australian ant allergy venom study was conducted , with the goal of determining which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis . It showed that the jack jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients ' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings . Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus , 176 were from the jack jumper . 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi , while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants . The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis . Apart from Myrmecia species , the green @-@ head ant ( Rhytidoponera metallica ) was also responsible for several systemic reactions . 
 Most people recover uneventfully following a mild local reaction and up to about 3 % of individuals suffer a severe localised reaction . Most individuals who suffer from severe localised reactions will most likely encounter another reaction if stung again . Fatalities are rare , and venom immunotherapy can prevent fatalities . 
 = = = First aid and emergency treatment = = = 
 If no signs of an allergic reaction are present , an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain . <unk> is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting . Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water , and if continuous pain remains for several days , antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days . 
 Emergency treatment is needed in a case of a severe allergic reaction . Before calling for help , laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested . Depending on a patients needs , they will be given an EpiPen or an <unk> to use in case they are stung . In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis , further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required . Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation . <unk> may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting . The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended , as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis . Medications like antihistamines , H2 blockers , corticosteroids and anti @-@ leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis . 
 There are several bush remedies used to treat jack jumper stings ( and any other Myrmecia sting ) . The young tips of a bracken fern provide a useful bush remedy to treat jack jumper stings , discovered and currently used by indigenous Australians . The tips are rubbed on the stung area , and may relieve the local pain after getting stung . Another plant used as a bush remedy is <unk> glaucescens ( known as angular sea @-@ fig or <unk> ) . 
 = = = Desensitisation and prevention = = = 
 Desensitisation ( also called allergy immunotherapy ) to the jack jumper sting venom has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis , but the standardisation of jack jumper venom is yet to be validated . Unlike bee and wasp sting immunotherapy , jack jumper immunotherapy lacks funding and no government rebate is available . Venom is available ; however , no commercial venom extract is available that can be used for skin testing . Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme . 
 The Royal Hobart Hospital offers a desensitisation program for patients who have had a severe allergic reaction to a jack jumper sting . However , the program may face closure due to budget cuts . Professor Simon Brown , who founded the program , commented , " Closing the program will leave 300 patients hanging in the lurch " . There is a campaign to make the program available in Victoria . The Royal Adelaide Hospital runs a small @-@ scale program that <unk> patients to the ants venom . 
 Patients are given an injection of venom under the skin in small amounts . During immunotherapy , the first dose is small , but will gradually increase per injection . This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body . 
 Follow @-@ ups of untreated people over thirty with a history of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy . Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy . The efficacy ( capacity to induce a therapeutic effect ) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy , where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction . <unk> initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used , but results show higher risks of allergic reactions . Despite immunotherapy being successful , only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation . 
 It is suggested that people should avoid jack jumpers , but this is difficult to do . Closed footwear ( boots and shoes ) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting , but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk . With this said , they are still capable of stinging through fabric , and can find their way through gaps in clothing . Most stings occur when people are gardening , so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended . People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent , or eliminate nearby nests . Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms , people who are allergic to them are advised to stay away from all Myrmecia ants , especially to ones they have not encountered before . 
 = 1982 – 83 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1982 – 83 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was least active cyclone season in the basin since 1961 – 1962 . There were six systems that were named , although three of them – Arilisy , Clera , and Fely – failed to intensify beyond tropical depression status . No storms reached tropical cyclone status , according to the official warning agency for the basin , Météo @-@ France , although the two strongest storms – Bemany and Elinah – peaked just below that intensity . The first named storm , Arilisy , formed on October 27 , and dissipated without having affected land . However , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is an unofficial warning center for the basin , briefly tracked a tropical depression in July . The next storm was Bemany , which passed east of Mauritius near peak intensity in early December . Tropical Depression Clera existed briefly in the middle of September , and Tropical Storm Dadafy moved across the eastern portion of the basin in late December . 
 The only deadly storm of the season was Elinah , which formed on January 9 in the Mozambique Channel . It moved to the southwest and was intensifying when it struck Comoros on January 11 . There , high winds and waves heavily damaged banana and coconut crops , and the storm damaged or destroyed 4 @,@ 357 buildings . High waves knocked 40 people off a pier on Anjouan , killing 33 of them . Damage in Comoros totaled $ 23 @.@ 1 million ( 1983 USD ) . Elinah intensified before brushing the coast of Mozambique , and it dissipated on January 9 . Aside from a weak storm classified by the JTWC in February , there was minimal activity for several months . The final storm of the season was Tropical Depression Fely , which dropped moderate rainfall in eastern Madagascar in late June . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The season was the least active since the 1961 – 1962 season . It occurred during a significant El Niño event . Its inactivity was comparable to the 2010 – 11 season which had three named storms . There were 13 days when storms were active , the same as 2010 – 11 , although the latter season also had a long @-@ lasting subtropical cyclone . It is estimated that Tropical Depression Fely and two of the other storms in this season would not have been named during the 2010 – 11 season . 
 There were six storms named by the weather service in Madagascar or Mauritius , with advisories issued by Météo @-@ France 's meteorological office at Réunion ( MFR ) . At the time , the MFR area of warning responsibility was from the coast of Africa to 80 ° E , and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region , also tracked a short @-@ lived tropical storm in February , which formed on February 5 northeast of Mauritius . The system tracked to the southeast , reaching peak winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) before dissipating on February 8 northwest of Rodrigues .

Haven received the name Bemany , the storm gradually intensified ; the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of minimal hurricane status on December 3 , and the next day MFR estimated peak winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) . While near peak intensity , Bemany passed about 230 km ( 140 mi ) east of Mauritius , and it subsequently weakened . The influence of an anticyclone turned the storm to the east and caused Bemany to loop back to the west . On December 5 , the storm became extratropical , and the next day the JTWC issued its last advisory . On December 7 , Bemany briefly became a tropical depression again , only to become extratropical for the final time the next day ; Bemany dissipated on December 9 .

The next day , the JTWC estimated Dadafy strengthened to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . The storm turned to the south and weakened . On December 29 , MFR declared that Dadafy became extratropical , and JTWC discontinued advisories the next day . The extratropical remnants dissipated on January 1 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Elinah = = = 
 The South Indian convergence zone spawned a circulation that organized into a tropical depression in the Mozambique Channel on January 9 . It gradually intensified while moving to the southwest , developing spiral rainbands . On January 11 , Elinah passed between Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago . The next day , JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , although land interaction with Mozambique weakened Elinah . After it turned to the south and moved away from the coast , the storm re @-@ intensified , and MFR estimated Elinah reached peak winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) on January 14 . Subsequently , the convergence zone caused the storm to weaken , ultimately absorbing it by January 16 . 
 While passing through the Comoros , Elinah caused heavy damage in Anjouan and Mohéli , destroying nearly all of the banana crops and 30 % of the coconut crops . About 2 @,@ 400 ha ( 5 @,@ 900 acres ) of agricultural lands were flooded , and the storm damaged 2 @,@ 120 ha ( 5 @,@ 200 acres ) of forests on <unk> ; agriculture damage was estimated at $ 9 @.@ 6 million ( 1983 USD ) . Elinah damaged or destroyed 4 @,@ 357 buildings . High waves reaching 12 m ( 39 ft ) damaged coastal roads and sea walls . On Anjouan , a wave knocked 40 people into the water , killing 33 of them . Elinah injured 52 and left $ 23 @.@ 1 million in damage ( 1983 USD ) . The military of Comoros helped clear roads , and workers rebuilt the damaged buildings . After the storm passed , the government of Comoros requested for aid to the international community . Collectively , the United States , Egypt , France , Germany , and Switzerland , as well as various agencies under the United Nations , provided $ 1 @.@ 7 million in assistance .

 = Xbox One = 
 The Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft . Announced on May 21 , 2013 , it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox family , and was released on November 22 , 2013 , in North America , Europe ( in some countries ) , Australia and Brazil , September 2 , 2014 , for other Europe countries , September 4 , 2014 , in Japan , and September 29 , 2014 , for China . It competes with Sony 's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 's Wii U as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles . It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China , specifically in the Shanghai Free @-@ Trade Zone . Microsoft marketed the device as an " all @-@ in @-@ one entertainment system " , which competed against other digital media players , such as the Apple TV and Google TV platforms . 
 Moving away from its predecessor 's PowerPC @-@ based architecture , the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox ; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit ( APU ) built around the x86 @-@ 64 instruction set . The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing and the integration of entertainment applications and services , offering the ability to overlay live television programming from an existing set @-@ top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide , split @-@ screen multitasking of applications , and improved second @-@ screen support . The console optionally includes a redesigned Kinect sensor , marketed as the " Kinect 2 @.@ 0 " , providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition for use in its graphical user interface ( GUI ) and games . The Xbox One offers the ability for users to record and share " clips " from gameplay or live @-@ stream directly to Twitch , Ustream , and other streaming platforms . The console 's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360 's , with a redesigned body , D @-@ pad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback , as well as the customization of the controller 's button input . 
 Prior to its official release , the Xbox One received mixed reviews ; the entertainment @-@ oriented features were praised , but controversy surrounded several policy changes since the Xbox 360 's release , including a proposed always @-@ on digital rights management ( DRM ) system , and concerns over a mandate that the Kinect sensor be used at all times . Microsoft retracted these changes prior to the launch , and it received mostly positive reception for its refined controller design , multimedia features , user interface , and voice navigation . 
 = = History = = 
 Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360 , Microsoft 's previous video game console , which was introduced in 2005 as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . In April 2016 , Microsoft announced the end of production of the 360 . Over the years , the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the unit 's size and improve its reliability . In 2010 , Microsoft 's Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about " halfway " through its lifecycle ; this was aided by the introduction of the Kinect motion sensor that year , which Lewis stated would extend the lifecycle by five years . 
 Initial hardware for the 360 's successor , commonly referred to by the industry as the " Xbox 720 " , was reportedly in hands of developers as early as May 2011 . The official developer kit was codenamed Durango , and appeared to be available to developers by mid @-@ 2012 . Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor , cloud access to games and media , integration with phone and tablet devices , and technology to provide players heads @-@ up displays on glasses worn by the player , codenamed " Fortaleza " ; Microsoft did not comment on these reported features . Similar , leaked design documents also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games , though Microsoft later clarified they were still reviewing the design and were " thinking about what is next and how we can push the boundaries of technology like we did with Kinect " , but did not comment on the validity of the information . 
 The console was publicly unveiled under the name Xbox One on May 21 , 2013 in a press conference designed to cover the unit 's broad multimedia and social capabilities . A second press event for the console was held during E3 on June 10 , 2013 , focusing on its video game @-@ oriented functionality . At that time , Microsoft announced that the console would be released in 21 different markets on November 22 , 2013 , but this was later amended down to 13 . The change , which pushed the release date for the other eight markets to 2014 , was attributed to unforeseen complexity in localizing the device 's voice recognition capabilities . Later , in September 2014 , the Xbox One was released in 26 markets , including remaining markets in Europe , the Japanese market , and Middle Eastern markets . 
 From the first announcement to the actual launch of the product , Microsoft made some significant changes to the console . Initially the system was to be able to play a disc @-@ based game without the disc after the initial install ; however , this came with a requirement that the users would have to connect online once per day , as well as restrictions on used games . These policies were reversed in June 2013 . 
 In 2015 , four members of an international hacking group pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to Microsoft 's computer network and obtaining sensitive information relating to Xbox One and Xbox Live . At the time of the security breach , Microsoft was in the development stage for its next @-@ generation gaming system . Between 2011 and 2013 , the hackers spent hundreds of hours searching through Microsoft 's network copying log @-@ in credentials , source code , technical specifications and other data . Group members say they were driven by an immense curiosity about Microsoft 's then @-@ unreleased Xbox One console and associated software . " Using stolen access credentials " , two of the hackers also committed a physical theft by entering " a secure building on Microsoft 's Redmond Washington campus " and carrying away three " Durango " development kits .

 Xbox One 's exterior casing consists of a two @-@ tone " liquid black " finish ; with half finished in a matte grey , and the other in a glossier black . The matte side of the top of the console consists of a large air vent . The design was intended to evoke a more entertainment @-@ oriented and simplified look than previous iterations of the console ; among other changes , the LED rings used by Xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white Xbox logo used to communicate the system 's status to the user . Due to the overall ventilation design of the console , Xbox One is designed to only sit horizontally , unlike its competitor , the PlayStation 4 . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Xbox One is powered by an AMD " Jaguar " Accelerated Processing Unit ( APU ) with two quad @-@ core modules totaling eight x86 @-@ 64 cores clocked at 1 @.@ 75 GHz , and 8 GB of DDR3 RAM with a memory bandwidth of 68 @.@ 3 GB / s . The memory subsystem also features an additional 32 MB of " embedded static " RAM , or <unk> , with a memory bandwidth of 109 GB / s . Eurogamer were told prior to its release that , for simultaneous read and write operations , the <unk> is capable of a theoretical memory bandwidth of 192 GB / s and that a memory bandwidth of 133 GB / s has been achieved with operations that involved alpha transparency blending . The system includes a non @-@ replaceable hard drive and a Blu @-@ ray Disc optical drive . 138 GB of hard drive space is used by the operating system , with the remainder available for the storage of games . Since the June 2014 software update , up to two USB drives can be connected to Xbox One to expand its capacity . External drives must support USB 3 @.@ 0 and have a capacity of at least 256 GB . 
 It was reported that 3 GB of RAM would be reserved for the operating system and utility software , leaving 5 GB for games . With DirectX 11 @.@ 2 as the console 's API , the graphics processing unit ( GPU ) is based on an AMD <unk> architecture with 12 compute units , which have a total of 768 cores , running at 853 MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1 @.@ 31 <unk> . For networking , Xbox One supports Gigabit Ethernet , 802.11n wireless , and Wi @-@ Fi Direct . 
 Xbox One supports 4K resolution ( <unk> × 2160 ) ( <unk> ) video output and 7 @.@ 1 surround sound . Yusuf Mehdi , corporate vice president of marketing and strategy for Microsoft , has stated that there is no hardware restriction that would prevent games from running at 4K resolution . Unlike the Xbox 360 , the Xbox One does not support 1080i and other interlaced resolutions . Xbox One supports HDMI 1 @.@ 4 for both input and output , and does not support composite or component video . 
 The console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating ; alongside increasing fan speed , additional measures can be taken , including forcing the hardware to run in a lower power state — a feature that was not present on Xbox 360 . Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance , but the setting would be intended as a last resort to prevent permanent hardware damage . 
 = = = Controller = = = 
 The Xbox One 's controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360 's controller , but with various refinements to its form . Among its changes include a smoother form , textured analog sticks , a four @-@ way directional pad , and redesigned triggers and shoulder buttons with a curved shape for ergonomics . " Menu " and " View " buttons have replaced the Start and Select buttons . Each trigger features independent rumble motors called " Impulse Triggers " , which allows developers to program directional vibration . One trigger can be made to vibrate when firing a gun , or both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit . The controller also contains light emitters that allow it to be tracked and paired using the Kinect sensor , and to detect when it 's not being held to automatically enter a low @-@ power state . An updated revision of the controller was released in June 2015 , which includes a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ millimeter headphone jack and other minor changes . 
 The Xbox One controller includes a micro USB port ; when attached via a micro @-@ USB cable , the controller can operate without battery power and can charge remotely , and is supported on computers running Windows 7 or later with drivers . The Xbox One Wireless Adapter accessory allows wireless use of Xbox One controllers on Windows computers also running Windows 7 or later . 
 The Elite Wireless Controller , or just Elite Controller , was released in October 2015 . It was described and marketed as " an elite controller for the elite gamer " , containing interchangeable parts , " hair trigger locks " for the triggers that allow users to reduce the amount of distance they must be pressed to register a press , and software for remapping buttons . 
 = = = Kinect 2 @.@ 0 sensor = = = 
 The Kinect 2 @.@ 0 , an updated natural user interface sensor , was redesigned and recreated to provide motion tracking and voice commands for the Xbox One . 
 Kinect 2 @.@ 0 features a wide @-@ angle time @-@ of @-@ flight camera and a 1080p camera , in comparison to the VGA resolution of the Xbox 360 version , and processes 2GB per second of data to map its environment . Kinect 2 @.@ 0 has an improved accuracy over its predecessor : it can track up to 6 people , referred to as " skeletons " at once , perform heart rate tracking , can track controller gestures , and QR codes to redeem Xbox Live gift cards . By default , voice recognition is active at all times , so the console can receive voice commands from the user when needed , even when the console is in sleep mode , as it is possible to awaken the console with a command , although settings are available to change which individual Kinect functions are active . 
 Prior to and after the mandate , all Xbox One consoles initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included . On June 9 , 2014 , cheaper Xbox One bundles were introduced , which slashed out the Kinect . Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox One bundles without Kinect was to " [ offer ] a choice to people that would allow people to buy an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to " , while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect . An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games , allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10 % of the GPU processing power . These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking , regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use . 
 A Windows compatible Kinect 2 @.@ 0 was released on July 15 , 2014 . Kinect 2 @.@ 0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014 ; it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight .

 Xbox One runs two operating systems within a hypervisor ; games run within one separate operating system , while apps and the user interface run within a stripped @-@ down " core " variant of Windows 10 , originally Windows 8 during its launch . This architecture allows resources to be allocated specifically to different aspects of the console 's functions , including multitasking and Kinect processing , ensuring an " absolute guarantee of performance " for games . Apps can be " snapped " to the side of the screen as a form of multitasking . Xbox One now supports Universal Windows Platform apps , which can be designed to run across Xbox One , Windows 10 , and Windows 10 Mobile in synchronization with the Windows platform . 
 Xbox One 's user interface is modeled on the Metro design language . The dashboard is divided into " Home " , " Community " , " OneGuide " , and " Store " sections . A guide sidebar is accessed by double @-@ pressing the Xbox Guide button , providing access to common functions such as the friends list , apps , the user 's party , and settings . Users can go back to the dashboard while using games or apps using either the Xbox button on their controller or a voice command ; up to four apps can run ( either actively or in the background ) at once , but only one game can run at a time . Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands . Xbox One 's voice control capabilities are similar to , albeit richer than those of Xbox 360 . Motion control support was also available on the dashboard with Kinect ; however , this feature has been removed from the New Xbox One Experience due to low usage . The voice assistant Cortana will be added in 2016 to provide expanded voice command functionality with natural language recognition . 
 The dashboard originally used a layout similar to Windows 8 's " Start screen " , with a horizontal @-@ scrolling , tile @-@ based interface . This design was replaced for Xbox Preview Program members in September 2015 with the current interface , known as " the New Xbox One Experience " , which was publicly released as part of the November 12 , 2015 system update . 
 = = = Multimedia features = = = 
 The Xbox One can view and play content from <unk> servers and USB storage devices using the " Media Player " app . An application allows playback of video from Blu @-@ ray Disc , DVD and CD media . 
 Xbox One provides the ability to feed live television by serving as an HDMI pass @-@ through for an existing television provider 's set @-@ top box or an optional Digital TV Tuner accessory that allows use of digital terrestrial television . The console provides its own electronic program guide known as OneGuide , augmenting the existing streaming functionality to provide show recommendations based on viewing history , integrated access to " App Channels " corresponding to online video services , and voice control via Kinect . The set @-@ top box and television are controlled by OneGuide using an IR blaster . 
 Xbox One does not provide full DVR functionality for recording television programs : executive Yusuf Mehdi indicated that Xbox One would " work in tandem " with existing television services , but that Microsoft would need to work with them directly to provide extended functionality , such as DVR integration . The digital TV tuner accessory allows limited DVR functionality for pausing and rewinding live TV for up to 30 minutes . In June 2016 , Microsoft announced that their plans for full DVR functionality for the Xbox One were on hold . 
 = = = Xbox Live = = = 
 The Xbox Live service has been scaled up to use 300 @,@ 000 servers for Xbox One users . Cloud storage is available to save music , films , games and saved content , and developers are able to use Live servers ( along with the Windows Azure cloud computing platform ) to offer dynamic in @-@ game content and other functionality . Users can have up to 1 @,@ 000 friends . The Xbox Avatars were reinstated in " the New Xbox Experience " update . 
 Players can use the Upload Studio app to edit and share clips from the last five minutes of gameplay footage that is automatically recorded by the console . Games can also be developed so that recording can automatically be triggered in response to notable events , such as achievements . Xbox One also integrates with the live streaming platform Twitch ; users can use voice commands to immediately begin streaming footage of their current game directly to the service , and use Kinect 's camera and microphone to record video and audio narration . Users can feature recorded clips on their Xbox Live profile page in a " Showcase " section . 
 As with Xbox 360 , premium online features such as multiplayer , voice communication , broadcasting and Upload Studio , as well as Games with Gold require an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use . Unlike Xbox 360 , a user 's Xbox Live Gold subscription benefits apply to all other users of their designated " home " console as well , rather than requiring a separate subscription for each user . Since June 2014 , applications no longer require an Xbox Live Gold membership to use . Additional subscriptions for outside services such as Netflix may still be required .

 The Xbox SmartGlass app provides extended functionality on Xbox One , allowing devices running Windows Phone , Windows 8 , iOS and Android to be used as a companion device for Xbox One features , such as powering on the console , a remote control , accessing messages and the Activity Feed , purchasing content , and providing integration with certain games and content . The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live TV to Android and Windows devices if the console is using a USB digital TV tuner . 
 On Windows 10 , SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox App , which supports the local streaming of games from Xbox One to personal computers and tablets running Windows 10 . An Xbox One controller must be used , but Windows @-@ compatible headsets and microphones can be used for voice chat . Games requiring Kinect are not supported , while Game DVR and online streaming are not available while using this functionality . 
 Per a partnership with Oculus VR , users will also be able to stream Xbox One games to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset by means of Xbox app for Windows 10 ; there are currently no immediate plans for direct integration between Xbox One and Oculus Rift . 
 = = Games = = 
 Xbox One games are distributed at retail on Blu @-@ ray Disc , and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store . All Xbox One games must be installed to the console 's storage : users can begin to play portions of a game ( such as opening levels ) once the installation or download reaches a specific point , while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background . Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby . If the game is installed from physical media , the disc is still required for validation purposes . If the game is installed on another console , and that console owner no longer has access to the disc , the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live ; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive . An active internet connection may be required for some games , particularly those that integrate cloud computing . 
 = = = Backward compatibility = = = 
 At its launch , the Xbox One did not have native backward compatibility with original Xbox or Xbox 360 games . Senior project management and planning director Albert <unk> explained that Microsoft was initially considering a cloud gaming platform to enable backward compatibility , but he felt it would be " problematic " due to varying internet connection qualities . Xbox Live director of programming Larry " Major Nelson " Hryb did state that users could theoretically use the HDMI @-@ in port on the console to pass an Xbox 360 ( or , alternatively , any other device that supports HDMI output , including competing consoles ) through Xbox One . This process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable display lag . 
 Xbox 360 backward compatibility uses a software emulator within the system software ; 104 Xbox 360 titles were supported at the feature 's public launch , with more to be added in the following months . Xbox 360 games contained within Rare Replay are packaged as standalone applications using the Xbox 360 emulation . Microsoft stated that publishers would only need to provide permission to the company to allow the repackaging , and they expect the number of supported games to increase significantly over time . Microsoft , along with fourteen other third @-@ party publishers , will offer supported games , and all Games with Gold titles on Xbox 360 since November 2015 are made <unk> division head Phil Spencer has also hinted the possibility of adding support for games from the original Xbox , but they are focusing on Xbox 360 compatibility first .

 After the official unveiling of Xbox One in May 2013 , the editorial staff of Game Informer offered both praise and criticism for the console . Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsoft 's intent to " control the living room " . He called Xbox One 's instant switching features " impressive " , and that the console was " a step in the right direction " with regards to TV entertainment , especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of non @-@ intuitive user interfaces often found on cable set @-@ top boxes . Jeff Cork said that Microsoft had " some great ideas " for the console , but that it failed to properly communicate them . 
 = = = = DRM controversy , E3 2013 = = = = 
 Microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for Xbox One than what was used upon its release : all games , including those purchased at retail , would be bound to the user 's Xbox Live account . Users could access their purchased games from any other Xbox One console , play games without their disc once installed , and allow users to " share " their games with up to ten designated " family " members . Users would trade games at " participating retailers " , and could also transfer a game directly to any Xbox Live friend on their list for at least 30 days , but only once . To synchronize licenses , the console would be required to connect to the internet once every 24 hours ; if the console could not connect , all games would be disabled until the console was connected again . 
 Reaction to this digital rights management scheme was greatly negative . Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers ' first @-@ sale rights for games purchased on physical media , as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold , and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell . Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on second @-@ hand copies of games . Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind , but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media . He also noted that Microsoft was not " giving in " to publishers ' objections to used games , but rather trying to balance the needs of consumers and the industry , and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time . 
 Microsoft 's E3 press conference on June 10 , 2013 , was also criticized for focusing too much on games that , beyond increased graphical capabilities , provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous @-@ generation games — giving little incentive for buying the new console . After Sony 's E3 press conference later that evening , GameSpot editor Tom <unk> went on to say that Microsoft had become anti @-@ consumerist , trying to " punish their loyal customers " with strict restrictions , and that " by saying no to the used game restrictions and always @-@ online that Microsoft is so happily implementing on the Xbox One , Sony has elevated the PlayStation 4 as the console to grab this holiday season . " Rafi Mohammed , author of " The Art of Pricing " felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One " too high " , and the $ 100 premium over its competitor could " derail " the system during the 2013 holiday season . 
 = = = = Response from Microsoft = = = = 
 On June 19 , 2013 , Microsoft announced , in response to the negative reaction , that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One 's DRM and game licensing model . As with Xbox 360 , users would be able to share and resell physical games without restrictions , and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console 's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu @-@ ray and DVD video , the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate . These changes required the family sharing features , along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation , to be dropped . Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future , but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints . Don Mattrick , the then president of Microsoft 's Interactive Entertainment Business , stated that the licensing changes were in response to the negative public reaction . Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony 's aggressive position during its E3 press conference . Mattrick , who had been a leader in Xbox One development , announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1 , 2013 , to become CEO of Zynga . Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One . 
 Microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for the Kinect sensor to be plugged into Xbox One at all times for it to function . Privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data could be used for targeted advertising , and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users . In response to these claims , Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users , Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy , and that the console would not redistribute user @-@ generated content without permission . In response to these pre @-@ launch changes and a belief that Microsoft 's decisions for the systems were in poor judgement , journalists and consumers jokingly gave Xbox One nicknames such as " Xbox 180 " , in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft 's decision to reverse its controversial decisions , and " <unk> " , suggesting that the company was " throwing a bone " to consumers by making these changes . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Upon its release , the Xbox One received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers . In its launch review , Polygon gave the Xbox One an 8 out of 10 . Its design was described as " inoffensive " but its larger size noted , while the console 's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on @-@ launch . The controller was praised for its battery life and " premium " design , but some members of the site 's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs . The design of Xbox One 's interface received mixed reviews : noting that it carried over Windows 8 's design language , the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller 's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures , seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead . While praised for having more " robust " voice navigation than Xbox 360 , they felt that voice navigation still had a " learning curve in understanding what works and what doesn 't . " Although its user following , Smart Match , and improved voice chat features were noted , Xbox Live was panned for not offering the ability on @-@ launch to use one 's real name ( as on PlayStation 4 ) . Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set @-@ top boxes ( drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs ) , Polygon felt the Xbox One 's overall multimedia experience " feels like a major step forward in set @-@ top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one . " 
 Engadget was similarly modest upon its launch , describing the Xbox One 's design as a " 1993 artist 's rendering of 2013 's technology " . Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the " <unk> [ ous ] " Xbox 360 design , they praised the controller for its improved D @-@ pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons . Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking , but that whilst " magical " , " every false positive or unrecognized [ voice ] command had us reaching for the controller . " The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4 , but its game library view was described as being a " jumbled , sadly <unk> rows of every owned piece of software " , that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not . The console was also panned for missing certain promised features on @-@ launch , such as Upload Studio , game streaming , and certain apps / services . 
 Later on , critics felt that the Xbox One 's functionality had matured over the year following its launch ; CNET acknowledged improvements to Xbox One 's software since its original release , but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4 , explaining that " navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be , and there 's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it . There are oddities peppered throughout , which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations . " Xbox One 's in @-@ game performance was mixed , with some titles showing slower performance over PS4 , but some multi @-@ platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4 . CNET praised the console 's providing a better lineup of multimedia services and apps over PS4 , free cloud @-@ synced save data for all users ( PS4 requires PlayStation Plus for such functionality ) , support for high @-@ speed USB 3 @.@ 0 as secondary storage , and having a " slightly better " lineup of upcoming exclusives , concluding that " While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch , that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One 's original missteps . " 
 TechRadar similarly felt that Xbox One " [ felt ] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago , " citing OneGuide , Upload Studio , and Microsoft 's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps , and that " there 's still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out . So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third @-@ party titles , it may not always remain that way . Just how Microsoft will get it to that point , though , is still a mystery . " However , they disfavored the console 's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality , Kinect 's voice recognition , and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution , but are upscaled . 
 IGN also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch , acknowledging that Microsoft had " made good on its promise of listening to consumers , rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers . " Regarding the console 's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4 , it was noted that " while <unk> might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately , most people generally won 't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game ( when there is one ) unless they see both running side by side " , and examples of " gorgeous " Xbox One games were noted , such as Sunset Overdrive and Forza Motorsport 5 . The number of " hidden " options in Xbox One 's user interface was equated to " hunting for treasure in a messy room " ; as such , Kinect voice commands , in combination with access to common functions within the Xbox SmartGlass app , were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience .

 State Route 906 ( SR 906 ) is a 2 @.@ 65 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 26 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington , serving Snoqualmie Pass and its associated ski areas in King and Kittitas counties . The highway travels southeast between two interchanges with Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) in Snoqualmie Pass and Hyak . SR 906 was formed out of segments of the former Sunset Highway that were bypassed by the construction of the controlled @-@ access Interstate Highway over the pass . Between 360 and 2 @,@ 100 vehicles use the road on an average day in 2012 .

 SR 906 begins at a half @-@ diamond interchange with I @-@ 90 , exit 52 , in Snoqualmie Pass , King County . North of I @-@ 90 , Summit Road provides access to the <unk> ski area . Only the first 3 ⁄ 10 mile ( 480 m ) of the highway is in King County , with the remainder of the highway in Kittitas County . After crossing the county line , SR 906 is bounded by Summit West on the west side of the highway and the Snoqualmie Pass Traveler 's Rest rest area on the east side . Access to the Pacific Crest Trail is provided from the one of Summit West 's parking lots . Just south of the rest area is an intersection with Yellowstone Road , which links back to I @-@ 90 at a full diamond interchange . Yellowstone Road was once a part of the Yellowstone Trail , a cross @-@ country auto @-@ trail . 
 Summit Central borders the west side of the highway with parking lots for the ski area on the east side of the highway , as the two @-@ lane 35 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 56 km / h ) speed limited road enters the unincorporated community of Hyak and continues southeastward . The highway comes to a four @-@ way intersection , and SR 906 turns to the north to meet I @-@ 90 at exit 54 . SR 906 Spur , a 0 @.@ 43 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 690 m ) spur route continues east through the intersection to serve the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) maintenance facility . Summit East is served by the roadway that continues south from the four @-@ way intersection . A hybrid half @-@ diamond interchange / partial cloverleaf serves as the eastern terminus of SR 906 as it reconnects to I @-@ 90 . The roadway continues north past the interchange as Lake <unk> Road , named after the nearby lake of the same name . 
 Every year , WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , WSDOT calculated that , on average , 360 vehicles used the highway near its eastern terminus , and as many as 2 @,@ 100 vehicles used the highway just west of Yellowstone Road .

 Automobile roads over Snoqualmie Pass date back to 1905 , when the first car traveled over the pass . A one @-@ lane road was competed by 1909 to promote the Alaska – Yukon – Pacific Exposition in Seattle , complete with a race over the pass . The Sunset Highway was built as a two @-@ lane road in 1915 , and rebuilt along the abandoned right @-@ of @-@ way of the Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1926 . The Sunset Highway was a part of the Yellowstone Trail , a transcontinental auto @-@ trail . In 1926 the United States Numbered Highway System was established , and the highway over Snoqualmie Pass was designated U.S. Route 10 ( US 10 ) . The bridge that carries SR 906 over Hyak Creek was built in 1928 . The road was first able to be kept open all winter by 1931 , and in 1934 it was numbered Primary State Highway 2 in addition to US 10 . The highway was paved between 1931 and 1939 . 
 SR 906 came to be the name of the highway during the construction of Interstate 90 over the pass . Parts of US 10 were not up to the new Interstate Highway System standards , so a new limited @-@ access highway was built , bypassing older alignments of roadway . The roadway now known as SR 906 was a bypassed section of the old Sunset Highway that was not up to Interstate Highway standards on May 11 , 1967 .

 Vijender Singh was born in a Jat family on 29 October 1985 in <unk> village , 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from Bhiwani , Haryana . His father , <unk> Singh <unk> , is a bus driver with the Haryana Roadways , while his mother is a homemaker . His father drove extra buses for overtime pay so as to pay for Vijender and his elder brother Manoj 's education . Vijender did his primary schooling in <unk> , secondary schooling in Bhiwani middle from happy sr <unk> school <unk> and finally received a bachelor 's degree from <unk> College . In 1990 , boxer Raj Kumar Sangwan got the Arjuna Award ; so the craze for boxing in India increased . The sport became one of the main job avenues in India . In order to ensure a better life for their poor family , Vijender and his elder brother Manoj decided to learn boxing . Vijender was inspired by his elder brother Manoj , a former boxer himself , to join the sport of boxing . After Manoj succeeded in entering the Indian Army in 1998 with his boxing credentials , he decided to support Vijender financially so he could continue his boxing training . Vijender 's parents decided to not pressurise him to continue his studies , as they felt that he had a talent and passion for boxing . For Vijender , boxing quickly grew from an interest and passion to a career choice . 
 He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club , where former national @-@ level boxer and Jagdish Singh recognised his talent . Working part @-@ time , he even tried his hand at modelling to financially support his coaching . The first recognition for Vijender came when he won a bout in the state level competition . Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub @-@ junior nationals in 1997 and went on to bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals . In 2003 , he became the all @-@ India youth boxing champion . The turning point , however , came in the 2003 Afro @-@ Asian Games . Despite being a junior boxer , Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal . 
 His boxing style , hooks and uppercut are compared by the media with the style of actor Sylvester Stallone as the character Rocky Balboa in the Rocky film series . Vijender cites him as one his primary influences , along with boxers Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali , and boxing promoter Don King . 
 Vijender Singh is married to Archana Singh . The couple have one child <unk> Singh .

 Vijender competed at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics , in the welterweight division , but lost to Mustafa <unk> of Turkey by a score of 20 – 25 . At the 2006 Commonwealth Games , he defeated England 's Neil Perkins in the semifinal but lost to South Africa 's <unk> <unk> in the final , thus leaving with a bronze medal . He decided to move up in weight and Vijender took part in the middleweight ( 75 kg ) division at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha , where he won the bronze medal in a lost semifinal bout against Kazakhstan 's Bakhtiyar Artayev with the final score of 24 – 29 . Initially Vijender was not supposed to compete because of a back injury , but he recovered in time to win the tournament and qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 Among his preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics was a period spent early in that year when he trained with German boxers in their own country . This training incorporated a tournament involving boxers from around Europe , in one event of which Singh won gold having beaten a German in the process . At The President 's Cup boxing tournament , which is touted as a dress rehearsal for the Olympic games , Vijender defeated Artayev in a quarterfinal bout . Speaking after this , Vijender sounded confident of his physical shape . Talking about his preparation for the Beijing Olympics , Vijender said : 
 " I did not do well the last time because then I was young and did not have the experience . I have just made it to the senior level and qualified for the Olympics . Now I have the experience . I have won medals at major tournaments like the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games . Recently , I also beat the 2004 Olympic Games gold medallist [ Bakhtiyar ] Artayev [ in the AIBA President 's Cup ] , so I have done quite well at the international level . So , definitely , everyone can expect a good showing from me in Beijing . " 
 " Now I have quite a lot of experience after competing at the international level regularly . I just want to say that Indian boxers are no longer a weak lot ; all are doing well at the international level . Our boxing graph is going up all the time and the rest of the world is now scared to face Indian boxers . "
