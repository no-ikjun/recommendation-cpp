 After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987 , Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars , and had unofficially canceled the sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi . At that point , the prequels were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of " The Star Wars " . Nevertheless , technical advances in the late 1980s and 1990s continued to fascinate Lucas , and he considered that they might make it possible to revisit his 20 @-@ year @-@ old material . After Star Wars became popular once again , in the wake of Dark Horse 's comic book line and Timothy Zahn 's trilogy of novels , Lucas saw that there was still a large audience . His children were older , and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing . By 1993 , it was announced , in Variety among other sources , that he would be making the prequels . He began penning more to the story , now indicating the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker 's fall to the dark side . Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals ; at first they were supposed to be a " filling @-@ in " of history tangential to the originals , but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin 's childhood and ended with his death . This was the final step towards turning the film series into a " Saga " . 
 In 1994 , Lucas began writing the screenplay to the first prequel , titled Episode I : The Beginning . Following the release of that film , Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two , and began work on Episode II , The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography , and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales , a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles , to polish it . Unsure of a title , Lucas had jokingly called the film " Jar Jar 's Great Adventure " . In writing The Empire Strikes Back , Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the " Clone Wars " mentioned by Princess Leia in A New Hope ; he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone <unk> from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were repelled by the Jedi . The basic elements of that backstory became the plot basis for Episode II , with the new wrinkle added that Palpatine secretly orchestrated the crisis . 
 Lucas began working on Episode III before Attack of the Clones was released , offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles . As he reviewed the storyline that summer , however , he says he radically re @-@ organized the plot . Michael Kaminski , in The Secret History of Star Wars , offers evidence that issues in Anakin 's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes , first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice , Count Dooku , murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter 's turn towards the dark side . After principal photography was complete in 2003 , Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin 's character , re @-@ writing his entire turn to the dark side ; he would now turn primarily in a quest to save Padmé 's life , rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several , including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic . This fundamental re @-@ write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage , and new and revised scenes filmed during pick @-@ ups in 2004 . 
 Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series ; much of it stemmed from the post ‐ 1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon . Michael Kaminski explained that these exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure . Kaminski rationalized that since the series ' story radically changed throughout the years , it was always Lucas ' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective . When congratulating the producers of the TV series Lost in 2010 , Lucas himself jokingly admitted , " when Star Wars first came out , I didn 't know where it was going either . The trick is to pretend you 've planned the whole thing out in advance . Throw in some father issues and references to other stories – let 's call them homages – and you 've got a series " . 
 = = = = Sequel trilogy = = = = 
 A sequel trilogy was reportedly planned ( Episodes VII , VIII and IX ) by Lucasfilm as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy ( Episodes IV , V and VI ) , released between 1977 and 1983 . While the similarly discussed Star Wars prequel trilogy ( Episodes I , II and III ) was ultimately released between 1999 and 2005 , Lucasfilm and George Lucas had for many years denied plans for a sequel trilogy , insisting that Star Wars is meant to be a six @-@ part series . In May 2008 ( 2008 @-@ 05 ) , speaking about the upcoming Star Wars : The Clone Wars film , Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy : " I get asked all the time , ' What happens after Return of the Jedi ? , ' and there really is no answer for that . The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker , and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father , that 's where that story ends . " 
 In January 2012 , Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller arthouse films . Asked whether the criticism he received following the prequel trilogy and the alterations to the original trilogy had influenced his decision to retire , Lucas said : " Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are ? " 
 Despite insisting that a sequel trilogy would never happen , George Lucas began working on story treatments for three new Star Wars films in 2011 . In October 2012 , The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that Star Wars Episode VII would be released in 2015 . Later , it was revealed that the three new upcoming films ( Episodes VII @-@ IX ) would be based on story treatments that had been written by George Lucas prior to the sale of Lucasfilm . The co @-@ chairman of Lucasfilm , Kathleen Kennedy became president of the company , reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn . In addition , Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films , with franchise creator and Lucasfilm founder Lucas serving as creative consultant . The screenplay for Episode VII was originally set to be written by Michael Arndt , but in October 2013 it was announced that writing duties would be taken over by Lawrence Kasdan and J. J. Abrams . On January 25 , 2013 , The Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced J. J. Abrams as Star Wars Episode VII 's director and producer , along with Bryan Burk and Bad Robot Productions . 
 On November 20 , 2012 , The Hollywood Reporter reported that Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg will write and produce Episodes VIII and IX . Kasdan and Kinberg were later confirmed as creative consultants on those films , in addition to writing stand @-@ alone films . In addition , John Williams , who wrote the music for the previous six episodes , has been hired to compose the music for Episodes VII , VIII and IX . 
 On March 12 , 2015 , Lucasfilm announced that Looper director Rian Johnson would direct Episode VIII with Ram Bergman as producer for Ram Bergman Productions . Reports initially claimed Johnson would also direct Episode IX , but it was later confirmed he would write only a story treatment . When asked about Episode VIII in an August 2014 interview , Johnson said " it 's boring to talk about , because the only thing I can really say is , I 'm just happy . I don 't have the terror I kind of expected I would , at least not yet . I 'm sure I will at some point . " It was originally scheduled to be released on May 26 , 2017 , but it 's delayed for December 15 , 2017 . J. J. Abrams will serve as executive producer .

 On February 5 , 2013 , Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed the development of two stand @-@ alone films , each individually written by Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg . On February 6 , Entertainment Weekly reported that Disney is working on two films featuring Han Solo and Boba Fett . Disney CFO Jay <unk> has described the stand @-@ alone films as origin stories . Kathleen Kennedy explained that the stand @-@ alone films will not crossover with the films of the sequel trilogy , stating , " George was so clear as to how that works . The canon that he created was the Star Wars saga . Right now , Episode VII falls within that canon . The spin @-@ off movies , or we may come up with some other way to call those films , they exist within that vast universe that he created . There is no attempt being made to carry characters ( from the stand @-@ alone films ) in and out of the saga episodes . Consequently , from the creative standpoint , it 's a roadmap that George made pretty clear .

" Additionally , Kathleen Kennedy and Kiri Hart confirmed that the stand @-@ alone films will be labeled as " anthology films " . Edwards stated that the style of the film will be similar to that of a war film , stating , " It 's the reality of war . Good guys are bad . Bad guys are good .

 The term Expanded Universe ( EU ) is an umbrella term for officially licensed Star Wars material outside of the six feature films . The material expands the stories told in the films , taking place anywhere from 25 @,@ 000 years before The Phantom Menace to 140 years after Return of the Jedi . The first Expanded Universe story appeared in Marvel Comics ' Star Wars # 7 in January 1978 ( the first six issues of the series having been an adaptation of the film ) , followed quickly by Alan Dean Foster 's novel Splinter of the Mind 's Eye the following month . 
 Despite Disney 's acquisition of the product , George Lucas retains artistic control over the Star Wars universe . For example , the death of central characters and similar changes in the status quo requires his approval before authors were allowed to proceed . In addition , Lucasfilm Licensing and the new Lucasfilm Story Group devote efforts to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across companies . Elements of the Expanded Universe have been adopted by Lucas for use in the films , such as the name of capital planet Coruscant , which first appeared in Timothy Zahn 's novel Heir to the Empire before being used in The Phantom Menace . Additionally , Lucas so liked the character <unk> <unk> , who was introduced in Dark Horse Comics ' Star Wars series , that he included her as a character in Attack of the Clones . 
 A radio adaptation of the original 1977 film was first broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981 . The adaptation was written by science fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden . It was followed by adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back in 1983 and Return of the Jedi in 1996 . The adaptations included background material created by Lucas but not used in the films . Mark Hamill , Anthony Daniels , and Billy Dee Williams reprised their roles as Luke Skywalker , C @-@ 3PO , and Lando Calrissian , respectively , except in Return of the Jedi in which Luke was played by Joshua Fardon and Lando by Arye Gross . The series also used John Williams ' original score from the films and Ben Burtt 's original sound designs . 
 While Lucasfilm strived to maintain internal consistency between the films and television content with the expanded universe , only the films and the second Clone Wars television series are regarded as absolute canon , since Lucas worked on them directly . On April 25 , 2014 — anticipating future film installments — the company announced that they had devised a " story group " to oversee and co @-@ ordinate all creative development . The first new on @-@ screen canon to be produced will be the television series Star Wars Rebels . Previous EU titles will be reprinted under the " Legends " banner .

 Following the success of the Star Wars films and their subsequent merchandising , several animated television series have been created : 
 Star Wars : Droids ; also known as Droids : The Adventures of R2 @-@ D2 and C @-@ 3PO , which premiered in September 1985 , focused on the travels of R2 @-@ D2 and C @-@ 3PO as they shift through various owners / masters , and vaguely fills in the gaps between the events of Episode III and Episode IV . 
 Star Wars : Ewoks ; also known as Ewoks , was simultaneously released in September 1985 and focused on the adventures of Wicket and various other recognizable Ewok characters from the original trilogy in the years leading up to Episode VI . 
 Star Wars : Clone Wars ; an animated micro @-@ series created by Genndy Tartakovsky ( Dexter 's Laboratory , Samurai Jack , etc . ) , which aired on Cartoon Network from November 2003 to March 2005 .

The series will take place during the original trilogy and the setting will be remote from the front line of war . Following the Disney purchase , this series was put on indefinite hold . 
 A live @-@ action television project has been in varying stages of development at Lucasfilm since 2005 , when George Lucas announced plans for a television series set between the prequel and original trilogies . The proposed series explores criminal and political power struggles in the aftermath of the fall of the Republic . Approximately fifty scripts have been written – Ronald D. Moore was one of the project 's enlisted writers – and , as of December 2015 , are still in possible development at Lucasfilm .

 Star Wars @-@ based fiction predates the release of the first film , with the 1976 novelization of Star Wars ( ghost @-@ written by Alan Dean Foster and credited to Lucas ) . Foster 's 1978 novel , Splinter of the Mind 's Eye , was the first Expanded Universe work to be released . In addition to filling in the time between the original 1977 film and The Empire Strikes Back , this additional content greatly expanded the Star Wars timeline before and after the film series . Star Wars fiction flourished during the time of the original trilogy ( 1977 – 83 ) but slowed to a trickle afterwards . In 1992 , however , Timothy Zahn 's <unk> trilogy debuted , sparking a new interest in the Star Wars universe . Since then , several hundred tie @-@ in novels have been published by Bantam and Del Rey . A similar resurgence in the Expanded Universe occurred in 1996 with the Steve Perry novel Shadows of the Empire , set in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi , and accompanying video game and comic book series . 
 <unk> radically changed the face of the Star Wars universe with the introduction of the New Jedi Order series , which takes place some 20 years after Return of the Jedi and stars a host of new characters alongside series originals . For younger audiences , three series have been introduced . The Jedi Apprentice series follows the adventures of Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi and his master Qui @-@ Gon Jinn in the years before The Phantom Menace . The Jedi Quest series follows the adventures of Obi @-@ Wan and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones . The Last of the Jedi series follows the adventures of Obi @-@ Wan and another surviving Jedi almost immediately , set in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope . 
 Following Disney 's purchase of the franchise , Disney Publishing Worldwide also announced that Del Rey would publish a new line of canon Star Wars books under the Lucasfilm Story Group being released starting in September on a bi @-@ monthly schedule . The Star Wars Legends banner would be used for those Extended Universe materials that are in print . 
 Marvel Comics published Star Wars comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986 . A wide variety of creators worked on this series , including Roy Thomas , Archie Goodwin , Howard Chaykin , Al Williamson , Carmine Infantino , Gene Day , Walt Simonson , Michael Golden , Chris Claremont , Whilce Portacio , Jo Duffy , and Ron Frenz . The Los Angeles Times Syndicate published a Star Wars newspaper strip by Russ Manning , Goodwin and Williamson with Goodwin writing under a pseudonym . In the late 1980s , Marvel announced it would publish a new Star Wars comic by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy . However , in December 1991 , Dark Horse Comics acquired the Star Wars license and used it to launch a number of ambitious sequels to the original trilogy instead , including the popular Dark Empire stories . They have since gone on to publish a large number of original adventures set in the Star Wars universe . There have also been parody comics , including Tag and Bink . On January 3 , 2014 , Marvel Comics — itself a Disney subsidiary since 2009 — announced that it would once again publish Star Wars comic books and graphic novels , taking over from Dark Horse , with the first release arriving on January 14 , 2015 .

 The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non @-@ canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy . In recent years , this has ranged from writing fan @-@ fiction to creating fan films . In 2002 , Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards , officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre .

Fan @-@ fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible , but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in @-@ universe fiction entries . 
 While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story , they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon . However , the lead character from the Pink Five series was incorporated into Timothy Zahn 's 2007 novel Allegiance , marking the first time a fan @-@ created Star Wars character has ever crossed into the official canon .

 Before Disney 's acquisition of the franchise , George Lucas had established a partnership in 1986 with the company 's Walt Disney Imagineering division to create Star Tours , an attraction that opened at Disneyland in 1987 . The attraction also had subsequent incarnations at other Disney theme parks worldwide . 
 The attractions at Disneyland and Disney 's Hollywood Studios closed in 2010 , at Tokyo Disneyland in 2012 , and at Disneyland Paris in 2016 to allow the rides to be converted into Star Tours – The Adventures Continue . The successor attraction opened at Disney 's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland in 2011 , and Tokyo Disneyland in 2013 . 
 Jedi Training : Trials of the Temple is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the Jedi Knights and the Force to become Padawan learners . The show is present at Disney 's Hollywood Studios and at the Tomorrowland Terrace at Disneyland . 
 From 1997 to 2015 , Walt Disney World 's Disney 's Hollywood Studios park hosted an annual festival , Star Wars Weekends , during specific dates from May to June .

 The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on modern American pop culture . Both the films and characters have been parodied in numerous films and television . 
 Notable film parodies of Star Wars include Hardware Wars , a 13 @-@ minute 1978 spoof which Lucas has called his favorite Star Wars parody , and Spaceballs , a feature film by Mel Brooks which featured effects done by Lucas ' Industrial Light & Magic . 
 Lucasfilm itself made two mockumentaries : Return of the Ewok ( 1982 ) , about Warwick Davis , who portrayed Wicket W. Warrick in Return of the Jedi ; and R2 @-@ D2 : Beneath the Dome ( 2002 ) , which depicts R2 @-@ D2 's " life story " . 
 There have also been many songs based on , and in , the Star Wars universe . " Weird Al " Yankovic recorded two parodies : " Yoda " , a parody of " Lola " by The Kinks ; and " The Saga Begins " , a parody of Don McLean 's song " American Pie " that retells the events of The Phantom Menace from Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi 's perspective . 
 In television , the creators of the Robot Chicken series have produced three television specials satirizing the Star Wars films ( " Robot Chicken : Star Wars " , " Episode II " , and " III " ) , and are developing an animated comedy series based in the Star Wars universe . The creators of the Family Guy series have also produced three Star Wars specials titled " Blue Harvest " , " Something , Something , Something , Dark Side " and " It 's a Trap ! " . Following Disney 's <unk> of the franchise , a Phineas and Ferb parody of Star Wars aired in the summer of 2014 . 
 During the 2012 Emerald City Comicon in Seattle , Washington , several prominent cartoon voice actors , consisting of Rob Paulsen , Jess Harnell , John DiMaggio , Maurice LaMarche , Tara Strong and Kevin Conroy , performed a parody reading of A New Hope as a radio play in each of their signature voice roles ; i.e. Paulsen and Harnell as Yakko and Wakko Warner from Animaniacs , Strong as Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls and Timmy Turner from The Fairly <unk> , LaMarche and DiMaggio as Kif <unk> and Bender from Futurama , and Conroy narrating as Batman . 
 When Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) , a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming ICBMs , the plan was quickly labeled " Star Wars " , implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Reagan 's acting career . According to Frances FitzGerald , Reagan was annoyed by this , but Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle told colleagues that he " thought the name was not so bad . " ; " ' Why not ? ' he said . ' It 's a good movie . Besides , the good guys won . ' " This gained further resonance when Reagan described the Soviet Union as an " evil empire " . 
 In 2013 , Star Wars became the first major motion picture translated into the Navajo language . 
 Between 2002 and 2004 , museums in Japan , Singapore , Scotland and England showcased the Art of Star Wars , an exhibit describing the process of making the Star Wars trilogy . 
 During the winter of 2015 , Chicago based theater company , Under the Gun Theater developed a parody revue which recapped all six of the Star Wars films as a lead up to the release of Star Wars : The Force Awakens . 
 In 1989 , the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry , as being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . " Its sequel , The Empire Strikes Back , was selected in 2010 . Despite these callings for archival , it is unclear whether copies of the 1977 and 1980 theatrical sequences of Star Wars and Empire — or copies of the 1997 Special Edition versions — have been archived by the NFR , or indeed if any copy has been provided by Lucasfilm and accepted by the Registry .

 = Stone Rollin ' = 
 Stone Rollin ' is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Raphael Saadiq , released on March 25 , 2011 , by Columbia Records . Inspired by the loud , raw sound of his live performances , Saadiq worked with recording engineer and long @-@ time collaborator Chuck Brungardt to produce a grittier , more aggressive sound than on his previous records . Most of the instruments played on the album were performed by Saadiq , and with the help of arranger Paul Riser and engineer Gerry Brown , he incorporated string and orchestral arrangements to the songs . 
 Stone Rollin ' expands on the traditional soul music style of his 2008 album The Way I See It , with songs incorporating rhythm and blues , rock , funk , and blues styles . A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq 's best work , the record was noted for its stylistic breadth , groove @-@ based compositions , varied subject matter , and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard . It also became Saadiq 's highest @-@ charting album in the United States , reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200 . He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2008 , Saadiq released his third album The Way I See It , which featured 1960s Motown Sound @-@ inspired songs with traditional soul music influences . The album was also an exemplary release of the " classic soul revival " during its peak at the time , a music scene marked by similarly retro @-@ minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele , independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap @-@ Kings and Mayer Hawthorne , and older artists making comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette . In promoting the album , Saadiq broadened his audience demographic and expanded as a touring artist , playing various music festivals throughout Europe and the United States . Along with the musical aesthetic of the album , Saadiq himself adopted a vintage soul image , donning old @-@ fashioned attire and performing traditional R & B dance moves at shows . His touring also inspired his approach for Stone Rollin ' , as he considered the louder , raw sound and general feeling of performing live . 
 Saadiq has said of his creative intentions with the follow @-@ up , " I ’ ve never shut my ears to anything , really . It ’ s not like I ’ m always looking for things , either , but I can ’ t close my ears to any music . Any guitar , any drums , any rhythm section — I ’ ve always been open to those things , trying to understand what makes them work in a song " . He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley , and has cited blues musician Howlin ' Wolf as an influence on the album 's sound , which he described as " bluesy " and " harder " than that of his previous album , with more aggressive tempos . In an interview for <unk> Magazine , Saadiq explained his idea of the album 's title , stating " Stone Rollin ' basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life . That 's what I 've done my whole career — taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take . Stone Rollin ' means I 'm going all the way out there this time " . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Saadiq recorded Stone Rollin ' at Blakeslee Recording Company , his recording studio complex in Los Angeles , California . He spent approximately one year working on the album , including writing its music and lyrics . He worked on the album 's production with recording engineer and long @-@ time collaborator Chuck Brungardt . The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques , which they had applied in recording The Way I See It . However , for Stone Rollin ' , they sought to eschew its predecessor 's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style , in keeping with Saadiq 's other musical projects . 
 According to Brungardt , the recording of the project 's earlier songs , " Heart Attack " , was critical in their decision for the album . The song was recorded during Saadiq 's break from touring for The Way I See It and had originally featured that album 's sound , with which they were not satisfied . When they revisited the song , Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track 's individually recorded instrument parts , with the exception of the vocals and some of its drums . In an interview for EQ Magazine , Brungardt said of their approach , " We wanted to evolve the songs , and I wanted to evolve the engineering , as well . On The Way I See It , everything was pretty much tube pre 's and tube compressors . On this one , I wanted to play around with some of the more solid @-@ state gear " . 
 Some of the album 's songs were recorded by Saadiq with his live band , which included drummer Lemar Carter , bassist Calvin Turner , and guitarist Rob Bacon . Bacon , who had played with Saadiq since 2002 , said of their grittier approach to guitar , " I have relative pitch , as opposed to perfect pitch , so there 'd be times when I 'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument . Then he 'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before . On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff that was out of tune . Raphael was like , ' That 's what makes it funky ! ' " . Musical guests such as vocalist <unk> Nagano , keyboardist Larry Dunn , bass player Larry Graham , keyboardist Amp Fiddler , and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album 's recording sessions , with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks . The song " Go to Hell " was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler 's Mellotron ideas . Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called " The Perfect Storm " , included as a hidden track on the album : " I played bass , but I put my bass down [ laughs ] . The first day I tried to play bass for him , I couldn 't even play . I froze three times . He 's my all @-@ time idol ! " . 
 For the majority of the recordings , Saadiq played most of the instruments , including bass , keyboard , guitar , Mellotron , percussion , and drums , and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards . Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq 's instrument part . Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio 's control room , an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown . According to Brungardt , " [ Saadiq 's ] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence . Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed " . With the songs ' guitar parts , Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier , guitar sound for the songs , a stylistic preference Saadiq and him had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time . He applied several techniques to achieve this sound , including increasing the gain on Saadiq 's Fender Twin guitar amplifier , using a software plug @-@ in for the recordings in post @-@ production , and re @-@ amping Saadiq 's guitar parts . In his interview for EQ Magazine , Brungardt discussed using a Massey <unk> , one of his preferred plug @-@ ins , in the recording process , stating " I ’ ll use that on a lot of things to get a little more grit . It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that ’ s a little too bright . I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing " . 
 For several songs , Saadiq incorporated lush orchestration and strings as predominant elements . He worked on the orchestral recording with arranger Paul Riser and Gerry Brown at Ocean Way Recording 's Studio B in Los Angeles , while the songs ' horn parts were mostly recorded at the Blakeslee studio . Brown also worked with Saadiq on the album 's tracking at Blakeslee . The album was mixed using Pro Tools in Blakeslee Recording Company 's Studio A , with the SSL 4000 used mostly for monitoring , and using the SSL 9000 in the " C " room . During mixing , Brungardt used equalization filters such as a <unk> FilterBank plug @-@ in and Waves Renaissance EQ to handle excessive high end in spots , and he utilized other equipment for additional sound effects , including a Line 6 Echo Farm , a Roland Space Echo , and an Echoplex clone . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Stone Rollin ' expands on the Motown @-@ inspired material of Saadiq 's previous album and includes various other R & B styles . Along with mid @-@ tempo soul songs , Stone Rollin ' features styles such as early R & B @-@ rooted rock and roll , rock @-@ inspired funk , Chess Records @-@ blues , and the more expansive orchestral sound of post @-@ Detroit Motown and 1970s Philadelphia soul . Disc jockey Chris Douridas described Saadiq 's sound as " a hybrid form that 's rooted in these familiar elements from classic soul but recontextualized with a modern sound " . Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic called the album 's songs " belters " and " guitar @-@ heavy " , and wrote of its musical influences , " While Prince informs the sound of this more than anybody , it 's a very early- ' 70s sounding album on the whole [ ... ] but there are influences that go back even further than that - Ray Charles and Little Richard in particular inform some of this record 's more energetic moments . " Los Angeles Times journalist Mikael Wood said of the album 's sound and production , " Where Saadiq 's previous efforts <unk> in the layering and the fine @-@ tuning made possible by modern recording gear , Stone Rollin ' presents a rawer , rowdier soul @-@ rock sound modeled after his energetic stage show " . 
 Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq 's compositions are characterized by " groove rather than song " . Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are " tied together by the Mellotron , a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings , but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings " , adding that " Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading " . Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed " a little less Motown gloss " than The Way I See It and " a little more rock grit in Saadiq ’ s grooves , heavy on the Sly Stone ( witness the opening ' Heart Attack ' ) , late ' 50s / early ' 60s Isley Brothers ( the joyful ' Radio ' ) , and Ray Charles ( ' Day Dreams ' ) , to say nothing of the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc , sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ( ' The Answer ' ) . " Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs ' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq " <unk> each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man ’ s existence and experience " . 
 The opening track , " Heart Attack " , is a rock and roll / soul song that incorporates driving bass , reverberating rhythm guitar , and a four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor drum beat . It is an homage to one of Saadiq 's musical idols , Sly Stone , and was inspired by Sly and the Family Stone songs " M <unk> " and " Dance to the Music " , whose burbling background vocals are referenced in " Heart Attack " . Saadiq said he wanted to open Stone Rollin ' " with that sense of urgency , that global soul and rock & roll feel " . On " Got to Hell " , he alludes to his adopted surname with the line " I 'm going to be a warrior of everything I say " ; " Saadiq " means " man of his word " in Arabic . He played a rockabilly style of guitar on " Radio " , which portrays a disapproving woman as the personification of mainstream radio : " I met this girl named Radio / said her signal was low / she wasn 't getting my sound " . According to Saadiq , the line " I tried to move away / she found me the very next day " alludes to his affinity for his musical roots and those of rock and roll . The album 's title track was written as an ode to curvaceous , full @-@ figured women , backed by a sound Saadiq described as " dirty , more of like a Chicago Blues , Rolling Stones dirty record ... the <unk> joint " on the album . 
 " Movin ' Down the Line " , an ode to a love unrequited , features mellow horns , jangling guitar , heavy bass lines , and a swelling string and piano conclusion . In the opinion of Lloyd Bradley , the song exemplifies the album 's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production : " It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today ’ s sounds ; but Saadiq 's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w @-@ a @-@ a @-@ ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down in a completely different era . The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time , and is utterly irrepressible for it " . Containing a psychedelic funk sound , " Just Don 't " is sung from the point of view of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him . The song features guest vocals by <unk> Nagano and an extended Moog solo played by Larry Dunn . " Good Man " contains plaintive lyrics , a hook co @-@ written and sung by vocalist <unk> Stinson , and lyrics about a man mourning his partner 's unfaithfulness . The album 's closing track , " The Answer " , features a wistful , jazz @-@ funk sound , and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility . Saadiq said , " I always have a song similar to that on my albums . I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time . So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you , and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them " .

 Stone Rollin ' was released in March 2011 by Columbia Records . In the United States , it debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200 , selling 21 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . It was Saadiq 's highest @-@ charting album on the Billboard 200 . By May , the album had sold 32 @,@ 100 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . Stone Rollin ' was promoted with the release of three singles : " Radio " on December 21 , 2010 , " Good Man " on February 15 , 2011 , and the title track on March 22 . A music video for " Good Man " was filmed by Isaiah <unk> , featuring fashion model Yaya DaCosta and actor Chad Coleman . Saadiq performed the title track on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , and on Conan . 
 Stone Rollin ' received widespread acclaim from critics and was one of the year 's best reviewed records . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 86 , based on 20 reviews ; Writing for AllMusic , Kellman deemed it more than a " period @-@ piece " and " the high point of Saadiq ’ s career , his exceptional output with Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! included " , while Kevin Ritchie from Now said he exhibited " the electrifying fervour and meticulous musicianship typical of his stage show " on the record . Steve Horowitz from PopMatters wrote that the album " shows off Saadiq 's genius as a singer , writer , instrumentalist , and producer of modern rhythm and blues that pays homage to its traditions " , adding that it does not have " a false step or even a dull note " . In MSN Music , Robert Christgau said Saadiq " plays with himself to beat the band " like Prince and " makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse . And then you notice even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs . " However , he perceived a drop @-@ off from The Way I See It in terms of songwriting and catchiness , singling out " Got to Hell " , " Day Dreams " , and " Good Man " as the highlights . Slant Magazine 's Matthew Cole was more critical , finding the record too involved in fabricating retro sensibilities " to leave a lasting impression of its own ... even the highlights are complacent genre exercises " . 
 At the end of 2011 , Stone Rollin ' was named one of the year 's best albums in several critics ' top @-@ 10 lists ; it was ranked at number one by Thomas Fawcett from The Austin Chronicle , number three by James Reed of The Boston Globe , number six by Los Angeles Times critic Todd Martens , and number seven by Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot , who also called it Saadiq 's greatest work : " He 's always written songs steeped in soul and R & B , but now he gives them a progressive edge with roaming bass lines and haunted keyboard textures . He 's no longer a retro stylist – he 's writing new classics . " " Good Man " was nominated for the 2012 Grammy Award for Best Traditional R & B Performance .

 = = Plot = = 
 It is May 2154 , and a pair of genetically enhanced humans , referred to as " Augments " , leave their home planet and take control of a Klingon Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey warship after killing the crew . Amid threats and protests by the Klingons , Starfleet tasks the newly refurbished Enterprise to stop the culprits . Captain Archer visits disgraced scientist Doctor Arik Soong , imprisoned for stealing augmented embryos , and transfers him from a holding facility . On @-@ board , Soong soon recognises his augments are responsible for the actions on board the Klingon vessel , but does not know why . He convinces Archer that he will be able to order his " children " to stand down without a fight . 
 Enterprise enters an area of space known as the " Borderland " between the territories of the Klingons and Orions . They are attacked by two Orion vessels and several crew members are captured , including T 'Pol ( newly granted the Starfleet rank of Commander ) . They are taken to a slave market and Archer is forced to ask for Soong 's assistance to rescue his crew .

 The three episode arc was an attempt to connect the events of Enterprise with The Original Series . It featured the augments , genetically engineered humans from 20th century Earth who had been featured previously in " Space Seed " and Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , both featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan Noonian Singh . The mini @-@ arc which began with " Borderland " was one of several plots during season 4 that sought to link the series closer to The Original Series and The Next Generation due to ongoing low ratings . 
 It was not originally planned to include an ancestor of Noonien Soong in the episode , with executive producer Manny Coto instead planning for the character to be Colonel Phillip Green from The Original Series episode " The Savage Curtain " . The character was to be a straight forward villain , but after discussion with The Next Generation Spiner , the character was re @-@ written to become Arik Soong , described as a " misunderstood genius " . It was Spiner 's first Star Trek role since the film Star Trek Nemesis in 2002 , having previously played Arik Soong 's descendant Noonien Soong and his creations Data and Lore in The Next Generation . 
 " Borderland " was the 80th episode of Enterprise , which was one more episode than the entire run of The Original Series . The episode featured the return of the Orion race , which had been featured in The Original Series episodes " The Cage " and " Whom Gods Destroy " . Actors portraying Orions included Bobbi Sue Luther and WWE wrestler Big Show . Luther subsequently explained that she was " familiar with the show but never really watched it " , and thanked her fiancé Robert Hall for explaining her role as an Orion slave girl to her . She researched the role on the internet after she received the script , in particular the portrayal by Susan Oliver in Star Trek 's original pilot , " The Cage " . It took four hours of make @-@ up work for Luther to be ready , and she described the costume as slightly <unk> than she was used to as a lingerie and bikini model . Despite the application of isopropyl alcohol , Luther said that it took days for the remnants of the make @-@ up to be removed . 
 Before broadcast , it was rumoured that the character of Vice Admiral Maxwell Forrest ( Vaughn Armstrong ) would be killed off in the episode . His death came three episodes later in " The Forge " . It was the last appearance in the Star Trek franchise by J.G. Hertzler , best known for playing Martok in Deep Space Nine . Appearing once again as a Klingon , he was allowed to choose his own costume from the prop department and decided to re @-@ use the outfit worn by Michael Ansara as Kang in the DS9 episode " Blood Oath " . Several items from the episode were sold on eBay as part of the It 's A Wrap ! sale and auction . These included the Orion costumes worn by Big Show and others , a unique Orion console created for the slave market , and a variety of Orion <unk> .

 " Borderland " first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 29 , 2004 . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . Robert Bianco highlighted the episode as one to watch in his preview column for USA Today . Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune praised the return of Brent Spiner to Star Trek , saying " Surprise , fear , elation , self @-@ control ; they 're all given masterful life by Spiner in the space of a few seconds . " The reviewer at IGN thought that the episode was a return to the quality of " Broken Bow " , and praised the abilities of Spiner . The teaser trailer was compared to that of a Quentin Tarantino film , and a score of 3 / 5 was given saying " Executive Producer Manny Coto has a long way to go if he has any hope of making up for Enterprise 's transgressions the past three years but if this three episode story arc lives up to the promise shown in Borderland , he might just pull it off . " Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a " C " grade rating . She said that she liked the premise of the episode , but felt that the execution was sub @-@ par , describing the augments as " <unk> " and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer . The mini @-@ arc featuring the episodes " Borderland " , " Cold Station 12 " and " The Augments " were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt .

 Bhatti was already known to EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part , as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street at the same time . Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef . In fact , Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef , as she " thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need — which is a very ambiguous but charming quality ! " Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming . He explained : " They 're so welcoming . There 's a lot of joking about . I 'm having a great time at EastEnders - it 's a real privilege to be here . I 've known Nitin and Nina Wadia , who plays Zainab , for a very long time and we 've always got on very well . Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it 's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards . " 
 Yusef is introduced as part of a storyline involving the Masood family . Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef is introduced to Tamwar 's parents Masood and Zainab , Masood " explodes " with anger at the sight of him , recognising him as a man from their past . Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire , all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen : " we are only playing it from each person 's point of view . Yusef is playing it from his point of view that he did try and save her . Masood is saying , ' All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire ' . " Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist . In March 2011 , Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011 , and would " see from there " . He made his first appearance on 23 November 2010 . Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying , " He 's very much an arch @-@ villain - he 's a great character who 's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods ' relationship . Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they 're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly , it 's exciting . It 's exciting for us to play . " 
 Bhatti 's departure was not announced . When a fire was reported to be happening around Christmas 2011 , rumours emerged from an alleged EastEnders insider that " Yusef has long been tipped as a possible fatality " . The insider added " This is the biggest fire EastEnders has ever seen and there will be casualties . It is such a huge disaster that it will affect most of the families on the show in one way or another . There is a great tradition at EastEnders of captivating Christmas Day storylines and this year is no different . " Yusef 's death aired on 26 December 2011 concluding his storyline . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 On the EastEnders website , Yusef is described as calm , collected , strong @-@ willed , mysterious , loyal to Afia and regretful of his past . Daniel Maier from The Guardian said that Yusef " is clearly a wrong ' un but it 's hard to tell exactly what his game is . You suspect he 's not sure himself . A <unk> Without Portfolio , most of his time seems taken up with malicious glances and general <unk> . " Susan Hill from the Daily Star called Yusef " twisted " , while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror called him " smug , deceitful and dangerous " . Wadia opined that Yusef is not evil but much more complex than that , and his personality would be explored during his storyline . Bhatti told Inside Soap that Yusef has " more bad qualities than good " but is insecure because when Zainab left him , it brought shame on his family .

 In an interview with Digital Spy , Bhatti described his relationship with his daughter Afia , explaining that they have a " strong bond " and that Yusef would die for his daughter . He said that " it definitely hurts " when he finds out that Tamwar and Afia are already married as he is so close to Afia and she has betrayed him . In an interview with Inside Soap , Bhatti admits that he is sympathetic for his character , Yusef . He said that Yusef is very insecure and that he can understand his behaviour in some ways . Meanwhile , discussing the fan reaction to his character , Bhatti admitted that women have told him that he 's a " bad man " . Bhatti also hinted that Yusef will become more firmly established as a Walford villain over the next few weeks , stating that Yusef does have more bad qualities than good and that fans call him " Dr. Evil " . 
 Yusef is wrongly accused of having an affair with Zainab , due to his sister @-@ in @-@ law overhearing them speaking . A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster . When <unk> sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they 're having an affair and everyone struggles to come to terms with what they have heard . Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob . Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror , he said that it 's a great compliment however , it was a complete surprise . Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character , but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits .

 In April 2011 , it was reported that Masood would kidnap Yusef , pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire . Yusef will then go to the Masood 's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done . An EastEnders insider told the News of the World , " Masood has never got over that . Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured . But Yusef will get his own back . It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages . It 's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef 's meddling . [ ... ] Yusef obviously wants [ Zainab ] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab . " Ganatra said that Yusef will turn " very manipulative and very nasty " and Masood finds him as a big threat saying , " He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood . [ ... ] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood 's life , really , and the way you do that is to get to his family . It 's a very clever way of doing things — it 's not about destroying his family , it 's about winning his family and turning them against him , so that Masood is left isolated and on his own . " Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying , " I think there 's rumours of revenge ! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he 's a very exciting character to throw into the mix . If it goes that way , it 's more drama for us to play . " The scenes were broadcast on 2 June 2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood .

 In late 2011 , Yusef manages to win his former wife back . They later make plans to get married . Nina Wadia explains why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef . Wadia said to Inside Soap : " He tells Zainab that he was forced to start the fire by his family . Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match , and that he ran into the house to save her . And by the end of this conversation , she finds herself saying to him , ' Let 's get married ' - regardless ! Obviously , it was something I struggled to get my head around . But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply . She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault , because she walked out on their marriage . " Wadia continued : " It doesn 't look like Zainab 's going to listen . But as Denise leaves , it 's clear she 's torn about what to do . " A short time before their wedding day arrives , Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally . He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son , Kamil , to control her . Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real @-@ life violence . She told BBC News : " I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women . They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they 're isolated from their friends and family . The manipulator can take advantage , so it 's to prove that it can even happen to people like her . To be honest , if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there 's some difference made to her life , I 'll feel like we 've done our job , " she continued . " It is a serious issue and I 'm glad it 's being highlighted . I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women , I know that there are abused men out there as well . So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that , we 'll have done our job . " The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in <unk> viewers at <unk> BBC Three 's repeat of the episode later secured <unk> viewers at 10pm . 
 Wadia admitted to feeling " emotionally drained " after her scenes with Ace Bhatti . She explained to The People : " It 's very draining . I 'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly is a reality for so many women . Zainab 's confidence has been steadily eroded . She 's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef 's control . He wants revenge . She is totally in his power . I had to show this can happen to any woman , no matter how strong she seems . Zainab was strong and not naive , but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots . But both Ace and I have found it hard to do . I 've known Ace for a long time and we 're good friends . He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through . " Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham , which specializes in abuse within Asian families . 
 Wadia warns that Yusef will ultimately get worse as time progresses . She said to Inside Soap : " I was filming out on location recently with Ace and a bunch of women came over to him and said , ' God , you 're such a horrible man ! ' It 's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven 't even seen the worst of Yusef yet ! " Wadia continued : " Let 's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see . Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love , and she definitely has feelings for him . It 's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan , it will be the end for her . I wouldn 't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that 's going to happen . " 
 Nitin Ganatra who plays Masood Ahmed explains to Digital Spy Masood 's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away . " Masood goes crazy over this ! " Nitin replies . " I 've got kids myself , and I know I 'd react the same way if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody 's house who the child doesn 't even know . Masood is still the only person who can see Yusef for what he really is , so he goes into a blind panic over the situation . Masood calls in the police , and they make sure that Kamil is safe , but we 're left to wonder if he will stay that way . The police say that they can 't get involved in domestic disputes , so Masood says , ' Well , what about the father 's rights ? If a mother reported this , you 'd see it as kidnap ' . I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment , Masood 's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don 't have access to their children in the same way . " 
 Asked what Masood 's reactions are over Zainab 's abuse , Nitin says : " Masood tells Denise , ' It 's just another one of Zainab 's dramas ' , but then there comes a point where he sees bruises on Zainab . Then Masood becomes very concerned for Zainab in a very genuine way . It also might reignite something between the two of them as well , as they have to work together to solve these problems . " The scenes showing Masood and Denise race to the café where Kamil was raised 8 @.@ 26 million viewers . BBC Three 's repeat screening later secured <unk> viewers at 10pm .

BBC News branded Yusef as " Zainab 's sinister first husband " , elsewhere , <unk> described Yusef as a " deceptive doctor " . Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a " stroke of genius " .

 = New York State Route 23 = 
 New York State Route 23 ( NY 23 ) is an east – west state highway in the eastern portion of New York in the United States . It extends for 156 @.@ 15 miles ( 251 @.@ 30 km ) from an intersection with NY 26 in the Central New York town of Cincinnatus to the Massachusetts state line in the Berkshire Mountains , where it continues east as that state 's Route 23 . Along the way , it passes through many communities , including the cities of Norwich and Oneonta . Outside of the communities , the route serves largely rural areas of the state and traverses the Catskill Mountains in the state 's Central New York Region . NY 23 crosses the Hudson River at Catskill via the Rip Van Winkle Bridge . 
 Sections of what is now NY 23 were part of unsigned legislative routes as early as 1908 ; however , NY 23 itself was not assigned until 1924 . At the time , the route extended from Oneonta to Massachusetts and followed a slightly different alignment from Cairo to Claverack via Hudson that took the route along modern County Route 23B ( CR 23B ) in eastern Greene County . NY 23 was extended west to Norwich in the mid @-@ 1920s and to NY 26 in northwestern Chenango County in 1930 . The route was gradually moved onto its current alignment between Cairo and Claverack in the 1950s and 1960s , and realigned on its western end in 1984 to serve Cortland County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 23 has three distinct sections : its western third in Central New York and the Central New York Region ( formerly Leatherstocking ) , the middle in the Catskills , and east of the Hudson River . Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) ; however , some sections are either locally maintained or owned by other agencies . In the city of Norwich , NY 23 is entirely city @-@ owned and maintained . Farther east in the city of Oneonta , the route is city @-@ maintained from the western city line to James F. Lettis Highway . Finally , the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and its approaches are maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Central New York = = = 
 The highway begins at a junction with NY 26 in Cincinnatus , a town in eastern Cortland County . It heads east across the <unk> River and through the hamlet of Lower Cincinnatus before curving to the northeast and crossing into Chenango County very soon afterward . Across the county line , it continues northeast through a lightly developed valley surrounding <unk> Creek to the Pharsalia State Wildlife Management Area , where it connects with CR 42 , a highway that was once part of NY 23 . From here , the route heads southeastward along another valley , this one surrounding Canasawacta Creek , to the city of Norwich , the county seat of Chenango County . It heads east – west across the city on Pleasant and Rexford streets , passing through mostly residential areas and intersecting with NY 12 at Broad Street . 
 On the eastern fringe of Norwich , NY 23 passes over the Chenango River and leaves the valley holding the river and the city , utilizing a gap in the valley wall formed by Ransford Creek . The waterway ends shortly afterward ; however , the route continues on , winding its way eastward into the town of New Berlin and the small hamlet of South New Berlin , situated in another valley surrounding the Unadilla River . Here , it connects to NY 8 , another major north – south route . The route crosses the river just east of South New Berlin , putting it into the equally hilly and rural Otsego County . After 6 @.@ 5 miles ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) of isolated areas , NY 23 encounters the village of Morris , the first of several villages along the route . In the village center , it briefly joins NY 51 along Morris ' main street . 
 Beyond Morris , the route continues in an easterly direction with a generally southern trend through rolling farmland until its turns south again at the Laurens hamlet of West Laurens . A brief easterly turn 5 miles ( 8 km ) later at West Oneonta takes it across Otego Creek to a junction with NY 205 on the eastern side of the creek 's valley . NY 23 joins NY 205 here , and the two highways enter the western outskirts of the nearby city of Oneonta . At Chestnut Street , the first intersection that the route has in the city 's vicinity , NY 23 leaves NY 205 to follow Chestnut Street . While NY 205 continues south toward the National Soccer Hall of Fame , NY 23 heads east toward downtown Oneonta . Just one block later , however , it meets NY 7 , which comes in from the southwest on Oneida Street . NY 7 turns east at this point to follow NY 23 into the city limits . 
 The two routes serve as Oneonta 's main street , following Chestnut and Main streets across the city 's western and central areas . Along the way , NY 7 and NY 23 pass Hartwick College and serve Oneonta 's central business district . NY 23 breaks from NY 7 just northeast of downtown to follow James F. Lettis Highway , a four @-@ lane divided highway , south into the southern half of the city . As it heads south on the arterial , it connects to Interstate 88 ( I @-@ 88 ) at an interchange on the northern bank of the Susquehanna River . NY 28 — which overlaps with I @-@ 88 from Oneonta to exit 17 northeast of the city — leaves the freeway here , following NY 23 across the river to a large commercial district on the south bank . NY 28 leaves NY 23 here to proceed to the southwest while NY 23 goes eastward past several large strip malls and big @-@ box retailers on its way out of both Oneonta and Otsego County .

 In the adjacent Delaware County , NY 23 initially follows a generally easterly routing through the Charlotte Creek valley . Here , the land gets more forested and the amount of houses decrease as it crosses the county . After Davenport , a hamlet 8 miles ( 13 km ) east of Oneonta , the road begins to climb onto the Catskill Plateau . By the time it intersects NY 10 at the village of Stamford , it has already reached an elevation of 1 @,@ 820 feet ( 555 m ) above sea level . Not far to the east of the NY 10 junction , it crosses the West Branch of the Delaware River , by this point a small brook as the river 's source is located just 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the north . It maintains this elevation during a brief , 2 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) foray into Schoharie County that leads the route around a pair of 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 914 m ) mountains situated south of the county line . 
 Elevation drops slightly upon reaching the hamlet of Grand Gorge within the town of Roxbury , located just above a small pond alongside NY 30 that gives rise to the Delaware 's East Branch . NY 23 intersects NY 30 in the hamlet 's center before making a sharp bend to the south as it approaches the Schoharie Reservoir , located 3 miles ( 5 km ) southeast of Grand Gorge . The route passes by the reservoir 's southern tip before it enters Greene County and the town of Prattsville . Just inside the county , a bridge carries the highway over Schoharie Creek and into the next community , the hamlet of Prattsville . Pratt Rock , a series of rock carvings depicting the life of <unk> Pratt — the tanner and politician who lent his name to the town — is located just east of the hamlet . 
 Southeast of Prattsville hamlet , NY 23A splits off from NY 23 to continue along Schoharie Creek while the latter climbs in elevation again along Batavia Kill . Shortly past Red Falls , all crossings of the creek come to mark the Blue Line that delineates the Catskill Park . The route remains to the north of the creek even as it passes the Windham Mountain ski area and NY 296 comes in from the south . However , it crosses it several times and is within the park as it reaches its highest point , 1 @,@ 940 feet ( 591 m ) at the pass next to Windham High Peak where the Long Path crosses the road . From here , NY 23 begins a long descent down the Catskill Escarpment , losing most of the elevation it had gained since leaving Oneonta . As it does so , the route provides sweeping , panoramic views of the Capital District and points north , east and west . Along this stretch is Five State Lookout , a vista providing views of five states and four mountain ranges , including the Adirondack foothills and Green Mountains in Vermont . 
 Having reached the floor of the Hudson Valley , NY 23 assumes a southeast @-@ trending route through the town of Cairo . It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo , but bypasses it on a four @-@ lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community . As it runs around Cairo , the route connects to NY 145 and briefly overlaps NY 32 , the major north – south state route on the west side of the Hudson River . NY 23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill , where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 87 ) . Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill , the county seat of Greene County . NY 23 bypasses this community as well , connecting to U.S. Route 9W ( US 9W ) and NY 385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge . 
 = = = East of the Hudson = = = 
 Once across the bridge and into Columbia County , the highway encounters NY 9G near the <unk> State Historic Site in western Greenport . The two highways briefly overlap until NY 9G continues north with NY 23B to follow NY 23 's old course into and through the city of Hudson . NY 23 continues to the southeast , bypassing Hudson well to the south and serving Columbia – Greene Community College , located in an otherwise forested area of Greenport . After 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , the route meets US 9 at an isolated junction due south of Hudson . US 9 and NY 23 overlap for 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) across more open but still largely undeveloped areas to a small , unnamed community on the western edge of Bell Pond , a small waterbody in the northeast corner of the town of Livingston . 
 In the center of the hamlet , US 9 and NY 23 encounter a complex intersection that features a total of four routes . At the junction , US 9 continues to the southwest while NY 82 continues southeast along NY 23 's course . NY 23 , meanwhile , picks up US 9 's routing , overlapping with NY 9H in a northerly direction that takes both highways across <unk> Creek and into the equally rural town of Claverack . The routes remain overlapped into the hamlet of Claverack , where NY 23B comes in from the west and finishes its alternate loop of NY 23 . At the same junction , NY 23 leaves the north – south NY 9H to resume an east – west alignment toward the Massachusetts state line . 
 Shortly after the NY 9H junction , NY 217 splits off to the northeast toward Philmont . The road continues southeastward from NY 217 , crossing over Claverack Creek and leaving the built @-@ up hamlet of Claverack for countryside more open and less rugged than that in the Catskills . It proceeds generally easterly across mostly undeveloped fields to Martindale , a small community at the interchange linking NY 23 to the Taconic State Parkway . From here , NY 23 follows a creek valley southeast and east into Hillsdale , where the route connects to NY 22 , a north – south highway that closely parallels New York 's eastern state line for most of its length . Almost 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the east , NY 23 reaches the state line , where it becomes Massachusetts Route 23 as it serves the bi @-@ state Catamount Ski Area .

 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 5 , an unsigned legislative route that extended from Kingston in the south to Mohawk in the north . From Oneonta to Grand Gorge , Route 5 utilized modern NY 23 . The portion of what is now NY 23 from Grand Gorge to Prattsville was designated as part of Route 38 in 1909 while the segment between the Delaware – Greene County line and Catskill ( via modern CR 23B ) became Route 5 @-@ a in 1911 . On March 1 , 1921 , Route 38 was realigned to enter Grand Gorge from the northeast on modern NY 30 while Route 5 @-@ a was renumbered to Route 47 and extended northwest to Grand Gorge over the former routing of Route 38 . 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the Oneonta – Grand Gorge segment of legislative Route 5 and all of Route 47 became part of NY 23 , which continued east from Catskill to the Massachusetts state line southwest of Great Barrington , Massachusetts . It initially overlapped with NY 10 ( later US 9W ) northward along modern NY 385 to Athens , where it crossed the Hudson River via a ferry to Hudson . It continued east from Hudson on what is now NY 23B to Claverack , where it joined its modern alignment to Massachusetts . NY 23 was extended westward to NY 12 in Norwich in the mid @-@ 1920s . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 23 was extended west along a previously unnumbered roadway to NY 26 in northwest Chenango County . From Norwich to North Pharsalia , NY 23 followed its modern alignment ; between North Pharsalia and NY 26 , NY 23 was routed on modern CR 42 .

 On July 2 , 1935 , the Rip Van Winkle Bridge over the Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic . It became part of a realigned NY 23 after the Athens – Hudson ferry shut down in the late 1940s . NY 23 utilized modern NY 23B between the bridge and Hudson . Plans were made in the early 1950s to construct a southern bypass of the city of Hudson between the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and NY 23 midway between Claverack and <unk> . Construction on the portion of the highway between the bridge and US 9 south of Hudson began in the mid @-@ 1950s and was completed in the late 1950s as a realignment of NY 23 . Ultimately , this was the only section that was built ; as a result , NY 23 overlapped with US 9 and NY 9H to reach its former alignment in Claverack . 
 NY 145 was extended eastward along NY 23 from Cairo to Catskill c . 1940 . Both routes were realigned in the 1960s to follow a new arterial between Cairo and the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in Catskill . The first segment of the highway , a northerly bypass of the hamlet of Cairo , opened c . 1961 . The remainder of the arterial was completed in the mid @-@ 1960s . NY 145 was truncated back to Cairo on January 1 , 1970 . Much of NY 23 's former routing between Cairo and the Catskill village line is now CR 23B ; however , a 0 @.@ 63 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 01 km ) segment in Jefferson Heights between exit 21 of the New York State Thruway and a town road named Austin Acres is state @-@ maintained as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 In July 1984 , NY 23 was realigned west of North Pharsalia to follow a new highway between NY 26 in Cincinnatus and North Pharsalia . The length of the Chenango County portion of the new alignment was 8 @.@ 40 miles ( 13 @.@ 52 km ) , roughly double that of NY 23 's old routing ( 4 @.@ 39 miles or 7 @.@ 07 kilometres ) . The 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) of state highway mileage for the new road in Chenango County came from NY 23 's former routing and NY 319 near Norwich , both of which were transferred to Chenango County after the new highway was completed .

 NY 23A ( 34 @.@ 56 miles or 55 @.@ 62 kilometres ) is an alternate route of NY 23 through Greene County .

 Just as Pam Halpert 's ( Jenna Fischer ) maternity leave ends and Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) also returns , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) is assigned with the task of forming a team and traveling down to Florida for three weeks to help Sabre launch a chain of retail stores . He and Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) must select employees to accompany Dwight to Tallahassee . At first Dwight chooses Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) , Phyllis Vance ( Phyllis Smith ) , Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) , Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) , and Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) , but Andy refuses to let so many essential employees leave for three weeks . While letting Dwight have Darryl and Phyllis , Andy chooses Kelly Kapoor ( Mindy Kaling ) , Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) and Cathy Simms ( Lindsey Broad ) to join the team instead , upsetting Dwight . Dwight then prematurely announces the picks and deliberately riles up the employees , hoping to change the team . Andy decides to let people convince him why they should go before making his final decision . 
 Meanwhile Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) receives a text from Robert California inviting him on the trip to Tallahassee . After unsuccessfully trying to back out via text , Jim and Pam both agree Jim should just go . During Jim 's request session with Andy and Dwight , Jim shows the texts from California , shocking both Andy and Dwight , making it all but official that Jim will be going to Tallahassee . The final team includes Cathy , Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) , Stanley Hudson ( Leslie David Baker ) , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) and Jim , infuriating Dwight . At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds , but after realizing they all have excellent ideas for the project , he is content with the team . 
 Erin expresses frustration that Andy is still with Jessica . After Andy and Dwight jointly choose her for the project team , she relates in a talking head that she is not going to return to Scranton once she arrives in Florida . At the end of the episode , it is revealed that Cathy has ulterior motives for the trip , intending to seduce Jim while the two are in Florida together , stating , during a cell phone conversation to an unidentified friend , that " ... Definitely we will . It 's three weeks in Tallahassee . What else is there to do ? " 
 Darryl discovers warehouse worker Val ( Ameenah Kaplan ) has knitted him a beanie . Unsure if she intended it as a romantic gift or simply one of friendship , Darryl decides to find out by giving her a Valentine 's Day gift of an expensive pair of cashmere ladies ' gloves with a romantic card . Upon discovering that Val had knitted a beanie for everyone in the warehouse , an embarrassed Darryl passes the gloves off to warehouse worker Nate ( Mark Proksch ) , who 's moved by the gift . Darryl is further disappointed when a man named Brandon calls asking for the address of the warehouse to send flowers to his girlfriend Val . He 's intrigued , however , when she says the flowers were from her mother , despite him pointing out the caller had had a deep voice and gone by the name Brandon . Darryl decides Val 's gift was " a love beanie " .

 " Special Project " received mainly positive reviews from critics , with many looking forward to the " special projects " plotline . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised the episode and the introduction of the special projects plotline , comparing it to the third season arc featuring Jim in Stamford , Connecticut , and the " Michael Scott Paper Company " arc from the fifth season . He praised the episode for feeling " like a big answer to many of the issues that have plagued the show so far this season " , specifically pointing to Dwight 's meta @-@ commentary on Cathy 's " lack of personality " . He moreover wrote that he was looking forward to the rest of the season and the change in dynamic . Despite this , he criticized Dwight 's role in the episode , comparing his orientation to Michael 's conference room lectures and wrote he had a " distaste " for the broader moments for the character . He ultimately gave the episode an A- , his highest grade for an eighth @-@ season episode . 
 New York writer Michael Tedder gave the episode a positive review for avoiding the " cutesy " moments that were featured in the first half of the season . He praised several of the cast members ' performances in the episode , including Ellie Kemper and Mark Proksch . He also complimented the sub @-@ plot featuring Darryl and Val , but wrote that the producers should just get the two together , because " Not every ongoing plotline needs to last all season " . IGN writer Cindy White wrote a positive review for the episode for allowing the " less prominent characters of the ensemble " to get some lines in the episode , specifically mentioning Stanley and Ryan . She also complimented the Darryl @-@ Val subplot , writing that they 're one of the few romantic pairings on the show that she 's " rooting " for . She ultimately gave the episode an 8 @.@ 0 / 10 , calling it " impressive " . 
 However , not all reviews were positive . Lizzie <unk> of Buzz Sugar wrote that while the " special projects " storyline has potential , " this week just kind of landed flat for me " . Brian Marder of Hollywood called the episode a " giant step back " , especially following the previous episode which he called " promising " . He wrote that the jokes and story of the episode went " nowhere " and he criticized the episode for its loud , " laugh @-@ track @-@ worthy " jokes compared to the early seasons of the series that featured more subtle humor . Despite the mostly negative review , he wrote that he hoped the episode would lead to a better storyline in the following episodes . The ending scene featuring Cathy 's phone conversation about Jim and Pam 's marriage has also received significant attention . Cindy White criticized the suggestion that Cathy will break Jim and Pam , calling it a " cheap plow " and that if Cathy and Jim would have an affair , it would cause " serious damage to [ Jim 's ] character " , while Myles McNutt felt it would allow Cathy to become an actual character in the series . 
 = Distributed element filter = 
 A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance , inductance and resistance ( the elements of the circuit ) are not localised in discrete capacitors , inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters . Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass , but to block others . Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors , and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model , which considers each element to be " lumped together " at one place . That model is conceptually simple , but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases , or equivalently as the wavelength decreases . The distributed element model applies at all frequencies , and is used in transmission line theory ; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line . In the distributed view of circuits , the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together . The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance , but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate " lumped " capacitors and inductors . There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band ( wavelength less than one metre ) . 
 Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters , such as selectivity of radio channel , <unk> of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel . Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the <unk> possible with lumped elements ( low @-@ pass , band @-@ pass , etc . ) with the exception of high @-@ pass , which is usually only approximated . All filter classes used in lumped element designs ( Butterworth , Chebyshev , etc . ) can be implemented using a distributed element approach . 
 There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters , but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line . These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line , and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors , capacitors or resonators , as required by the filter . 
 The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World War II . Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required . When the war ended , the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed @-@ communication networks , such as television broadcasters . Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass @-@ produced consumer items , such as the converters ( figure 1 shows an example ) used with satellite television dishes . 
 = = General comments = = 
 The symbol λ is used to mean the wavelength of the signal being transmitted on the line or a section of line of that electrical length . 
 Distributed element filters are mostly used at frequencies above the VHF ( Very High Frequency ) band ( 30 to 300 MHz ) . At these frequencies , the physical length of passive components is a significant fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency , and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model . The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration . A common rule of thumb is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than <unk> The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ . The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher as a result of these advances . On the other hand , antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model . 
 The most noticeable difference in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped @-@ element approximation is that the former will have multiple passband replicas of the lumped @-@ element prototype passband , because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals . These spurious passbands are undesirable in most cases . 
 For clarity of presentation , the diagrams in this article are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format . This does not imply an industry preference , although planar formats ( that is , formats where conductors consist of flat strips ) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques . The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques ( with suitable adjustments to dimensions ) and can be adapted to coaxial cables , twin leads and waveguides , although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others . The open wire implementations , for instance , of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures . Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs . 
 = = History = = 
 Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II . A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937 . Mason had filed a patent much earlier , in 1927 , and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis . Mason and Sykes ' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use . Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter @-@ measures . A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory , but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved . 
 Some important advances in network theory were needed before filters could be advanced beyond wartime designs . One of these was the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards . Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length ( or in some cases multiples of the unit length ) , although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances . Richards ' transformation allows a lumped element design to be taken " as is " and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation . 
 The difficulty with Richards ' transformation from the point of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included series connected elements . This was not possible to implement in planar technologies and was often inconvenient in other technologies . This problem was solved by K. Kuroda who used impedance transformers to eliminate the series elements . He published a set of transformations known as Kuroda 's identities in 1955 , but his work was written in Japanese and it was several years before his ideas were incorporated into the English @-@ language literature . 
 Following the war , one important research avenue was trying to increase the design bandwidth of wide @-@ band filters . The approach used at the time ( and still in use today ) was to start with a lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form . This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five ( see Band @-@ pass filters below for an explanation of Q ) . In 1957 , Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype . This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave , corresponding to a Q of about 1 @.@ 3 . Some of Young 's procedures in that paper were empirical , but later , exact solutions were published . Young 's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators , but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types , such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article . The capacitive gap filter ( figure 8 ) and the parallel @-@ coupled lines filter ( figure 9 ) are examples of directly coupled resonators . 
 The introduction of printed planar technologies greatly simplified the manufacture of many microwave components including filters , and microwave integrated circuits then became possible . It is not known when planar transmission lines originated , but experiments using them were recorded as early as in 1936 . The inventor of printed stripline , however , is known ; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951 . This caught on rapidly , and Barrett 's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats , especially triplate and microstrip . The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate . 
 Early stripline directly coupled resonator filters were end @-@ coupled , but the length was reduced and the compactness successively increased with the introduction of parallel @-@ coupled line filters , interdigital filters , and comb @-@ line filters . Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei , and also including Leo Young mentioned above , in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers . The hairpin filter was first described in 1972 . By the 1970s , most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described . More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters , such as pseudo @-@ elliptic , while still using the same basic topologies , or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline . 
 The initial non @-@ military application of distributed element filters was in the microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks . These links were also used by other industries with large , fixed networks , notably television broadcasters . Such applications were part of large capital investment programs . However , mass @-@ production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems . An emerging application is in superconducting filters for use in the cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies . 
 = = Basic components = = 
 The simplest structure that can be implemented is a step in the characteristic impedance of the line , which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics . This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line . Figure 4 ( a ) shows a step up in impedance ( narrower lines have higher impedance ) . A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4 ( a ) . The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor , or more exactly , as a low @-@ pass T circuit as shown in figure 4 ( a ) . Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order . These impedance transformers can be just a short ( often λ / 4 ) length of transmission line . These composite structures can implement any of the filter families ( Butterworth , Chebyshev , etc . ) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter . This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour . Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters ( the so @-@ called semi @-@ lumped structures ) . 
 Another very common component of distributed element filters is the stub . Over a narrow range of frequencies , a stub can be used as a capacitor or an inductor ( its impedance is determined by its length ) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator . Short @-@ circuit , nominally quarter @-@ wavelength stubs ( figure 3 ( a ) ) behave as shunt LC <unk> , and an open @-@ circuit nominally quarter @-@ wavelength stub ( figure 3 ( b ) ) behaves as a series LC resonator . Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and , as would be expected from their resonant nature , are most useful in band @-@ pass applications . While open @-@ circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies , they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit ( see figure 4 ( b ) ) , often leading to a preference for short @-@ circuit stubs ( one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ / 4 to or from the length ) . 
 A helical resonator is similar to a stub , in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it , but is actually built using lumped elements . They are built in a non @-@ planar format and consist of a coil of wire , on a former and core , and connected only at one end . The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core . It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose . They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and <unk> bands . 
 Coupled lines ( figures 3 ( c @-@ e ) ) can also be used as filter elements ; like stubs , they can act as resonators and likewise be terminated short @-@ circuit or open @-@ circuit . Coupled lines tend to be preferred in planar technologies , where they are easy to implement , whereas stubs tend to be preferred elsewhere . Implementing a true open circuit in planar technology is not feasible because of the dielectric effect of the substrate which will always ensure that the equivalent circuit contains a shunt capacitance . Despite this , open circuits are often used in planar formats in preference to short circuits because they are easier to implement . Numerous element types can be classified as coupled lines and a selection of the more common ones is shown in the figures . 
 Some common structures are shown in figures 3 and 4 , along with their lumped @-@ element counterparts . These lumped @-@ element approximations are not to be taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range . Figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) show a short @-@ circuit and open @-@ circuit stub , respectively . When the stub length is λ / 4 , these behave , respectively , as anti @-@ resonators and resonators and are therefore useful , respectively , as elements in band @-@ pass and band @-@ stop filters . Figure 3 ( c ) shows a short @-@ circuited line coupled to the main line . This also behaves as a resonator , but is commonly used in low @-@ pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest . Figures 3 ( d ) and 3 ( e ) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band @-@ pass filters . The structures of figures 3 ( c ) and 3 ( e ) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line . Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open @-@ wire circuits but not with a planar technology . These two structures are therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element . 
 = = Low @-@ pass filters = = 
 A low @-@ pass filter can be implemented quite directly from a ladder topology lumped @-@ element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5 . The filter consists of alternating sections of high @-@ impedance and low @-@ impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped @-@ element implementation . Low @-@ pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current ( DC ) bias to active components . Filters intended for this application are sometimes referred to as chokes . In such cases , each element of the filter is λ / 4 in length ( where λ is the wavelength of the main @-@ line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source ) and the high @-@ impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance . Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped @-@ element counterpart . As well as the planar form shown , this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor . 
 A more complex example of stepped impedance design is presented in figure 6 . Again , narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors , but in this case , the lumped @-@ element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line . This topology can be used to design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband . However , calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m @-@ derived filters instead , which perform well and are much easier to calculate . The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection . However , beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator , the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open @-@ circuit . For this reason , filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped @-@ impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter . This also ensures good rejection at high frequency . 
 Another common low @-@ pass design technique is to implement the shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband . This implementation has a lumped @-@ element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6 . Where space allows , the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line as shown in figure 7 ( a ) . The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response . However , a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design . If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line , the stub may be inconveniently wide . In these cases , a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel . That is , each stub position has a stub on both sides of the line . A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ / 2 length of line formed by the two stubs together . For a choke design , the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible , for which the maximum stub width of λ / 4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line . The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5 , but has been designed on completely different principles . A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined . A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre @-@ line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response . For a wide stub , however , calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern . One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs . A pair of radial stubs in parallel ( one on either side of the main line ) is called a butterfly stub ( see figure 7 ( b ) ) . A group of three radial stubs in parallel , which can be achieved at the end of a line , is called a clover @-@ leaf stub . 
 = = Band @-@ pass filters = = 
 A band @-@ pass filter can be constructed using any elements that can resonate . Filters using stubs can clearly be made band @-@ pass ; numerous other structures are possible and some are presented below . 
 An important parameter when discussing band @-@ pass filters is the fractional bandwidth . This is defined as the ratio of the bandwidth to the geometric centre frequency . The inverse of this quantity is called the Q @-@ factor , Q. If ω1 and ω2 are the frequencies of the passband edges , then : 
 bandwidth <formula> , 
 geometric centre frequency <formula> and 
 <formula> 
 = = = <unk> gap filter = = = 
 The capacitive gap structure consists of sections of line about λ / 2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled " end @-@ on " by gaps in the transmission line . It is particularly suitable for planar formats , is easily implemented with printed circuit technology and has the advantage of taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would . The limitation of this topology is that performance ( particularly insertion loss ) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth , and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5 . A further difficulty with producing low @-@ Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths . The minimum width of gaps , like the minimum width of tracks , is limited by the resolution of the printing technology . 
 = = = Parallel @-@ coupled lines filter = = = 
 Parallel @-@ coupled lines is another popular topology for printed boards , for which open @-@ circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of nothing more than the printed track . The design consists of a row of parallel λ / 2 resonators , but coupling over only λ / 4 to each of the neighbouring resonators , so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9 . Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter , but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower @-@ Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process . One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers . In this way , the lines can be coupled across their width , which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge @-@ to @-@ edge , and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance . For other ( non @-@ printed ) technologies , short @-@ circuit lines may be preferred since the short @-@ circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q @-@ reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support . Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons , there is little preference for open @-@ circuit over short @-@ circuit coupled lines . Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance . Both types of parallel @-@ coupled filters , in theory , do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies ( e.g. , stubs ) . However , suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice , so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency . 
 The hairpin filter is another structure that uses parallel @-@ coupled lines . In this case , each pair of parallel @-@ coupled lines is connected to the next pair by a short link . The " U " shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter . In some designs the link can be longer , giving a wide hairpin with λ / 4 impedance transformer action between sections . The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle , which produces a large discontinuity , and a smooth bend , which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products . Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available . The lumped @-@ element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped @-@ impedance discontinuity . Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph at the top of the article . 
 = = = Interdigital filter = = = 
 Interdigital filters are another form of coupled @-@ line filter . Each section of line is about λ / 4 in length and is terminated in a short @-@ circuit at one end only , the other end being left open @-@ circuit . The end which is short @-@ circuited alternates on each line section . This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies , but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case . The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars , and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy . As with the parallel @-@ coupled line filter , the advantage of a mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated . The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure ; as such , higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved , and Q values as low as 1 @.@ 4 are possible . 
 The comb @-@ line filter is similar to the interdigital filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support . In the case of the comb @-@ line , all the lines are short @-@ circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends . The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground , and the design is consequently classified as semi @-@ lumped . The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide , that is , free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest . 
 = = = Stub band @-@ pass filters = = = 
 As mentioned above , stubs lend themselves to band @-@ pass designs . General forms of these are similar to stub low @-@ pass filters except that the main line is no longer a narrow high impedance line . Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from , some of which produce identical responses . An example stub filter is shown in figure 12 ; it consists of a row of λ / 4 short @-@ circuit stubs coupled together by λ / 4 impedance transformers . The stubs in the body of the filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles , an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages . The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti @-@ resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti @-@ resonators . A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ / 4 open @-@ circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ / 4 impedance transformers , although this structure is not possible in planar technologies . 
 Yet another structure available is λ / 2 open @-@ circuit stubs across the line coupled with λ / 4 impedance transformers . This topology has both low @-@ pass and band @-@ pass characteristics . Because it will pass DC , it is possible to transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors . Also , since short @-@ circuit links are not required , no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline . The disadvantages are ( i ) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ / 4 stub filter , since the stubs are all twice as long ; ( ii ) the first spurious passband is at <unk> , as opposed to <unk> for the λ / 4 stub filter . 
 Konishi describes a wideband 12 GHz band @-@ pass filter , which uses 60 ° butterfly stubs and also has a low @-@ pass response ( short @-@ circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response ) . As is often the case with distributed element filters , the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be spurious . 
 = = High @-@ pass filters = = 
 Genuine high @-@ pass filters are difficult , if not impossible , to implement with distributed elements . The usual design approach is to start with a band @-@ pass design , but make the upper stopband occur at a frequency that is so high as to be of no interest . Such filters are described as pseudo @-@ high @-@ pass and the upper stopband is described as a vestigial stopband . Even structures that seem to have an " obvious " high @-@ pass topology , such as the capacitive gap filter of figure 8 , turn out to be band @-@ pass when their behaviour for very short wavelengths is considered . 
 = Harold Larwood = 
 Harold Larwood ( 14 November 1904 – 22 July 1995 ) was a professional cricketer for Nottinghamshire and England between 1924 and 1938 . A right @-@ arm fast bowler who combined unusual speed with great accuracy , he was considered by many commentators to be the finest bowler of his generation . He was the main exponent of the bowling style known as " bodyline " , the use of which during the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) tour of Australia in 1932 – 33 caused a furore that brought about a premature and acrimonious end to his international career . 
 A coal miner 's son who began working in the mines at the age of 14 , Larwood was recommended to Nottinghamshire on the basis of his performances in club cricket , and rapidly acquired a place among the country 's leading bowlers . He made his Test debut in 1926 , in only his second season in first @-@ class cricket , and was a member of the 1928 – 29 touring side that retained the Ashes in Australia . The advent of the Australian batsman Don Bradman ended a period of English cricket supremacy ; Larwood and other bowlers were completely dominated by Bradman during Australia 's victorious tour of 1930 . Thereafter , under the guidance of England 's combative captain Douglas Jardine , the fast leg theory or bodyline bowling attack was developed . With Larwood as its spearhead the tactic was used with considerable success in the 1932 – 33 Test series in Australia . The Australians ' description of the method as " unsportsmanlike " soured cricketing relations between the two countries ; during subsequent efforts to heal the breach , Larwood refused to apologise for his bowling , since he was carrying out his captain 's instructions . He never played for England after the 1932 – 33 tour , but continued his county career with considerable success for several more seasons . 
 In 1949 , after years out of the limelight , Larwood was elected to honorary membership of the MCC . The following year he and his family were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia , where he was warmly welcomed , in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days . He worked for a soft drinks firm , and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides . He paid several visits to England , and was honoured at his old county ground , Trent Bridge , where a stand was named after him . In 1993 , at the age of 88 , he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in a delayed recognition of his services to cricket . He died two years later . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Harold Larwood was born on 14 November 1904 in the Nottinghamshire village of Nuncargate , near the coal mining town of Kirkby @-@ in @-@ Ashfield . He was the fourth of five sons born to Robert Larwood , a miner , and his wife Mary , née Sharman . Robert was a man of rigid principles , a disciplinarian teetotaller who was treasurer of the local Methodist chapel . His chief pastime was playing cricket for the village team , which he captained . Harold Larwood 's biographer Duncan Hamilton writes that for Robert , cricket represented , " along with his dedication to God ... the core of his life " . 
 From the age of five , Harold attended Kirkby Woodhouse school . Over the years this small village school produced , besides Larwood , four other international cricketers who became his contemporaries in the Nottinghamshire county side : William " Dodge " <unk> , Sam Staples , Bill Voce and Joe Hardstaff junior . On leaving the school in 1917 , when he was 13 , Harold was employed at the local miners ' cooperative store , before beginning work the following year at Annesley Colliery in charge of a team of pit ponies . He had shown an early talent for cricket , and began to play for Nuncargate 's second team in 1918 . Playing against experienced adults , in his first season he took 76 wickets at an average of 4 @.@ 9 . By 1920 he was in the first team , alongside his father , playing in <unk> because the family could not afford to buy him proper cricket boots . 
 = = Cricket career = = 
 = = = County recruit = = = 
 Despite his short stature ( at 18 he was only 5 feet 4 inches tall ) , Larwood had acquired considerable stamina and upper body strength from his long shifts at the mine and could bowl at a disconcertingly fast speed . Among those who watched his rising prowess as a fast bowler was Joe Hardstaff senior , the Nottinghamshire and England cricketer who lived in Nuncargate . Hardstaff , who had worked with Robert Larwood at the mine , suggested to the youthful bowler that he should attend a trial at the county ground . In April 1923 father and son made the journey to Trent Bridge . 
 In the practice nets , the county players towered over Larwood ; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought he looked more like a jockey than a cricketer . At first he bowled badly , and his efforts were unimpressive . As his confidence increased his bowling improved , and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement ; when the session ended , Larwood was offered a playing contract . He accepted instantly ; the terms were 32 shillings ( £ 1 @.@ 60 ) per week — the same as his mining wages — and he was expected , when not playing , to carry out ground staff duties . Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms , but according to Hamilton , Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine , even for a single summer . 
 In the 1923 season , under the eye of the county 's coach , James Iremonger , Larwood concentrated on building his physique and on learning bowling skills . He grew a few inches in height , although he remained short for a fast bowler , and under Iremonger 's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight . Besides his physical development , he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts , among them accuracy in line and length , variation of pace and grip , and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing . That year he played intermittently for the county 's Second XI , and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs . 
 Larwood was first called for full county duty on 20 August 1924 , against Northamptonshire , at Trent Bridge . He bowled 26 overs in all , conceded 71 runs and took the wicket of Vallance Jupp , an experienced Test all @-@ rounder . His assessment of his performance was negative : " I wasn 't ready " . Iremonger was much more positive , assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning . Larwood had also gained the support of the county captain , Arthur Carr , a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler . " The best way to deal with him " , Carr said later , " was as if he was my own son " . Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler 's talents , and acted as Larwood 's guiding spirit throughout the latter 's career . 
 Larwood had to wait until June 1925 for his next county match , which was against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield . Although Nottinghamshire lost the game , Larwood took three wickets , including that of Yorkshire 's leading batsman Herbert Sutcliffe . From that point he became a regular member of the county side ; he finished the season with 73 wickets at an average of 18 @.@ 01 , with best match figures of 11 for 41 against Worcestershire . From time to time he showed good form as a batsman , his best score being 70 against Northamptonshire . 
 = = = Test cricketer = = = 
 Larwood began the 1926 county season in good form ; during a drawn match against Surrey , he twice took the wicket of Jack Hobbs , England 's premier batsman and an influential voice with the national selectors . The Australians were in England , to defend the Ashes in a five @-@ match Test series , and Carr had been appointed to captain England . Hobbs was convinced that Larwood was good enough to play for his country ; this recommendation may have prompted the young bowler 's inclusion in a " Test Trial " match at Lord 's , early in June . Larwood took five wickets in the match , but was not selected for the first Test , which in any event was ruined by rain after barely an hour 's play . For the second Test , due to begin at Lord 's on 26 June , the selectors took a gamble and selected the youthful Larwood . His reaction when told by Carr was to protest that he was not good enough ; Carr assured him that he was . 
 The Lord 's Test was drawn , with neither side coming near to winning . Larwood took three high @-@ profile wickets — Charlie Macartney , Jack Gregory and the Australian captain H.L. Collins — while conceding 136 runs . He thought his performance " wasn 't great ... I wasted a lot of energy " . He was not selected for the Third or Fourth Tests , both of which ended in draws ; after the fourth match Carr , whose leadership had been criticised and whose batting form was poor , was replaced as England 's captain by Percy Chapman for the series ' decisive match at the Oval . Primarily at the urging of Hobbs , Larwood was recalled for this critical game . On a tumultuous final day the Australians , needing 415 to win , were bowled out for 125 , the main bowling honours being shared between Larwood ( 3 wickets for 34 ) and the 49 @-@ year @-@ old veteran Wilfred Rhodes ( 4 for 44 ) , who had first appeared for England in 1899 , five years before Larwood was born . The victory meant that England had secured the Ashes for the first time since 1912 . Among many tributes recognising Larwood 's performance was one from the former England captain Pelham Warner , who predicted a big future , but noted that " he must guard against bowling just short of a length " . 
 In the 1926 season as a whole , Larwood took 137 wickets at 18 @.@ 31 ; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12 @.@ 88 . No Tests were played in 1927 ; Larwood 's performances for Nottinghamshire , however , lifted him to the top of the national bowling averages — 100 wickets at 16 @.@ 95 — and he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . His efforts could not quite secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire ; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan . The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old ex @-@ miner who , after beginning as a slow left @-@ arm orthodox spin bowler , later became Larwood 's principal fast bowling partner for county and country . At the season 's end , Larwood was married , in a quiet and private ceremony , to Lois Bird , a miner 's daughter whom he had first met in 1925 . 
 Larwood did not join the MCC 's weak team that toured South Africa in 1927 – 28 under the inexperienced R.T. <unk> . During 1928 Larwood appeared in two Tests against an emergent West Indies side that was playing its first series . He took six wickets in these matches , but his best performances that season were for Nottinghamshire . With 138 wickets at 14 @.@ 51 , Larwood once again headed the national bowling averages . As a batsman , his 626 runs at an average of 26 @.@ 08 included his first century , 101 not out against Gloucestershire . 
 = = = Australian tour , 1928 – 29 = = = 
 On the basis of his form , Larwood was an obvious choice for the MCC touring side that Chapman took to Australia in the English winter of 1928 – 29 . In an early game against Victoria he took 7 for 51 in the state 's first innings and scored 79 when MCC batted . One of his victims in the match was Bill Ponsford , the Australian Test opening batsman , who let slip his opinion that Larwood was " not really fast " . According to the journalist and future Australian Test player Jack Fingleton , Ponsford was then targeted by Larwood . A month later at Brisbane , in the first Test of the series , Larwood dismissed him cheaply , twice ; in the second Test , at Sydney , Ponsford scored 5 before a rapid delivery from Larwood broke a bone in his hand ; Ponsford did not play again that summer . 
 England won the Brisbane Test by a record margin of 675 runs . Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings , bowling at a speed that Wisden 's S.J. Southerton described as " faster than I have ever seen him " . According to Jardine 's biographer Christopher Douglas , this bowling , which included a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs , delivered a lasting blow to Australian morale and was a major factor in England 's ultimate series victory . The match saw a low @-@ key Test debut by Don Bradman , who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test , before being rapidly reinstated for the third . England maintained their ascendancy during the second , third and fourth Tests , though with decreasing victory margins ; Australia finally achieved success in the last match , giving England a 4 – 1 series victory . A combination of hard pitches , stifling heat , and long matches reduced Larwood 's effectiveness as the tour progressed . He finished the Test series with 18 wickets at 40 @.@ 22 , behind George Geary ( 19 at 25 @.@ 11 ) and Jack White ( 25 at 30 @.@ 80 ) . In all first class matches on the tour , Larwood took 40 wickets at 31 @.@ 35 ; as a batsman he scored 367 runs , averaging 26 @.@ 21 . Larwood 's occasional tactic of bowling leg theory , that is , in the direction of the batsman 's legs to a concentration of leg side fielders , had been noted by the Australian former bowler Arthur Mailey . In his report on the fourth Test , Mailey wrote , Larwood resorted to his " famous leg theory " after receiving severe punishment from the Australian batsman Archie Jackson , but the change brought no success : " All theories and all bowlers were alike to [ Jackson ] " . 
 Southerton 's tour report refers to the crowds ' reactions to the England team , and in particular to the " barracking " of Larwood . This , he says , only once reached unacceptable proportions — during the game against Victoria that took place between the fourth and fifth Tests . This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman 's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria 's weakest batsman , Bert Ironmonger . In general , Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that , " objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England , it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day 's enjoyment " . Larwood 's view was that " it was a bit too thick at times ... I got called every name you can imagine , and every four @-@ letter word you can think of was used against me " . The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine , was likewise a target of the crowds , and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians — which was fully reciprocated . 
 = = = Bradman in 1930 = = = 
 Back in England for the 1929 season , Larwood made three Test appearances against the visiting South Africans , for modest returns : a total of eight wickets at 23 @.@ 25 , and with the bat 50 runs at 12 @.@ 50 . He was injured during the third Test , and thus missed the last two games of the series and several county matches . His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years ; with 117 wickets at 21 @.@ 66 he fell to 25th place in the national averages . The 20 @-@ year @-@ old Voce , whose fast @-@ medium bowling style had now fully developed , was the county 's most successful bowler . Together , Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier . 
 Ahead of the Australians ' visit to England in 1930 there was some confidence in English cricketing circles , since Chapman 's victorious 1928 – 29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong , especially in batting . England duly won the first Test , at Trent Bridge , by 93 runs , despite a second @-@ innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match . Larwood 's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis ; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs . 
 His illness meant that Larwood missed the second Test , at Lord 's , which saw Australia score a record 729 for 6 including a rapid 254 from Bradman , at the time the highest individual Test score in England . Australia won the game by seven wickets , to draw level 1 – 1 in the five @-@ match series . Larwood returned to the England side for the third Test , at Headingley , Leeds . He later claimed that his first ball to Bradman , before the batsman had scored , was a bouncer that touched the edge of the bat and was caught by the wicket @-@ keeper , George Duckworth : " You could hear the <unk> all over the ground " . The umpire , however , gave Bradman not out . Bradman went on to compile 334 , beating his record score of two weeks earlier . Larwood 's one wicket in the Australian innings cost 139 runs ; England were saved from probable defeat when the game was shortened by rain . The England selectors dropped Larwood from the team for the fourth Test , in which Bradman was limited to 14 runs , but the game was rained off after just over two days ' play . Larwood was recalled for the final Test at the Oval that , as in 1926 , would determine the series victor . In a game with no time limit , Australia replied to England 's 405 with 695 ( Bradman 232 ) , then dismissed England for 251 to win by an innings and 39 runs . Larwood 's single wicket — Bradman , for the first time in Tests — cost 132 runs . In the three Tests in which he played , Larwood took 4 wickets for 292 ; Bradman , he admitted , had " pasted me unmercifully " . Commentators recognised the danger that Bradman presented to English hopes ; the former England bowler Percy Fender , who was captain of Surrey and a respected cricket journalist , was convinced that " something new will have to be introduced to curb Bradman " . Warner was explicit : " England must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill " . 
 = = = Prelude to bodyline = = = 
 Apart from his treatment by Bradman , Larwood was successful in 1930 , rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages ( 99 wickets at 16 @.@ 38 ) . He also batted well on occasions , including a not @-@ out century against Northamptonshire . He was not selected for the 1930 – 31 tour of South Africa , and for the next two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket . He made one Test appearance in 1931 , against New Zealand , in a rain @-@ ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled . He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932 , in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12 @.@ 86 , the best seasonal figures of his career . However , because of his poor Test record in 1930 , Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932 – 33 tour to Australia were slim . The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day 's play , during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket . Nevertheless , to his great relief he was selected for the tour , as was Voce , who had been England 's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930 – 31 . 
 In 1931 , with the 1932 – 33 series in mind , the selectors had appointed Jardine as England 's captain . In his efforts to build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy , the new captain consulted widely . Along with other observers , including Duckworth ( who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test ) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast , rising balls , and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had hit him in the chest . This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers ; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched . This , to Jardine , suggested the basis of a plan : a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally . 
 Leg theory bowling was not new ; Larwood , Voce and others had employed it , generally for short periods , as had several Australians including Jack Scott , who in 1928 – 29 dismissed Jardine and Herbert Sutcliffe using this tactic . What Jardine planned was a sustained leg stump attack , used in conjunction with a semicircle of close leg @-@ side fielders ready to pounce on any mistimed shot . He found a willing ally in Carr , who , though no longer playing Test cricket , still captained Nottinghamshire and had , according to Hamilton , " an almost carnivorous appetite for trying to humiliate the Australians and grinding them , and especially Bradman , into the dirt " . At a private dinner at the Piccadilly Hotel , which Jardine and Carr arranged shortly after the announcement of the 1932 – 33 touring party , Larwood and Voce were quizzed about leg theory . Larwood later recalled the conversation thus : 
 Jardine asked me if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up into the body all the time , so that Bradman had to play his shots to leg . " Yes , I think that can be done " , I said ... I had no doubt of its purpose : we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls , and we reasoned that if he got a lot of them he would be ... intimidated and eventually , having to direct his shots to leg all the time , would give a catch to one of the [ leg @-@ side ] fieldsmen " . 
 In pursuit of his plans , Jardine took advice on fielding positions from Frank Foster , who had bowled a form of medium @-@ fast leg theory during the 1911 – 12 series in Australia with much success , taking 32 wickets at 21 @.@ 63 . Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine 's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial . His priority was to contain Bradman , so " any scheme that would keep him in check appealed to me a great deal " . In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner , Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out , with mixed results . Two Essex batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling , at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs . However , Glamorgan , reckoned to be a weak batting side , scored more than 500 against the experimental attack ; spectators , including the future cricket writer and commentator John Arlott , were puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the bowling . Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches . Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce ; in Yorkshire 's match against Surrey at The Oval , Bill Bowes bowled a series of bouncers , bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner . 
 = = = Australian tour , 1932 – 33 = = = 
 The MCC party that sailed for Australia on 17 September 1932 contained four fast bowlers : Larwood , Voce , Bowes and G.O. " Gubby " Allen , the Middlesex amateur . Warner was manager of the side ; he had captained two tours to Australia prior to 1914 and was a popular figure there . The manager 's role , as the tour 's historian Laurence Le Quesne remarks , was at the time less influential than that of the captain , who had absolute authority on the field of play . 
 Prior to the Test series , the party played matches against State sides and selected Australian elevens . The intended fast leg theory attack was not revealed until the fifth of these games , against " An Australian XI " ( including Bradman ) , which began at Melbourne on 18 November . Larwood dismissed Bradman for low scores in each of the Australian innings , writing later : " It was a refreshing sight to see [ him ] clumsily waving his bat in the air " . Hobbs , who having retired from Test cricket was reporting the tour for London 's The Star newspaper , thought that the bowling had shaken Bradman 's confidence : " He was drawing away , sure proof that he didn 't like the bumpers " . The English tactics in the game offended the crowds and so upset H.V. Evatt ( later leader of the Australian Labor Party , then a High Court judge ) that he lost all desire to watch any of that year 's Tests . 
 The first Test began at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932 , and was played in a tense and heated atmosphere . Bradman , whose discomfort and poor form against the tourists ' bowling in the preparatory games had become sources of anxiety , was prevented from playing by illness . England won the game by 10 wickets ; Larwood 's match figures were 10 for 124 , with only limited use of fast leg theory . The match 's most successful batsman was Australia 's Stan McCabe , who scored 187 in his side 's first innings , attacking both the orthodox and leg theory attacks in a " death or glory " approach . During the match Hugh Buggy , a reporter for the Melbourne Herald , used the word " bodyline " to describe the English leg theory bowling . The term was soon universally adopted in Australia , though English sources continued to refer to " leg theory " . The second Test , at Melbourne beginning 30 December , was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace attack . Larwood was further handicapped by pains from sore feet , caused by a new pair of boots . Bradman returned to the Australian side and scored a century , guiding his team to victory by 111 runs ; his success led many commentators to suppose that fast leg theory would thenceforth prove ineffective . The series was tied 1 – 1 and , in the words of the writer @-@ historian Ronald Blythe , " all was sweetness and light " . 
 The third Test , which began at Adelaide on 13 January 1933 , has been characterised by Wisden as " probably the most unpleasant [ Test match ] ever played " . Bill Woodfull , the Australian captain , was struck over the heart by a ball from Larwood and was incapacitated for several minutes . Larwood had been bowling to an orthodox field ; on Woodfull 's resumption , to the crowd 's amazed hostility , Jardine switched to the leg theory attack . " What could be clearer " , wrote Swanton , " than that at the root of these leg @-@ theory tactics was the threat of physical injury ? " . Larwood then knocked Woodfull 's bat from his hands , bringing further demonstrations from the crowd . Later in the innings a Larwood delivery struck Bert Oldfield on the head , causing his retirement from the match . The crowd 's reaction was such that Larwood thought a full @-@ scale invasion of the pitch might follow : " If one man jumps the fence the whole mob will go for us " . 
 England eventually won by 338 runs ; Larwood 's total of seven wickets in the match was exceeded by Allen 's eight , earned by orthodox style fast bowling . While the game was still in progress , the Australian Board of Control cabled the MCC , protesting the English tactics with a direct accusation of unsportsmanlike conduct . In reply , MCC rejected the Australian Board 's charges and insisted that they withdraw the charge of bad sportsmanship . The row escalated into high diplomatic and political circles , and drew in the Australian prime minister , Joseph Lyons , the governor of South Australia , Sir Alexander Hore @-@ Ruthven , and the British Dominions secretary , J.H. Thomas . Ultimately it was decided that the matter should be referred to the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) , with a view to a possible change in the rules relating to bowling . Jardine had stated that he would not lead his team in another Test unless the " unsportsmanlike " charge was withdrawn . On 8 February , two days before the fourth Test was due to begin at Brisbane , the Australian Board clarified that , while they continued to find bodyline objectionable , " we do not consider the sportsmanship of your team as being in question " . 
 In the fourth Test , which England won to retain the Ashes , Larwood curtailed his use of bodyline on an unreceptive pitch . The match passed without untoward incident ; on the final day came news of the death of Archie Jackson , who had been ill for months with tuberculosis . Two days earlier he had sent Larwood a telegram : " Congratulations magnificent bowling good luck in all matches " ; Larwood kept this as a souvenir for the rest of his life . In the final Test , at Sydney , several Australian batsmen were hit , but their improving technique against this style of bowling enabled them to score 435 , their highest innings total of the series . Larwood 's main contribution to this game was as a batsman ; sent in as a nightwatchman , he batted well into the following day to score 98 . In the Australians ' second innings Larwood suffered a serious injury to his left foot , the legacy of much bowling on hard , unyielding pitches . Although he could no longer bowl , Jardine would not let him leave the field while Bradman was still batting , believing that Larwood 's continuing presence represented a psychological threat . When Bradman was out , he and Larwood left the field together , although no words were exchanged . England won the match to secure a 4 – 1 series victory . 
 The injury ended Larwood 's tour at that point . While the rest of the team fulfilled the final Australian fixtures before embarking on a short tour of New Zealand , Larwood returned to England on board SS Otranto . In the Test matches he had been England 's most successful bowler , with 33 wickets at 19 @.@ 52 . As a batsman he had scored 145 runs , averaging 24 @.@ 16 . In all first @-@ class matches on the tour he took 64 wickets at 13 @.@ 89 and scored 358 runs at 23 @.@ 45 . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 On his return home , despite massive press and public interest Larwood was bound by his contract with the MCC to remain silent until the main party returned . On 7 May 1933 , the day after their arrival , he gave in a Sunday Express article a strong defence of what he continued to call " leg theory " . Woodfull , he said , was too slow , and Bradman too scared : " Richardson and McCabe played me all right , Woodfull and Bradman could not " . He was highly critical of the Australian crowds who , he said , knew nothing of cricket — all they wanted was for Bradman to score runs . In mid @-@ May , in a hastily prepared , ghost @-@ written book entitled Bodyline ? that was serialised in the Sunday Dispatch , Larwood elaborated on his themes of Australian batting failures and crowd hooliganism . By this time the 1933 cricket season was in full swing ; bodyline bowling was being widely practised , by Bowes , Voce and by the fast bowlers in the visiting West Indies touring side , Learie Constantine and E.A. Martindale . Larwood 's writings were inconvenient for the MCC committee which , now more aware of the intimidatory aspects of bodyline , was revising its position and was more inclined to appease Australian feelings . 
 The injury to Larwood 's foot meant that he scarcely bowled for Nottinghamshire in 1933 . However , such was his drawing power that the county continued to play him as a batsman until mid @-@ July , when his unfitness prematurely ended his season . Meanwhile , on 28 April the Australian Board had unilaterally adopted a regulation that specifically outlawed bodyline bowling in Australia ; MCC 's initial response was to declare this law impractical , but as the events of the season unfolded they modified their stance . The ICC meeting on 31 July produced no immediate resolution , but did elicit a verbal promise from the MCC that bodyline would not be used in the projected 1934 tour by the Australians . In exchanges of telegrams with the Australian Board , the MCC still contrived to avoid a specific commitment , while emphasising that they had " always agreed that a form of bowling which is obviously a direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman would be an offence against the spirit of the game " . On that basis , the Australian Board agreed to the 1934 tour . 
 By the beginning of the 1934 season Larwood was fit again , and it was anticipated that he would play in the Tests . Jardine had earlier issued an unequivocal statement that he would not play . By way of confirming their commitment not to use bodyline , the MCC committee decided that Larwood should apologise to the Australians for his bowling on the 1932 – 33 tour . No such apology had been requested from Jardine ; Larwood refused to do so , insisting that he had bowled precisely as instructed by his captain . Shortly before the second Test , he wrote in the Sunday Dispatch that he was unrepentant about leg theory , adding : " I doubt if I shall ever play against [ the Australians ] again , at least in big cricket " . Larwood 's Test career thus ended . In its review of the 1934 season , Wisden commented : " No greater disservice was ever done to English cricket than when Larwood was induced to dash into print and become responsible for statements which put him beyond the pale of being selected for England " . 
 Larwood continued to play for Nottinghamshire for several more seasons , with considerable success : 82 wickets at 17 @.@ 25 in 1934 , 102 at 22 @.@ 70 in 1935 and in 1936 , his benefit season , 119 at 12 @.@ 97 . The 18 @-@ year @-@ old future Test batsman Denis Compton , in his second county match for Middlesex , faced Larwood in June 1936 ; he later recorded that Larwood and Voce were the most accurate fast bowlers he ever faced , and that Larwood was the fastest . The benefit season yielded the then county record sum of £ 2 @,@ 098 . In the English winter of 1936 – 37 , while an MCC team led by Allen toured Australia , Larwood took a coaching job in India . The climate and the food disagreed with him , and he returned home early . His bowling achievements in 1937 were modest : 70 wickets at 24 @.@ 57 . Larwood 's relations with Nottinghamshire had steadily deteriorated since Carr 's dismissal from the captaincy in 1934 ; his foot problem returned , and was aggravated by a cartilage injury to his left knee . In 1938 , after a few matches , he left the county by mutual agreement and retired from first @-@ class cricket . In his first @-@ class career he took 1 @,@ 427 wickets at 17 @.@ 51 , and scored 7 @,@ 290 runs at 19 @.@ 91 including three centuries . In Tests he took 78 wickets at 28 @.@ 35 and scored 485 runs at 19 @.@ 40 .

 After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939 , on the outbreak of war Larwood left the game altogether , to work away from the public eye as a market gardener . In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool . Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity , he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman at the end of the Australians ' 1948 tour . He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies , though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team , including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall . The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC . This recognition , he said , went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game 's ruling body 15 years earlier . 
 = = = Emigration to Australia = = = 
 In the economic austerity of post @-@ war Britain , Larwood 's business made little money . He was persuaded , largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton , that he would find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia , and he decided to emigrate there with his family , which by then included five daughters . On 1 April 1950 the <unk> sailed on SS Orontes — the ship that had carried Jardine 's party 18 years previously . On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate . During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel , unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley . Despite a housing shortage , the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford , and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm . Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley ; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other , and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter . 
 From time to time Larwood supplemented his wages by commenting on cricket for newspapers and broadcasters . At first he was treated with some suspicion by English touring teams ; in 1950 – 51 when he visited the English dressing room he received a cold reception from the England captain , F.R. Brown . Four years later , according to Larwood , he was kept out of the dressing room by Trevor Bailey , the 1954 – 55 team 's vice captain — though Bailey denied that this ever happened . However , from the early 1960s onwards Larwood was often visited by members of England teams , and he became a regular and welcome guest in English dressing rooms . He sometimes went to cricket events where he often met Don Bradman ; relations between the two , though outwardly cordial , remained essentially cold . 
 In 1977 Larwood attended the Centenary Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , along with many survivors of old Ashes battles . As on similar past occasions he had to be persuaded to go ; later he would describe it as " one of the best days of my life " . His presence created considerable interest among generations of cricket followers to whom the bodyline series was distant history . Later that year he visited England , and watched England 's cricketers play Australia at Trent Bridge , his old home ground ; this was one of several trips he made to his home country , the last of which was in 1980 . In 1982 , the 50th anniversary of the bodyline series was commemorated with much publicity , some of which brought a revival of hate mail and hostility towards Larwood . 
 = = = Final years and death = = = 
 As he grew older , Larwood increasingly spoke out on current cricket issues . He was particularly critical of the proliferation of protective clothing in the 1970s , and considered Ian Botham , the England all @-@ rounder , over @-@ rated : his bowling " wouldn 't burst a paper bag " . He was unimpressed by the 1984 Australian television miniseries Bodyline which he considered inaccurate and at risk of reawakening ill @-@ feelings he thought best forgotten . In 1985 he was given honorary life membership of the Sydney Cricket Ground and , in England , the Larwood and Voce Stand was opened at Trent Bridge . In June 1993 , in the Queen 's Birthday Honours List , Larwood was appointed an MBE for services to cricket . Of this award , Today newspaper commented : " At last the ruling classes honour the man who carried the can for their savage arrogance " . 
 In his final years , Larwood withdrew his claims that Bradman had been frightened of him , and acknowledged his Australian foe as the greatest batsman of all time . He was gradually losing his sight , although he retained his alertness , and on his 90th birthday was able to join in a game of garden cricket with his great @-@ grandchildren . He died in hospital on 22 July 1995 , following a brief illness , in his 91st year . He was cremated , and his ashes placed in a memorial wall at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Kingsford . A plaque with a simple inscription was placed on the wall by his daughters . His wife Lois died in 2001 , and her ashes were placed alongside his . 
 = = Style and influence = = 
 Larwood has been widely acknowledged as the greatest fast bowler of his generation and , according to his Wisden obituary , was " one of the rare fast bowlers in the game 's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by the mere mention of his name " . Timing technology was primitive in his day , but various tests indicated speeds of between 90 and 100 mph ( 140 to 160 km / h ) . Fingleton commented that Larwood was " about twice as fast as anyone out there " , indicating a match in progress at Trent Bridge . However , one Australian from an earlier cricketing generation , Ernie Jones , dismissed Larwood : " He wouldn 't knock a dint in a pound of butter on a hot day " . 
 At around 5 feet 7 inches , Larwood was short for a fast bowler , although he had long arms in relation to his height . His lower bowling trajectory helped the ball to retain speed . His side @-@ on bowling action , following a smooth and almost soundless approach , was described by the Manchester Guardian 's cricket correspondent Neville Cardus as " absolutely classical , left side showing down the wicket before the arm swung over with a thrilling vehement rhythm " . Facing Larwood at his fastest was , according to Hamilton , " akin to a public stoning " . Hobbs , who batted against him many times in county matches , thought him not just the fastest but the most accurate bowler he had ever seen . Among later fast bowlers influenced by Larwood 's style was Ray Lindwall , Australia 's bowling star of the 1940s and 1950s , who watched the bodyline series as a schoolboy and modelled his own action on Larwood 's . 
 Larwood claimed that he did not intend to hit batsmen , though " I didn 't shed any crocodile tears if a batsman was hit in the thigh " . In a press interview in 1990 he further admitted that he " might sometimes have bowled at a batsman 's ribs , but never at his head " . He did from time to time inflict serious injuries on his opponents : Reg Sinfield of Gloucestershire , Patsy Hendren of Middlesex , and H.B. Cameron of South Africa were all carried unconscious from the field after being hit by high @-@ speed deliveries . Many others suffered discomfort in the form of bruises and minor fractures . In Australia , in the wake of the bodyline series , a music hall song summed up many apprehensive batsmen 's feelings : 
 = Smith Gun = 
 The Smith Gun was an ad hoc anti @-@ tank artillery piece used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War . With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France , most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army , leaving the Home Guard short on supplies , particularly anti @-@ tank weaponry . The Smith Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti tank weapon , and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . 
 The weapon consisted of a 3 @-@ inch smoothbore barrel approximately 54 inches long mounted on a carriage and capable of firing both modified 3 inch mortar anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ personnel rounds . Despite the promising @-@ sounding nature of the weapon , which at trials in ideal conditions it achieved a maximum range of 1 @,@ 600 yards ( attempts to increase maximum range to 3 @,@ 000 yards having been abandoned due to excessive recoil and consequent instability ) it was generally regarded as a short @-@ range weapon , one with an accepted maximum range of only 500 yards , and an accepted effective range of between 100 and 300 yards . Furthermore , it was heavy and awkward to manhandle , not simply to move around but also to tip over onto the correct wheel on firm level so it lay in , and remained in , the correct firing configuration . 
 It was also alleged to have developed ' a terrifying reputation for killing its crew ' when finally issued in 1942 , following production difficulties . When it was issued ( mainly to Home Guard units and those units in the regular Army tasked with point defence , such as guarding airfields , ammunition shortages meant that on average these units only had six or seven modified mortar rounds per gun . Despite these limitations many Home Guard units developed an attachment to the weapon , some later claiming it was ' one of the best pieces of equipment ever issued to the force ' . 
 = = Development = = 
 With the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940 , a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely . However , the British Army was not well @-@ equipped to defend the country in such an event ; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty @-@ seven divisions . The Army was particularly short of anti @-@ tank guns , 840 of which had been left behind in France , and only 167 were available in Britain ; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes . 
 Given these shortcomings , those modern weapons that were available were allocated to the British Army , and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti @-@ tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons , one such being the Smith Gun which had what Mackenzie describes as of ' unorthodox origin ' , as were many of the other weapons that were produced for use by the Home Guard . Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith , the managing director of <unk> Toys but how had a civil engineering background the Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti @-@ tank weapon . 
 When submitted to the Ordnance Board - which remained unconvinced of its merits - Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , witnessed a demonstration of the weapon in 1941 and ordered that it be put into production . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Smith Gun consisted of a 3 inch calibre smoothbore barrel 54 inches in length , mounted on a carriage ' like a two @-@ wheeled baby carriage ' that , unlike the average stroller weighed some 604 pounds . A basic shield was provided between the two wheels to cover for the crew but one of the unconventional aspects of the design was when mobile the weapon lay on its side , so that to fire a Smith Gun had to be tipped over onto one of the heels which acted as a combined baseplate and turntable , while the other proved some overhead protection for the crew . ( This meant in firing configuration the Smith Gun resembled a miniature , rather antiquated naval gun mount of the pre @-@ Dreadnought era . ) . 
 While unorthodox it might be but it gave the Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which , combined with a maximum 40 @-@ degree elevation , produced a basic weapon aspiring to the condition of a basic and firing @-@ plate mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle despite not being so @-@ designed . ( Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact , having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon 's wheels ( and possibly the axle ) , inhibiting or even preventing traverse . ) Happily , ammunition shortages made the similarly @-@ constructed limber redundant and so , <unk> , a source for spares . 
 Capable of firing both anti @-@ personnel and anti @-@ tank rounds ( the latter capable of penetrating some 60 mm of armour ) the Smith Gun provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti @-@ personnel and anti @-@ armour weapon , however there were several flaws in its design , and as such was not well liked by some of the Home Guard units to which it was issued : it was heavy and awkward to manhandle , particularly over rough ground and in urban areas ; in the latter , it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position . It also possessed a low muzzle velocity , which implies a rainbow @-@ like trajectory , making precise range calculations and experience with both natures vital . This was difficult when so few rounds were available , a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to its alleged ' terrifying reputation for killing its crew ' . ( This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when , during a live @-@ fire exercise in 1942 , Corporal Maynard of <unk> Squadron , RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Production on the Smith Guns began in late 1941 , but problems with their manufacture meant that it was not until mid @-@ 1942 that the first batch were delivered to the Home Guard ; by the beginning of 1943 , a total of 3 @,@ 049 Smith Guns had been issued to Home Guard units . Production problems also affected the ammunition for the weapons ; a delay in manufacturing anti @-@ tank ammunition meant that each weapon was only supplied with six or seven rounds . A number of Smith Guns were also issued to regular army units tasked with guarding airfields . Soon after issue a malfunction causing an explosion resulting in the death of Corporal Maynard of <unk> Squadron , RAF Regiment . Similar incidents followed and all Smith Guns were withdrawn from RAF Regiment units in 1943 . 
 One was mounted onto a Bren Carrier , although this innovation was not repeated . 
 Despite the many problems with the weapon , and its tendency to injure or even kill those who manned it , the government attempted to portray it in a positive light , issuing special instructions in the autumn of 1942 which stated that the Smith Gun was a " simple , powerful and accurate weapon which , if properly handled , will add greatly to the fire power of the Home Guard . " After a period of initial distrust , many Home Guard units appear to have taken to the Smith Gun and attempted to make the best use of it : Mackenzie states that some units even had ' a growing sense of affection for the weapon ' and describes how , when a letter was published in The Times towards the end of the conflict criticizing the weapon , numerous Home Guard volunteers replied with their own letters describing how satisfactory the Smith Gun had been ; they also stated that it was ' one of the best pieces of equipment ever issued to the force ' . 
 No Smith Guns were used in active service , and they were declared to be obsolete in 1945 . 
 = Susanna Paine = 
 Susanna Paine , also known as Susannah and Susan ( June 9 , 1792 – November 10 , 1862 ) , was an American portrait artist in New England in the 19th century . She published poetry , a Christmas hymn , a novel , and an autobiography entitled Roses and Thorns , or Recollections of an Artist . 
 As a young girl she was an excellent student , but needed to quit school at the age of 11 to care for her ill grandmother . At 15 , she taught school and a year later joined an academy in Providence , Rhode Island , where she earned her way through school by making and selling needlework . She graduated with highest honors and established a school that she operated for years . Paine gave the profits her family , and she helped support them throughout most of her life . 
 She had a short marriage characterized by abuse and control . A child was born to the couple , but died 11 months later . Before the child 's birth , Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce . To support herself , she taught school for a period and then began to work as a portraitist . She traveled throughout Rhode Island , Massachusetts , and Maine accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862 . Because she lived a mobile lifestyle , she had few long @-@ lasting relationships . The closest personal relationship of her life was with her mother . She raised a girl , however , for three years and taught her how to paint . Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security , but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Susanna Paine , born in Rehoboth , Massachusetts on June 9 , 1792 , was the second child of James Paine ( b . 1764 @-@ 65 ) and Mary Chaffee Paine ( 1767 @-@ 1849 ) . Her father was a mariner . When she was a young girl , he was lost at sea . She then lived with her maternal grandparents , Reverend Jonathan Chaffee and Mary Chaffee . Paine , an excellent student , attended school until she was 11 years of age , when she was needed to help care for her ill grandmother . The following year she nearly died as the result of a lightning strike that killed the person standing beside her . Believed to have died , she resumed consciousness after one hour , but suffered from seizures for several years after the incident . Her mother married widower Nathaniel Thurber on April 9 , 1808 , and the combined household , including his four children , moved to a Foster , Rhode Island farm . 
 At 15 years of age , Paine taught school and then attended " the best Academy in Rhode Island " , which she financed through the sales of her needlework . Paine learned how to paint with watercolor at the academy and graduated with the highest honors ; she was sufficiently trained " to teach any of the common branches of education . " Upon graduation Paine established a school near her mother and stepfather 's house . The profits she made from the school were given to her mother and on one occasion loaned to her stepfather . 
 Reluctantly , and at her mother 's insistence , she married James Phillips on November 4 , 1819 . Her husband — a gambler — was abusive , tyrannical and cruel . According to Paine , she left her husband after " one year and two months of cruel bondage " . Paine returned to her mother 's house and three months later gave birth to her son on August 30 , 1821 . The child , Theodore Winthrop Phillips , died 11 months later . The Rhode Island Supreme Court granted Paine a divorce from her husband in 1821 or 1823 . Paine was left destitute , having received no alimony and having relinquished property that she previously owned to her husband . 
 Paine resumed teaching and painted portraits to supplement her earnings , allowing her to support herself and send money to her mother , stepfather and their family , who had moved to Connecticut . To this point her life had been one of turmoil and financial precariousness . Rather than marry another man to secure a better standard of living , she developed a career so that she could support herself . 
 I was very diligent : toiling incessantly at my easel , until the picture was finished : when I viewed it with great complacency , ( artist like ) and called Mrs. R. , my patron and landlady , to look at it for the first time . She entered with an anxious , doubting look — but at the first glance she started back , in surprise — then fell into perfect rapture , declaring it was " most excellent " ... The next day , the house was " inundated " with callers . They entered my " sanctum " with eager looks , to see whither [ sic ] — a woman could paint a likeness ?

 Paine worked as a professional portrait painter by traveling through New England and placing advertisements in local newspapers to solicit business . She and Ruth Henshaw Bascom were two of 11 or more women who worked as professional itinerant <unk> in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . 
 In many ways , her [ Paine 's ] career typified the itinerant portraitist in the early nineteenth @-@ century United States . Her anxiety over commissions , the constant threat of poverty and corresponding need for mobility in search of work , would have been familiar to contemporary American painters both male and female . 
 Paine was " a woman of stalwart proportions , weighing over 200 pounds , and was a very original character ... " She was also described as a idealist . Paine was subject to criticism for traveling alone as a woman , but found it was safe to stay in boarding houses , secured through " several letters of introduction " from trusted people . To establish herself as a " genteel " artist , she studied art at the Boston Athenæum , stayed at upscale boarding houses , and became a published writer . 
 Throughout her career , Paine generally made oil paintings on 1 / 2 inch wood panels of which the sides and back were washed in red , gray @-@ green , or green @-@ blue . The subjects of the paintings were often portrayed in a confident manner in half @-@ length poses . Their accessories , hair , and clothing were often " elaborately detailed " . The placement of hands , tables , and other objects could be awkward . She had a tendency to paint the sitters with long hands , light flesh tones , <unk> eyes and round faces . Paine was known to take liberties in the portrayal of her subjects ; she once painted a gray @-@ eyed man 's portrait with black eyes because she thought they were more attractive .

 She traveled alone for the first time in 1826 to Portland , Maine and placed a business advertisement in the December 12 edition of the Portland Advertiser . The standard rate for large oil portraits at that time was US $ 20 – $ 30 , but Paine advertised $ 8 for large portraits . Not having received any leads for work , she placed a January ad with a testimonial , which said that her portrait 's were a good likeness of the subject and well executed — and that women might find " a pride and pleasure in patronizing a female artist . " Once she made a painting for her landlady and neighbors saw it , she began to receive commissions for her work . 
 Paine worked in southern Maine , Portland , and New Hampshire in 1827 and 1828 . Initially , she had sufficient commissions to support the rental of a furnished parlor , an office for painting , and another office to exhibit her portraits . A religious woman , Paine adopted simpler clothing as a spiritual practice during this time . As her health declined , she engaged nursing services , which left her short of funds . Paine answered a friend 's request to return to Providence to paint her dying daughter , and still in poor health , stayed there several months . 
 Paine worked as an artist in Maine until about 1831 . One of her subjects while in Portland was George Morillo Bartol , her portrait of him sold for US $ 38 @,@ 513 on March 6 , 2011 .

 She received formal art training at the Boston Athenæum around 1832 and spent the following summer in Cape Ann . Paine , one of the first artists to paint on Cape Ann , returned for several years , interrupted by visits to her mother each spring and fall . She was in the village of <unk> on Cape Ann by 1834 , when she painted portraits of families . Paine continued to paint on the cape during the 1830s and 1840s . She found it to be a unique place : 
 The scenery was delightful ; and the people just to my liking ... No one was very rich , and no one very poor ; they all seemed on an equality ... Kindness , benevolence and good will , were the most prominent traits of their lives , and characters . 
 She raised a girl , who she called her adopted daughter , from 12 to 15 years of age . During that time Paine taught her to paint and they lived for a few months in Fall River , Massachusetts . During a visit to her mother and stepfather 's farm , she found that her younger half @-@ brother , Nathaniel , had secured the deed to the farm and lived in the main house ; her parents lived in " a sort of out @-@ house " . Months later , after her half @-@ brother sold the farm , Paine found them " looking sad and dejected " with Nathaniel in South <unk> , Connecticut and made arrangements for her mother and step @-@ father to live in an apartment .

 In 1830 , Paine painted the portrait of author , Catharine R. Williams , who wrote poetry , Religion at Home , and the Lives of William Barton and Stephen Olney . The portrait was given to the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1885 from a group of members of the society , including Henry J. Steere . From about 1836 , she had a residence in Providence , Rhode Island and kept her parents in " comfortable support " . Between 1836 and 1838 , she wrote and published a Christmas hymn and poetry . She enjoyed a successful professional life until 1842 when she left town for her safety during the Dorr Rebellion . She went to Cape Ann and after a few months returned to Providence . She became ill and , unable to find work in both places , suffered financially . Her mother came to live with her in Providence following the death of her stepfather , Nathaniel Thurber , in November , 1848 . The following March , her mother Mary died during a visit to her half @-@ brother who then lived in Hartford , Connecticut . She had supported her parents since she was a teenaged girl . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Paine traveled through Maine , where she had difficulty establishing herself for want of connections that she had relied upon in the past , so she returned to Providence and for the first time established herself in a highly respectable commercial building with , aside from herself , only male occupants . She struggled professionally and , because of the loss of her mother , she suffered personally . The career that she relied upon kept her forever traveling , which had made it difficult to establish long @-@ standing relationships . Her relationship with her mother was the only close one of her life . 
 She published her autobiography , Roses and Thorns , or Recollections of an Artist in 1854 . Six years later she published Wait and See , a Victorian novel . She died in Providence , Rhode Island on November 10 , 1862 .

 = 2002 Bou 'in @-@ Zahra earthquake = 
 The 2002 Bou 'in @-@ Zahra earthquake ( also known as the 2002 Avaj earthquake or the 2002 Changureh earthquake [ a ] ) occurred on June 22 , 2002 . The epicenter was near the city [ b ] of Bou 'in @-@ Zahra [ c ] in Qazvin Province , a region of northwestern Iran which is crossed by several major faults that is known for destructive earthquakes . The shock measured 6 @.@ 3 on the moment magnitude scale , had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII ( Severe ) , and was followed by more than 20 aftershocks . At least 261 people were killed and 1 @,@ 500 more were injured . 
 According to the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology ( <unk> ) , the earthquake was felt as far away as the capital city of Tehran , approximately 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) east of the epicenter , although no damage was reported there . Most houses in the region were single @-@ story masonry buildings , and virtually all of these collapsed . The public became angry due to the slow official response to victims who needed supplies . Residents of the town of Avaj resorted to throwing stones at the car of a government minister . 
 = = Background and tectonics = = 
 The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of the belt of active continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate . Iran is crossed by several major faults , with 90 % of them being seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year ; the area around the rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily . The most seismically active parts of this area are the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range . Qazvin Province , which is located between these two zones , suffers less earthquakes , but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build . 
 The Bou 'in @-@ Zahra earthquake was located in an area of active thrust faulting and folding , parallel and south of the southern edge of the Alborz mountain range , and was the 11th rupture in the previous two months in central Iran . A seismic inversion of long @-@ period P and SH body @-@ wave seismograms indicated a rupture on a thrust fault that dips 49 degrees to the southwest and had a centroid depth of roughly 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) . The rupture 's mechanism of faulting was reverse . 
 Multiple @-@ event relocation of the main shock and aftershock epicenters and discontinuous surface ruptures recorded after the earthquake are compatible with northeastward movement on a southwest @-@ dipping thrust , although maximum recorded displacements were less than would have been expected from the observed magnitude . This suggests that most of the slip did not actually reach the Earth 's surface but caused folding at the surface . A previously unmapped thrust with little surface expression , the <unk> fault , has been identified from the disruption of earlier drainage systems by the growth of the fold in its hanging wall , and is thought to be responsible for the earthquake . Such structures are known as blind thrusts , and have been responsible for many destructive earthquakes in Iran and elsewhere . The geomorphological effects of this particular fold have been partly obscured by the presence of an earlier Neogene topography . The Qazvin region was hit by an even greater earthquake in 1962 , which killed 12 @,@ 200 . In 1990 a rupture killed over 40 @,@ 000 people , injured 60 @,@ 000 , and left more than 500 @,@ 000 homeless . 
 = = Damage and casualties = = 
 The earthquake occurred at 02 : 58 UTC ( 7 : 28 a.m. Iran Standard Time ) , while many of the estimated 60 million Iranians affected were in their homes . Its duration was seven seconds , and the epicenter was near the settlement of Bou 'in @-@ Zahra in the Khar river valley , a mountainous farming region about 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) from the provincial capital of Qazvin . The greatest damage was across an area best known for its seedless grape harvesting , a getaway for wealthy residents of Tehran . At least 261 people were killed , 1 @,@ 500 injured , and 25 @,@ 000 left homeless . An earlier death toll was reported as 500 , but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead . Most of the dead were women , children and the elderly , as many of the men were working in local vineyards . Over 20 aftershocks were recorded , with magnitudes up to 5 @.@ 1 on the moment magnitude scale . At least three of these caused further casualties and damage , most of which were within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the main shock . 
 An estimated 5 @,@ 000 buildings were damaged beyond repair . In the Qazvin province , 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage . In the neighboring Hamadan province , 45 villages were destroyed . A large majority of houses in the region were single @-@ story masonry buildings , and virtually all of these collapsed . As non @-@ engineered structures , these could not withstand seismic forces , with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall @-@ to @-@ wall separation and the lack of structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting . Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic @-@ resistant design fared much better . Damage to the historic <unk> tomb towers , which were in a good state of preservation before the event , suggests that the earthquake was possibly one of the most powerful in the region for approximately 900 years . 
 At a station 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) from the epicenter , the maximum horizontal and vertical accelerations were recorded to be roughly 0 @.@ 5 g and 0 @.@ 26 g . A bridge collapsed as a result of the disaster . Water and irrigation systems were severely damaged near the epicenter , and water facilities were demolished in nine villages . Many of the main water pipelines in the affected areas were damaged or destroyed , causing inadequacies in water availability and quality . Surface cracks were observed in Ab Darreh and Changureh , the villages that suffered the heaviest damage , being roughly 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) from the epicenter . 
 The relatively low levels of damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab @-@ e @-@ Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation . In Changureh , only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred . Ab Darreh also fared poorly ; the disaster destroyed the town 's only mosque , toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people . North of Avaj , in the village of <unk> , survivors recovered 38 corpses , a ninth of the total population , while searching for the missing , feared trapped in the ruins . In another village in the vicinity , <unk> , two shepherds were the only known survivors . In the small village of <unk> @-@ Jin , roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture . Survivors crying and beating their heads and faces over loved ones were a common sight on Iranian state television . 
 The cost of the damage was estimated at US $ 91 million . [ d ] The quake was felt across a wide area , including the provinces of Qazvin , Gilan , Kurdistan , Zanjan , and Hamedan . Of all these , Qazvin was the most heavily damaged , with an unnamed Qazvin official reporting that 177 had died in the province . It was also felt in the capital of Tehran , roughly 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) east of the epicenter , although no serious damage was reported . However , Iranian journalist <unk> <unk> reported that in Tehran he saw buildings sway and glass objects shatter . 
 = = Landslides = = 
 The Bou 'in @-@ Zahra earthquake triggered 59 landslides over an area of about 3 @,@ 600 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 390 sq mi ) . Landslides formed due to the quake included 47 falls and topples , nine slides , and three lateral spreads . The largest of these slides was a rockslide , 150 × 100 m ( 490 × 330 ft ) , which occurred southeast of Changureh . Landslides triggered by the quake occurred more often in the geologic areas most susceptible to damage , where there were many landslides before . 
 = = Relief efforts and aftermath = = 
 The Red Crescent Society sent relief workers , detection dogs , 100 tons of food , 1 @,@ 000 tents , 2 @,@ 500 blankets , and mobile kitchens to the earthquake @-@ stricken area . In addition , the Iranian army supplied soldiers , machinery and water trucks . To prevent the spread of disease , villages were sprayed with disinfectants and their inhabitants were given tetanus shots , among other measures . After Iranian officials launched an appeal for assistance , the United Nations Development Programme supplied $ 50 @,@ 000 . The United Nations ' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) mobilised a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination ( <unk> ) team , deploying five members . Pope John Paul II prayed for the earthquake victims and asked for a " generous " response . 
 United States President George W. Bush offered aid to Iran , which he had previously called part of an " axis of evil " . According to him , " human suffering knows no political boundaries " and he stood " ready to assist the people of Iran as needed and as desired " . However , the Iranian government refused his help , though it called for the help of non @-@ governmental agencies . 
 According to Hossein <unk> , head of the Red Crescent in Changureh , the society " levelled an area to put up tents but most people wanted to stay next to their houses to look after their property " . Survivors instead lit small fires amongst the rubble to protect against freezing temperatures . The Iranian President at the time , Mohammad Khatami , declared three days of mourning and visited earthquake @-@ stricken areas on June 25 . Hospitals struggled to cope with the surplus of patients , discharging non @-@ critical ones from their wards . The Associated Press stated that 20 funerals were held on June 23 , 2002 at a cemetery overlooking the village of <unk> . A bank account was started to handle public donations for the families of the dead . 
 Often armed with no more than shovels and spades , soldiers and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble . Other than this , rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles , including the temperatures of the villages damaged . They were warm during the day , although the villages grew colder at night , making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris . Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks . According to Gary <unk> of International Rescue , the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment , and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much . Official rescue work ended on June 24 , 2002 , when rescue workers said there were no more survivors . 
 = = = Public reaction = = = 
 Of the roughly 80 villages that suffered heavy damage , the Iranian government claimed that relief work was mostly complete . Residents of Changureh , however , complained that tents , food , and medicine had not reached them , after waiting in near @-@ freezing temperatures . A man from Avaj stated that only locals helped uncover the body of his child . In protest at Iran 's slow response to the tragedy , some 300 people blocked the main road through Avaj . On June 23 , " dozens " of Avaj residents threw stones at Interior Minister <unk> <unk> @-@ Lari 's car in anger at the government 's delay in providing relief . They also claimed that the death toll was higher than official reports said it was . 
 = = = Reconstruction = = = 
 Electricity was restored to affected areas by June 25 . On November 9 , 2002 , the World Bank granted $ 225 million towards the reconstruction and economic rehabilitation of the area devastated by the quake . Reconstruction of housing and infrastructure by provincial authorities was interrupted for almost four months ( November 2002 – February 2003 ) due to harsh weather conditions . In August 2003 , the reconstruction was completed in all villages affected by the earthquake . 
 = Condensed matter physics = 
 Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter . Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws . In particular , they include the laws of quantum mechanics , electromagnetism and statistical mechanics . 
 The most familiar condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature , the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices , and the Bose – Einstein condensate found in cold atomic systems . The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using techniques of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior . 
 The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics : one third of all American physicists identify themselves as condensed matter physicists , and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the American Physical Society . The field overlaps with chemistry , materials science , and nanotechnology , and relates closely to atomic physics and biophysics . Theoretical condensed matter physics shares important concepts and techniques with theoretical particle and nuclear physics . 
 A variety of topics in physics such as crystallography , metallurgy , elasticity , magnetism , etc . , were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s , when they were grouped together as solid state physics . Around the 1960s , the study of physical properties of liquids was added to this list , forming the basis for the new , related specialty of condensed matter physics . According to physicist Philip Warren Anderson , the term was coined by him and Volker Heine , when they changed the name of their group at the Cavendish Laboratories , Cambridge from " Solid state theory " to " Theory of Condensed Matter " in 1967 , as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids , nuclear matter and so on . Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name " condensed matter " , it had been present in Europe for some years , most prominently in the form of a journal published in English , French , and German by Springer @-@ Verlag titled Physics of Condensed Matter , which was launched in 1963 . The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name " condensed matter physics " , which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids , liquids , plasmas , and other complex matter , over " solid state physics " , which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors . The Bell Telephone Laboratories was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics . 
 References to " condensed " state can be traced to earlier sources . For example , in the introduction to his 1947 book " Kinetic Theory of Liquids " , Yakov <unk> proposed that " The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies . As a matter of fact , it would be more correct to unify them under the title of ' condensed bodies ' " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Classical physics = = = 
 One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy , in the first decades of the nineteenth century . Davy observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time , twenty @-@ six had metallic properties such as lustre , ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity . This indicated that the atoms in Dalton 's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed , but had inner structure . Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases , such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals . 
 In 1823 , Michael Faraday , then an assistant in Davy 's lab , successfully liquefied chlorine and went on to liquefy all known gaseous elements , with the exception of nitrogen , hydrogen and oxygen . Shortly after , in 1869 , Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases , and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures . By 1908 , James Dewar and H. Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium , respectively . 
 Paul Drude in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a classical electron moving through a metallic solid . Drude 's model described properties of metals in terms of a gas of free electrons , and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann – Franz law . However , despite the success of Drude 's free electron model , it had one notable problem , in that it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties of metals , as well as the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures . 
 In 1911 , three years after helium was first liquefied , Onnes working at University of Leiden discovered superconductivity in mercury , when he observed the electrical resistivity of mercury to vanish at temperatures below a certain value . The phenomenon completely surprised the best theoretical physicists of the time , and it remained unexplained for several decades . Albert Einstein , in 1922 , said regarding contemporary theories of superconductivity that “ with our far @-@ reaching ignorance of the quantum mechanics of composite systems we are very far from being able to compose a theory out of these vague ideas ” . 
 = = = Advent of quantum mechanics = = = 
 Drude 's classical model was augmented by Wolfgang Pauli , Arnold Sommerfeld , Felix Bloch and other physicists . Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the Fermi – Dirac statistics . Using this idea , he developed the theory of <unk> in 1926 . Shortly after , Sommerfeld incorporated the Fermi – Dirac statistics into the free electron model and made it better able to explain the heat capacity . Two years later , Bloch used quantum mechanics to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice . The mathematics of crystal structures developed by Auguste Bravais , <unk> Fyodorov and others was used to classify crystals by their symmetry group , and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series International Tables of Crystallography , first published in 1935 . Band structure calculations was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials , and in 1947 John Bardeen , Walter Brattain and William Shockley developed the first semiconductor @-@ based transistor , heralding a revolution in electronics . 
 In 1879 , Edwin Herbert Hall working at the Johns Hopkins University discovered the development of a voltage across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current . This phenomenon arising due to the nature of charge carriers in the conductor came to be known as the Hall effect , but it was not properly explained at the time , since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later . After the advent of quantum mechanics , Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum hall effect discovered half a century later . 
 Magnetism as a property of matter has been known in China since <unk> . However , the first modern studies of magnetism only started with the development of electrodynamics by Faraday , Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century , which included the classification of materials as ferromagnetic , paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization . Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials . In 1906 , Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of <unk> . The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization . The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher @-@ dimensional lattices . Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on <unk> led to the development of new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices . 
 = = = Modern many @-@ body physics = = = 
 The Sommerfeld model and spin models for ferromagnetism illustrated the successful application of quantum mechanics to condensed matter problems in the 1930s . However , there still were several unsolved problems , most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect . After World War II , several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems . These included recognition of collective modes of excitation of solids and the important notion of a <unk> . Russian physicist Lev Landau used the idea for the Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now known as Landau @-@ quasiparticles . Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions , which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry . The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases . Eventually in 1965 , John Bardeen , Leon Cooper and John <unk> developed the so @-@ called BCS theory of superconductivity , based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair . 
 The study of phase transition and the critical behavior of observables , known as critical phenomena , was a major field of interest in the 1960s . Leo <unk> , Benjamin <unk> and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and scaling . These ideas were unified by Kenneth Wilson in 1972 , under the formalism of the renormalization group in the context of quantum field theory . 
 The quantum Hall effect was discovered by Klaus von <unk> in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant <formula> . ( see figure ) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as the system size and impurities . In 1981 , theorist Robert Laughlin proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau . It also implied that the Hall conductance can be characterized in terms of a topological invariable called Chern number . Shortly after , in 1982 , Horst <unk> and Daniel Tsui observed the fractional quantum Hall effect where the conductance was now a rational multiple of a constant . Laughlin , in 1983 , realized that this was a consequence of <unk> interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational solution , known as the Laughlin wavefunction . The study of topological properties of the fractional Hall effect remains an active field of research . 
 In 1986 , Karl Müller and Johannes <unk> discovered the first high temperature superconductor , a material which was superconducting at temperatures as high as 50 Kelvin . It was realized that the high temperature superconductors are examples of strongly correlated materials where the electron – electron interactions play an important role . A satisfactory theoretical description of high @-@ temperature superconductors is still not known and the field of strongly correlated materials continues to be an active research topic . 
 In 2009 , David Field and researchers at Aarhus University discovered spontaneous electric fields when creating prosaic films of various gases . This has more recently expanded to form the research area of <unk> . 
 In 2012 several groups released preprints which suggest that samarium hexaboride has the properties of a topological insulator in accordance with the earlier theoretical predictions . Since samarium hexaboride is an established Kondo insulator , i.e. a strongly correlated electron material , the existence of a topological surface state in this material would lead to a topological insulator with strong electronic correlations . 
 = = Theoretical = = 
 Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter . These include models to study the electronic properties of solids , such as the Drude model , the Band structure and the density functional theory . Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions , such as the Ginzburg – Landau theory , critical exponents and the use of mathematical techniques of quantum field theory and the renormalization group . Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high @-@ temperature superconductivity , topological phases and gauge symmetries . 
 = = = Emergence = = = 
 Theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics is closely related to the notion of emergence , wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents . For example , a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are not well understood , although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known . Similarly , models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons , thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon . Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials : one example is the lanthanum @-@ aluminate @-@ strontium @-@ titanate interface , where two non @-@ magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity , superconductivity , and ferromagnetism . 
 = = = Electronic theory of solids = = = 
 The metallic state has historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids . The first theoretical description of metals was given by Paul Drude in 1900 with the Drude model , which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an ideal gas of then @-@ newly discovered electrons . He was able to derive the empirical Wiedemann @-@ Franz law and get results in close agreement with the experiments . This classical model was then improved by Arnold Sommerfeld who incorporated the Fermi – Dirac statistics of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat of metals in the Wiedemann – Franz law . In 1912 , The structure of crystalline solids was studied by Max von Laue and Paul Knipping , when they observed the X @-@ ray diffraction pattern of crystals , and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic lattices of atoms . In 1928 , Swiss physicist Felix Bloch provided a wave function solution to the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential , called the Bloch wave . 
 Calculating electronic properties of metals by solving the many @-@ body wavefunction is often computationally hard , and hence , approximation techniques are necessary to obtain meaningful predictions . The Thomas – Fermi theory , developed in the 1920s , was used to estimate system energy and electronic density by treating the local electron density as a variational parameter . Later in the 1930s , Douglas Hartree , Vladimir Fock and John Slater developed the so @-@ called Hartree – Fock wavefunction as an improvement over the Thomas – Fermi model . The Hartree – Fock method accounted for exchange statistics of single particle electron wavefunctions . In general , it 's very difficult to solve the Hartree – Fock equation . Only the free electron gas case can be solved exactly . Finally in 1964 – 65 , Walter Kohn , Pierre <unk> and Lu Jeu Sham proposed the density functional theory which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals . The density functional theory ( DFT ) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids .

 Certain states of matter exhibit symmetry breaking , where the relevant laws of physics possess some symmetry that is broken . A common example is crystalline solids , which break continuous translational symmetry . Other examples include magnetized <unk> , which break rotational symmetry , and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor , that breaks U ( 1 ) phase rotational symmetry . 
 Goldstone 's theorem in quantum field theory states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry , there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy , called the Goldstone bosons . For example , in crystalline solids , these correspond to phonons , which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations . 
 = = = Phase transition = = = 
 Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system , which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as temperature . Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed . For example , when ice melts and becomes water , the ordered crystal structure is destroyed . In quantum phase transitions , the temperature is set to absolute zero , and the non @-@ thermal control parameter , such as pressure or magnetic field , causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle . Here , the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct ground states of the Hamiltonian . Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare @-@ earth magnetic insulators , high @-@ temperature superconductors and other substances . 
 There are two classes of phase <unk> : first @-@ order transitions and continuous transitions . For the continuous transitions , the two phases involved do not co @-@ exist at the transition temperature , also called critical point . Near the critical point , systems undergoes displays critical behavior , wherein several of their properties such as correlation length , specific heat and susceptibility diverge exponentially . These critical phenomena poses serious challenges to physicists because normal macroscopic laws are no longer valid in the region and novel ideas and methods has to be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system . 
 The simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the Ginzburg – Landau theory , which works in the so @-@ called mean field approximation . However , it can only roughly explain continuous phase transition for <unk> and type I superconductors which <unk> long range microscopic interactions . For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point , a better theory is needed . 
 Near the critical point , the fluctuations happen over broad range of size scales while the feature of the whole system is scale invariant . <unk> group techniques successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage . Thus , the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically . The techniques , together with powerful computer simulation , contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition . 
 = = Experimental = = 
 Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials . Experimental probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields , measurement of response functions , transport properties and thermometry . Commonly used experimental techniques include spectroscopy , with probes such as X @-@ rays , infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering ; study of thermal response , such as specific heat and measurement of transport via thermal and heat conduction . 
 = = = Scattering = = = 
 Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe , such as X @-@ ray , optical photons , neutrons , etc . , on constituents of a material . The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest . Visible light has energy on the scale of 1 eV and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as dielectric constant and refractive index . X @-@ rays have energies of the order of 10 keV and hence are able to probe atomic length scales , and are used to measure variations in electron charge density . 
 Neutrons can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron spins and magnetization ( as neutrons themselves have spin but no charge ) . Coulomb and Mott scattering measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes . Similarly , positron annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density . Laser spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying the microscopic properties of a medium , for example , to study forbidden transitions in media with nonlinear optical spectroscopy . 
 = = = External magnetic fields = = = 
 In experimental condensed matter physics , external magnetic fields act as thermodynamic variables that control the state , phase transitions and properties of material systems . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) is a technique by which external magnetic fields can be used to find resonance modes of individual electrons , thus giving information about the atomic , molecular and bond structure of their neighborhood . NMR experiments can be made in magnetic fields with strengths up to 60 Tesla . Higher magnetic fields can improve the quality of NMR measurement data . Quantum oscillations is another experimental technique where high magnetic fields are used to study material properties such as the geometry of the Fermi surface . High magnetic fields will be useful in experimentally testing of the various theoretical predictions such as the quantized <unk> effect , image magnetic monopole , and the half @-@ integer quantum Hall effect . 
 = = = Cold atomic gases = = = 
 Cold atom trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter as well as atomic , molecular , and optical physics . The technique involves using optical lasers to create an interference pattern , which acts as a " lattice " , in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures . Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as " quantum simulators " , that is , they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems , such as frustrated magnets . In particular , they are used to engineer one- , two- and three @-@ dimensional lattices for a Hubbard model with pre @-@ specified parameters , and to study phase transitions for antiferromagnetic and spin liquid ordering . 
 In 1995 , a gas of rubidium atoms cooled down to a temperature of 170 <unk> was used to experimentally realize the Bose – Einstein condensate , a novel state of matter originally predicted by S. N. Bose and Albert Einstein , wherein a large number of atoms occupy a single quantum state . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Research in condensed matter physics has given rise to several device applications , such as the development of the semiconductor transistor , and laser technology . Several phenomena studied in the context of nanotechnology come under the purview of condensed matter physics . Techniques such as scanning @-@ tunneling microscopy can be used to control processes at the nanometer scale , and have given rise to the study of <unk> . 
 In quantum computation , information is represented by quantum bits , or qubits . The qubits may <unk> quickly before useful computation is completed . This serious problem must be solved before quantum computation may be realized . The superconducting Josephson junction qubits , the <unk> qubits using the spin orientation of magnetic materials , or the topological non @-@ Abelian <unk> from fractional quantum Hall states are a few of the promising approaches proposed in condensed matter physics to solve this problem . 
 Condensed matter physics also has important applications to biophysics , for example , the experimental technique of magnetic resonance imaging , which is widely used in medical diagnosis . 
 = Neerja = 
 Neerja is a 2016 Indian Hindi @-@ language biographical thriller film directed by Ram Madhvani and written by Saiwyn Quadras and Sanyuktha Chawla Shaikh . It was produced by Atul Kasbekar 's company , Bling Unplugged , alongside Vijay Singh 's Fox Star Studios . The film features Sonam Kapoor as the title character , with Shabana Azmi , Yogendra Tiku and Shekhar Ravjiani in supporting roles . 
 The plot centers on the Libyan @-@ backed Abu Nidal Organization 's hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi , Pakistan , on 5 September 1986 . The film is shown from the point of view of the flight 's head purser , Neerja Bhanot , who thwarted the hijack attempt by alerting the pilots , thus grounding the plane ; Bhanot gave her life to help save 359 of the 379 passengers and crew on board . 
 Development began in September 2014 , when Kasbekar signed Madhvani and Kapoor for a film to be made by Bling Unplugged and Fox Star Studios . Saiwyn Quadras and Sanyuktha Chawla worked on the script , with principal photography taking place in Mumbai . The film features music by Vishal Khurana , with lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi . Neerja was released on 19 February 2016 to positive critical reception , with praise directed to Kapoor 's performance , and became one of the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film opens with 22 @-@ year @-@ old Neerja Bhanot ( Sonam Kapoor ) arriving late for a house party . Later that evening , her mother ( Shabana Azmi ) expresses concern about Neerja 's job as a flight attendant , suggesting that Neerja should return to her old modeling job . Neerja , who insists on keeping her job , is driven to the airport by her boyfriend Jaideep ( Shekhar Ravjiani ) . 
 Neerja reflects on her brief , unhappy arranged marriage to Naresh ( Kavi Shastri ) , a professional in Doha , Qatar , who constantly abused Neerja over her dowry and inability to cook or clean . She eventually returned home for a modeling contract ; however , Naresh sent back a humiliating letter attacking her parents about the dowry and lack of domestic skills , and demanding that Neerja either bring back money or not return at all . Neerja left Naresh and landed a highly competitive job with Pan Am Airways . 
 As Neerja boards Pan Am 73 , it is revealed that the Abu Nidal Organization , a Libyan @-@ sponsored terrorist group , has planned to hijack the plane in Karachi . The plane takes off from Mumbai 's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi , where the four Abu Nidal terrorists , disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat , hijack the plane . Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit , and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch , fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers . 
 When an Indian American passenger inadvertently reveals himself as an American , one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft in front of the Pakistani negotiators . The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom . When <unk> Ali ( Shashi Bhushan ) , a Pakistani radio operator , begins to stand up , Neerja signals for him to sit down . The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage ; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports , disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats . Dejected over not finding any American passports , the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage . 
 The Pakistani negotiators inadvertently reveal the name of radio engineer Ali , whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit so they can use the radio for negotiations . Meanwhile , the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time . When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants , the terrorist leader chastises him ; humiliated , enraged , and out of control , the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali , screaming wild threats over the radio . While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on , the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation , with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute . 
 Around 17 hours later , the plane loses auxiliary power , and the lights go out inside . Despite Neerja and the other attendants ' attempts to explain , the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately , and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane . The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately ; at great peril to her own life , Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute , directing passengers out of the plane . Choosing to let the passengers escape first , Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire . The film ends with a tribute to Neerja , who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra , India 's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor , courageous action or self @-@ sacrifice .

 Pre @-@ production work on Neerja began in September 2014 , when the film 's executive producer Atul Kasbekar said that his company , Bling Unplugged , would co @-@ produce Ram Madhvani ’ s film along with Fox Star Studios . Kasbekar later tweeted , “ Do U Know Who Neerja Bhanot Is ? No ? Well U Really Really Should ... ” . He said , “ For us [ ... ] , a story of courage as exceptional as Neerja ‘ s simply deserved to be told . We just decided that we would our bit to ensure that India would remember one of its great heroines . ” 
 The film 's script and screenplay were penned by Saiwyn Quadras , and the dialogue was written by Sanyuktha Chawla Sheikh . The director of photography for the film was the cinematographer Mitesh <unk> , who had been previously associated with 2012 film Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana . The editing for the film was done by Monisha R <unk> and Manohar Verma served as the stunt director for the film .. 
 Kapoor was contracted by Kasbekar to play Neerja Bhanot , the senior flight crew member who became the youngest recipient of the Ashoka Chakra . On receiving the role of Neerja in the film , Kapoor told PTI , " I thought doing this film just reaffirms that it is about not bowing down . It is an inspiring story for me to do . I am blessed . " 
 It was reported in May 2015 that Shekhar Ravjiani , one half of Bollywood 's performing / producing duo Vishal – Shekhar , would play a short role in the movie , marking his acting debut . Shabana Azmi played the role of Neerja 's mother in the film . In an interview with The Indian Express , Azmi describes her character and explains , " It was very difficult to play her , particularly the last scene where Rama addresses an audience . It is an extremely well @-@ written emotional scene , which does complete justice to the moment . "

 = Rise of Neville Chamberlain = 
 The early life , business career and political rise of Neville Chamberlain culminated on 28 May 1937 , when he was summoned to Buckingham Palace to " kiss hands " and accept the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom . Chamberlain had long been regarded as Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin 's political heir , and when Baldwin announced his retirement , Chamberlain was seen as the only possible successor . 
 Chamberlain was born in 1869 ; his father was the politician and future Cabinet minister , Joseph Chamberlain . He was educated at Rugby School and Mason College ( now Birmingham University ) ; at neither institution was he particularly successful . After a period in a firm of chartered accountants , the younger Chamberlain spent six years in the Bahamas managing a sisal plantation in a failed attempt to recoup the family fortunes . 
 After returning to England in 1897 , Chamberlain became a successful businessman in his home city of Birmingham . He was interested in social affairs , and successfully stood for Birmingham City Council in 1911 . He became Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1915 . His second term was interrupted in December 1916 when Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked him to become Director of National Service . Chamberlain received little support from Lloyd George in the post , and his eight @-@ month tenure sparked a hatred between the two which lasted Chamberlain 's lifetime . 
 In 1918 , Chamberlain was elected to the House of Commons , at age 49 the oldest man to enter Parliament and later become Prime Minister . After four years on the backbenches , Chamberlain saw rapid promotion , briefly becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer after less than a year as a minister . Chamberlain subsequently spent five years as Minister of Health , securing the passage of many reforming acts . After two years in opposition , Chamberlain became part of Ramsay MacDonald 's National Government , and spent five and a half years as Chancellor , directing Britain 's financial policies as the nation emerged from the Depression . When Baldwin ( who had replaced MacDonald as Prime Minister in 1935 ) retired in 1937 , Chamberlain succeeded him . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Chamberlain was born in a house called Southbourne , in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham , England , as the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain , who later became Mayor of Birmingham , and who also served as a Cabinet minister . Joseph Chamberlain had fathered two children by his first marriage , Beatrice and Austen . Joseph 's first wife , Harriet , died giving birth to Austen ; Neville 's mother , the former Florence Kenrick , also died in childbirth in 1875 , when Neville was six years old . Florence Chamberlain left three daughters in addition to Neville and her stepchildren . Joseph Chamberlain , in the midst of a highly successful parliamentary career , was often away , leaving the household in the hands of his sister . Young Neville was sent away to school at age eight . 
 Chamberlain attended Rugby School . Unhappy during his school years , he made no lasting friendships there . Although he did reasonably well in his classes , he was not outstanding academically or athletically , and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday . In later years , as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics , he seldom visited the school , did not enrol his own son , and rarely spoke of his time there . Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College ( which later developed into the University of Birmingham ) , which both emphasised the politician 's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby . Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years , but had little interest in the subjects . In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants . Within six months , he became a salaried employee . 
 = = Businessman ( 1890 – 1911 ) = = 
 Joseph Chamberlain had difficulty living within his means , a problem exacerbated by investment losses in the late 1880s . In 1890 , Sir Ambrose Shea , Governor of the Bahamas , advised him that growing sisal in the Bahamas could restore the family fortunes . Joseph Chamberlain sent his two sons to the Bahamas to investigate in November 1890 , and they recommended the venture . Neville Chamberlain was assigned to manage the undertaking , and in early 1891 , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took out a lease on 26 @,@ 000 acres ( 110 km2 ) on the island of Andros . He spent most of the next six years on Andros . The soil proved to be unsuitable for growing sisal , and the venture failed . Joseph Chamberlain lost £ 50 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 4 @.@ 2 million today ) . Neville Chamberlain returned to Britain in early 1897 . 
 Neville Chamberlain resided in his father 's Birmingham house , Highbury , a large part of which was shut up to save on expenses . His father and half @-@ brother spent much of their time in London , where they were serving in the Lord Salisbury Government . Through a family connection , Neville Chamberlain was made a director of Elliot 's Metal Company , which was located within a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of Highbury . Chamberlain took a hands @-@ on approach , exploring all aspects of the business . In November 1897 , he purchased ( with assistance from his family ) Hoskins & Company , a manufacturer of metal ship berths . Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17 years , during which time the company prospered . Chamberlain introduced a profit @-@ sharing scheme at Hoskins which he credited with ensuring industrial peace , and opened a medical clinic for the workers . His business acumen raised him in the eyes of his father , who told a friend that of his two sons , " Neville is really the clever one " and but for his lack of interest in politics , " I would back him to be Prime Minister " . 
 Chamberlain 's business interests did not completely fill his time , and he indulged his love of natural history and other outdoor pursuits . He spent many Sundays working in the gardens and greenhouses at Highbury . He enjoyed long walks in the countryside , and developed a passion for hunting and fishing . Even as he approached the heights of his political career , he would contribute articles to journals such as The Countryman . In 1931 , he stated , " I really can 't consent to die until they arrange some fishing in the next world . " Chamberlain travelled extensively in Europe and North Africa , made a five @-@ month tour to India , Ceylon and Burma in 1904 – 05 , and according to his biographer , Robert Self , was one of the more travelled Prime Ministers . 
 Chamberlain also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham . In 1906 , Chamberlain was a founding member of the University House Committee at Birmingham University , the president of which was his aunt , Mrs Charles Beale , wife of the University 's first Vice @-@ Chancellor . He became an Official Visitor and then a director of the Birmingham General Hospital . He advocated a larger facility for the hospital , a cause in which he was eventually successful , though building did not commence until 1934 and he was still fundraising as Prime Minister . Stating that he was painfully aware of the defects of his own education , he played a part in the establishment of the University of Birmingham , of which Mason Science College became a part . Joseph Chamberlain became the University 's first chancellor ; Neville Chamberlain was appointed to its Council and later to its Board of Governors . 
 Though he declared himself uninterested in politics , Chamberlain supported his father 's views loyally . He made speeches in support of British policy towards the Boers and when the Boer War broke out , supported the British war effort . During the " Khaki election " of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain 's Liberal Unionists , which were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them . In 1903 , Chamberlain fell in love with Rosalind <unk> , a London professional singer , and repeatedly journeyed to the capital to be with her . The following year , she decided she preferred another man , leaving Chamberlain distraught . In 1910 , he fell in love with Anne Cole , a distant relative by marriage , and the following year married her . Anne Chamberlain proved to be a loyal supporter of her husband and got along well with his maiden sisters . The two had a son and a daughter , with Neville Chamberlain involving himself deeply in the children 's upbringing . 
 When he became Prime Minister in 1937 Chamberlain paid tribute to his wife : 
 I never should have become P.M. if I hadn 't had Annie to help me . It isn 't only that she charms every one into good humour & makes them think that a man can 't be so bad who has a wife like that ... But besides all this she has softened & smoothed my natural impatience and dislike of anything with a whiff of humbug about it and I know she has saved me from making an impression of hardness that was not intended . "

 While Chamberlain had continued to give speeches at general elections , his entry into politics at age 42 in 1911 stemmed from interest in local politics and the opportunities they offered for social improvement . In 1910 , Chamberlain appeared before a Parliamentary committee , testifying in favour of a bill to merge Birmingham with its suburbs . The bill passed , tripling the size of the city and greatly increasing its population . Chamberlain was very interested in city planning for Birmingham . In November 1911 , standing as a Liberal Unionist , he was elected to Birmingham City Council for All Saints ' Ward , located within his father 's parliamentary constituency . Chamberlain 's party merged with the Conservatives the following year , forming the Unionist Party , which was given its present formal name of the Conservative and Unionist Party in 1925 . 
 Upon his election , Chamberlain was made chairman of the Town Planning Committee , which sketched out four development schemes covering 15 @,@ 000 acres ( 61 km2 ) in the city , allowing for suburban development while preserving green space . In 1913 , he led a committee looking at housing conditions in Birmingham . It was a forerunner to the parliamentary Unhealthy Areas Committee ( 1919 – 21 ) , of which he was chairman . Chamberlain found that over 100 @,@ 000 housing units lacked toilet facilities , with nearly half of those not even having running water . He advocated gradual reorganisation to abate the problem , and warned that the city government must be ready to take over property if the private sector failed . Under Chamberlain 's direction , Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain which would , in time , be mirrored by other large industrial cities such as Liverpool and Leeds . However , the start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans in Birmingham . 
 With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Chamberlain became deeply involved in the war effort . In addition to his duties as councillor , Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers . Late in 1914 , he became an alderman of Birmingham , and the following year , became Lord Mayor . Chamberlain 's biographer , Robert Self , suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year , the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain 's hard work rather than to any family influence . As a Lord Mayor in wartime , Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work , and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard . He set up crèches for workers , stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage , and reinvigorated Birmingham 's various committees , which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries . He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription , and stated that he was more lenient than were other members of the tribunal . He halved the Lord Mayor 's expense allowance , and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent . 
 Under Chamberlain , the group which became the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was initiated . The Lord Mayor persuaded Sir Thomas Beecham to conduct a series of events in Birmingham . The concerts caused Birmingham to be regarded as a cultural centre , and in 1919 , the Orchestra was formally founded . Chamberlain established the Birmingham Municipal Bank , the only one of its type in the country , which aimed to encourage savings to pay for the war loan . The bank proved highly successful and lasted until 1976 , when it was taken over by Lloyds Bank . Chamberlain was re @-@ elected Lord Mayor in 1916 , but he did not complete his term . 
 = = = Director of National Service = = = 
 Conscription for the Army , but not for civilian industry , had been brought in in the first half of 1916 . Towards the end of Asquith ’ s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville ’ s brother Austen , but it had no executive powers . After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service , as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him , Chamberlain , who was already nationally known , was proposed for the job by his brother Austen . In December 1916 , the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job , with responsibility for co @-@ ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces . Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham , Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor . 
 To a great extent Chamberlain 's actual responsibilities were left vague by Lloyd George . On his appointment Lloyd George implied in the House of Commons that " compulsion " ( the industrial equivalent of conscription ) was to be extended to industry and that Chamberlain would soon produce a system of industrial enrolment . But Chamberlain found his work to be handicapped by the Prime Minister 's political manoeuvres . As Chamberlain sought to maximise the number of workers subject to both conscription and compulsion , Lloyd George pledged to the unions that he would oppose any sort of " industrial conscription " . Although Chamberlain repeatedly made proposals for mandatory service , they were turned down by Lloyd George and his War Cabinet . The Army still controlled its own recruitment at this stage , whilst Chamberlain met with resistance from the Ministries of Munitions and Labour . Chamberlain ’ s proposal that all men under 21 be drafted from industry into the Army was blocked by Minister of Munitions Addison ( 19 January 1917 ) , as it would have meant conscripting skilled young men who had already spent time in apprenticeships . 
 Chamberlain was not made a Privy Councillor . He also spurned advice from Lloyd George about his choice of advisors ( apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting ) , instead appointing cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was . Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when , having not been told or consulted , he read in the newspapers that he had been given a new Parliamentary Secretary . 
 Denied the use of compulsion , Chamberlain had to persuade Britons to volunteer for essential war work , and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army . He had to address mass meetings and issue posters . He found that workers were reluctant to exchange the comforts of home and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day . Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful , with only 9 @,@ 000 workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties . 
 Chamberlain finally resigned on 8 August 1917 . He was thanked warmly by the staff at St <unk> ’ s Hotel where the Ministry was housed . Lloyd George wrote to his family ( in Welsh ) that " Neville Chamberlain has resigned and thank God for that . " He met with considerable sympathy from members of parliament after his resignation . John Dillon , an Irish Nationalist MP , stated that " if Mr. Chamberlain were an archangel , or if he were Hindenburg and Bismarck and all the great men of the world rolled into one , his task would be wholly beyond his powers " . Unionist Party leader Andrew Bonar Law spoke of the " absolutely impossible task " Chamberlain had faced . Auckland Geddes , Chamberlain 's successor , was made a Privy Councillor and had more power and more support from the War Cabinet than he had had . 
 The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred , with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George " that dirty little Welsh Attorney " and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s . Austen Chamberlain , the brother of one opponent and , for a time , the political ally of the other , regretted the enmity , " More 's the pity , for together if they were together they might do a great deal . " Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs , claiming that “ Mr Chamberlain is a man of rigid competency . Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times . But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time . ” <unk> dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology , although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this . Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940 , when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain ’ s government .

 Having resigned as Director , Chamberlain returned to Birmingham , embittered by his experience in London . He wrote that the experience " reminds me of the Bahamas when the plants didn 't grow " . He had retained his seat on the City Council and busied himself with his civic duties , as well as his business interests and family life . In February 1918 , having declined a third term as Lord Mayor , he was appointed Deputy Mayor . 
 Chamberlain had formed a close friendship with his cousin , Norman Chamberlain , who had also served on the City Council and who shared the future Prime Minister 's social ideals . In December 1917 , Norman Chamberlain was reported missing in action during the Battle of Cambrai , and in February 1918 , Norman 's body was found — a great blow to Neville Chamberlain , who described Norman as " the most intimate friend I had " . Through the rest of his career , Neville Chamberlain laboured to further the ideals of his cousin , and wrote his biography — the only book he ever wrote . Some historians relate Norman 's death to a hatred of war on his cousin 's part which led to appeasement ; according to Chamberlain 's biographer Nick Smart , the death did not cause Chamberlain to hate World War I , and any influence on his later positions is far from certain . 
 After some hesitation as to his future career , Chamberlain determined to enter Parliament , though , after his experience with National Service , he feared that he would only have a brief , unsatisfying parliamentary career . Wishing to stand for a Birmingham constituency , he initially had some difficulty in finding one . The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave Birmingham five additional seats , and Chamberlain was adopted as candidate for one of the new seats , Birmingham Ladywood . With the election on hold until the conclusion of the war , he continued his work in Birmingham . Shortly after the Armistice , his sister Beatrice died in the influenza pandemic , and Chamberlain mourned her , " She had the warmest heart . " With the war ended , a general election was called almost immediately . Chamberlain stood as a Unionist ( as the Conservative Party was known from 1912 to 1925 ) and was given the " coupon " or letter of endorsement granted by Coalition party leaders Lloyd George and Andrew Bonar Law to approved candidates , though he declined to make any use of it . He was elected with almost 70 % of the vote and a majority of 6 @,@ 833 . At age 49 , he remains the oldest man to enter Parliament for the first time and later become Prime Minister . 
 Chamberlain threw himself into Parliamentary work , begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work . When Austen Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister , Lloyd George , tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee , Neville Chamberlain informed his half @-@ brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7 : 30 am . Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank , and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank . In March 1920 , he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister , but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law 's warnings that Chamberlain , now past fifty , might never be offered another chance to serve in government , as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time . Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George 's premiership , and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader , Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament . 
 Unionist backbenchers had long been restive as Lloyd George granted the Liberals in the Coalition more than their proportionate share of offices . In October 1922 , discontent among Unionists against the Lloyd George Coalition Government erupted . When Unionist MPs were summoned to the Carlton Club for a meeting to receive their instructions for the forthcoming election , which , as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals , they instead rebelled and voted to fight the election as a single party . Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister . Most Unionist leaders , including Austen Chamberlain , had supported the Coalition and advocated its continuation . They resigned from their government and party offices , with Austen Chamberlain writing , " The meeting today rejected our advice . Other men who have given other counsels must inherit our burden " . Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister . Neville Chamberlain was in Canada at the time of the meeting and so was not forced to choose between supporting his brother 's leadership and bringing down a man he despised .

 = = = Bonar Law Government ; early ministerial office = = = 
 Many frontbench Unionists refused to serve under Bonar Law , who was forced to form his Cabinet from lower @-@ ranking party members . Liberal MP Winston Churchill , who would lose his seat in the upcoming election , dubbed Bonar Law 's ministry " a government of the second eleven " . The conflict amongst the Unionists greatly benefited Neville Chamberlain , who rose , over the course of ten months , from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer . 
 Bonar Law appointed Chamberlain as Postmaster General , a ministerial post below Cabinet level . Bonar Law called an election shortly after his accession , which the Unionists won , and Chamberlain was re @-@ elected , though his prediction that his seat was " safe as houses " proved dubious — his majority was reduced to 2 @,@ 443 . In January 1923 , Chamberlain granted the first operating licence to the British Broadcasting Company , though he opposed its request to broadcast the King 's Speech setting forth the Government 's programme in opening Parliament . Chamberlain feared that allowing the speech to be aired would lead to broadcast of parliamentary debates over the radio , " a prospect which makes one shudder " . 
 Sir Arthur Griffith @-@ Boscawen , the Minister of Health , had lost his seat in the 1922 General Election and failed to win a by @-@ election in March 1923 . Housing fell within the remit of the Minister of Health . As Chamberlain had experience in developing housing programmes in Birmingham , Bonar Law offered the Health Ministry , within the Cabinet , to him . Chamberlain was initially reluctant , feeling that he should not leave the Post Office before he " had a chance of doing something there " , but decided that " it would not be playing the game " to refuse Bonar Law 's request . There was a great shortage of housing in Britain as a result of pent @-@ up demand from the war years , and almost all housing was rent controlled , giving builders little incentive to build more . Any removal of rent restrictions would be wildly unpopular . Chamberlain introduced a Housing Act in April 1923 that provided subsidies for private companies , and extended rent control until 1925 . He expected rent control to be gradually abolished as the housing supply increased , but the restrictions remained in force until 1933 , when a new scheme was enacted . 
 In May 1923 , Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced terminal throat cancer . He immediately resigned , and King George V sent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Stanley Baldwin , to form a government . Baldwin served as his own Chancellor for three months while he sought a successor and then promoted Chamberlain to the position . Chamberlain had little time for any policy changes , as he served only five months in the office and did not present a budget . Though the Unionists had an ample majority in the House of Commons and the current Parliament had four years to run , Baldwin decided that a general election was needed and that the Unionists should fight it on the issue of tariff reform . He hoped to gain both a personal mandate as Prime Minister and a policy mandate for his tariff proposals . He miscalculated badly : in the general election held in December 1923 the Unionists remained the largest party in the House of Commons , but were outnumbered by the combined Liberal and Labour MPs . The Baldwin Government retained office until it was defeated when Parliament assembled in January 1924 , and Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister . Chamberlain 's majority in Birmingham Ladywood was cut yet again , this time to 1 @,@ 500 votes . 
 With the Unionists in opposition , Chamberlain managed to broker a reconciliation between his brother ( and the other <unk> ) and the new leadership , and Austen Chamberlain resumed his place on the front benches . The Labour government fell within months , necessitating another general election . Neville Chamberlain was challenged by Labour candidate Oswald Mosley , who later led the British Union of Fascists . Mosley campaigned aggressively in Ladywood ; and accused Chamberlain of being a " landlords ' hireling " . The outraged Chamberlain demanded that Mosley retract the claim " as a gentleman " . Mosley , whom Baldwin described as " a cad and a wrong ' un " , refused to retract the allegation . It took several recounts before Chamberlain was declared the winner by 77 votes and Mosley blamed poor weather for the result . Chamberlain had not wanted to desert Ladywood , but now deemed the seat impossible to hold and was adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston for the next election ( held in 1929 ) , at which Ladywood fell to Labour by eleven votes . The Unionists won the 1924 election , their last under that name . Baldwin formed a new government , in which Austen was Foreign Secretary and Neville Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor , preferring his former position as Minister of Health . 
 = = = Minister of Health = = = 
 Within two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health , Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted . Before he left office in 1929 , 21 of the 25 had passed into law . An early , very popular piece of legislation was the Widows , Orphans , and Old Age Pensions Act 1925 , passed after the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Winston Churchill , had agreed to find whatever money was needed to fund the Act . Churchill , recently returned to the Conservative ranks after fifteen years as a Liberal , expressed envy at Chamberlain 's receiving the credit for the Act , and the Minister of Health described his colleague as " a man of tremendous drive & vivid imagination but obsessed with the glory of doing something spectacular which should erect monuments to him " . The Act lowered the age for receiving the government old age pension from 70 to 65 , as well as providing for dependents of deceased workers . Though the pension sum , ten shillings ( today about £ 20 ) per week , was not enough for a pensioner to make ends meet , Chamberlain stated that it was not intended to replace private thrift and that the sum was the maximum financially feasible . 
 Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians , which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates . Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour , and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able @-@ bodied unemployed . Chamberlain 's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925 , which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates , as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment . Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill , who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis . Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript ; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours — with a pair of scissors . 
 Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the 1926 General Strike , in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition . Future Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee complained that Chamberlain " always treated us like dirt " , and Chamberlain wrote in April 1927 , " More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity . " One Labour MP referred to Chamberlain as " a miniature Mussolini " , and others claimed that Chamberlain 's policies had allowed entire communities to starve , dubbing him the " Minister of Death " . His poor relations with the Labour Party eventually played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister . 
 With many mining communities suffering high levels of unemployment following the General Strike , some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances . These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants . With the system thrown into crisis , Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards , and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards . Though no board members were prosecuted , Chamberlain dismissed three boards , replacing their members with his own appointees . Finally , in 1929 , Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely , replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities . Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the second reading of the Bill , and when he concluded , he was applauded by all parties . The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority , and the Morning Post commented that ( despite Labour attacks ) , it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular . 
 = = = Return to opposition = = = 
 Baldwin called a general election for 30 May 1929 . Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph , and thought he would be moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office , where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark . Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston , which he represented for the rest of his life , but the general election resulted in a hung parliament , with Labour holding the most seats . Baldwin and his Government resigned , and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office . 
 Chamberlain anticipated that Labour would legislate for two years , then seek a general election and be returned with a majority of the seats . Were this to occur , he would be 67 when that term expired , and according to him perhaps too old to hold office . With no ministerial responsibilities , he departed on a three @-@ month tour of East Africa , hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary . As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression , the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare , with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election , and for being too moderate . Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin , only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back . During the leadership crisis , Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin . Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself . 
 The campaign by the press lords , notably Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere for " Empire Free Trade " , the removal of tariffs within the Empire , culminated in a crucial by @-@ election at which the press lords ran their own candidate under the banner of the United Empire Party . Robert Topping , the General Director at Conservative Central Office , produced a memorandum showing that Baldwin 's support had eroded tremendously . Chamberlain confronted Baldwin with the memorandum . Baldwin was badly shaken , and told Chamberlain he would resign . After a day , Baldwin reconsidered , and even considered giving up his seat and standing in the by @-@ election himself . When Chamberlain told Baldwin that if he stood and lost , his successor would be badly damaged , Baldwin replied , " I don 't give a damn about my successor , Neville . " Chamberlain resigned as party chairman , though he continued as head of the Conservative Research Department , which he had founded , until his death . Baldwin did not stand in the by @-@ election , but he retained his position and attacked the press barons as wanting " power without responsibility , the prerogative of the harlot through the ages " , and the Conservatives won the election . Baldwin and Chamberlain healed their breach , and Chamberlain helped negotiate the return of the press lords to the Conservative fold . Baldwin led the Conservative Party for another six years . In January 1931 , Churchill , one of Chamberlain 's leadership rivals , left the Conservative front bench in a dispute over policy on India . 
 In 1931 , the MacDonald Government faced a serious crisis , as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced , with an expected shortfall of £ 120 million . As this information became public , there was a run on the pound , depleting the nation 's gold reserves . The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which would be needed to balance the budget , and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party . With Baldwin on holiday in France , Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives . Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made . Finally , on 24 August 1931 , the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government , supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party . Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health . The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient , but governed Britain until Chamberlain 's fall in 1940 . In the ensuing General Election , the National Government won 554 of the 615 seats in the House of Commons , with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs . 
 = = = Chancellor and Conservative heir apparent = = = 
 After the election , MacDonald wanted to designate Liberal National Walter Runciman , an advocate of free trade , as Chancellor . Conservatives insisted that a member of their party who favoured tariffs be given the office . Reluctantly , MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor , and Runciman was made President of the Board of Trade . Chamberlain proposed a 10 % tariff on foreign goods , with lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the Dominions . Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy , " Imperial Preference " ; his sons found it pleasing and appropriate that Chamberlain could now promote his father 's policies , and Sir Austen Chamberlain wrote to his brother in November 1931 , " Father 's great work will be completed in his children . " 
 The tariff issue bitterly divided the Cabinet , and threatened to end the National Government . The Cabinet accepted a proposal by Lord Hailsham , Secretary of State for War , that they agree publicly to disagree , a rare suspension of the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility . Chamberlain prepared his tariff bill , which exempted the Dominions pending the Ottawa Conference , set for later that year . On 4 February 1932 , he laid it before the Commons . Addressing a packed House , with the Prince of Wales , the Duke of York and Joseph Chamberlain 's third wife in the gallery , and with his brother seated behind him , Chamberlain concluded by referring to his father 's inability to get a similar proposal adopted , 
 I think he would have found consolation for the bitterness of his disappointments , if he could have seen that these proposals , which are the direct and legitimate descendants of his own conception , would be laid before the House of Commons , which he loved , in the presence of one and by the lips of another of the two immediate successors to his name and blood . 
 At the end of the speech , Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down and shook his brother 's hand . The Import Duties Act 1932 passed Parliament easily . The Ottawa Conference that August produced little result , with Chamberlain bringing home several minor bilateral trade agreements , and no general agreement . 
 In the interim between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference , Chamberlain presented his first budget , in April 1932 . The gold standard had been abandoned in the early days of the National Government ; the Bank of England sought its restoration . Chamberlain , on advice from his officials , declined to restore the gold standard , realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade . Otherwise , Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government : Chamberlain cut means @-@ tested benefits and public sector wages , which proved to be an unpopular move . He also cut interest rates , which led to a house @-@ building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums . Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget . Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain 's war debt from 5 % to 3 @.@ 5 % . Between 1932 and 1938 , Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt . 
 Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated . In June 1933 , Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference . Describing the event as the " most crucial gathering since Versailles " , Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover , referring to him as " that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes , lean , taciturn , iron @-@ willed ... It is no secret that Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain 's leave . " The Conference came to nothing , when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation . After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act , forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts , Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt , and , as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default , the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain 's war debt payments to the US . 
 In 1934 , Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus , and restore many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant 's salaries he had made after taking office . He told the Commons , " We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of Great Expectations . " With MacDonald in decline and Conservative Party leader Baldwin exhibiting his customary lethargy , Chamberlain increasingly became the workhorse of the National Government . 
 Defence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain 's early budgets . By 1935 , faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler 's leadership , he was convinced of the need for rearmament , and was the driving force behind Defence White Papers advocating rearmament in 1936 and 1937 . Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force , realising that Britain 's traditional bulwark , the English Channel was no defence against air power . Rearmament was an unpopular policy in Britain , and Labour attacked Chamberlain as a warmonger . Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee spoke against the 1936 Budget as tremendously overspending on defence : " Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death . " Churchill also criticised the National Government 's defence plans , though he called for an even faster buildup . Despite the sniping from both sides , Chamberlain was very concerned about the expense of rearmament , " What a frightful bill we do owe to Master Hitler , damn him ! If it only wasn 't for Germany , we should be having such a wonderful time just now . " 
 In 1935 , MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister , taking Baldwin 's post as Lord President of the Council , and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time . Chamberlain remained at the Treasury , almost the only Cabinet member not to be moved in the subsequent reshuffle . Chamberlain was still spoken of as heir apparent , but feared being eclipsed by a younger man . To be seen more as the second man of the Government , he insisted on moving into Number 11 Downing Street , the Chancellor 's traditional residence , which had been occupied by Baldwin during MacDonald 's premiership . Baldwin indicated his desire to remain in office until his 70th birthday in August 1937 , but Chamberlain doubted he would last that long . In the 1935 General Election , the Conservative @-@ dominated National Government lost 90 seats from the massive majority of 1931 , but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons . During the campaign , deputy Labour leader Arthur Greenwood attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament , stating that the rearmament policy was " the merest scaremongering , disgraceful in a statesman of Mr. Chamberlain 's responsible position , to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments " . 
 In January 1936 , Edward VIII became king on the death of his father , George V. Chamberlain supported Baldwin 's stance that King Edward must abdicate if he wished to marry the woman he loved , Wallis Warfield Simpson . After the conclusion of the Abdication Crisis , Baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the Coronation of King Edward 's successor George VI . King George was crowned on 12 May 1937 ; Baldwin resigned on 28 May , advising the King to send for Chamberlain . Sir Austen did not live to see his brother 's final " climb ... to the top of the greasy pole " , having died two months earlier .

 Polemics such as Guilty Men , which helped demolish Chamberlain 's reputation for his foreign policy as premier , also touched on his record as minister . These books blamed the National Government , in which Chamberlain had taken a leading role , for a failure to rearm . Historian David Dutton suggested in his book on Chamberlain that the damage to his reputation , both as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet minister , could have been contained had the Conservative Party defended his policies , but for 23 years after Chamberlain 's death , the party leaders ( Churchill , Anthony Eden , and Harold Macmillan ) had made reputations as opponents of appeasement , and who were little minded to defend Chamberlain 's record as a minister . The Labour landslide in the 1945 General Election cemented this inclination , with Macmillan stating that it was not " Churchill who had brought the Conservative party so low . On the contrary it was the recent history of the Party , with its pre @-@ war record of unemployment and its failure to preserve peace . " 
 The adoption of policies using Keynesian economics led to other criticisms of Chamberlain 's ministerial record . Popular wisdom then held that governments could keep unemployment at a low level through spending . Chamberlain 's acceptance of unemployment as an inevitable part of the business cycle was seen as outdated . In 1958 , as Prime Minister , Macmillan described a report advocating limits on public investment as " a very bad paper . Indeed a disgraceful paper . It might have been written by Mr. Neville Chamberlain 's Government . " 
 In 1961 , a controversial biography of Chamberlain by Conservative Party chairman Iain Macleod defended Chamberlain 's ministerial record . Macleod pointed out that Chamberlain had been a " most valiant " champion of rearmament as Chancellor as early as 1934 , but that little was done . According to Time magazine , Macleod saw Chamberlain as a " humanitarian industrialist , [ a ] progressive Lord Mayor of Birmingham and a dedicated Minister of Health who was damned as a ' Tory socialist ' [ . ] Chamberlain had worked tirelessly in the ' 20s and ' 30s for the ' noble and fascinating ideal ' of fashioning a better life for Britain 's workingman . " 
 The 1960s and 1970s saw a further reassessment of Chamberlain as a Cabinet minister . Historians such as A. J. P. Taylor pointed out that while the 1930s were a decade of misery for some , for most Britons , it was a time of rising living @-@ standards , with unemployment concentrated in only a few regions of the country . As economists and historians came to question the assumption that the National Government could have spent its way out of unemployment , Chamberlain 's tenure as Chancellor was to an extent rehabilitated . American social historian Bentley Gilbert stated that Chamberlain was " the most successful social reformer in the seventeen years between 1922 and 1939 ... after 1922 no one else is really of any significance . " According to Taylor , writing in 1965 , Chamberlain did more to improve local government while serving as Health Minister than did anyone else in the 20th century . 
 In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher instituted economic policies reminiscent of Chamberlain 's as Chancellor — control of inflation ( even at the expense of unemployment ) , minimisation of budget deficits , and low rates of direct taxation . This was a point not lost on the Labour Party , and the Trades Union Congress adopted a slogan of " Forwards to the Eighties not Backwards to the Thirties " . Thatcher 's critics denigrated both her policies and those of the 1930s in such comparisons , but she did not care to defend those of the 1930s . Thatcher stated that the historical justifications for her economic positions were the policies of the Victorian era . 
 Dutton , who traced the progress of Chamberlain 's reputation through the years , wrote in 2001 that Chamberlain 's accomplishments at the Ministry of Health were " considerable achievements by any standards " and stated that they should not be seen in isolation , but as part of " the authentic Chamberlain , a man who was throughout his life on the progressive left of the Conservative party , a committed believer in social progress and in the power of government at both the national and local level , to do good . " Five years later , Chamberlain biographer Graham Macklin quoted Dutton in noting the eclipse of Chamberlain 's earlier accomplishments by his later policy of appeasement : 
 As [ Chamberlain 's ] entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography observed , " Had Chamberlain retired in 1937 , he would not have risked anything . He would have been a considerable figure in British political history , his career a study in success . " But Chamberlain did not retire . He accepted the premiership imagining it to be his crowning glory . As it transpired it was his most bitter personal and political defeat . Thus was the " authentic Chamberlain " — the sincere social reformer — almost entirely obliterated from the popular consciousness by subsequent history and historiography .
