 Larrys Creek then heads southwest back into Mifflin Township , where it passes through the borough of Salladasburg , with Pennsylvania Route 973 running parallel to the creek from the township line to the borough . At Salladasburg , Larrys Creek receives its major tributary , the Second Fork of Larrys Creek , on the right bank 5 @.@ 8 miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) from the mouth . 
 The Second Fork rises in Cogan House Township near the village of White Pine and runs south through the village of Brookside , then a few miles through Cummings Township , and last through Mifflin Township and Salladasburg . Lawshe Run is its major tributary . Pennsylvania Route 287 runs parallel to the Second Fork its whole length , and continues parallel to Larrys Creek from Salladasburg south to its terminus on U.S. Route 220 ( near the creek 's mouth ) . 
 Just south of Salladasburg , Larrys Creek receives the First Fork of Larrys Creek , 4 @.@ 2 miles ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) from the mouth . The First Fork has its source in Cummings Township and flows south @-@ southeast into Mifflin Township . 2 @.@ 8 miles ( 4 @.@ 5 km ) from its mouth Larrys Creek receives Canoe Run . Both these tributaries enter on the right bank . 
 Larrys Creek then enters Piatt Township , flowing east around a ridge and through the village of Larryville where it receives Seeley Run on the left bank , 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the mouth . It next flows back southwest , then south to the hamlet of Larrys Creek and finally into the West Branch Susquehanna River , 2 @.@ 6 miles ( 4 @.@ 2 km ) east of the borough of Jersey Shore , at an elevation of 515 feet ( 157 m ) . U.S. Route 220 and the Lycoming Valley Railroad cross the creek on separate bridges just north of its mouth . The direct distance between the source and mouth is only 16 @.@ 9 miles ( 27 @.@ 2 km ) . The difference in elevation between source and mouth , 1 @,@ 225 feet ( 373 m ) , divided by the length of the creek , 22 @.@ 9 miles ( 36 @.@ 9 km ) , gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or relief ratio of 53 @.@ 5 feet per mile ( 10 @.@ 1 m / km ) . The meander ratio is 1 @.@ 08 , so the creek is fairly straight in its bed .

 From 1960 to 1979 , the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) operated one stream gauge on Larrys Creek at the village of Cogan House , for the uppermost 6 @.@ 8 square miles ( 18 km2 ) of the watershed . The mean discharge measured at this site from 1961 to 1978 was 10 @.@ 8 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 306 m ³ / s ) , with a peak discharge of 1 @,@ 130 cubic feet per second ( 32 @.@ 0 m ³ / s ) and peak gauge height of 5 @.@ 29 feet ( 1 @.@ 61 m ) , both on June 22 , 1972 during Hurricane Agnes . The USGS also estimated mean monthly and annual groundwater recharge at the Cogan House stream gauge . Using data from 1961 to 1977 , the upper and lower annual recharge estimates were 18 @.@ 1 to 14 @.@ 5 inches ( 46 to 37 cm ) , and the greatest monthly recharge was in March , with 20 @.@ 1 % of the annual total . 
 The USGS also measured discharge at the village of Larrys Creek , very near the creek 's mouth , as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975 . The average discharge was 66 @.@ 0 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 87 m3 / s ) , and ranged from a high of 114 cubic feet per second ( 3 @.@ 23 m3 / s ) to a low of 8 @.@ 8 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 25 m3 / s ) . Lycoming County operates a stream gauge at Salladasburg as part of the county @-@ wide flood warning system . It only measures the water height ( not discharge ) and had a peak gauge height of 8 @.@ 0 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , on September 18 , 2004 during Hurricane Ivan . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Larrys Creek is in a sandstone , limestone , and shale mountain region , with the source in the dissected Allegheny Plateau and the mouth in the Ridge @-@ and @-@ valley Appalachians . The southern part of the Larrys Creek watershed has sedimentary surface rocks from the Devonian period , with a large area from the Mississippian period in the north of the watershed and a small Pennsylvanian period region within this area . The Cogan House anticline runs north of and parallel to the upper part of the creek . Iron ore within the watershed was mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century ; there are also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain . 
 Larrys Creek is in a narrow valley formed by mountains and hills , with steep to moderate slopes . The channel pattern is regular , with a dendritic drainage pattern . South of its source , the creek turns to flow southwest along the northern edge of Green Mountain , turns south into the State Game Lands at Buckhorn Mountain , and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain . The only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris Point , where it leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau . 
 The Second Fork flows south along the eastern side of Henson Ridge , then east of Puterbaugh Mountain . The only named peak on the east bank of the Second Fork is Clapp Point , which marks the boundary of the dissected plateau and is southwest of Harris Point . The First Fork flows past the southwest edge of Little Round Top and then continues on the southwest side of Puterbaugh Mountain . Fishery Point is at the southern end of the Allegheny Plateau , just west of the First Fork . The three features named Point are each part of the Allegheny Front , the edge of the Allegheny Plateau . 
 The Larrys Creek watershed has two deposits of low volatile bituminous coal along Roaring Run and a small , deep natural gas field . A potentially large source of natural gas is the Marcellus Shale , which lies 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 0 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 2 km ) below the surface here and stretches from New York through Pennsylvania to Ohio and West Virginia . Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian era range from 168 to 516 trillion cubic feet ( 4 @.@ 76 to 14 @.@ 6 trillion m3 ) , with at least 10 percent considered recoverable . In November 2007 , drilling within the Larrys Creek watershed started in Mifflin Township , just west of Salladasburg , with a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) deep well . A second well was drilled in Mifflin Township in December 2007 , and by February 2008 every well drilled in Lycoming County was producing natural gas . The Marcellus Shale requires special techniques to fracture the rock and release the gas , including pumping sand and water into the well , and , in some cases , horizontal drilling . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The Larrys Creek watershed is entirely in Lycoming County and accounts for 7 @.@ 17 % of the county by area . It is the only major creek whose watershed is entirely in the county , and lies between the Pine Creek watershed ( including Little Pine Creek ) 5 @.@ 2 miles ( 8 @.@ 4 km ) to the west and the Lycoming Creek watershed 11 @.@ 9 miles ( 19 @.@ 2 km ) to the east ( as measured on the river ) . 
 The Larrys Creek watershed has a total population of 2 @,@ 513 ( as of 2000 ) and a total area of 89 @.@ 1 square miles ( 231 km2 ) . Of that area , 74 square miles ( 190 km2 ) are forested and 14 square miles ( 36 km2 ) are given to agricultural uses . Larrys Creek is the largest creek in Lycoming County without its own watershed association . 
 = = = Tributaries = = = 
 The major smaller streams in the Larrys Creek watershed include the First and Second Forks , Roaring Run , Lawshe Run , and Canoe Run . The Second Fork is the largest tributary , with a watershed of 24 @.@ 9 square miles ( 64 km2 ) or 28 @.@ 0 % of the total watershed . The First Fork is next largest , with a watershed of 17 @.@ 6 square miles ( 46 km2 ) or 19 @.@ 8 % of the total . Roaring Run accounts for 5 @.@ 7 % of the total watershed with 5 @.@ 1 square miles ( 13 km2 ) and other tributaries are less than 5 % of the total . 
 Starting at the mouth , the tributaries of Larrys Creek are : Seeley Run , Canoe Run , First Fork Larrys Creek , Second Fork Larrys Creek , Mash Run , " Pond Hollow " , " Spook Hollow " , Roaring Run , " Cramer Hollow " , " Pot Lick Hollow " , " Match Pine Hollow " , " Watt Hollow " , Long Run , Wendell Run , <unk> Hollow Run , Wolf Run , <unk> Hollow Run , and Birch Run ( unnamed streams in a named feature are given as the name of the feature in quotation marks ) . 
 = = = Water quality , pollution , and filtration plant = = = 
 The clear @-@ cutting of forests in the 19th century adversely affected the ecology of the Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality . Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries . As of 2006 , water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good , although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine . Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution . <unk> limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5 @-@ day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand ( <unk> ) are 25 mg / L , while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100 mL in May through September , and 2000 per 100 mL in October through April . 
 The mean annual precipitation for Larrys Creek is 40 to 42 inches ( 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 100 mm ) . According to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission : " Pennsylvania receives the most acid deposition of any state in the nation because , in addition to being the third highest producer of the gases that cause acid deposition , we are also located downwind from the highest concentration of air pollution emitters . " The region 's geology gives it a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid . This makes the creek especially vulnerable to increased acidification from rain , which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek . 
 The Jersey Shore Area Joint Water Authority ’ s water filtration plant is on Larrys Creek , near the border between Mifflin and Anthony Townships . The plant has been there since at least 1914 and provides water from the creek to 2 @,@ 500 industrial and residential customers in the boroughs of Jersey Shore and Salladasburg , as well as Anthony , Mifflin , Nippenose , Piatt , and Porter Townships in southwestern Lycoming County , and Pine Creek Township in the southeastern part of neighboring Clinton County , Pennsylvania . 
 = = = Recreation = = = 
 There are at least two camps along Larrys Creek . " Camp Kiwanis " has a main lodge , four cabins , picnic pavilion , and various recreational facilities on 50 acres ( 20 ha ) on Route 287 , 1 @.@ 0 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Salladasburg in Mifflin Township . It is operated as a service by the Williamsport Kiwanis and rented out for fire department training , Girl Scouts , weddings , church , and other groups . Further south along the creek in Piatt Township is the New Tribes Mission camp for preparing Christian missionaries for field work with indigenous peoples in remote parts of the world . The training at the camp lasts one year . 
 Edward Gertler writes in Keystone Canoeing that Larrys Creek " has an exceptionally scenic , ultra @-@ highwater , whitewater run that is really worthy of your attention " . Canoeing and kayaking on Larrys Creek are possible when the water is high enough ( in Spring and after hard rain ) , with 8 @.@ 0 miles ( 12 @.@ 9 km ) of Class 3 whitewater on the International Scale of River Difficulty from Township Road 786 south through the State Game Lands to Route 973 , and 7 @.@ 4 miles ( 11 @.@ 9 km ) of Class 1 to 2 whitewater south from PA 973 to U.S. 220 . 
 In addition to the 2 @,@ 881 acres ( 1 @,@ 166 ha ) in State Game Lands No. 114 , opportunities for hunting and fishing are available in the areas of Tiadaghton State Forest in the western part of the watershed , along the First and Second Forks . In 2002 , a Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) report on " State Forest Waters with Special Protection " rated the First Fork as a " High Quality @-@ Cold Water Fishery " . A stretch of Larrys Creek from the water company filtration plant ( near the border between Mifflin and Anthony Townships ) to 1 @.@ 0 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) downstream of the confluence with the First Fork has been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission . This means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season . 
 There are also private hunting and fishing clubs and cabins along Larrys Creek and its tributaries . The largest is the " Larrys Creek Fish and Game Club " , incorporated August 1 , 1906 , which owns over 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 400 ha ) along Route 287 on the Second Fork . As of 2006 , the club has 55 active and 15 honorary members ( all male ) . The club promotes conservation and stocks its 7 miles ( 11 km ) of trout stream with three to four thousand brook and brown trout each year . The club 's facilities include a trapshooting range and a helipad , to aid in medical evacuations from its remote location . 
 Another large private club is the Ogontz Lodge on the First Fork , established by banker Jay Cooke about 1884 for fishing and hunting . Cooke owned nearly the whole First Fork , 9 @.@ 2 miles ( 14 @.@ 8 km ) long , with the main " Lodge " 1 @.@ 2 miles ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) from the mouth , and a smaller " Upper Cabin " 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) upstream of that . Herbert Hoover found solitude at the Ogontz Lodge as a guest of Jay Cooke III three times : in June , 1918 ( just before leaving for Europe as head of the American Food Administration ) , mid @-@ May , 1928 ( just before his selection as the Republican presidential candidate ) , and finally in late May , 1930 ( as President of the United States ) . Other notable guests at the Ogontz Lodge include Theodore Roosevelt , Jr. and Katharine Hepburn , and it is still in operation as of 2007 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early inhabitants = = = 
 Two Clovis points found in the Salladasburg area in a " stream site " are the earliest evidence of human activity along Larrys Creek ( circa 10 @,@ 000 BCE ) . The earliest recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks . Their name meant " people of the muddy river " in Algonquian . Decimated by diseases and warfare , they had died out , moved away , or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century . The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee phratry of the Lenape ( or Delaware ) , and were under the nominal control of the Five ( later Six ) Nations of the Iroquois . The Great Shamokin Path crossed the creek at a ford near its mouth ; however , no trails of the indigenous peoples are recorded as having followed Larrys Creek north . 
 On November 5 , 1768 , the British acquired the " New Purchase " from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix , opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement . However , the Line of Property ( or Purchase Line ) border defined by " Tiadaghton Creek " dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed . The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek , the Iroquois and other tribes that it was Lycoming Creek . Larrys Creek was in the disputed territory between these , so the illegal settlers there were part of the " Fair Play Men " system of self @-@ government , with their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4 , 1776 . 
 In the Revolutionary War , settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British . After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 ( near what is now Wilkes @-@ Barre ) and smaller local attacks , the " Big Runaway " occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley . Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies . Homes and fields were abandoned , with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy , then further south to Sunbury . The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers . Some settlers soon returned , only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the " Little Runaway " . Sullivan 's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement , which continued after the war . 
 On April 13 , 1795 , Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County , prompting further growth . In 1800 , the " State Road " was the second major road built in the county and followed part of Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township as it ran from Newberry ( the western part of Williamsport today ) north to the Pennsylvania @-@ New York state line near Painted Post , New York . Larrys Creek had a bridge near the mouth by 1806 , the first of the major creeks in the county for which a bridge is mentioned . 
 = = = Lumber = = = 
 Like all creeks in Lycoming County , Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms . As logging became a major industry in the mid @-@ 19th century , the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills . The first sawmill on the creek , in what is now Mifflin Township , was built in 1799 . The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport ( as they were on Pine Creek to the west ) . 
 This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills : the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles ( 35 km ) of the mouth ( as well as other industries of the time ) . No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory . Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork , six on the First Fork , one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run , and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself . Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills , and only four were steam powered ( the rest were water powered ) . The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 ( near Seeley Run ) , the last in 1902 ( on Lawshe Run ) , and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating . 
 Lumbering removed the tree trunks , but left many flammable limbs , branches , and stumps behind . On May 2 , 1872 , a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township . There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today . 
 = = = Paper railroads = = = 
 Two " paper railroads " were proposed for Larrys Creek : the " Larry 's Creek Railroad and Coal Company " , incorporated June 24 , 1839 to hold 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) and operate up to 7 miles ( 11 km ) of railroad from the mouth of the creek north to the coal mines ; and the " Jersey Shore , Pine Creek & State Line Railroad " , incorporated on April 11 , 1853 to run north from Jersey Shore up Pine Creek to Tioga or Long Run , and thence to the New York state line . Its charter was amended April 4 , 1854 to run up Marsh Creek ( then known as the Third Fork Pine Creek ) and Crooked Creek to the Tioga Railroad , and again on March 26 , 1856 to run up Little Pine Creek ( then known as First Fork Pine Creek ) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to Blossburg . It was still an active corporation in 1865 , but the charter of the " Jersey Shore , Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway " in 1870 ( New York City @-@ Reading interests ) superseded it . Neither railroad was actually ever built . The only railroad in the watershed crosses the creek just north of the mouth . 
 = = = Plank road = = = 
 In 1851 a plank road or puncheon was built along Larrys Creek from the village of Larrys Creek at the creek 's mouth north to Salladasburg , then later along the Second Fork and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township . It was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the village of English Center in Pine Township ( along the current course of Pennsylvania Route 287 ) . A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek into Anthony Township was also built , but it is not known how far it extended . ( Landis claims it may have run nearly as far north as the covered bridge in Cogan House Township ) . The plank road was a toll road run by " The Larrys Creek Plank Road Company " , a corporation founded May 8 , 1850 . It served the sawmills , grist mills , mines , and leather tanneries along the creek . There was a connection to the railroad and the West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal at the hamlet of Larrys Creek , as well as the West Branch Susquehanna River . 
 Hemlock logs were used to build the plank road . At that time , the tree 's bark was a major source of tannin used to tan leather . The wood was not used much for lumber , so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot . There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry . 
 The earth under the plank road was first graded , then ties ( similar to those used for railroad tracks ) were set into the ground . Next long narrow stringers ( similar to rails on a railroad track ) were nailed to the ties , with a distance between stringers of about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . The road surface consisted of planks about 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth . The road had turnoffs ( as it was not wide enough for horse @-@ drawn vehicles to pass each other ) . Toll houses were at regular intervals , with variable tolls for pedestrians , riders on horseback and various carts and wagons . No toll schedule has survived . 
 The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1 , 1889 washed out much of it . The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek 's mouth . The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood , which killed over 2200 people . The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood , as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream . The 90 foot ( 27 m ) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877 , listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 , rehabilitated in 1998 , and is today one of just three left in the county . 
 By then most of the original forests in the county had been clear @-@ cut , so no cheap source of wood was available as before . While the road from Salladasburg south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt , the rest was not . In 1900 the county courts recognized a petition to end tolls on this last portion of the road . The corporation was dissolved and the road and its maintenance passed to the county . As sections of plank road wore out they were replaced by graded dirt and gravel , so that it soon became a regular road . The plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years . Today only the " Plank Road " name survives , in a 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 0 @.@ 97 km ) section of road that runs north from U.S. Route 220 , parallel to Route 287 . 
 = European Nucleotide Archive = 
 The European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA ) is a repository providing free and unrestricted access to annotated DNA and RNA sequences . It also stores complementary information such as experimental procedures , details of sequence assembly and other metadata related to sequencing projects . The archive is composed of three main databases : the Sequence Read Archive , the Trace Archive and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( also known as EMBL @-@ bank ) . The ENA is produced and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute and is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ( INSDC ) along with the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank . 
 The ENA has grown out of the EMBL Data Library which was released in 1982 as the first internationally supported resource for nucleotide sequence data . As of early 2012 , the ENA and other INSDC member databases each contained complete genomes of 5 @,@ 682 organisms and sequence data for almost 700 @,@ 000 . Moreover , the volume of data is increasing exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 10 months . 
 = = History = = 
 The European Nucleotide Archive originated from separate databases , the earliest of which was the EMBL Data Library , established in October 1980 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( EMBL ) , Heidelberg . The first release of this database was made in April 1982 and contained a total of 568 separate entries consisting of around 500 @,@ 000 base pairs . In 1984 , referring to the EMBL Data Library , Kneale and Kennard remarked that " it was clear some years ago that a large computerized database of sequences would be essential for research in Molecular Biology " . 
 Despite the primary distribution method at the time being via magnetic tape , by 1987 , the EMBL Data Library was being used by an estimated 10 @,@ 000 scientists internationally . The same year , the EMBL File Server was introduced to serve database records over <unk> , <unk> and the early Internet . In May 1988 the journal Nucleic Acids Research introduced a policy stating that " manuscripts submitted to [ Nucleic Acids Research ] and containing or discussing sequence data must be accompanied by evidence that the data have been deposited with the EMBL Data Library . " 
 During the 1990s the EMBL Data Library was renamed the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and was formally relocated to the European Bioinformatics Institute ( EBI ) from Heidelberg . In 2003 , the Nucleotide Sequence Database was extended with the addition of the Sequence Version Archive ( SVA ) , which maintains records of all current and previous entries in the database . A year later in June 2004 , limits on the maximum sequence length for each record ( then 350 kilobases ) were removed , allowing entire genome sequences to be stored as a single database entry . 
 Following the uptake of Sanger sequencing , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute ( then known as The Sanger Centre ) had begun cataloguing sequence reads along with quality information in a database called The Trace Archive . The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high @-@ throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina . In 2008 , the EBI combined the Trace Archive , EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( now also known as EMBL @-@ Bank ) and a newly developed Sequence ( or Short ) Read Archive ( SRA ) to make up the ENA , aimed at providing a comprehensive nucleotide sequence archive . As a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration , the ENA exchanges data submissions each day with both the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank . 
 = = EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database = = 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ( also known as EMBL @-@ Bank ) is the section of the ENA which contains high @-@ level genome assembly details , as well as assembled sequences and their functional annotation . EMBL @-@ Bank is contributed to by direct submission from genome consortia and smaller research groups as well as by the retrieval of sequence data associated with patent applications . 
 As of release 114 ( December 2012 ) , the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database contains approximately 5 × 1011 nucleotides with an uncompressed <unk> of 1 @.@ 6 terabytes . 
 = = = Data classes = = = 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database supports a variety of data derived from different sources including , but not limited to : 
 Expressed sequence tags with their associated sample data . 
 Nucleotide sequence being generated from whole genome sequencing projects at varying stages of assembly , including complete contigs and annotated , fully assembled sequence . 
 Data relating to <unk> , such as complementary DNA , with optional annotation . 
 Novel or extended annotations of existing coding sequences , for example new sequence versions with corrected start or stop codons . 
 = = = EMBL @-@ Bank format = = = 
 The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a flat file plaintext format to represent and store data which is typically referred to as EMBL @-@ Bank format . EMBL @-@ Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in <unk> and GenBank , though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature , such as taxonomies as defined by the NCBI Taxon database . Each line of an EMBL @-@ format file beings with a two @-@ letter code , such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record ; each record ends with / / . 
 = = Sequence Read Archive = = 
 The ENA operates an instance of the Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) , an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release . Originally called the Short Read Archive , the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads . Currently , the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next @-@ generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and <unk> SOLiD as well as some corresponding analyses and alignments . The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ( INSDC ) and is the fastest @-@ growing repository in the ENA . 
 In 2010 the Sequence Read Archive made up approximately 95 % of the base pair data available through the ENA , encompassing over 500 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sequence reads made up of over 60 trillion ( 6 × 1013 ) base pairs . Almost half of this data was deposited in relation to the 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their sequence data to the SRA in real @-@ time . In total , as of September 2010 , 65 % of the Sequence Read Archive was human genomic sequence , with another 16 % relating to human metagenome sequence reads . 
 The preferred data format for files submitted to the SRA is the BAM format , which is capable of storing both aligned and unaligned reads . Internally the SRA relies on the NCBI SRA Toolkit , used at all three INSDC member databases , to provide flexible data compression , API access and conversion to other formats such as <unk> . 
 = = Data access = = 
 The data contained in the ENA can be accessed manually or programmatically via REST URL through the ENA browser . Initially limited to the Sequence Read Archive , the ENA browser now also provides access to the Trace Archive and EMBL @-@ Bank , allowing file retrieval in a range of formats including XML , HTML , <unk> and <unk> . Individual records can be accessed using their accession numbers and other text queries are enabled through the EB @-@ eye search engine . Additionally , sequence similarity @-@ based searches implemented using De Bruijn graphs offer another method of retrieving records from the ENA . 
 The ENA is accessible via the EBI SOAP and REST APIs , which also offer access to other databases hosted at the EBI , such as <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = Storage = = 
 The European Nucleotide Archive handles large volumes of data which pose a significant storage challenge . As of 2012 , the ENA 's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially , with a doubling time of approximately 10 months . To manage this increase , the ENA selectively discards less @-@ valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies . The <unk> reference @-@ based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements . 
 = = Funding = = 
 Currently the ENA is funded jointly by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory , the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust . The emerging <unk> framework , coordinated by EBI director Janet Thornton , aims to secure a sustainable European funding infrastructure to support the continued availability of life science databases such as the ENA . 
 = Daruvar Agreement = 
 The Daruvar Agreement ( Croatian , Serbian : <unk> sporazum ) was a document negotiated by Croatian and Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) local authorities in the United Nations Protected Area ( UNPA ) for the SAO Western Slavonia , also known as Sector West on 18 February 1993 , during the Croatian War of Independence . The agreement provided for the improvement of water and electrical power supply , the return of refugees to their homes and the opening of transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting Croatian Army @-@ controlled areas near towns of Nova Gradiška and Novska . It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the <unk> and RSK @-@ controlled portions of Sector West . The agreement was named after Daruvar , the site of its signing . 
 The Daruvar Agreement , mediated by the head of the United Nations ( UN ) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer , was negotiated in secrecy . When the central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the arrangement , the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested . The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities . Fischer and other UN officials , who were involved in mediation of the agreement , were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter . Fischer soon left the area . 
 = = Background = = 
 In November , Croatia , Serbia and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) agreed upon the Vance plan , designed to halt combat operations in the Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement . Besides the ceasefire , the plan entailed protection of civilians in specific areas , designated as United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) , and UN peacekeepers in Croatia — United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) . The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992 . Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted , the European Community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992 , while the <unk> and JNA @-@ held areas within Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . 
 Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months . When its troops eventually pulled out , JNA left their equipment to the RSK . As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire , the UNPROFOR , did not start to deploy until 8 March . The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs . The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs , ceasefire maintenance , monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons and refugees . Those comprised more than 300 @,@ 000 Croats who were exiled from the RSK @-@ controlled territory , and 20 @,@ 000 Serbs who fled the areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) in Operations Swath @-@ 10 , Papuk @-@ 91 and Hurricane @-@ 91 in late 1991 . 
 A part of western Slavonia , encompassing an area extending approximately 90 by 45 kilometres ( 56 by 28 miles ) , was designated as the UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan . Unlike other UNPAs , the RSK controlled only a part of the area — approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south — centred on the town of Okučani . The RSK @-@ held area included a section of the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway . The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV would attack the area to control the motorway . In response , the UNPROFOR developed Operation Backstop aimed at defending against the HV attack , assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway . 
 = = Cooperation schemes = = 
 Division of Sector West into <unk> and RSK @-@ controlled areas fragmented the market for locally grown agricultural produce , and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers . Furthermore , the RSK @-@ controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity , while the Croatian @-@ held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK @-@ held area to the south of the town . The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West , Gerard Fischer , and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala , commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West , to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area . 
 Their efforts resulted in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK @-@ held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian @-@ controlled areas , and the supply of potable water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West . Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities . The scheme involved up to 2 @,@ 500 refugees who would be allowed to rebuild their homes , funded by the Austrian government . The funds , in the amount of 1 @.@ 3 million dollars , were obtained through Michael <unk> , Special Assistant to the Director @-@ General of the United Nations Office at Vienna . 
 = = = Formal agreement = = = 
 Fischer attempted to gain wider support for the cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West . Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that such a move would prevent renewed fighting in the area . The result of Fischer 's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement . The agreement , signed in Daruvar on 18 February , encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks , the reopening of the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non @-@ commercial traffic , the facilitation of the Novska – Nova Gradiška railway , the repair of telecommunication lines , the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West , the return of all refugees to their homes , the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line , and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation . 
 On behalf of the RSK local authorities , the agreement was signed by Veljko Džakula , Dušan Ećimović , Milan <unk> , Mladen <unk> , Đorđe <unk> and Milan <unk> . At the time , Džakula held the position of deputy prime minister , while Ećimović was a government minister in the RSK . Signatories on behalf of the Croatian local authorities were Zlatko Kos , Zdravko <unk> , Ivan <unk> , Vladimir <unk> and Želimir <unk> . Fischer signed the agreement as a witness . According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia testimony given by Džakula at the trial of Milan Martić , Ivan <unk> was present at the signing of the agreement as a representative of the Government of Croatia , accompanied by <unk> <unk> , Croatian Deputy Interior Minister . According to Džakula , no effort was made to conceal the signing of the agreement , even though the negotiations beforehand were kept secret . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the agreement through a report filed by the 18th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina on 26 February , eight days after it was signed . The main opposition to the agreement came from Milan Martić , the RSK Interior Minister . Leadership of the ruling Serb Democratic Party accused Džakula of handing the RSK territory to Croatia . The RSK leadership considered the Daruvar Agreement tantamount to admission of economic <unk> of the RSK and an act of treason . District council of the RSK @-@ controlled western Slavonia condemned the agreement because it was enacted only in the Croatian language , and failed to note the existence of the RSK or its administrative divisions . 
 Džakula and Ećimović were sacked from their government positions , and from the positions of regional authority in the RSK @-@ held western Slavonia . The other three RSK signatories were dismissed from their official posts as well . At local elections held in May 1993 to fill the vacated posts , Džakula was elected to serve as the Mayor of Pakrac municipality . On 21 September , Džakula and Ećimović were arrested , and taken to Knin prison and then to Glina while the investigation was in progress . On 3 December , they were released only to learn that the arrest of the two , and <unk> , was ordered days later . In order to evade the arrest , the three fled the RSK to Serbia . On 4 February 1994 , Džakula was abducted in Belgrade by the RSK agents and taken back to the RSK . 
 The RSK 's response to the agreement ended Fischer 's efforts . Moreover , Fischer , Zabala and <unk> were criticised by the UN , citing their excessive assertiveness in the matter . Fischer left Croatia , and Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March . The Zagreb – Belgrade motorway was reopened in December 1994 through an agreement between the governments of the RSK and Croatia . However , a series of armed incidents in late April 1995 led to a Croatian military intervention and the capture of the portion of Sector West previously controlled by the RSK in Operation Flash in early May . 
 = Warwick Armstrong = 
 Warwick <unk> Armstrong ( 22 May 1879 – 13 July 1947 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 50 Test matches between 1902 and 1921 . An all @-@ rounder , he captained Australia in ten Test matches between 1920 and 1921 , and was undefeated , winning eight Tests and drawing two . Armstrong was captain of the 1920 – 21 Australian team which defeated the touring English 5 – 0 : one of only three teams to win an Ashes series in a whitewash . In a Test career interrupted by the First World War , he scored 2 @,@ 863 runs at an average of 38 @.@ 68 , including six centuries , and took 87 wickets . He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 . 
 Armstrong was a large man ( 6 foot 3 inches – 1 @.@ 9 m tall and 21 stones – 133 kg or 294 lb ) and was known as the " Big Ship " . He was not a stylish batsman but his strokeplay was effective , with a sound defence and temperament . He bowled leg spin with a gentle action and while not a big turner of the ball , he relied on accuracy to dismiss opponents . He made his Test debut in 1902 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) and was selected to tour England later that year where he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . That was the first of four tours of England . He was involved in several altercations with cricket administrators and was one of the " Big Six " who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England after a dispute with the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket . 
 A talented Australian rules footballer , Armstrong briefly represented South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League before playing Test cricket . He was employed as a pavilion clerk by the Melbourne Cricket Club for much of his cricket career , who allowed him time to play cricket . Following his retirement from Test and first @-@ class cricket after the successful 1921 tour of England , Armstrong took a position as an agent for a scotch whisky distributor and wrote on cricket for the Sydney Evening News . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Armstrong was born in the rural Victorian town of Kyneton in 1879 , the eldest son of John and his wife Amelia ( née Flynn ) . The marriage was across the sectarian divide , then strong in Australia : John was an Anglican ; Amelia was a Catholic . The Armstrong family moved to Melbourne in 1880 , settling in the inner suburb of Emerald Hill . An inheritance enabled the family to move to a larger house , " <unk> Glen " in North Caulfield , Victoria in 1888 . 
 Armstrong attended <unk> School , a respected sporting member of the Schools Association , a group of smaller private schools in Melbourne . By 1893 , he had found himself a spot in the school XI and came to the attention of the press , catching the eye of journalists Reginald Wilmot and Tom Horan . Armstrong joined the nearby Caulfield Cricket Club and played in a senior premiership with the club at the age of 15 . 
 The next year the St Kilda Cricket Club , one of the leading clubs in Melbourne 's pennant competition , gave the youthful Armstrong a trial . In the 1896 – 97 season , Armstrong fell out with St Kilda and returned to Caulfield . His last years of school were at University College . 
 Leaving school at 19 , Armstrong joined his father 's former club , South Melbourne , captained by Australian Test captain Harry Trott . Armstrong was an immediate success , scoring 101 runs against University and 173 against his former club , St Kilda . He was selected to represent Victoria against Tasmania in Hobart in January 1899 , as one of seven in the squad making their first @-@ class cricket débuts . Armstrong 's performance was promising , scoring six and 33 and taking four for 78 in 27 overs . 
 Armstrong began regular Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1899 – 1900 season . In his first match against New South Wales in January 1900 , he dismissed Syd Gregory with his second delivery and scored 45 runs in the second innings . In the Pennant season for South Melbourne , Armstrong scored 665 runs at an average of 95 ; this included 145 and six for nineteen against the Melbourne Cricket Club , the largest club in Melbourne whose team included many Test and first @-@ class cricketers .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Following his feats against it in 1899 – 1900 , Armstrong was recruited for the next season by the Melbourne Cricket Club ( MCC ) . For the next twenty years , on and off the pitch , Armstrong 's fortunes were tied to the club , a leading cricketing light in Australia and a bastion of the city 's rich and powerful . He scored his maiden first @-@ class century , 118 , against South Australia , facing the very fast and physically dangerous bowling of Ernie Jones , and by the end of the 1900 – 01 season he was a permanent member of the Victorian team . 
 The England cricket team , organised and captained by Archie MacLaren , toured Australia to compete for the Ashes in the summer of 1901 – 02 . The English were considered a poor and undermanned team , but it surprised all by winning the first Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground by an innings and 124 runs . Before the second Test , Armstrong had an excellent all @-@ round performance against New South Wales , dismissing Test players Victor Trumper and Syd Gregory , and then scoring 137 in reply . When the team for the Melbourne Test was announced , Armstrong was selected , making his début with Reggie Duff from New South Wales . 
 Armstrong made a steady start to Test cricket . Batting at No. 9 on a sticky wicket , he made four not out in the first innings , in an Australian total of 116 . In reply , England could only score 61 . With the wicket still treacherous , Australia rearranged their batting order to save the better batsmen until conditions improved . The two debutants , Duff and Armstrong , were positioned at 10 and 11 , and shared a 120 @-@ run partnership for the last wicket , Duff scoring 104 and Armstrong 45 not out . Australia won the Test by 229 runs . Armstrong played in the remaining Tests in the series , narrowly heading the averages with 159 runs at an average of 53 , and Australia went on to win comfortably by four matches to one . 
 Armstrong was selected as part of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1902 . He started the tour well , taking eight for 47 in the second innings against Nottinghamshire , his best bowling figures to that date . The first Test , at Edgbaston was rain @-@ affected and the Australians were lucky to come away with a draw , being dismissed for 36 in their first innings . The rest of the close @-@ fought series was followed with interest by the English public . The second Test at Lord 's was rained off , and Australia won the third at Bramall Lane by 143 runs . The final two Tests were nail @-@ biters — Australia winning the fourth at Old Trafford by only three runs and England earning a consolation victory in the fifth Test at the Oval by one wicket , when last @-@ wicket pair George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes eked out the final runs . Armstrong had a good tour , making 1 @,@ 075 runs at 27 @.@ 56 and taking 72 wickets at an average of 17 @.@ 90 , but the star for the Australians was Victor Trumper , who made 2 @,@ 570 runs at an average of 48 @.@ 49 including eleven centuries . 
 On the return trip to Australia , the touring team stopped in South Africa to play three Tests , the first between the two nations . In the second Test at Johannesburg , Armstrong scored 159 , just over half the Australian score of 309 and carried his bat through the innings as Australia won the Test by 159 runs . Australia won the Test series two – nil . On return to Australia for the 1902 – 03 season , he made 580 runs at an average of 58 and 23 wickets at an average of just over 19 . The highlights of his season included 145 against Queensland and a hat @-@ trick against New South Wales . 
 Plum Warner 's English team toured Australia in 1903 – 04 , the first to do so under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club . The strong English team defeated Australia three – two , retrieving the Ashes . Armstrong did not have a good series . He was tormented by Rhodes , who dismissed him eight times in ten meetings for Victoria and Australia that summer . As a result , he was dropped from the Australian XI after the Third Test . 
 Returning to club cricket , Armstrong found form , scoring 438 in only 455 minutes for Melbourne against University , from a total score of 699 for eight . In the 1904 – 05 season , Armstrong scored 460 runs at 57 @.@ 5 for Victoria to secure selection for the 1905 tour of England . 
 = = = Consolidation and conflict = = = 
 The 1905 Australians left for England , leaving behind the beginnings of a conflict between players and administrators over control of cricket that would poison the sport in Australia for the next ten years . While previous tours of England had been underwritten by the Melbourne Cricket Club and organised by the players , the new Australian Board of Control was asserting its right to control Australian cricket . 
 Armstrong , finding himself promoted to number five in the batting order , started the tour well with 112 against Nottinghamshire and 248 against Gentlemen of England at Lord 's . In the first Test at Trent Bridge , Australia 's lack of effective bowling options had Armstrong forced to bowl wide outside the leg stump in an early form of leg theory bowling to prevent the England batsmen from scoring quickly . <unk> and taciturn , Armstrong maintained an accurate line and length , and put a strangle on both England 's run @-@ scoring and the crowd 's entertainment . It was a recurrent pattern for the rest of the series , and lead to what was seen by spectators and the press as dull cricket . Batsmen like the imperial Archie MacLaren would kick the ball away contemptuously , but lissome Johnny Tyldesley proved that runs could still made if a batsman employed more enterprise . Hopping away to leg to make room for himself , Tyldesley cut and drove the leg @-@ spinner to great effect in a strategy later used by Don Bradman against the bodyline menace . 
 Armstrong 's tactics were ultimately futile , a Stanley Jackson @-@ inspired England winning the series by two Tests to none . For the season , he scored 1 @,@ 902 runs at an average of fifty . Regarding his batting , Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack said , " The great batsman of the eleven was Armstrong . In form nearly all through the tour , he struck the happy medium , being brilliant without recklessness . " The highlight of his tour was a triple century ( 303 not out ) at the Recreation Ground in Bath against Somerset . 
 When the team returned to Australia , the rift between the players and the Board of Control widened . The dispute saw the English postpone their tour , scheduled for 1906 – 07 . In the midst of all this turmoil , Armstrong continued to impress : on tour with Melbourne Cricket Club in New Zealand , he was described by that country 's Herald newspaper as a " team almost in himself " . He made 868 runs at an average of 124 to complement his 83 wickets at under ten . He was elected captain of Victoria by his team @-@ mates for the match against New South Wales , commencing on New Year 's Eve , responding with six for 68 with the ball and then scoring 168 in the second innings as part of a sturdy rearguard effort . 
 Armstrong found employment with the Department of Home Affairs and , as a result , declared himself unavailable for the next match against South Australia . He was mortified when he found that he had been included in the team and that the Victorian Cricket Association ( VCA ) had approached his employer to ask for leave on his behalf , despite his having explicitly instructed the VCA secretary otherwise . Armstrong refused to play and was called to face a disciplinary hearing at Young & Jackson 's Hotel . <unk> indignant , he was left unpunished . 
 The scheduled tour postponed from the previous season kicked off with the arrival of an English team weakened by the withdrawals of a number of leading players . The first Test saw an Australian victory , Armstrong bowling 53 overs and taking four for 92 . More squabbling , this time over expenses , followed between Armstrong and the VCA , and the former withdrew from the Boxing Day match against New South Wales . Armstrong sought a ₤ 1 per diem , but the VCA held fast at ten shillings . It then mounted a campaign in the Melbourne press , attempting to portray Armstrong as avaricious and once again called him to front a disciplinary commission . Following threats of suspension , Armstrong was forced to apologise to the VCA . The fracas did not affect his form , however : the second Test , starting on New Years Day , saw Armstrong score 31 and 77 and take five wickets for 89 . Despite his efforts , England won a hard @-@ fought Test by one wicket . 
 Australia took the third Test in Adelaide , and a patient 133 in 289 minutes from Armstrong in the fourth saw Australia clinch the series and win back the Ashes . The margin was four – one , but both teams were criticised by reporters for slow scoring and negative cricket . 
 Once again , the selection and management of the Australian team to tour England in 1909 caused friction between leading players and the Board of Control . Clem Hill , unwilling to tour on the terms offered by the Board , withdrew his name from consideration . Regardless , the tour was a success , both for the Australians , who won the series two @-@ one , and for Armstrong , who made 1 @,@ 451 runs at an average of just under 44 and took 133 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 40 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack described his role in the tour as " to keep the side together by means of his impregnable defence , and he did exactly what was required , only on rare occasions giving free play to his hitting power . When he likes to let himself loose there is no harder driver in the world " . 
 Armstrong , along with Monty Noble , <unk> Cotter and Bert Hopkins returned home via Sri Lanka ( then Ceylon ) , Penang and Singapore , where they were lavishly entertained and comfortably billeted by the elite of the Colony . Their hosts took the cricketers on a trip to the British protectorate of Perak for a shooting expedition where Armstrong contracted malaria . He would suffer relapses throughout the rest of his life . 
 = = = Rebellion = = = 
 Armstrong was appointed captain of an Australian team touring New Zealand in 1909 – 10 , partly as recognition of his accomplishments and partly due to the unavailability of other candidates , such as Trumper . Suspicions still ran high between the Board and the players and Trumper , tiring of what he perceived as persecution , retired from first @-@ class cricket . The tour did not include any Test matches , although a match was played against a representative New Zealand team . Australia won every game , save a draw against Canterbury . Armstrong , more diplomatic as captain than some commenters had been expecting , turned down a lucrative offer to coach the Auckland team . 
 The Melbourne Cricket Club found Armstrong a job as " pavilion clerk " . His duties were broadly defined in order to allow him to meet his representative cricket obligations . These included matches against the touring South Africans , scheduled to play five Tests in 1910 – 11 . The first Test saw Australia win by an innings and 114 runs thanks mainly to an innings on 191 from Hill and eight wickets to Bill Whitty . Armstrong nearly missed the second Test in Melbourne with a case of mumps . He recovered , and although still unwell managed to score 75 and take 4 – 134 from 48 overs . In the fourth Test , Armstrong compiled another century , 132 including a partnership of 154 with Hill . Australia won the series comfortably , winning four of the five Test matches with their only loss at Adelaide by 38 runs . Returning to cricket after his self @-@ imposed exile , Victor Trumper was the leading player for the Australians during the series scoring 661 runs at an average of 94 . 
 The English team returned to Australia the following season to compete for the Ashes with Pelham Warner once again captain of a very strong English team that included bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster . Warner suffered from an illness early in the tour and handed the captaincy to Johnny Douglas . After losing the first Test , England won the remaining four Tests comfortably . In the second Test at Melbourne , Armstrong played one of his best Test innings . Facing exceptional bowling from Foster and Barnes , he made a nerveless 90 , including 14 boundaries , before being dismissed by Foster . 
 While this series took place , the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted rights of the players to appoint a manager when touring England . The hostility between the players and the board saw a fist fight break out between Clem Hill and Peter McAlister at a selection meeting . When the Board announced that George Crouch would be manager of the Australian team for the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England , rather than the player 's choice , Frank Laver , outright rebellion ensued . Armstrong , Hill and Trumper , along with Hanson Carter , <unk> Cotter and Vernon Ransford ( known as the " Big Six " ) announced that they would be unavailable to join the touring party . The team , under the captaincy of Syd Gregory , left without these players . The tour was not a success on any front : the Australians winning only eight games and losing nine in a wet season and Crouch on return to Australia reported to the Board that " some of the players had conducted themselves so badly in England as to lead to the team being socially ostracised . " 
 International cricket was placed on hold as a result of the outbreak of the Great War . Armstrong had been named captain of the Australian team to tour South Africa in 1914 – 15 , however the tour was unable to take place . Armstrong chose not to enlist in the military during the war and kept his own counsel on the subject . He continued to work and play cricket for Melbourne Cricket Club , participating in the occasional fund @-@ raising fixture . 
 = = = Captain = = = 
 When international cricket resumed after the Great War , Armstrong , now over forty years of age , was appointed captain of a strong Australian team boosted by the inclusion of players such as Jack Gregory and Herbie Collins who had starred in the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team . Armstrong was much older than many of his team @-@ mates and was the subject of some awe ; Gregory describing him as " my ideal cricketer " . The English team , captained once again by Johnny Douglas was no match for the Australians , who won all five Tests in the 1920 – 21 series , completing the first and only Ashes whitewash for 86 years on 1 March . Armstrong was masterful throughout the Test series . He scored 474 runs at an average of over 77 including three centuries ; 158 in Sydney , 121 in Adelaide and 123 not out in Melbourne . Before going out to bat in the second innings at Sydney , he was seen , " padded up , [ drinking ] whisky with his mates at the members ' bar " . 
 Armstrong remained unpopular with the Board of Control . Despite Armstrong 's triumphs , it was reported that he was only appointed captain of the 1921 Australian team to tour England by " the narrowest possible margin " . On the voyage to England , Armstrong attempted to lose some weight by spending some time each day in the stokehold of the ship . On arrival , however , he weighed in 4 pounds ( 2 kg ) heavier . Against English teams badly affected by the Great War , the Australians dominated the series . Armstrong marshalled his troops well , utilising Gregory and Ted McDonald to devastating effect . Australia won the first Test in two days , the second Test by lunch on the third day and the third Test and the Ashes by 5 @.@ 00 pm on the third day . Throughout the tour , Armstrong fought a series of running battles against the Board appointed manager , Syd Smith , on behalf of his men . Smith , looking to cut overheads , had suggested boarding with wealthy cricket devotees ; Armstrong dismissed the idea . 
 The fourth Test at Old Trafford was famous for two events , both involving Armstrong . The first day 's play was washed out and England commenced their innings the following day , the match now a two @-@ day affair . Lionel Tennyson , the English captain , declared his innings closed with twenty minutes of play left in the day . The Australian wicket @-@ keeper , Sammy Carter pointed out to Armstrong that a declaration at that time in a two @-@ day match was against the laws of cricket as they stood at that time . Armstrong protested to the umpires and England were forced to continue batting . In the commotion , Armstrong managed to bowl two overs in succession , an action also against the laws of cricket . 
 By the fifth Test , the Australian team was in sight of being the first Australian team to remain unbeaten throughout a tour of England . Once again , much of the first day was lost to rain . Determined not to lose , Armstrong attempted to delay commencement after the rain and was heckled by English supporters . He told his three main bowlers , " I won 't ask you not to get a man out , but as long as Mead ( a notoriously slow scoring batsman ) remains at the wicket we can 't be beaten " . In the last three hours of the Test , Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part @-@ time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves . During this time , Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field and began to read . When asked about this later , Armstrong was said to have replied , " I wanted to see who we were playing " , although this is claimed to be apocryphal . The Australians drew the Test and won the series three – nil , however they could not maintain their unbeaten record , losing by 28 runs to an English XI at Eastbourne and again to C. I. Thornton 's XI at Scarborough . 
 Despite the two losses , the tour was a triumph for Armstrong . Personally , he achieved the 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets milestone for the third time in an English summer . About his captaincy , former rival Frank Foster said , " I honestly think that Australia have got to thank one man , one man only for their success . That man is Warwick Armstrong , probably one of the best captains ever sent to England from Australia " . On return to Australia , Armstrong was greeted by large enthusiastic crowds and acclaimed at many public receptions . At one reception , he was presented with a ₤ 2 @,@ 500 cheque by the Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes . 
 If ever there was a man singled out as a king of sport it was Mr. Armstrong , who had gone out to give the people of England a chance to regain the Ashes and who had returned , like Imperial Caesar , who came , saw and conquered .

 The 1921 tour was Armstrong 's swan song in first @-@ class cricket . On the journey back to Australia , he suffered a relapse of the malaria that had plagued him since his earlier visit to Malaya . This kept him from taking part in any of the matches in South Africa , allowing Herbie Collins to captain Australia for the first time . Armstrong resigned from his job with Melbourne Cricket Club and drawing on contacts he had made while on tour took a role as an agent for Dawson 's Scotch Whisky . He remained in the liquor trade until his retirement in 1946 . Armstrong also applied his cricket background acting as a cricket journalist for the Sydney Evening News . His copy was promoted as " frank and fearless " and was generally contemptuous of much of the cricket and cricketers he saw , especially of what he saw as dull cricket . 
 In 1922 he wrote a primer on cricket titled The Art of Cricket published by Methuen & Co , London . 
 In July 1913 he married Aileen O 'Donnell , the daughter of a wealthy Irish Australian pastoralist with large land holdings in the Riverina region of New South Wales . The couple met while Armstrong was representing the Melbourne Cricket Club in a match against a Wagga Wagga XV . Armstrong and his new wife settled in Melbourne , moving to the Sydney suburb of Edgecliff for business reasons in 1935 . Aileen died of a thrombosis in 1940 . Armstrong , following illness that saw him lose much of the weight that he was known for , died on 13 July 1947 , leaving an estate to the value of ₤ 90 @,@ 000 . He was survived by his son , Warwick George . 
 Armstrong was an all @-@ round sportsman , playing Australian rules football in the winter for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) , the premier competition in the state , from 1898 to 1900 . A slim utility , he played 16 games for the club , scoring 18 goals . He played in South Melbourne 's losing 1899 VFL Grand Final team defeated by Fitzroy by one point . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 Although slim as a young man , Armstrong grew into a big man , weighing 133 kilograms ( 293 lb ) and being 190 centimetres ( 6 foot 3 inches ) tall . As a result , he acquired the nickname " The Big Ship " . His oversize shirt , measuring 26 centimetres ( 10 in ) by 85 centimetres ( 33 in ) and his shoes , 32 centimetres ( 13 in ) long by 18 centimetres ( 7 in ) wide are on display at the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame . A story told of Armstrong had a young boy following him around at a tour match in Southampton . Armstrong , thinking it a manifestation of hero worship , offered to sign the boy 's autograph book . The boy turned to Armstrong and said , " Please , sir , you are the only bit of decent shade in the place . " 
 As a batsman , Armstrong was not a stylist . The Times , in describing Armstrong 's batting after he scored his maiden century against Sussex in 1902 said , " Mr. Armstrong 's methods were not attractive " . 
 His pose at the wickets gives an impression of awkwardness which is not dispelled when he shapes to play the ball and his strokeplay is essentially laboured ... His methods , however , are remarkably effective ; they show a most admirable blend of aggression and caution , backed by the right temperament . His defence is very sound , watchful and painstaking , his strokeplay is limited in its variety , but very sound in its execution . 
 Armstrong was tireless as a leg break bowler and was known for his ability to land the ball on any point of the pitch he liked . His action imparted as much topspin as leg spin , making it difficult for batsman to detect his " straight @-@ breaks " . Early in his career , he bowled negative leg theory but later used his accuracy to great effect , bowling an over or two of leg breaks and then the straight one in the hope of bowling the batsman or receiving a leg before wicket dismissal . His action consisted of an easy amble and a gentle arc and was described in the Sporting Life as " rather like a fat uncle , not altogether unlike a fat aunt . " It was effective , however , with the Daily Telegraph stating after the first Test in 1921 , " there is not a single batsman in England who faces with any appearance of confidence his innocuous slows . " 
 Armstrong was renowned for his gamesmanship and was willing to push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable behaviour in order to obtain an advantage for his team . In 1909 , the English all @-@ rounder Frank Woolley was making his Test début against the Australians at the Oval . Taking advantage of a rule that allowed bowlers to bowl trial balls or " <unk> " , Armstrong kept Woolley waiting nervously for more than fifteen minutes while he bowled trial balls alongside the pitch . In a club game against St Kilda , Armstrong claimed a catch in the slips , only to have the umpire refuse the dismissal . It was the last ball of the over and as the field changed , Armstrong brusquely inquired why this was so . Informed that the ball had struck the batsman 's pads , Armstrong then appealed for a leg before wicket dismissal , which the umpire then upheld . 
 Armstrong was not a " walker " ; he believed in waiting for the umpire to make a decision , once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan , " The more you play this game , the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa " . English professional cricketers took a dim view of Armstrong 's approach to the game . Jack Hobbs , describing one instance said , 
 The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong , who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike , refusing to accept the umpire 's decision . That upset me . I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go , never even attempting to play it ; and it bowled me . I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong .

 M @-@ 113 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs in Grand Traverse County from M @-@ 37 near Hannah to US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) in Walton Junction . The trunkline runs through farm fields and woodlands in a rural area of the county . It connects the highways at its termini with the village of Kingsley . First designated in November 1927 , the highway was extended in 1940 by adding the southernmost section near Walton Junction which was originally part of US 131 .

The trunkline follows Main Street through the business district in the village . On the east side of town , M @-@ 113 runs through fields mixed with scattered groves of trees . The landscape transitions over to woodland just before a 90 @-@ degree turn south near Fife Lake . About one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the turn , M @-@ 113 intersects M @-@ 186 at the latter 's western terminus .

 M @-@ 113 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 113 were the 7 @,@ 519 vehicles daily in the village of Kingsley ; the lowest count was 4 @,@ 161 vehicles per day south of the M @-@ 186 intersection .

 = HMS Minotaur ( 1906 ) = 
 HMS Minotaur was the lead ship of the Minotaur @-@ class armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy . Launched in 1906 , she served as the flagship of the China Station before the First World War . Shortly after the war began , the ship searched unsuccessfully for the German East Asia Squadron and was transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914 . During the rest of the war Minotaur served as the flagship of the 7th and 2nd Cruiser Squadrons and spent most of her time assigned to the Northern Patrol . In mid @-@ 1916 she participated in the Battle of Jutland but did not fire her weapons during the battle . The ship was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap the following year . 
 = = Description = = 
 Minotaur displaced 14 @,@ 600 long tons ( 14 @,@ 800 t ) as built and 16 @,@ 630 long tons ( 16 @,@ 900 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 519 feet ( 158 @.@ 2 m ) , a beam of 74 feet 6 inches ( 22 @.@ 7 m ) and a mean draught of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) . She was powered by a pair of four @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , which developed a total of 27 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 20 @,@ 130 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . The engines were powered by 24 Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers . The ship carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 060 long tons ( 2 @,@ 090 t ) of coal and an additional 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 8 @,@ 150 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 090 km ; 9 @,@ 380 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Minotaur was designed to carry 779 officers and men , but mustered 825 in 1909 . 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of four BL 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch Mark X guns in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . Her secondary armament , ten BL 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mark II guns , were mounted amidships in single turrets . Anti @-@ torpedo boat defence was provided by sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder ( three @-@ inch ) 18 @-@ cwt guns . Minotaur also mounted five submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , one of which was mounted in the stern . 
 The waterline belt consisted of 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of Krupp cemented armour roughly between the fore and aft 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun turrets , but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 6 – 8 in ( 152 – 203 mm ) of armour . The thickness of the lower deck was 1 @.@ 5 – 2 inches ( 38 – 51 mm ) . The armour of the conning tower was 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Minotaur was ordered as part of the 1904 – 05 naval construction programme as the last of three Minotaur @-@ class armoured cruisers . She was laid down on 2 January 1905 at Devonport Royal Dockyard and was christened on 6 June 1907 by the Countess of Crewe . The ship suffered a coal gas explosion that injured three sailors and one dockyard worker on 6 November before she was commissioned on 1 April 1908 . Minotaur cost £ 1 @,@ 410 @,@ 356 . The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon commissioning . She escorted the royal yacht Victoria and Albert from Kiel , Germany to Reval when King Edward VII and his wife visited in Russia in June . The next month Minotaur escorted the battlecruiser Indomitable as it carried the Prince of Wales to Canada to commemorate the tercentenary of Quebec City . The ship was transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron when the Home Fleet reorganized on 24 March 1909 . She was present for two fleet reviews in June and July before she was ordered to the China Station in January 1910 to relieve King Alfred as flagship . 
 Minotaur was in Wei Hai Wei on 3 July 1914 when most of the ships assigned to the China Station were ordered to assemble at Hong Kong . Shortly after the start of the First World War , the ship , together with the armoured cruiser Hampshire and the light cruiser Newcastle sailed for the German @-@ owned island of Yap . They captured the collier <unk> on 11 August and destroyed the radio station there with gunfire . They then unsuccessfully searched for the ships of the East Asia Squadron until the light cruiser Emden was reported to have destroyed several ships in the Bay of Bengal in mid @-@ September . Minotaur was ordered to the west coast of Sumatra to search for the German warship , but was unsuccessful . She was then ordered to escort a troop convoy from Wellington , New Zealand in late September . The ship was detached from the convoy and ordered to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope and reinforce the squadron there on 6 November after the Admiralty learned of the defeat at the Battle of Coronel . Upon her arrival Minotaur became flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station under the command of Vice Admiral Herbert King @-@ Hall and escorted a South African troop convoy to <unk> Bay in German South @-@ West Africa . The ship was near Table Bay , South Africa when the East Asia Squadron was destroyed during the Battle of the Falklands in early December and she was ordered home on 8 December . 
 Upon her arrival , Minotaur became flagship of the 7th Cruiser Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Arthur <unk> , based at Cromarty Firth . She received a brief refit in early 1915 and was then assigned to Northern Patrol for the next year . The ship received a QF 12 @-@ pounder ( three @-@ inch ) 12 @-@ cwt anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) gun and a QF three @-@ pounder ( 47 mm ) AA gun in 1915 – 16 . The 12 @-@ pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the three @-@ pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear . The ship was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron on 30 May 1916 and participated in the Battle of Jutland on the following day as flagship of Rear Admiral Herbert Heath . She remained unengaged throughout the battle and did not fire her 9 @.@ 2 or 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns at all during the battle . Minotaur was also present during the attempted interception of the High Seas Fleet by the Grand Fleet on 19 August although no combat occurred . For the rest of the war , the ship was assigned to the Northern Patrol . On 11 December 1917 , together with her sister Shannon and four destroyers , she was assigned to patrol the convoy route between Lerwick and Norway , but the Germans successfully destroyed a convoy off the Norwegian coast on the following day and returned home without being spotted . The British ships were only able to rescue survivors and escort the sole surviving ship from the convoy , the crippled destroyer Pellew , back to Scapa Flow . 
 In 1917 – 18 the 12 @-@ pounder AA gun mounted on the aft superstructure was moved to the roof of the forward 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch gun turret and a fire @-@ control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast . Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919 , placed on the disposal list in May , put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month . 
 = BX ( sternwheeler ) = 
 The BX sternwheeler was the first of two river steamers built for service on the upper Fraser River by the BC Express Company during the busy era of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway construction . The BX was built at Soda Creek in early 1910 by Alexander Watson Jr , of Victoria , who was one of British Columbia 's foremost shipbuilders and the son of the man who had built the Charlotte . The BC Express Company also hired Captain Owen Forrester Browne to be the master of the BX as he was the most experienced upper Fraser River pilot . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Captain Browne worked with Alexander Watson throughout the design and construction phases of the BX . Watson purchased the BX 's boiler , engines and other equipment from the Chicago Marine Ironworks Company , who were informed that the BX 's construction site at Soda Creek was 167 miles ( 269 km ) away from the railway at Ashcroft and therefore the equipment would have to be hauled by horse drawn freighters for that distance . Chicago Marine decided to build the boiler in sections , the heaviest piece was less than 10 @,@ 000 lb ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) , so it was easily transported to the construction site . They also supplied two compound condensing engines for the BX which would use half the fuel of a single engine of similar power . These engines gave the BX an enormous advantage over the other sternwheelers that were on the river at this time , as it cut down on both the labor needed to load the wood and the cargo space required to carry <unk> was later estimated that these engines saved the BX a sum equal to the amount of her construction , $ 54 @,@ 531 @.@ 33 . 
 For the hull , Watson turned to local man , William Lyne , who was a portable sawmill <unk> was instructed to find a good stand of fir and cut the necessary timbers and planks . Intending to build a steamer with the lightest draught possible , Watson built the rest of the BX out of first grade cedar , shipped up from Victoria . Construction began in February when Watson arrived with a crew of fifty carpenters , <unk> and labourers and work was begun on the hull . 
 At the end of March , a near catastrophe occurred . The ice on the Fraser suddenly broke up and piled up at Soda Creek Canyon , a quarter mile from the BX 's construction site . The river overflowed its banks and chunks of ice were deposited all over the site . The rushing water knocked the BX off its blocks and swept many of the tools and supplies out of the warehouse and down into the river . Luckily the workers had heard the ice breaking up in the canyon and had been able to scramble to higher ground and safety . When the floodwaters receded , Watson was able to inspect the BX and found that the only damage done was some twisted and broken timbers that were quickly replaced . The company swiftly shipped up the replacement tools and supplies from Ashcroft and work resumed once more . 
 When the BX was completed , she had three decks , with stateroom accommodation for 70 passengers and could also carry another 60 deck passengers . The staterooms featured steam heat , hot and cold running water , fine quality bedding and attractive wall and floor coverings . Her dining room could seat 50 and was lavishly furnished , right down to the plates , which were specially ordered from England and monogrammed in the BX Company 's colors : red , yellow and white . Off the ladies cabin above the covered paddlewheel a bridal chamber was built , which contained , among other luxuries , a double brass bed and a silk <unk> worth $ 150 . Many dignitaries , including Premier Richard McBride would travel in the comfort of this sumptuous suite . 
 = = Maiden voyage = = 
 The BX was launched at Soda Creek on Friday May 13 , 1910 , without ceremony . Many people of a superstitious bent , especially the shipyard workers , criticized Watson and Browne for choosing to launch a ship on a Friday the 13th . The BC Express Company mollified the workers by explaining that it was the company 's lucky day . 
 Watson and Browne were pleased with how the BX sat in the water , her draught was only 16 inches ( 410 mm ) at the bow and 20 inches ( 510 mm ) at her deepest part . Even fully loaded , with a hundred tons of freight , she only sat 30 inches into the water . 
 She left Soda Creek for her first trip upstream on May 23 , leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am . Captain Browne made semi @-@ weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George , the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon . He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon , offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan . However , Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX did not need to line through and could run the canyons unaided . By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side . However , by the fall of 1910 , the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her passengers on board . This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals , all of which had to line through both canyons , wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers . 
 The BX arrived in South Fort George on June 24 , to a warm welcome from the local populace . The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte , <unk> and Quesnel . Nevertheless , local residents had been anticipating the day of the BX 's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse . Many local business decisions were going to be based on this , as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and <unk> from the south . One businessman , hotelier Al Johnson , was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George 's first licensed hotel , the Hotel Northern . The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town @-@ site , so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George . The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun . This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George 's rival town @-@ site , Central Fort George on the <unk> River , which had hoped for the BC Express 's landing and offices for itself . George Hammond , the promoter for Central , made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town @-@ site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George . 
 = = The route = = 
 Once the BX had been successfully tested in the canyons , she began a semi @-@ weekly passenger and mail service from Soda Creek to Fort George . The BX would meet the company horse stages or automobiles at Soda Creek and would leave at 3am on Sundays and Wednesdays , arriving in Quesnel at noon , offload cargo and passengers and continue upriver until dark . The next day she would start again at dawn and arrive in Fort George around 11am . The return trips downriver were much faster , the BX would leave Fort George on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 7am and arrive in Soda Creek at 4pm the same day . She made good speed through the canyons , often as fast as 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) . 
 In 1910 , the stage fare from Ashcroft to Soda Creek was $ 27 @.@ 50 , steamer fare from there to Fort George was $ 17 @.@ 50 , meals were 75 cents and berths , $ 1 @.@ 50 . Along the route , if a settler needed the BX to stop , they simply raised a white flag along the riverbank and the steamer would pull over and land . A white flag was never ignored , it might only be a settler wanting to ship some produce to market , or it could be a sick child that needed emergency transportation to a hospital . 
 Late in 1910 , the BX fulfilled a heroic role . The <unk> had been on its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George 's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel . When news of this reached Fort George , pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow @-@ shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX with the necessary supplies . By then ice had begun to form along the river , but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George , without as much as a scratch on her paint . 
 1911 was a busy year as more settlers poured into the district , and in 1912 , the BX was joined by her sister ship , the BC Express , which under the command of Captain Joseph <unk> , had been built for service on the Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache section of the upper Fraser . However , that year the Fraser was very low and all the sternwheelers had trouble . The BX rammed the same rock twice in the Fort George Canyon , until her crew , in case of frustrated over @-@ exuberance , dynamited the offending boulder , thereby breaking every window in the BX in the process . 
 But 1912 also brought some very good news for all the local river steamers , and the area in general . It was announced that another railway was going to be built , the Pacific Great Eastern which would run from Vancouver to Fort George and eventually beyond to the Peace River Country . Foley , Welch and Stewart would be the contractors for this railway as well and they planned to build the grade along the upper Fraser River from Fort George to Soda Creek so that sternwheelers could be used to aid in its construction . 
 In 1914 , the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific was finished and construction on the Pacific Great Eastern began and the Foley , Welch and Stewart boats , the Operator and the Conveyor joined the BX and the BC Express on the route between Soda Creek and Fort George . By then , the rivalry between the FW & S boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon came down to a race . The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister ship Operator , as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express , so one day in July , the Conveyor 's Captain Shannon challenged Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek . The rules were rather odd , as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could run right through . As the race progressed , it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat , as she had stayed ahead for most of the race , despite having to stop several times . At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor , but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor . Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again . Fortunately Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met and that there was no serious damage . In fact , when Browne arrived in Quesnel , he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again . When the full tale was heard by the local populace , it was unanimously agreed that the BX was the winner and she was declared the " Speed Queen of the Fraser " . Captain Shannon , meanwhile was apologetic , and had stated that he just got caught up in the moment . 
 That would be the last race on the upper Fraser River , because that August would bring the onset of World War I and the halting of construction of the Pacific Great Eastern . 
 = = The end of an era = = 
 In 1915 , only the BX was used on the upper Fraser River , with the BC Express reserved for special trips . Despite having a monopoly on river traffic , the BX finished the season with a $ 7000 loss . 
 In 1916 and 1917 , sternwheelers were not used on the river at all . In 1918 , after an appeal from the Quesnel Board of Trade , the provincial government granted the BC Express Company a $ 10 @,@ 000 per year subsidy to continue river navigation from Soda Creek to Fort George . The BX ran until August 30 , 1919 , when she was punctured by an infamous rock called the " Woodpecker " and sank with a 100 tons of bagged cement intended for construction of the Deep Creek Bridge . The BC Express Company , fully intending to salvage their prized craft , hired Alexander Watson Jr to rush up from Victoria to overhaul the BC Express , which had been out of service since 1915 , so she could go rescue the BX . However , out at the site of the accident , it was discovered that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze @-@ up . In the spring of 1920 , the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $ 40 @,@ 000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George . The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George . This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon . That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain <unk> . The BC Express ran until November 1920 and then it joined the BX on the riverbank at Fort George , where their hulls were abandoned . In a sense , they lived on , as their engines and equipment were shipped to Northern Alberta to work on the Mackenzie River for the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company . 
 = Flood ( Halo ) = 
 The Flood are fictional parasitic alien life forms in the Halo video game series created by Bungie . They are introduced in Halo : Combat Evolved as a second enemy faction alongside the Covenant ; they return in sequels Halo 2 , Halo 3 , Halo Wars , and as a gametype in Halo 4 . The Flood are driven by a desire to infect any sentient life they encounter , and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient Forerunners were forced to kill themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100 @,@ 000 years ago in an effort to starve the Flood to death . 
 The Flood 's design and fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees , who utilized unused concepts from the earlier Bungie game Marathon 2 . The ringworld Halo was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood 's appearance more startling . Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre @-@ production time refining the Flood 's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood @-@ infested space ships for Halo 3 . 
 The player 's discovery of the Flood in Halo : Combat Evolved is a major plot twist , and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release . The Flood 's return in Halo 2 and Halo 3 was less enthusiastically praised . Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years ; while some found the Flood too derivative and a cliché element of science fiction , some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time . 
 = = Game development = = 
 The Flood were added early in the development of Halo : Combat Evolved , before the game had made its jump from the Macintosh platform to the Xbox . A design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997 . Commenting upon the inception of the Flood , Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that " the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy @-@ spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci @-@ fi . Yeah , and bad sci @-@ fi too . " Another inspiration was Christopher Rowley 's The Vang series . The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees , who considers himself " the architect " of the Flood ; the Flood 's roots are reflected in concept art of a " fungal zombie " that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game Marathon 2 : Durandal . McLees also did all the early concept art for the Flood . 
 Based on the behavior of viruses and certain bacteria , the Flood were intended to be " disgusting and nasty " . The creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants , so the artists had to make sure the Flood soldiers were recognizable enough while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected . Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints — initially , the Flood were intended to convert any species of the alien Covenant into soldiers . " We didn 't have the resources to make it happen , " McLees recalled , so they modified the game 's fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops . At one point , the ringworld Halo featured dinosaur @-@ like terrestrial creatures , but these were dropped due to gameplay constraints . An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood . 
 For Halo 3 , it was decided a new visual language for the Flood was needed . The task of developing the new Flood forms , organic Flood terrain , and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon , Bungie 's Senior Environment Artist . With the addition of mutable forms in Halo 3 , the only fictional constraint on the designer 's imaginations was that the Flood altered the DNA of its victims by digesting . 
 Early concepts of what became " pure forms " featured the creatures wielding an array of weapons via tendrils , while forms like the Flood <unk> and Flood Transport concepts never made it into the final game . Flood @-@ infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance Flood biomass , as well as provide surfaces for the game 's artificial intelligence to exploit and move on . New additions were designed to be multi @-@ purpose ; exploding " growth pods " that spew Flood forms were added to the game to adjust pacing , provide instant action , and add to the visuals . Endoscopic pictures provided further inspiration . Bungie used Halo 3 's improved capacity for graphics to make a host 's sudden transformation into Flood form more dramatic ; two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real @-@ time .

 = = = Halo : Combat Evolved = = = 
 The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through Halo : Combat Evolved 's campaign , during the mission " 343 Guilty Spark " . The Master Chief is sent on an extraction mission by the artificial intelligence Cortana to find Captain Jacob Keyes , who disappears in a swamp while looking for a weapons cache with which to fight the alien Covenant . The Master Chief discovers that the Covenant have released the Flood accidentally , and the sheer numbers of the parasite overwhelm Keyes and his squad . Keyes ' squad is turned into soldiers for the parasite , while Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth . Keyes successfully resists , but is assimilated by the Flood before Master Chief can rescue him . The emergence of the Flood on the ringworld Halo prompts Halo 's resident artificial intelligence 343 Guilty Spark to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo 's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak . When Master Chief learns of the devastation that Halo would cause to humanity and all other sentient life if activated , he detonates the human ship Pillar of Autumn 's engines , destroying the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping . 
 The Flood are depicted as having a complicated lifecycle . The largest self @-@ contained form that the Flood can produce itself , without using other biomass , is an " infection form " . The infection form seeks hosts living or dead , attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system . The host is incapacitated while the infection form burrows into the host 's body and begins the mutation process , bringing the host under Flood control . Depending on the size or condition of the body , the Infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food . Larger hosts are seen turned into forms for combat , growing long whiplike tentacles , while mangled and disused hosts are turned into incubators for more infection forms . The Flood also create forms not suited to combat , which interrogate and strip information from the minds of its victims or serve as a central intelligence to drive the infestation .

Successfully assimilating most of the Covenant and wildlife aboard the ship , the Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by Rtas ' Vadumee , who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun . The second story , Breaking Quarantine , details the escape of Sergeant Avery Johnson from the clutches of the Flood , immediately after Keyes ' squad is overrun during Halo . Due to a pre @-@ existing medical condition , the Flood parasites cannot infect Johnson and attempt to kill him instead . Whereas the Flood are only hinted at being intelligent in Halo : Combat Evolved , the Halo Graphic Novel shows the Flood have a hive mind , assimilating the knowledge of their hosts rapidly . Lee Hammock , writer of The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor , described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace , rather than something the player encounters and shoots . Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood , and " hopefully euthanize the idea that they are just space zombies " .

 The Flood make a return appearance in Halo 2 , first after being released on a Forerunner facility near Halo , and again on Installation 05 or " Delta Halo " . The Flood on Delta Halo are led by the Gravemind , a massive creature that dwells in the bowels of the ring . Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and the Arbiter and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring . In the meantime , Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad and crashes it into the Covenant space station of High Charity . Once there , the Flood sweep through the city , before Gravemind appears and questions Cortana . As the Flood spread across Halo and infect High Charity in Halo : Ghosts of Onyx , the Covenant form a blockade in an effort to prevent the parasite from leaving its prison .

 The Flood reappear in the Halo 3 mission " <unk> " , on board a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo . While the infestation of Earth is prevented by the <unk> of the only site of outbreak , in the East African continent , Gravemind follows Master Chief and his allies to the Ark aboard the infested High Charity . Though the Master Chief and Arbiter form a tenuous alliance with the Flood to stop the activation of all the Halo rings , as soon as the firing sequence is stopped Gravemind turns on them . The Master Chief fights his way to the center of High Charity , freeing Cortana and destroying the city , but Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on the ring under construction by the Ark . Realizing that lighting the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation and spare the galaxy , the Master Chief , Arbiter , Cortana and Sergeant Johnson proceed to Halo 's control room , activate the ring , and escape . Gravemind leaves the Master Chief and the Arbiter with a final warning that his defeat will only delay the Flood 's goal of consuming all sentient life . Halo 3 added new capabilities to the Flood , including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time . The Flood are also seen to produce a mutable " pure form " which can mutate into several other Flood types . 
 = = = Forerunner Saga = = = 
 It is revealed in the novel Halo : Silentium that the Flood are what remains of the Precursors , an ancient race that was said to accelerate the evolution of a species and " shape galaxies " . 10 million years before the war between the Flood and the Forerunners , the Precursors created many races including humanity and the Forerunners . The Forerunners were the first born of these created races , and were bestowed , by right of inheritance , with the venerable Mantle of Responsibility , which is a complex concept involving the preservation of life . 
 Despite careful preparations , patience and remedial efforts by the overseeing Precursors , it became apparent that the Forerunners were irredeemable and grossly unworthy of their inheritance , to the extent of becoming a direct threat to the Mantle itself . Eventually , the Precursors reached the limit of their patience , and determined that to protect the Mantle , the Forerunners must be reserved for utter destruction . However , the Forerunners discovered the Precursors ' intentions before they could be carried out , and in defiance , hunted the Precursors to the verge of extinction . Surviving Precursors proceeded to protect their own continued existence , by creating a biological powder which can be used to reconstruct their genome when it is safe for their resurrection . However , time rendered the powder corrupted and malfunctioning , and it became mutagenic , reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into the Flood . The sole surviving Precursor , who discovered this catastrophic failure of the final solution , remarked that as the Precursors ' destruction would be permanent , it was " good " that the solution failed in the way it did , as the Flood would insure that none of their creations would persist to threaten the Mantle . The Flood was unleashed on the galaxy , its first target being a space @-@ faring civilization of prehistoric humans .

 The Flood have been featured in four series of Halo action figures , produced by Joyride Studios . For Halo : Combat Evolved , Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle . Halo 2 's series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form ( bundled with the Master Chief ) , which were released after the video game . Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair <unk> expressed the sentiment that Joyride 's models could not totally capture the <unk> texture and detail of the Flood . The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood , the third series featured a human Combat Form . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The surprise appearance of the Flood during Halo : Combat Evolved was seen as an important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playing of the game . Gamasutra , writing about video game plots , gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of Halo , but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot . Mark <unk> of Rolling Stone credited the appearance of the Flood as an excellent way to keep players on their toes by forcing them to adjust their strategies , as well as being a twist as radical " as if , several levels into a game of Pac @-@ Man , the dots suddenly began to attack you " . 
 Despite the positive acclaim in Halo , the response to the presence of the Flood in Halo 2 and Halo 3 was mixed . A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in Halo 2 for no obvious reasons , and were simply described as " aggravating " to play against . Similarly , reviewers including Victor <unk> of The Dallas Morning News felt that the Flood were too derivative of other sci @-@ fi stereotypes , and functioned as " space zombies " . Daniel Weissenberger of <unk> noted in his review of Halo 3 that even though the Flood looked better than ever , their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time . GamesRadar 's Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the worst part of Halo , contrasting what he considered fun , vibrant and open levels before the Flood 's appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies . The Flood have been recognized as some of the greatest game villains . Wizard Magazine ranked the Flood as the 77th Greatest Villains of all time , Game Daily ranked them 5th of their " Top 25 Enemies of All Time " , and PC World ranked the Flood the 31st " Most Diabolical Video @-@ Game Villains of All Time " . Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the Flood in their top ten list of " badass undead " . MTV considered Flood possession in Halo 3 as a " great gaming moment " of 2007 , stating that " with the power of the Xbox 360 's graphics , this reanimation comes to vivid , distressing life , more memorably than it had in the earlier games . Here are the zombies of gaming doing what they do worst . [ ... ] It 's grisly and unforgettable . " IGN listed the Flood as the 45th best video game villain , describing them as one of the most hated video game villains in the history of video games . 
 = Islay = 
 Islay ( / <unk> / EYE @-@ lə ; Scottish Gaelic : Ìle , pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . Known as " The Queen of the Hebrides " , it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of the Irish coast . The island 's capital is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located . Port Ellen is the main port . 
 Islay is the fifth @-@ largest Scottish island and the seventh @-@ largest island surrounding Great Britain , with a total area of almost 620 square kilometres ( 239 sq mi ) . There is ample evidence of the prehistoric settlement of Islay and the first written reference may have come in the 1st century AD . The island had become part of the Gaelic Kingdom of Dál Riata during the Early Middle Ages before being absorbed into the Norse Kingdom of the Isles . The later medieval period marked a " cultural high point " with the transfer of the Hebrides to the Kingdom of Scotland and the emergence of the Clan Donald Lordship of the Isles , originally centred at Finlaggan . During the 17th century the Clan Donald star waned , but improvements to agriculture and transport led to a rising population , which peaked in the mid @-@ 19th century . This was followed by substantial forced displacements and declining resident numbers . 
 Today , it has over 3 @,@ 000 inhabitants and the main commercial activities are agriculture , malt whisky distillation and tourism . The island has a long history of religious observance and Scottish Gaelic is spoken by about a quarter of the population . Its landscapes have been celebrated through various art forms and there is a growing interest in renewable energy . Islay is home to many bird species such as the wintering populations of Greenland white @-@ fronted and barnacle goose , and is a popular destination throughout the year for birdwatchers . The climate is mild and ameliorated by the Gulf Stream . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Islay is 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) long from north to south and 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) broad . The east coast is rugged and mountainous , rising steeply from the Sound of Islay , the highest peak being Beinn <unk> , which is a Marilyn at 1 @,@ 612 feet ( 491 m ) . The western peninsulas are separated from the main bulk of the island by the waters of Loch Indaal to the south and Loch <unk> to the north . The fertile and windswept southwestern arm is called The Rinns , and Ardnave Point is a conspicuous promontory on the northwest coast . The south coast is sheltered from the prevailing winds and , as a result , relatively wooded . The fractal coast has numerous bays and sea lochs , including Loch an t @-@ <unk> , Aros Bay and <unk> Bay . In the far southwest is a rocky and now largely uninhabited peninsula called The Oa , the closest point in the Hebrides to Ireland . 
 The island 's population is mainly centred around the villages of Bowmore and Port Ellen . Other smaller villages include Bridgend , Ballygrant , Port Charlotte , Portnahaven and Port Askaig . The rest of the island is sparsely populated and mainly agricultural . There are several small freshwater lochs in the interior including Loch Finlaggan , Loch Ballygrant , Loch <unk> and Loch Gorm , and numerous burns throughout the island , many of which bear the name " river " despite their small size . The most significant of these are the River Laggan which discharges into the sea at the north end of Laggan Bay , and the River <unk> which , draining Loch Finlaggan , enters the head of Loch Indaal at Bridgend . 
 There are numerous small uninhabited islands around the coasts , the largest of which are Eilean Mhic <unk> and Orsay off the Rinns , Nave Island on the northwest coast , Am Fraoch Eilean in the Sound of Islay , and <unk> off the south coast . 
 = = = Geology and geomorphology = = = 
 The underlying geology of Islay is intricate for such a small area . The deformed <unk> igneous rock of the Rhinns complex is dominated by a coarse @-@ grained gneiss cut by large intrusions of deformed gabbro . Once thought to be part of the Lewisian complex , it lies beneath the Colonsay Group of metasedimentary rocks that forms the bedrock at the northern end of the Rinns . It is a quartz @-@ rich metamorphic marine sandstone that may be unique to Scotland and which is nearly 5 @,@ 000 metres thick . South of <unk> ' a ' <unk> there are outcrops of quartzite , and a strip of mica schist and limestone cuts across the centre of the island from The Oa to Port Askaig . Further south is a band of metamorphic quartzite and granites , a continuation of the beds that underlie Jura . The geomorphology of these last two zones is dominated by a fold known as the Islay Anticline . To the south is a " shattered coastline " formed from mica schist and hornblende . The older Bowmore Group sandstones in the west centre of the island are rich in feldspar and may be of Dalradian origin . 
 . 
 Loch Indaal was formed along a branch of the Great Glen Fault called the Loch <unk> Fault ; its main line passes just to the north of Colonsay . This separates the limestone , igneous intrusions and Bowmore sandstones from the Colonsay Group rocks of the Rhinns . The result is occasional minor earth tremors . 
 There is a <unk> bed near Port Askaig that provides evidence of an ice age in the Pre @-@ Cambrian . In comparatively recent times the island was ice @-@ covered during the Pleistocene glaciations save for Beinn Tart a ' <unk> on the Rinns , which was a nunatak on the edge of the ice sheet . The complex changes of sea level due to melting ice caps and <unk> since then have left a series of raised beaches around the coast . Throughout much of late prehistory the low @-@ lying land between the Rinns and the rest of the island was flooded , creating two islands . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The influence of the Gulf Stream keeps the climate mild compared to mainland Scotland . Snow is rarely seen at sea level and frosts are light and short @-@ lived . However , wind speeds average 19 to 28 kilometres per hour ( 10 to 15 kn ) annually and winter gales sweep in off the Atlantic , gusting up to 185 kilometres per hour ( 115 mph ) . This can make travelling and living on the island during the winter difficult , while ferry and air links to the mainland can suffer delays . The driest months are April to July and the warmest are May to September , which as a result are the busiest times for tourism . Sunshine hours are typically highest around the coasts , especially to the west . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Islay was probably recorded by Ptolemy as <unk> , the use of the " p " suggesting a Brittonic or Pictish tribal name . In the seventh century Adomnán referred to the island as <unk> and the name occurs in early Irish records as Ile and as <unk> in Old Norse . The root is not Gaelic and of unknown origin . In seventeenth century maps the spelling appears as " <unk> " or " Ila " , a form still used in the name of the whisky <unk> Ila . In poetic language Islay is known as <unk> Innse Gall , or <unk> nan Eilean usually translated as " Queen of the Hebrides " and Eilean <unk> Ìle – the " green isle of Islay " A native of Islay is called an <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ] . 
 The obliteration of pre @-@ Norse names is almost total and place names on the island are a mixture of Norse and later Gaelic and English influences . Port Askaig is from the Norse ask @-@ <unk> , meaning " ash tree bay " and the common suffix <unk> is from the Norse <unk> , meaning " farm " . Gaelic names , or their anglicised versions such as Ardnave Point , from <unk> an Naoimh , " height of the saint " are very common . Several of the villages were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries and English is a stronger influence in their names as a result . Port Charlotte for example , was named after Lady Charlotte Campbell , daughter of the island 's then owner , Daniel Campbell of Shawfield . 
 = = Prehistory = = 
 The earliest settlers on Islay were nomadic hunter @-@ gatherers who may have first arrived during the Mesolithic period after the retreat of the Pleistocene ice caps . A flint arrowhead , which was found in a field near Bridgend in 1993 and dates from 10 @,@ 800 BC , is amongst the earliest evidence of a human presence found so far in Scotland . Stone implements of the <unk> culture found at Rubha Port an t @-@ <unk> near Port Askaig by foraging pigs in 2015 probably came from a summer camp used by hunters travelling round the coast in boats . Mesolithic finds have been dated to 7000 BC using radiocarbon dating of shells and debris from kitchen middens . By the Neolithic , settlements had become more permanent , allowing for the construction of several communal monuments . 
 The most spectacular prehistoric structure on the island is Dun <unk> . This 375 square metres ( 4 @,@ 040 sq ft ) Iron Age fort occupies a prominent crag and has commanding views of the surrounding landscape . The name 's origin is probably a mixture of Gaelic and Old Norse : Dun in the former language means " fort " and <unk> @-@ borg in the latter means " fort on the crag " . There is no evidence that Islay was ever subject to Roman military control although small numbers of finds such as a coin and a brooch from the third century AD suggest links of some kind with the intermittent Roman presence on the mainland . The ruins of a broch at Dùn <unk> south east of Ballygrant and the remains of numerous Atlantic roundhouses indicate the influences of northern Scotland , where these forms of building originate . There are also various crannogs on Islay , including sites in Loch Ardnave , Loch Ballygrant and Loch <unk> in the south east where a stone causeway leading out to two adjacent islands is visible beneath the surface of the water . 
 There is some controversy about the nature of the relationship between the indigenous peoples of Ireland and south west Scotland during the late Iron Age . The widely accepted theory is that the latter became populated by immigrants from the former , replacing an earlier culture , although it has also been suggested that the Gaels in this part of Scotland were indigenous to the area . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Dalriada = = = 
 By the 6th century AD Islay , along with much of mainland Argyll , lay within the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata with strong links to Ireland and , according to the Senchus fer n @-@ Alban ( " The History of the Men of Scotland " ) , was ruled by the kin group Cenél nÓengusa . In 627 the son of a king of the Irish Uí <unk> , a branch of the Dál nAraidi kingdom of Ulster , was killed on Islay at the unidentified location of Ard @-@ <unk> by a warrior in an army led by King <unk> <unk> of the <unk> Réti , a kindred based in Cowal on the mainland of Scotland . The Senchus also lists what is believed to be the oldest reference to a naval battle in the British Isles — a brief record of an engagement between rival Dál Riatan groups in 719 . 
 There is evidence of another kindred on Islay , the Cenél <unk> , descended from a brother of the legendary Dál Riatan king Fergus Mór but its existence seems to have been brief and the four hundred and thirty households of the island are later said to have been divided between three great @-@ grandsons of the eponymous founder of Cenél <unk> : Lugaid , Connal and Galán . 
 = = = Norse influence and the Kingdom of the Isles = = = 
 The arrival of Scandinavian settlers on the western seaboard of Scotland in the ninth century had a long @-@ lasting effect . For the next four centuries and more all the islands of the west fell under the control of various rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles most of whom were of Norse origin . As is the case in the Northern Isles , the derivation of place names suggests a complete break from the past . Jennings and Kruse conclude that although there were settlements prior to the Norse arrival " there is no evidence from the <unk> that the inhabitants of these settlements ever existed " . Gaelic continued to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse period , but the place name evidence suggests it had a lowly status , possibly indicating an enslaved population . 
 Godred Crovan was one of the Norse @-@ Gael rulers of this Hebridean sea kingdom who had a connection with Islay . His origins are obscure . The Chronicles of Mann call him the son of Harald the Black of Ysland , ( his place or origin variously interpreted as Islay , Ireland or Iceland ) and state he " so tamed the Scots that no one who built a ship or boat dared use more than three iron bolts " . Godred also became King of Dublin at an unknown date although in 1094 he was driven out of the city by <unk> Ua Briain , later known as High King of Ireland , according to the Annals of the Four Masters . He died " of pestilence " on Islay the following year . A local tradition suggests that a standing stone at <unk> <unk> near <unk> marks Godred Crovan 's grave . A genuine 11th century Norse grave @-@ slab was found at <unk> <unk> in 1838 , although it was not associated with a burial . The slab is decorated with foliage in the style of Ringerike Viking art and an Irish @-@ style cross , the former being unique in Scandinavian Scotland . 
 In the 12th century a granddaughter of Godred Crovan 's married the ambitious Somerled , a Norse @-@ Gael Argyll nobleman . Godred Olafsson , a grandson of Crovan , was an increasingly unpopular King of the Isles at the time and Somerled was spurred into action . The two fought the Battle of Epiphany in the seas off Islay in January 1156 . The result was a bloody stalemate , and the island kingdom was temporarily divided , with Somerled taking control of the southern Hebrides . Two years later Somerled completely ousted Godred and re @-@ united the kingdom , but the divide was re @-@ established after the former 's death in 1164 . His Clann Somhairle descendants continued to describe themselves as " King of the Sudreys " until the 13th century but following the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland . 
 = = = Scottish rule = = = 
 = = = = Lords of the Isles = = = = 
 Somerled 's descendants became the rulers of various powerful clans , including the MacDougalls , Clan Donald and the <unk> . Alexander MacDougall 's support of the opponents of King Robert the Bruce led to the forfeiture of his lands and they were distributed between Aonghas Óg MacDonald of Islay and the chief of the <unk> , Ruaidhri mac <unk> , who also held much of Lorne , parts of Lochaber , Garmoran and the North Isles . These estates were eventually inherited by Amie <unk> of Garmoran . She had married her MacDonald cousin John of Islay in the 1330s , and he now controlled significant stretches of the western seaboard of Scotland from Morvern to Loch Hourn and the whole of the Hebrides save for Skye . From 1336 onwards John began to style himself Dominus Insularum — " Lord of the Isles " , a title that implied a connection to the earlier Kings of the Isles and by extension a degree of independence from the Scottish crown and this honorific was claimed by his heirs for several generations . 
 Initially , the MacDonald Lords ' power base was on the shores of Loch Finlaggan in northeastern Islay . Successive chiefs of Clan Donald were proclaimed Lord of the Isles there and their advisory " Council of the Isles " met on Eilean na Comhairle . However , as their control of the west grew in strength the twin castles of Aros and Ardtornish in the Sound of Mull had become the " heart of the Lordship " by the early 15th century . 
 The Islay Charter , a record of lands granted to an Islay resident , Brian Vicar MacKay , by Domhnall of Islay , Lord of the Isles in 1408 , is one of the earliest records of Gaelic in public use , and is a significant historical document . In 1462 , John of Islay , Earl of Ross struck an alliance with Edward IV of England under the terms of the Treaty of Ardtornish @-@ Westminster . The onset of the Wars of the Roses prevented Edward from fulfilling his obligations as an ally , and in 1493 MacDonald was compelled to forfeit his estates and titles to James IV . After the forfeiture , James ordered Finlaggan demolished , its buildings razed , and the coronation stone destroyed to discourage any attempts at restoration of the Lordship . When Martin Martin visited Islay in the late 17th century he recorded a description of the coronations Finlaggan had once seen . 
 = = = = 16th and 17th centuries = = = = 
 Initially dispossessed in the wake of royal opposition to the Lordship , Clan MacDonald of <unk> 's holdings in Islay were restored in 1545 . In 1549 , Dean Monro observed that the island was fertile , fruitful , and full of natural pastures , with good hunting and plentiful salmon and seals . He also referred to Dunyvaig Castle in the south east , controlled by Clan Donald and Loch Gorm Castle on Eilean Mòr in Loch Gorm to the west , " now usurped be M ’ <unk> of <unk> " . This implied dispute with the Macleans continued and they were expelled from Loch Gorm by force in 1578 and defeated at the Battle of <unk> <unk> in 1598 . However , a clash with the Irish branch of the family led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell and their unpopularity in Edinburgh ( where their use of Gaelic was regarded as barbaric ) weakened the MacDonald grip on their southern Hebridean possessions . In 1608 the Scottish crown mounted an expedition to subdue them and then in 1614 handed Islay over to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor in return for an undertaking to pacify the island . This the Campbells eventually achieved although a setback occurred during the Civil War when a Covenanter army under Sir David Leslie arrived on the island in 1647 . They besieged a royalist garrison at <unk> and laid waste to the island . It was not until 1677 that the Campbells felt sufficiently at ease there to construct Islay House at Bridgend ( which is now used as a hotel ) as their principal ( and unfortified ) island residence . The structure was built for Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor and is now a Category A listed building . 
 = = = British era = = = 
 At the beginning of the 18th century much of the population of Argyll was to be found dispersed in small clachans of farming families and only two villages of any size — <unk> near Bridgend and Lagavulin — existed on Islay at the time . ( <unk> had a church and tolbooth and houses for merchants and craft workers but was razed in the 1760s to " improve " the grounds of Islay House . ) The agricultural economy was dependent on arable farming including staples such as barley and oats supplemented with stock @-@ rearing . The carrying capacity of the island was recorded at over 6 @,@ 600 cows and 2 @,@ 200 horses in a 1722 rental listing . 
 In 1726 Islay was purchased by Daniel Campbell of Shawfield . It remained in his family 's ownership until 1853 when it was sold to James Morrison of Berkshire , ancestor of the third Baron <unk> , who still owns a substantial portion of the island . A defining aspect of 19th century Argyll was the gradual improvement of transport infrastructure . Roads were built , the Crinan canal shortened the sea distance to Glasgow and the numerous traditional ferry crossings were augmented by new quays . Rubble piers were built at several locations on Islay and a new harbour was constructed at Port Askaig . 
 Initially , a sense of optimism in the fishing and cattle trades prevailed and the population expanded , partly as a result of the 18th century kelp boom and the introduction of the potato as a staple . The population of the island had been estimated at 5 @,@ 344 in 1755 and grew to over 15 @,@ 000 by 1841 . However , the sundering of the relationship between the landowners and the island 's residents proved consequential . When the estate owners realised they could make more money from sheep farming than from the indigenous small farmers , wholesale Clearances became commonplace . Four hundred people emigrated from Islay in 1863 alone , some for purely economic reasons , but many others having been forced off the land their predecessors had farmed for centuries . In 1891 the census recorded only 7 @,@ 375 citizens , with many <unk> making new homes in Canada , the United States and elsewhere . The population continued to decline for much of the 20th century and today is about 3 @,@ 500 . 
 During World War I two troop ships foundered off Islay within a few months of each other in 1918 . The American vessel SS Tuscania was torpedoed by UB @-@ 77 on 5 February with the loss of over 160 lives and now lies in deep water 6 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 4 mi ) west of the Mull of Oa . On 6 October HMS Otranto was involved in a collision with HMS Kashmir in heavy seas while convoying troops from New York . Otranto lost steering and drifted towards the west coast of the Rinns . Answering her SOS the destroyer HMS Mounsey attempted to come alongside and managed to rescue over 350 men . Nonetheless , the Otranto was wrecked on the shore near <unk> Bay with a total loss of 431 lives . A monument was erected on the coast of The Oa by the American Red Cross to commemorate the sinking of these two ships . A military cemetery was created at Kilchoman where the dead from both nations in the latter disaster were buried ( the American bodies later removed ) . 
 During World War II , the RAF built an airfield at <unk> which later became the civil airport for Islay . There was also an RAF Coastal Command flying boat base at Bowmore from 13 March 1941 using Loch Indaal . In 1944 an RCAF 422 Squadron Sunderland flying boat 's crew were rescued after their aircraft landed off Bowmore but broke from her moorings in a gale and sank . There was an RAF Chain Home radar station at <unk> Bay and RAF Chain Home Low station at <unk> .

 The mainstays of the modern Islay economy are agriculture and fishing , distilling and tourism . 
 = = = Agriculture and fishing = = = 
 Much of Islay remains owned by a few non @-@ resident estate owners and sheep farming and the few dairy cattle herds are run by tenant farmers . Islay has some fine wild brown trout and salmon fishing and in September 2003 the European Fishing Competition was held on five of the island 's numerous lochs ; this was " the biggest fishing event ever to be held in Scotland " . Sea angling is also popular , especially off the west coast and over the many shipwrecks around the coast . There are about 20 commercial boats with crab , lobster and scallop fishing undertaken from Port Askaig , Port Ellen and Portnahaven . 
 = = = Distilling = = = 
 Islay is one of five whisky distilling localities and regions in Scotland whose identity is protected by law . There are eight active distilleries and the industry is the island 's second largest employer after agriculture . Those on the south of the island produce malts with a very strong peaty flavour , considered to be the most intensely flavoured of all whiskies . From east to west they are <unk> , Lagavulin , and <unk> . On the north of the island Bowmore , Bruichladdich , <unk> Ila and <unk> are produced , which are substantially lighter in taste . Kilchoman is a <unk> opened in 2005 toward the west coast of the Rinns . 
 The oldest record of a legal distillery on the island refers to Bowmore in 1779 and at one time there were up to 23 distilleries in operation . For example , Port Charlotte distillery operated from 1829 to 1929 and Port Ellen is also closed although it remains in business as a malting . In March 2007 Bruichladdich announced that they would reopen Port Charlotte distillery using equipment from the <unk> distillery .

 The location of Islay , exposed to the full force of the North Atlantic , has led to it being the site of a pioneering , and Scotland 's first , wave power station near Portnahaven . The Islay LIMPET ( Land Installed Marine Powered Energy Transformer ) wave power generator was designed and built by Wavegen and researchers from the Queen 's University of Belfast , and was financially backed by the European Union . Known as Limpet 500 , due to cabling constraints its capacity is limited to providing up to 150 kW of electricity into the island 's grid . In 2000 it became the world 's first commercial wave power station . In March 2011 the largest tidal array in the world was approved by the Scottish Government with 10 planned turbines predicted to generate enough power for over 5 @,@ 000 homes . The project will be located in the Sound of Islay which offers both strong currents and shelter from storms .

 Many of the roads on the island are single @-@ track with passing places . The two main roads are the <unk> from <unk> to Port Askaig via Port Ellen and Bowmore , and the <unk> which runs down the east coast of the Rhinns . The island has its own bus service provided by Islay Coaches and <unk> Airport offers flights to and from Glasgow International Airport and on a less regular basis to Oban and Colonsay . 
 Caledonian MacBrayne operate regular ferry services to Port Ellen and Port Askaig from <unk> , taking about two hours . Ferries to Port Askaig also run on to <unk> on Colonsay and , on summer Wednesdays , to Oban . The purpose @-@ built vessel , MV Finlaggan entered service in 2011 . ASP Ship Management Ltd operate a small car ferry on behalf of Argyll & Bute Council from Port Askaig to <unk> on Jura .

 Islay has historically been a very strong Gaelic @-@ speaking area . In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses , all parishes in Islay were reported to be over 75 percent Gaelic @-@ speaking . By 1971 , the Rhinns had dropped to 50 @-@ 74 percent Gaelic speakers and the rest of Islay to 25 @-@ 49 percent Gaelic speaker overall . By 1991 about a third of the island 's population were Gaelic speakers . In the 2001 census this had dropped to 24 percent , which , while a low figure overall , nonetheless made it the most strongly Gaelic @-@ speaking island in Argyll and Bute after Tiree , with the highest percentage recorded in Portnahaven ( 32 percent ) and the lowest in <unk> ( 17 percent ) , with the far north and south of the island being the weakest areas in general . 
 The Islay dialect is distinctive . It patterns strongly with other Argyll dialects , especially those of Jura , Colonsay and Kintyre . Amongst its distinctive phonological features are the shift from long / aː / to / ɛː / , a high degree of retention of long / eː / , the shift of dark / l ̪ ˠ / to / t ̪ / , the lack of intrusive / t ̪ / in sr groups ( for example / s ̪ <unk> / " nose " rather than / s ̪ t ̪ <unk> / ) and the retention of the <unk> past @-@ tense particle d ' ( for example , d <unk> " rose " instead of dh <unk> ) . It sits within a group of lexical <unk> ( i.e. words distinctive to a certain area ) with strong similarities to southern Gaelic and northern Irish dialects . Examples are <unk> " to you " ( instead of the more common <unk> ) , the formula gun <unk> math <unk> " thank you " ( instead of the more common <unk> <unk> or <unk> leat but compare Irish go <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> " able to " ( instead of the more common <unk> ) or <unk> " hurry " ( instead of the more common <unk> , Irish <unk> ) .

 Associated with various Islay churches are <unk> of uncertain age ; these can be seen at Kilchoman Church , where the carved cross there is erected on one , and at <unk> Church on the Rhinns . In historic times some may have been associated with pre @-@ Christian wishing ceremonies or pagan beliefs in the " wee folk " . 
 The early pioneers of Christianity in Dál Riata were Columba of Iona and Moluag of Lismore . The legacy of this period includes the 8th century Kildalton Cross , Islay 's " most famous treasure " , carved out of local <unk> . A carved cross of similar age , but much more heavily weathered can be found at <unk> , which may have served as a site of lay worship . Although the first Norse settlers were pagan , Islay has a substantial number of sites of drystone or clay @-@ mortared chapels with small burial grounds from the later Norse era . In the 12th century the island became part of the Diocese of Sodor and the Isles , which was re @-@ established by King Olaf Godredsson . The diocese fell within the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Nidaros and there were four principal churches on Islay in the Norwegian <unk> model : <unk> , Kildalton , Kilarrow and <unk> . In 1472 Islay became part of the Archdiocese of St Andrews . 
 Archibald Campbell , 5th Earl of Argyll was a strong supporter of the Reformation , but there is little evidence that his beliefs were greeted with much enthusiasm by the islanders initially . At first there were only two reformed churches but in 1642 three parishes were created , based at Kilchoman , Kilarrow and a new church at Dunyvaig . By the end of the century there were seven churches including one on Nave Island . Kilarrow Parish Church is round , as local folklore has it , to leave no corner for the devil to hide in . This " architectural gem " was constructed in 1767 by Daniel Campbell , the laird of Islay . The kirk on the Rhinns of Islay is St <unk> 's , located just outside the village of Port Charlotte and Port Ellen is served by St John 's . There are a variety of other Church of Scotland churches and various other congregations on the island . Baptists meet in Port Ellen and in Bowmore , the Scottish Episcopal Church of St. Columba is located in Bridgend and the Islay Roman Catholic congregation also uses St. Columba 's for its services .

 Mark " Marco " Bresciano ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; born 11 February 1980 ) is an Australian football ( soccer ) player who last played for Qatar Stars League side Al @-@ Gharafa as a midfielder . He represented Australia at all youth levels , including appearances at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship and 2000 Olympic Games . For several years he was a regular member of the Australian national team , and represented Australia at the 2006 , 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups . Since the age of 19 he played senior club football in Italy with Empoli , Parma , Palermo and Lazio before moving to the United Arab Emirates . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early days in Australia = = = 
 Bresciano grew up in Rosanna , Melbourne . He began playing football locally and later progressed to the first team of Victorian Premier League side Bulleen Lions in 1995 at the age of 15 . He made little impact until his third year in the first team , scoring four goals in four league games and helping Bulleen to the 1997 VPL grand final . Bresciano 's reputation began to grow and he was selected in an Australian Schoolboys squad that toured the United Kingdom in 1996 . In 1997 , he featured prominently in Australia 's unsuccessful U17 World Cup qualifying campaign , scoring five goals . 
 At the end of the 1997 season and upon completing high school at <unk> College , he was offered a place at the Australian Institute of Sport , where he reunited with childhood pal Vince Grella . The players ' careers would mirror in the coming years as the two supported their footballing endeavours on and off the field . He and Vince Grella signed with new National Soccer League ( NSL ) club Carlton for the 1997 – 98 season , but Bresciano was forced to wait until Round 17 to make his NSL debut . He then played every game for the rest of the year , as Carlton finished second with a place in the finals . Bresciano scored in injury time to win the elimination semi @-@ final and put the club into its first grand final , which they lost 2 – 1 . He stayed with the Blues for the 1998 – 99 season , scoring four goals in 18 games , but the club finished well outside the top six . In 1998 and 1999 , Bresciano made a number of appearances for Australia in various matches at Under @-@ 20 and Under @-@ 23 level , including the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship , where the Young Socceroos were eliminated in the first round . 
 = = = Move to Italy = = = 
 As for many Australian players , a career in Europe beckoned for Bresciano as he sought to develop his game and further his career . Bresciano and Grella had sights set on a move to Italy , spurred in part by their Italian heritage . The pair joined Empoli in 1999 , who had been relegated to Serie B the previous season , and became regular selections in the first team . In Bresciano 's third year at the club , he scored 10 goals and helped Empoli to a fourth position and promotion back to the top @-@ flight Serie A. The pair also appeared several times in the Australian Under @-@ 23 team in the lead @-@ up to the 2000 Olympics , particularly in friendlies held in Europe . They were both included in the team for the Sydney Olympics , although Bresciano only saw limited action as a substitute . The following year , his efforts with the Olympic squad were rewarded with a call @-@ up to the " Socceroos . " On 1 June 2001 , Bresciano received his first cap for Australia in a Confederations Cup match against France , coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute for Josip <unk> . He made a further five appearances that year for the " Socceroos , " including another match against France in a friendly at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) , again replacing <unk> as a substitute . 
 In the summer of 2002 , he joined Parma for € 7 million , at the time a record transfer fee for an Australian player . " Moving to Parma was a big change in every way , not just money @-@ wise but it is a big club . The structure of the club , the facilities , its popularity means you are under a lot more pressure to get a result , " he said following the close of the season , well aware of his profile . Though he was hampered by a series of injuries , his 24 appearances in 2002 – 03 helped Parma to fifth and a UEFA Cup place . With Empoli being relegated again , he was reunited with Grella who stayed in Serie A with a transfer to Parma . 
 = = = Goal scoring for Parma and Socceroos = = = 
 Setting himself a target for the 2003 – 04 season of five goals , Bresciano surpassed that with eight goals from 33 appearances , the most of any midfielder in the Serie A , as Parma finished fifth in the league again . Bresciano had also claimed a regular spot in the " Socceroos " line @-@ up , justifying his selection with a string of goals , including a match @-@ winning free @-@ kick against New Zealand and the only goal in a one @-@ nil victory against South Africa . Parma 's fifth place qualified them for the UEFA Cup , where the club advanced through to the semi @-@ finals before being eliminated by eventual winners CSKA Moscow . Their league performance that year was in stark contrast to their UEFA Cup form , as they were forced in to a play @-@ off to retain their Serie A status by finishing 18th in the league . Bresciano and Grella were excused from the 2005 Confederations Cup by then @-@ Australian manager Frank Farina to allow them to take part in the play @-@ off against Bologna — Parma went on to win the tie and remained in Serie A for the following season . Both players returned to the Australian squad in September 2005 , now under the direction of Guus Hiddink , for World Cup qualification playoff against the Solomon Islands , followed by a friendly against Jamaica where Bresciano scored the first of Australia 's five goals . After playing the first leg of the CONMEBOL – OFC World Cup qualification play @-@ off against Uruguay on 12 November , Bresciano scored the only goal in the second leg four days later . The 1 – 0 win levelled the playoff 1 – 1 on aggregate after extra time and the " Socceroos " won the ensuing penalty shoot @-@ out to advance to the World Cup . 
 Parma recovered well in the 2005 – 06 season with Bresciano playing the majority of games , finishing a respectable 10th by season 's end in May 2006 ( later rising to seventh and a UEFA Cup place after the Calciopoli findings ) . Bresciano described their resurgence as physically finding their form . Despite starting poorly , the team went from " strength to strength " as the season went on , with Bresciano himself becoming mentally tougher for the experience . 
 = = = 2006 World Cup = = = 
 Buoyed by his strong club season , Bresciano played in Australia 's opening game of the 2006 FIFA World Cup , being substituted before the team went on to score three goals and defeat Japan . He came on as a substitute in the second game against Brazil and , in the third Group Stage game , was instrumental in the 79th @-@ minute goal scored by Harry Kewell against Croatia . The goal resulted in a 2 – 2 draw , a result securing Australia 's place in the second round . Against Italy , Bresciano was judged to be in a scoring position in the 50th minute when fouled by Marco Materazzi , the Italian receiving a red card . Italy went on to win after being awarded a penalty in the dying minutes of the game , eliminating the " Socceroos . " After being identified as a key player for Australia , Bresciano 's overall performance at the tournament failed to live up to expectations , described by an FFA writer as " solid without being spectacular , " although his role as a set @-@ piece @-@ specialist was highlighted . 
 = = = Palermo and Asian Cup = = = 
 Shortly after the end of the World Cup , Bresciano was signed by Palermo on a four @-@ year @-@ contract , and made regular first team appearances in the Serie A and Europe . In October 2006 Bresciano scored what some – including Socceroos Assistant Coach John <unk> – have described as the greatest goal ever scored for Australia in a full international match . In an Asian Cup qualification match against Bahrain , Mile <unk> received a cross @-@ field pass which was played first @-@ time back in to the penalty area , Bresciano reacting quickly to turn his body horizontally and strike the ball on the volley into the net . The goal drew comparisons to his first goal for Palermo in Serie A , two months earlier , against Reggina on the opening day of the 2006 – 07 season . Bresciano was on the pitch on 2 February 2007 , when violence broke out outside the stadium in the Catania @-@ Palermo match . He was affected by tear gas as it drifted into the stadium and afterwards described the incident as " completely terrifying " . He scored his ninth international goal against China in March 2007 . A hamstring injury suffered in May caused him to miss the final round match for Palermo , Australia 's friendly against Uruguay on 2 June and hampered his preparations for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup . However , he recovered in time for a warmup match against Singapore and played all of Australia 's first two Asian Cup matches . He was substituted in the second half against Thailand and the quarter @-@ final against Japan before the Socceroos ' elimination on penalties . The Sydney Morning Herald rated the 71 minutes played against Japan as his best performance of the tournament , after average displays in the early matches . 
 Bresciano returned to the national team in February 2008 for Australia 's opening World Cup qualification match against Qatar , starting the match and scoring the Socceroos third goal . He also played a full 90 minutes in the second group match , away to China . The new campaign has also seen Bresciano change squad numbers , wearing ' 18 ' in the two qualifiers , as opposed to his traditional ' 23 ' which he has worn for the majority of his <unk> career . 
 = = = To England and back = = = 
 On return from Australia 's Asian Cup exit , Bresciano became a transfer target for Premier League club Manchester City . After confirmation from new Palermo manager Stefano <unk> that he would be leaving Palermo for Manchester , the clubs agreed to a four @-@ year contract with a transfer price of £ 5 million and he began training with the City squad . " I needed a new challenge and I wanted to get the excitement factor back into my game , " Mark stated in confirming his desire to play in England , also citing the chance to play under Sven @-@ Göran Eriksson as a big reason for seeking to make the switch . However , talks between the two clubs broke down in finalising the move , with the timing of the transfer fee given as the primary issue – as City sought to delay payment – and Bresciano returned to Palermo to rejoin their pre @-@ season preparations . As the transfer deadline passed and the deal was put off indefinitely , Bresciano continued training with Palermo . He came off the bench for their opening @-@ day loss to Roma , and remained a regular selection under new manager Francesco Guidolin , although more commonly from the substitute bench . 
 He came off the bench in the first match of the 2008 – 09 season to score a goal , although Palermo lost 3 – 1 to Udinese . He then established himself back in the starting line @-@ up following the appointment of new head coach Davide <unk> , playing both as a winger and a deep @-@ lying forward for the <unk> , and also managing to score both goals in Palermo 's second seasonal away win , a 2 – 0 to Sampdoria on 18 January 2009 .

 = Milton Friedman = 
 Milton Friedman ( July 31 , 1912 – November 16 , 2006 ) was an American economist who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy . With George Stigler and others , Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago price theory , a methodological movement at the University of Chicago 's Department of Economics , Law School , and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward . Several students and young professors that were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists ; they include Gary Becker , Robert Fogel , and Robert Lucas , Jr . 
 Friedman 's challenges to what he later called " naive Keynesian " theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function . In the 1960s , he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies , and described his approach ( along with mainstream economics ) as using " Keynesian language and apparatus " yet rejecting its " initial " conclusions . He theorized that there existed a " natural " rate of unemployment , and argued that employment above this rate would cause inflation to accelerate . He argued that the Phillips curve was , in the long run , vertical at the " natural rate " and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation . Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as " monetarism " , and argued that a steady , small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy . His ideas concerning monetary policy , taxation , privatization and deregulation influenced government policies , especially during the 1980s . His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve 's response to the global financial crisis of 2007 – 08 . 
 Friedman was an advisor to Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention . He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment . In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom , Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military , freely floating exchange rates , abolition of medical licenses , a negative income tax , and school vouchers . His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice . 
 Milton Friedman 's works include many monographs , books , scholarly articles , papers , magazine columns , television programs , and lectures , and cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues . His books and essays have had an international influence , including in former communist states . A survey of economists ranked Friedman as the second most popular economist of the twentieth century after John Maynard Keynes , and The Economist described him as " the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century ... possibly of all of it . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Friedman was born in Brooklyn , New York on July 31 , 1912 . His parents , <unk> Ethel ( née Landau ) and Jenő Saul Friedman , were recent Jewish immigrants from <unk> in Carpathian Ruthenia , Kingdom of Hungary ( now <unk> in Ukraine ) . They both worked as dry goods merchants . Shortly after Milton 's birth , the family relocated to Rahway , New Jersey . In his early teens , Friedman was injured in a car accident , which scarred his upper lip . A talented student , Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928 , just before his 16th birthday . 
 In 1932 , Friedman graduated from Rutgers University , where he specialized in Mathematics and Economics and initially intended to become an actuary . During his time at Rutgers , Friedman became influenced by two economics professors , Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones , who convinced him that modern economics could help end the Great Depression . 
 After graduating from Rutgers , Friedman was offered two scholarships to do graduate work — one in mathematics at Brown University and the other in economics at the University of Chicago . Friedman chose the latter , thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933 . He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner , Frank Knight , and Henry Simons . It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife , economist Rose Director . During the 1933 – 1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University , where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling . He was back in Chicago for the 1934 – 1935 academic year , working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz , who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand . That year , Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W. Allen Wallis . 
 = = Public service = = 
 Friedman was initially unable to find academic employment , so in 1935 he followed his friend W. Allen Wallis to Washington , where Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal was " a lifesaver " for many young economists . At this stage , Friedman said that he and his wife " regarded the job @-@ creation programs such as the WPA , CCC , and PWA appropriate responses to the critical situation , " but not " the <unk> and wage @-@ fixing measures of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration . " Foreshadowing his later ideas , he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued . Indeed , Friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the New Deal was " the wrong cure for the wrong disease , " arguing that the money supply should simply have been expanded , instead of contracted . Later , Friedman and his colleague Anna Schwartz wrote A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 – 1960 , which argued that the Great Depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the Federal Reserve . 
 During 1935 , he began work for the National Resources Committee , which was then working on a large consumer budget survey . Ideas from this project later became a part of his Theory of the Consumption Function . Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income . This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice , which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income , a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s . The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices . 
 During 1940 , Friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and decided to return to government service . From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the Federal Government , as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury . As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation . He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system , since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war . He later said , " I have no apologies for it , but I really wish we hadn 't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now . "

 In 1940 , Friedman accepted a position at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II . Friedman believed the United States should enter the war . In 1943 , Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University ( headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling ) , where he spent the rest of World War II working as a mathematical statistician , focusing on problems of weapons design , military tactics , and metallurgical experiments . 
 In 1945 , Friedman submitted Incomes from Independent Professional Practice ( co @-@ authored with Kuznets and completed during 1940 ) to Columbia as his doctoral dissertation . The university awarded him a PhD in 1946 . Friedman spent the 1945 – 1946 academic year teaching at the University of Minnesota ( where his friend George Stigler was employed ) . On February 12 , 1945 , his son , David D. Friedman was born . 
 = = = University of Chicago = = = 
 In 1946 , Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago ( a position opened by departure of his former professor Jacob Viner to Princeton University ) . Friedman would work for the University of Chicago for the next 30 years . There he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Prize winners , known collectively as the Chicago school of economics . 
 At that time , Arthur F. Burns , who was then the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research , asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau 's staff . He accepted the invitation , and assumed responsibility for the Bureau 's inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle . As a result , he initiated the " Workshop in Money and Banking " ( the " Chicago Workshop " ) , which promoted a revival of monetary studies . During the latter half of the 1940s , Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz , an economic historian at the Bureau , that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co @-@ authored by Friedman and Schwartz , A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 – 1960 . 
 Friedman spent the 1954 – 1955 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge . At the time , the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority ( including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn ) and an anti @-@ Keynesian minority ( headed by Dennis Robertson ) . Friedman speculated that he was invited to the fellowship , because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions . Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine ( 1966 – 84 ) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people . From 1968 to 1978 , he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series , a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days ' issues for about a half @-@ hour at a time . 
 Friedman was an economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater during 1964 .

 In 1977 , at the age of 65 , Friedman retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30 years . He and his wife moved to San Francisco where he became a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco . From 1977 on , he was affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University . During the same year , Friedman was approached by the Free To Choose Network and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy . 
 The <unk> worked on this project for the next three years , and during 1980 , the ten @-@ part series , titled Free to Choose , was broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) . The companion book to the series ( co @-@ authored by Milton and his wife , Rose Friedman ) , also titled Free To Choose , was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages . 
 Friedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign , and then served on the President 's Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the Reagan Administration . <unk> says Friedman was " the ' guru ' of the Reagan administration . " In 1988 he received the National Medal of Science and Reagan honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom . Milton Friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century . Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television . He made several visits to Eastern Europe and to China , where he also advised governments . He was also for many years a Trustee of the Philadelphia Society . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 According to a 2007 article in Commentary magazine , his " parents were moderately observant [ Jews ] , but Friedman , after an intense burst of childhood piety , rejected religion altogether . " He described himself as an agnostic . Friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences , especially in 1998 in his memoirs with his wife Rose , titled Two Lucky People . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Friedman died of heart failure at the age of 94 years in San Francisco on November 16 , 2006 . He was still a working economist performing original economic research ; his last column was published in the The Wall Street Journal the day after his death . He was survived by his wife ( who died on August 18 , 2009 ) and their two children , David , known for the anarcho @-@ capitalist book The Machinery of Freedom , and Janet .

 = = = Economics = = = 
 Friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output , that is , the quantity theory of money . Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory . Its origins can be traced back to the 16th @-@ century School of Salamanca or even further ; however , Friedman 's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization . He co @-@ authored , with Anna Schwartz , A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 – 1960 ( 1963 ) , which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history . A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations . Several regression studies with David <unk> during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output . These challenged a prevailing , but largely untested , view on their relative importance . Friedman 's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short @-@ run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer @-@ run effect was primarily on the price level . 
 Friedman was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics . He maintained that there is a close and stable association between inflation and the money supply , mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the monetary base 's growth rate . He famously used the analogy of " dropping money out of a helicopter . " , in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would <unk> his models . 
 Friedman 's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of Cost @-@ push inflation , that the increased General Price Level at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil , or increases in wages ; as he wrote , 
 Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . 
 Friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management ; and he held that the government 's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely . Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression , which he termed the Great Contraction , arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve . 
 The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden @-@ variety recession , although perhaps a fairly severe one , into a major catastrophe . Instead of using its powers to offset the depression , it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one @-@ third from 1929 to 1933 ... Far from the depression being a failure of the free @-@ enterprise system , it was a tragic failure of government . 
 Friedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in currency markets , thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject , as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates . His close friend George Stigler explained , " As is customary in science , he did not win a full victory , in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations , a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas , also at the University of Chicago . " The relationship between Friedman and Lucas , or new classical macroeconomics as a whole , was highly complex . The Friedmanian Phillips curve was an interesting starting point for Lucas , but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory . Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian adaptive expectations . Due to this reformulation , the story in which the theory of the new classical Phillips curve was embedded radically changed . This modification , however , had a significant effect on Friedman ’ s own approach , so , as a result , the theory of the Friedmanian Phillips curve also changed . Moreover , new classical Neil Wallace , who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963 , regarded Friedman ’ s theoretical courses as a mess . This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics . 
 Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function , the permanent income hypothesis ( 1957 ) , which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work . This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income . Windfall gains would mostly be saved . Tax reductions likewise , as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances . Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment ( 1968 ) . This critique associated his name , together with that of Edmund Phelps , with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so . Unemployment may be temporarily lower , if the inflation is a surprise , but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market . 
 Friedman 's essay " The Methodology of Positive Economics " ( 1953 ) provided the epistemological pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School . There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective . Moreover , a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction . That is , students should measure the accuracy of its predictions , rather than the ' soundness of its assumptions ' . His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy <unk> , Leonard Savage , and Ronald Fisher . 
 = = = Statistics = = = 
 One of his most famous contributions to statistics is sequential sampling . Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia , where he and his colleagues came up with the technique . It later became , in the words of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics , " the standard analysis of quality control inspection " . The dictionary adds , " Like many of Friedman ’ s contributions , in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control ; that however is a measure of his genius . " 
 = = Public policy positions = = 
 = = = Federal Reserve = = = 
 Due to its poor performance , Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished . He further believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled ( as by the Federal Reserve System ) that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate . 
 = = = Exchange rates = = = 
 Friedman was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire Bretton @-@ Woods period . He argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid Balance of Payments crises . He saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention . The case was articulated in an influential 1953 paper , " The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates " , at a time , when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as a fantasy . 
 = = = School choice = = = 
 In his 1955 article " The Role of Government in Education " Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers . Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in , for example , Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992 . In 1996 , Friedman , together with his wife , founded The Foundation for Educational Choice to advocate school choice and vouchers . 
 = = = Conscription = = = 
 While Walter Oi is credited with establishing the economic basis for a volunteer military , Milton Friedman was a proponent , stating that the draft was " inconsistent with a free society . " In Capitalism and Freedom , he argued that conscription is inequitable and arbitrary , preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit . During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid / volunteer armed force . He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment . Friedman did , however , believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 Biographer Lanny <unk> noted a drift over time in Friedman 's views from an interventionist to a more cautious foreign policy . He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism , but moderated over time . He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War . In a spring 2006 interview , Friedman said that the USA 's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War , but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful independent country . 
 = = = Libertarianism and the Republican Party = = = 
 He served as a member of President Reagan 's Economic Policy Advisory Board starting at 1981 . In 1988 , he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science . He said that he was a libertarian philosophically , but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of " expediency " ( " I am a libertarian with a small ' l ' and a Republican with a capital ' R. ' And I am a Republican with a capital ' R ' on grounds of expediency , not on principle . " ) But , he said , " I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable . I don 't really care very much what I 'm called . I 'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas , rather than the person . " 
 = = = Public goods and monopoly = = = 
 Friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide . However , he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector . Above all , if some public goods are provided by the state , he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited ; for example , he wrote : 
 There is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office . It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils . Along these lines , one could perhaps justify a government post office , but not the present law , which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail . If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly , no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government . If it is not , there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it . The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter . 
 = = = Social security , welfare programs , and negative income tax = = = 
 After 1960 Friedman attacked Social Security from a free market view stating that it had created welfare dependency . 
 Friedman proposed that if there had to be a welfare system of any kind , he would replace the existing U.S. welfare system with a negative income tax , a progressive tax system in which the poor receive a basic living income from the government . According to the New York Times , Friedman 's views in this regard were grounded in a belief that while " market forces ... accomplish wonderful things " , they " cannot ensure a distribution of income that enables all citizens to meet basic economic needs " . 
 = = = Drug policy = = = 
 Friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and prostitution . During 2005 , Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana .

 Friedman was also a supporter of gay rights . He never specifically supported same @-@ sex marriage , instead saying " I do not believe there should be any discrimination against gays . " 
 = = = Economic freedom = = = 
 Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994 . The goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it . Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom , Economic Freedom in the World . This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer @-@ reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations . 
 Along with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the Copyright Term Extension Act and filed an amicus brief in Eldred v. Ashcroft . He supported the inclusion of the word " no @-@ brainer " in the brief . 
 Friedman argued for stronger basic legal ( constitutional ) protection of economic rights and freedoms to further promote industrial @-@ commercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society . 
 = = Honors , recognition , and influence = = 
 George H. Nash , a leading historian of American conservatism , says that by , " the end of the 1960s he was probably the most highly regarded and influential conservative scholar in the country , and one of the few with an international reputation . " Friedman allowed the libertarian Cato Institute to use his name for its biannual Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty beginning in 2001 . A Friedman Prize was given to the late British economist Peter Bauer in 2002 , Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto in 2004 , Mart Laar , former Estonian Prime Minister in 2006 and a young Venezuelan student Yon Goicoechea in 2008 . His wife Rose , sister of Aaron Director , with whom he initiated the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice , served on the international selection committee . Friedman was also a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics . 
 Upon Friedman 's death , Harvard President Lawrence Summers called him " The Great Liberator " saying " ... any honest Democrat will admit that we are now all <unk> . " He said Friedman 's great popular contribution was " in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate . " 
 In 2013 Stephen Moore , a member of the editorial forward of the Wall Street Journal said , " Quoting the most @-@ revered champion of free @-@ market economics since Adam Smith has become a little like quoting the Bible . " He adds , " There are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations . "

 Friedman once said , " If you want to see capitalism in action , go to Hong Kong . " He wrote in 1990 that the Hong Kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy . 
 One month before his death , he wrote the article " Hong Kong Wrong – What would <unk> say ? " in the Wall Street Journal , criticizing Donald Tsang , the Chief Executive of Hong Kong , for abandoning " positive <unk> . " Tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to " big market , small government , " where small government is defined as less than 20 % of GDP . In a debate between Tsang and his rival , Alan Leong , before the 2007 Chief Executive election , Leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused Tsang of angering Friedman to death . 
 = = = Chile = = = 
 During 1975 , two years after the military coup that brought military dictator President Augusto Pinochet to power and ended the government of Salvador Allende , the economy of Chile experienced a severe crisis . Friedman and Arnold <unk> accepted an invitation of a private Chilean foundation to visit Chile and speak on principles of economic freedom . He spent seven days in Chile giving a series of lectures at the Universidad Católica de Chile and the ( National ) University of Chile . One of the lectures was entitled " The Fragility of Freedom " and according to Friedman , " dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government . " 
 In an April 21 , 1975 , letter to Pinochet , Friedman considered the " key economic problems of Chile are clearly ... inflation and the promotion of a healthy social market economy " . He stated that " There is only one way to end inflation : by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money ... " and that " ... cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit , because it ... strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth " . As to how rapidly inflation should be ended , Friedman felt that " for Chile where inflation is raging at 10 – 20 % a month ... gradualism is not feasible . It would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive . " Choosing " a brief period of higher unemployment ... " was the lesser evil .. and that " the experience of Germany , ... of Brazil ... , of the post @-@ war adjustment in the U.S. ... all argue for shock treatment " . In the letter Friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with " ... a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress " and " ... for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal ... to be taken as illustrative " although his knowledge of Chile was " too limited to enable [ him ] to be precise or comprehensive " . He listed a " sample proposal " of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including " the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market . For example , suspend ... the present law against discharging employees " . He closed , stating " Such a shock program could end inflation in months " . His letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes . 
 Sergio de Castro , a Chilean Chicago School graduate , became the nation 's Minister of Finance in 1975 . During his six @-@ year tenure , foreign investment increased , restrictions were placed on striking and labor unions , and GDP rose yearly . A foreign exchange program was created between the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chicago . Many other Chicago School alumni were appointed government posts during and after the Pinochet years ; others taught its economic doctrine at Chilean universities . They became known as the Chicago Boys . 
 Friedman did not criticize Pinochet 's dictatorship at the time , nor the assassinations , illegal imprisonments , torture , or other atrocities that were well known by then . In 1976 Friedman defended his unofficial adviser position with : " I do not consider it as evil for an economist to render technical economic advice to the Chilean Government , any more than I would regard it as evil for a physician to give technical medical advice to the Chilean Government to help end a medical plague . " 
 Friedman defended his activity in Chile on the grounds that , in his opinion , the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but also contributed to the amelioration of Pinochet 's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990 . That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom , in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom . In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose , he said the following : " Chile is not a politically free system , and I do not condone the system . But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role . ... The conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse . They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system . " In 1984 , Friedman stated that he has " never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile . " In 1991 he said : " I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed . It was a terrible political regime . The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically ; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market . [ ... ] In Chile , the drive for political freedom , that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success , ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy . Now , at long last , Chile has all three things : political freedom , human freedom and economic freedom . Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether , now that it has political freedom , that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom . " He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states . 
 During the 2000 PBS documentary The Commanding Heights ( based on the book ) , Friedman continued to argue that " free markets would undermine [ Pinochet 's ] political centralization and political control . " , and that criticism over his role in Chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people , and that Chile 's unfree economy had caused the military government . Friedman advocated for free markets which undermined " political centralization and political control " . 
 = = = Iceland = = = 
 Friedman visited Iceland during the autumn of 1984 , met with important Icelanders and gave a lecture at the University of Iceland on the " tyranny of the status quo . " He participated in a lively television debate on August 31 , 1984 with socialist intellectuals , including Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson , who later became the president of Iceland . When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that , hitherto , lectures by visiting scholars had been free @-@ of @-@ charge , Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free @-@ of @-@ charge in a meaningful sense : lectures always have related costs . What mattered was whether attendees or non @-@ attendees covered those costs . Friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid . In this discussion Friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture . 
 = = = Estonia = = = 
 Although Friedman never visited Estonia , his book Free to Choose exercised a great influence on that nation 's then 32 @-@ year @-@ old prime minister , Mart Laar , who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office . Laar 's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the " Baltic Tiger . " A prime element of Laar 's program was introduction of the flat tax . Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty , awarded by the Cato Institute . 
 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 After 1950 Friedman was frequently invited to lecture in Britain , and by the 1970s his ideas had gained widespread attention in conservative circles . For example , he was a regular speaker at the Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) , a libertarian think tank . Conservative politician Margaret Thatcher closely followed IEA programs and ideas , and met Friedman there in 1978 . He also strongly influenced Keith Joseph , who became Thatcher 's senior advisor on economic affairs , as well as Alan Walters and Patrick Minford , two other key advisers . Major newspapers , including the Daily Telegraph , The Times , and The Financial Times all promulgated Friedman 's monetarist ideas to British decision @-@ makers . Friedman 's ideas strongly influenced Thatcher and her allies when she became Prime Minister in 1979 . 
 = = Critics = = 
 = = = Famous Critics of Overall Work = = = 
 <unk> David Hendry criticized part of Friedman 's and Anna Schwartz 's 1982 Monetary Trends . When asked about it during an interview with Icelandic TV in 1984 , Friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and Schwartz had tackled , and hence was irrelevant , and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst <unk> on Hendry 's work . In 2006 , Hendry said that Friedman was guilty of " serious errors " of misunderstanding that meant " the t @-@ ratios he reported for UK money demand were overstated by nearly 100 per cent " , and said that , in a paper published in 1991 with Neil Ericsson , he had refuted " almost every empirical claim [ … ] made about UK money demand " by Friedman and Schwartz . A 2004 paper updated and confirmed the validity of the Hendry – Ericsson findings through 2000 . 
 Although Keynesian Nobel laureate Paul Krugman praised Friedman as a " great economist and a great man " after Friedman 's death in 2006 , and acknowledged his many , widely accepted contributions to empirical economics , Krugman had been , and remains , a prominent critic of Friedman . Krugman has written that " he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work . It 's extremely hard to find cases in which Friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets could go wrong , or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose . " 
 In her book The Shock Doctrine , author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman 's economic liberalism , identifying it with the principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups in countries such as Chile and Indonesia . Based on their assessments of the extent to which what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality , both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations . 
 Because of his involvement with the Pinochet government , there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976 . Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet , and a controversial six @-@ day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 ( less than two years after the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende ) . Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship , but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation , and met with officials , including Augusto Pinochet , while in Chile . 
 Chilean economist Orlando <unk> asserted that Pinochet 's dictatorship resorted to oppression because of popular opposition to Chicago School policies in Chile . After a 1991 speech on drug legalisation , Friedman answered a question on his involvement with the Pinochet regime , saying that he was never an advisor to Pinochet ( also mentioned in his 1984 Iceland interview ) , but that a group of his students at the University of Chicago were involved in Chile 's economic reforms . Friedman credited these reforms with high levels of economic growth and with the establishment of democracy that has subsequently occurred in Chile . 
 = = = Capitalism and Freedom = = = 
 Capitalism and Freedom is a seminal work by Friedman . In the book , Friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society , that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long @-@ run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the United States and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s . He goes through the chapters specifying a specific issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure . Friedman concludes Capitalism and Freedom with his “ classical liberal ” stance , that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country . He recounts how the best of a country ’ s abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention .

 = Harry Glicken = 
 Harry Glicken ( March 7 , 1958 – June 3 , 1991 ) was an American volcanologist . He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its famous 1980 eruption , and blamed himself for the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston , who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview . In 1991 , while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan , Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow . His remains were found four days later , and were cremated in accordance with his parents ' request . Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions . 
 Despite a long @-@ term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey , Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric . Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations , Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches . He also wrote several major publications on the topic , including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled " Rockslide @-@ debris Avalanche of May 18 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens Volcano , Washington " that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon . Since being published posthumously by Glicken 's colleagues in 1996 , the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches . Following his death , Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field .

 = = = Early work = = = 
 Glicken was born in 1958 to Milton and Ida Glicken . He graduated from Stanford University in 1980 . Later that year , while a graduate student at the University of California , Santa Barbara , he was temporarily hired by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) to help monitor the volcano Mount St. Helens in Washington state . St. Helens , dormant since the 1840s and 1850s , resumed activity in March 1980 . 
 As seismic and volcanic activity increased , volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe any impending eruption . Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on and around the growing lava domes , and , on May 1 , 1980 , established the Coldwater I and II observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed . Glicken monitored the volcano for two weeks , taking shelter in a trailer at the Coldwater II site located a little more than 5 miles ( 8 km ) northwest of the volcano . On May 18 , 1980 , after working for six days straight , Glicken took the day off to attend an interview for his graduate work with his professor , Richard V. Fisher , in Mammoth , California . His research adviser and mentor David A. Johnston replaced him at his post , despite expressing concerns about its safety given indications of mobile magma within the volcano . After a magnitude 5 @.@ 1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide at 8 : 32 a.m. , Mount St. Helens erupted . Johnston was killed after he was enveloped by swift pyroclastic flows that traveled down the mountain 's flanks at near supersonic speeds . 
 After the eruption , Glicken went to Toutle High School , the center for relief efforts , where he joined Air Force Reserve Rescue Squadron officials in a helicopter to look for Johnston or any sign of his post . Despite searching with three separate crews over a span of nearly six hours , Glicken found no trace . He attempted to enlist a fourth helicopter crew to aid his search , but they declined , fearing dangerous conditions . In his distraught state , Glicken refused to accept Johnston 's death , and had to be comforted by Swanson before calming down . 
 In mid @-@ 1980 , after the May eruption , USGS Survey scientists decided to establish the David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory ( CVO ) in Vancouver , intending to closely monitor volcanoes in Oregon , Washington , and Idaho . Glicken returned to St. Helens to analyze the remains of the volcano 's lateral blast . However , as other CVO employees had already commenced their research at the mountain , Glicken 's offer to help USGS on his own was declined by senior scientists . Instead , he found work with newly appointed Survey employee Barry Voight , a specialist in landslides . Under Voight 's guidance , Glicken absorbed himself in his work , motivated to earn a job at the Survey , and to relieve some of his anguish over Johnston 's death . Glicken and a team of geologists mapped the debris field left over from St. Helens 's structural collapse , which consisted of roughly a quarter of the mass of the volcano . Through extensive , meticulous analysis , the team traced the origins and the means of movement of each piece of debris , ranging from blocks 100 yards ( 91 m ) in width to mere fragments . 
 With his group , Glicken compiled a landmark study in the field of volcanic landslides , establishing the principle that tall volcanoes have a tendency to collapse . The study garnered praise for its unique conclusions and attention to detail , inspiring volcanologists to identify similar deposit mounds at volcanoes around the world . After the findings from his dissertation were published in several shorter articles throughout the 1980s , Glicken earned recognition as the first geologist to explain the creation of hummock fields near tall volcanoes .

 In the years following the eruption , despite earning rapid fame and opportunities to research internationally in Japan , New Zealand , and Guadeloupe , Glicken still failed to obtain a job at USGS . Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling . Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished , prompting USGS to reduce CVO 's budget and contemplate closing the station . He continued helping the Survey until 1989 , also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara . 
 From 1989 to 1991 , Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo , supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation . Later , while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University , Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen . The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990 , after being dormant for 198 years . In the months after its first activity , it erupted sporadically , and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991 . On June 2 , 1991 , Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft . The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day , assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them . Later that day , a lava dome collapsed , sending a large flow down the valley at 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . The current reached the turn before separating into two parts , and the upper , hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists ' post , killing them upon impact . In total , 41 or 42 people died in the incident , including press members who had been watching the volcanologists . The volcano burned down 390 houses , and the remains of the flow extended 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) in length . Glicken 's remains were found four days later , and were cremated according to his parents ' wishes . To date , Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists known to have been killed by a volcanic eruption .

 At the time of his death , Glicken had been seeking to publish his doctoral dissertation in one piece , having earlier published elements as shorter articles . He had already defined the criteria for debris avalanches on the slopes of volcanoes , and authored several publications on the subject ; Swanson named him one of the foremost experts in the field . After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , research in the niche grew as more studies identified debris at well @-@ known volcanoes . His work on flows at Mount St. Helens is considered the most complete in the field to date . It was later published in 1996 as a single report by his acquaintances Carol <unk> , John Costa , Dan <unk> , and Jon Major , among others , at the United States Geological Survey . In his preface to Glicken 's publication , Major comments that " the Mount St. Helens deposit will never be mapped in such detail again . " 
 Glicken 's report is titled " Rockslide @-@ debris Avalanche of May 18 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens Volcano , Washington " . It comprises his extensive laboratory and field work , supplemented by photographs of the eruption , writings that describe St. Helens before the eruption , and references to previous publications , including Voight 's work . In the report , Glicken constructed a map of the landslide deposit at a scale of 1 : 24000 , followed by a <unk> map describing rock varieties at a scale of 1 : 12000 . The report also provides a conclusion for the movement of each slide block , using photographs and other data to estimate the velocity of each landslide , describing the composition of each , and recounting the interactions between blocks . 
 = = Tributes and legacy = = 
 Despite their appreciation of his work , many of Glicken 's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized . Chatty , noted for being extremely sensitive , and often considered a " nut " by his peers , Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail . One of his friends writes , " Harry was a character his whole life . ... Everyone who knew him was amazed he was such a good scientist . " Regarding Glicken 's driving habits , the same acquaintance describes him as " a cartoon character " who " would drive at full speed down the road , talking about whatever was important to him , and ... come to a four @-@ way stoplight and he 'd sail through it , never knowing he 'd just gone through " . 
 Glicken 's father said in 1991 that his son died pursuing his passion , and that he was " totally absorbed " with volcanology . United States Geological Survey co @-@ worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation , and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student . Speaking about Glicken 's personal passion for his field , his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes , " What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [ Glicken ] deeply for a very long time , and , in a way , I think it made him even more dedicated than he was before . " Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that " Harry was very enthusiastic , very bright , and very ambitious , ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes . " Many studies have utilized Glicken 's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition , and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken 's 1996 report . Reflecting on Glicken 's body of work , USGS employee Don Swanson names him as " a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches " . 
 Glicken was closely connected to the University of California , Santa Barbara , where he earned his doctorate and conducted research . To remember his association with the university , each year the Department of Earth Science awards an outstanding graduate geology student the " Harry Glicken Memorial Graduate Fellowship " , established by the Harry Glicken Fund , which aims to support students " who will pursue research relating to the understanding of volcanic processes " .

 Most of Glicken 's published work centers around the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . He also coauthored works with other volcanologists that focused on debris avalanches . Colleague Jon Major writes that " The full scope of Harry 's work ... has never been published . "

 Mandatory Fun is the fourteenth studio album by American musician " Weird Al " Yankovic . Self @-@ produced , the album was released by RCA Records in the United States on July 15 , 2014 . Yankovic had previously released Alpocalypse in 2011 , and toured in support of it when he first spoke of his next record . When he began to work on what would become Mandatory Fun , Yankovic found himself listening to older acts , many of which he would stylistically spoof on the album . 
 Recorded at studios in Los Angeles and Massachusetts from 2012 to 2014 , the album contains twelve songs , which include parodies of songs by Pharrell Williams , Robin Thicke , Iggy Azalea , Lorde and Imagine Dragons . It also features original songs in the form of pastiche , imitating the styles of the Pixies , Cat Stevens , Foo Fighters , Crosby , Stills & Nash and Southern Culture on the Skids . Yankovic composed the originals first , and wrote parodies last in order for them to be as timely as possible upon the album 's release . Many artists reacted positively to being parodied ; Williams remarked that he was " honored " to be spoofed by Yankovic , while Imagine Dragons advised Yankovic on how to replicate sounds in their original song . 
 After Yankovic 's 32 years under contract , Mandatory Fun marks his first number one album in the United States . It received positive reviews from contemporary music critics . Yankovic chose not to release a lead single and instead publicized the album by launching eight music videos online during the first week of the album release through different video content portals . Among these , " Word Crimes " became Yankovic 's fourth top 40 song , making him one of few artists to achieve such a feat in four separate decades . 
 The album won for Best Comedy Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards , Yankovic 's fourth career Grammy . Due to the completion of his record contract obligations and the success of the video strategy , Yankovic has suggested Mandatory Fun may be his last traditional album , switching to more timely releases of singles and EPs of his songs . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the closing stages of the Alpocalypse tour , Yankovic stated in an interview with The Morning Call that he had one more album on his contract ; the paper and other sources took to mean that this album would be his last . Yankovic later clarified that this was the last album on the current recording contract with his label , that he is currently " weighing his options " for renewing the contract or looking to another publisher , and made it clear that he was not retiring from music in the foreseeable future . In a later interview with NPR 's Weekend Edition , he stated that this might be his last conventional album , turning instead to more frequent releases of singles and EPs . For an LP , Yankovic stated that given the time lapse between the beginning of the process and the release of the finished product , " chances are a lot of the material is going to be somewhat dated by the time it comes out " . 
 The first tracks conceived for the album were original songs in the style of various bands as , compared to direct parodies , the pastiches " age better " . Prior to composing these songs , he had been listening to older acts such as Cat Stevens , Foo Fighters , and Southern Culture on the Skids for his own amusement . His Crosby , Stills & Nash style parody " Mission Statement " draws from his experiences attending executive meetings in his music career . Shortly after completing the song , Yankovic encountered Graham Nash , who coincidentally asked Yankovic to parody " Suite : Judy Blue Eyes " . Yankovic played a recording of his pastiche on his phone to Nash on the spot , and claimed that Nash loved the track . " First World Problems " is an original composition emulating the style of the Pixies , whom Yankovic had performed alongside for a charity concert two years earlier . The song features background vocals by Amanda Palmer , emulating the vocal style of Kim Deal ( particularly from the song " Debaser " ) ; who cites Yankovic and the Pixies as being her childhood heroes , and elaborated that she and Yankovic had met at one of her concerts in Los Angeles a few years previously . After Yankovic learned that his fans had petitioned for him to headline a Super Bowl halftime show , he realized that he lacked a sports @-@ themed composition in his repertoire , and decided to write " Sports Song " . 
 Yankovic noted that his usual method of generating parody ideas is to scan Billboard charts , radio play and online buzz in order to create a master list of candidates . From that point , he works out possible puns on the song titles , the potential for humor and general direction for his versions . Fans speculated ahead of the album 's release that Yankovic would parody " Let It Go " from the Disney film Frozen , due to the song 's popularity . He later explained that he considered making a Frozen parody titled " Make It So " about Star Trek : The Next Generation , but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed . Yankovic observed that the existing spoof " had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to take it down ! I couldn 't think of an idea that I liked as much as ' Make It So ' , so ... I gave up ! " . There were several other songs he intended to parody , but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for , and instead used them in the medley " Now That 's What I Call Polka " . More specifically , Yankovic expressed that while Daft Punk 's " Get Lucky " is an " iconic song " , it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Twelve songs were recorded for Mandatory Fun . Most of the sessions took place at Way Station , <unk> Studio and Bedrock L.A. in Los Angeles . Yankovic pre @-@ recorded demos of each song on his personal laptop prior to recording , to show his bandmates the direction to go in . The earliest songs produced were " Mission Statement " , " Lame Claim to Fame " and " My Own Eyes " , which were recorded on September 4 , 2012 . Three more songs were later recorded : " Sports Song " on May 3 , followed by " First World Problems " and " Jackson Park Express " on May 8 , 2013 . Yankovic announced Amanda Palmer 's involvement in the album later that month . Her background vocal sessions for " First World Problems " took place at Mad Oak Studios in Allston , Massachusetts , as she was unable to travel to L.A. at the time . Yankovic coached Palmer remotely via Skype as she attempted to emulate the vocal style of Kim Deal . 
 As usual for him , Yankovic sought permission from the original artists for his parodies ; in contrast to previous albums , he had few difficulties in obtaining these . Yankovic stated " This is the first time where I 've gotten everybody that I wanted , and I couldn 't be happier about it . " He was able to get Pharrell Williams ' permission for three of the songs he represented on the album , Williams ' " Happy " , Robin Thicke 's " Blurred Lines " , and " Get Lucky " , through a personal email to the artist after Yankovic 's manager had difficulty working this with Williams ' manager ; according to Yankovic , Williams was " honored " to have his work used by Yankovic . Yankovic and his band got full cooperation from Imagine Dragons , who gave permission and advised on how to recreate some of the sounds used in " Radioactive " for Yankovic 's sendup " Inactive " . 
 When Yankovic decided to parody " Blurred Lines " , he was initially concerned that by the time his version would be released a year later , many parodies would already exist . He therefore opted to go in a more distinct direction by making " Word Crimes " , which continues his fascination with grammar previously expressed in video set pieces where he corrected malformed signage and text in public . Yankovic said that his version avoids the perceived misogyny of the original song and its various existing parodies . He also considered this " the only chance that ' Blurred Lines ' will be used in the curriculum of somebody 's school " . " Word Crimes " , " Inactive " and " Foil " were all recorded in December 2013 while " Tacky " and " Now That 's What I Call Polka ! " were produced the following April . Lisa Popeil also revealed in April that she would be recording with Yankovic for the album . Comedian Patton Oswalt , who appears in the video for " Foil " , listened to Yankovic 's album in May 2014 and revealed that " He satirizes a band I 've worshiped since the 90s " . Yankovic later affirmed that Oswalt was referring to his Pixies pastiche . 
 Eleven tracks had been completed by early 2014 , and Yankovic set the release date in the middle of the year as to keep the material " as timely as possible " . However , he wished to find " the big hit of the summer " to add to the set . Yankovic recalled that he determined the saturation point of Iggy Azalea 's " Fancy " by asking his daughter : " I said , ' Are they talking about Iggy Azalea at school ? ' And she says , ' Well , not so much . ' I asked the same thing two weeks later and she said , ' Oh yeah , that 's all they 're talking about now ! ' " Yankovic then traveled from Los Angeles to Denver , Colorado in early June 2014 to ask Azalea permission to parody her song . He noted that meeting a spoof target in person is not his usual method for obtaining permission , but was necessary in this instance to meet the album deadline . The encounter was described by TMZ as an " ambush " as Yankovic presented the potential parody lyrics to Azalea backstage at one of her concerts . He later clarified that the meeting was much more polite and blown out of proportion by TMZ . Yankovic recorded the Azalea parody " Handy " that same month , and announced that the album mastering process was complete on June 12 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Mandatory Fun consists of twelve tracks , five of which are parodies of songs popular at the time of the album 's production . The opening Iggy Azalea parody of " Fancy " is " Handy " , performed from the point of view of a person described by Kenneth Partridge of Billboard as " the world 's most braggadocious contractor " . The character portrayed in the song rhymes about various handyman tasks including installing countertops , tile floors , and repairing leaf blowers . Kevin O 'Keeffe of The Wire noted that the only direct connection between the character and Azalea is the line " I got 99 problems but a switch ain 't one " , which refers to Azalea 's appearance in the song " Problem " . 
 The Southern Culture on the Skids pastiche " Lame Claim to Fame " examines celebrity @-@ obsessed culture . It features frequent name @-@ drops as the singer brags about having tangential associations with popular people . " Foil " is a parody of the Lorde song " Royals " and focuses on two cases of aluminum foil use : the first verse deals with food being preserved with the material , while the second verse describes the foil being used by conspiracy theorists as a protective hat . O 'Keeffe observed that it is the shortest parody on Mandatory Fun as it omits the bridge and final chorus of the original song . The original composition " Sports Song " imagines a college marching band directly insulting the opposing team with their fight song . Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club summarized the track as a " passable but not particularly inspired take on rabid fandom " . 
 The following Robin Thicke parody " Word Crimes " involves the singer pointing out grammatical errors frequently made in online messages , and shaming people who engage in various other common textual misconceptions . " My Own Eyes " is a style parody of the Foo Fighters in which the protagonist recalls witnessing unusual events throughout his life , such as elderly men dying of " Bieber fever " and a mime " hacked to death with an imaginary cleaver " . Partridge felt that the pastiche " falls flat " without Dave Grohl 's songwriting and personality . " Now That 's What I Call Polka ! " is Yankovic 's twelfth polka medley , in which Yankovic sings selections of various popular songs at the time of recording , set to a polka music . The title is a parody of the long @-@ running series of compilation albums released by EMI , Now That 's What I Call Music ! . 
 The song " Mission Statement " emulates the style of Crosby , Stills & Nash , with the lyrics citing a series of corporate buzzwords and executive jargon . Yankovic considered it " ironic to juxtapose that with the song stylings of CSN , whose music pretty much symbolizes the antithesis of corporate America " . Rolling Stone noted that the song imitates the band 's layered harmonies used in " Carry On " and " Suite : Judy Blue Eyes " . 
 " Inactive " is a spoof of the Imagine Dragons song " Radioactive " that centers on an extremely lethargic character covered in food residue . O 'Keeffe remarked upon the breathing sounds of the original song being <unk> in the parody , as the character mentions that he requires an inhaler . The Pixies pastiche " First World Problems " lampoons people who complain of various First World problems such as the lack of gluten @-@ free cookies in an airport lounge . The song features " off @-@ kilter guitars and a Black Francis @-@ esque raucous vocal delivery " with stylistic references to the Pixies songs " Debaser " and " Hang Wire " . The sendup of Williams ' " Happy " is the song " Tacky " , in which the singer boasts of having no shame and making unfashionable or tactless choices . Reviews noted that the song lists various disruptive acts associated with social media , referencing Instagram , Twitter , and Yelp . 
 Following Yankovic 's tradition of recording long @-@ form songs such as " Albuquerque " , " Genius in France " , " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " , he concludes the album with a 9 @-@ minute plus track called " Jackson Park Express " . The song is in the style of Cat Stevens , and described by Zaleski as " an in @-@ depth vignette about a bus @-@ ride @-@ length romance that 's really a figment of the protagonist 's imagination . " Another review detailed that the piece is a conversation between two bus passengers involving topics such as relationships , deodorant , and wearing the skin of another person ; the protagonist insists that the latter is " not in a creepy way . " Comedy website Chortle opined that " Jackson Park Express " is the best song on the album , and " arguably the funniest one he 's ever written . "

 The cover art and title of the album was first affirmed via the RCA Records website . Regarding the title of the album , Yankovic mentioned that , " That was just an oxymoron that I 've always been amused by . It 's used a lot in corporate retreats and , I 'm told , in the military . " Yankovic also acknowledged that the name is speculated to be a reference to the album marking the end of his 32 @-@ year @-@ long label contract . 
 The artwork is designed to resemble an agglomeration of Soviet and Chinese propaganda , and Yankovic is described by Rolling Stone as wearing a Russian military costume over a font resembling Soviet text . Communist propaganda is often drawn in shades of red , features people marching , and is supported in the background by an image of a leader . Yankovic stated that the cover image was photographed as early as August 2013 . Yankovic said the cover art was a play on the name Mandatory Fun . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 Before the album was complete and a release date was set , Yankovic had already booked promotional appearances that coincidentally fell around the album 's time of release : this included an appearance on the YouTube series Epic Rap Battles of History where he dressed as Isaac Newton , and the Comedy Central series Drunk History where he played Adolf Hitler . Yankovic started hinting at the release of Mandatory Fun using social media in mid @-@ June 2014 . On June 14 , he posted a self @-@ described " cryptic " image of himself with the message " July 15 " , which Rolling Stone specified as being the album release date . Yankovic used a series of short trailers to tease the album , using stock footage of historical communism and military propaganda films interspersed with imagery from the album cover art . He later observed that his portrayal of Hitler on Drunk History fit the " totalitarian theme " of the Mandatory Fun artwork . 
 Yankovic announced that there would be no pre @-@ album single for Mandatory Fun , and instead he would let the listeners decide which songs are the hits . He also revealed that he would participate in a Reddit " Ask Me Anything " session on the day of the album release . Yankovic explained that the pre @-@ release campaign deliberately withheld song information , since he felt it has become more difficult to establish a unique take on a parody in the age of YouTube content creation . He later made an appearance on the Hulu sitcom The <unk> of Orlando that coincided with the Mandatory Fun launch . After the album was released , he elaborated that putting out singles was technically unnecessary , since customers can buy the songs individually from digital vendors . 
 Yankovic made a commitment not to tour for an entire year during 2014 , instead using Mandatory Fun to tour " with a vengeance " in 2015 . " The Mandatory World Tour " was announced in January 2015 , and covered venues in the United States , Canada , Europe , Australia , and New Zealand throughout 2015 starting that May . Yankovic continued this tour in 2016 primarily across North America . 
 = = = Music videos = = = 
 To help promote Mandatory Fun in social media circles , Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album ; one was revealed each day starting on July 14 , 2014 , a day prior to the album 's release . Yankovic commented that " there is no more music television " as there was in the past , and that " the Internet [ ... ] is the new MTV " that operates continuously . Yankovic came up with the idea for the video promotion of the new album about two years before its release . He felt that releasing a new video for eight continuous days " would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long " . The approach has been compared to Beyoncé Knowles ' marketing for her album Beyoncé which took advantage of social media ; when asked if this video strategy was influenced by Knowles , Yankovic pointed out that his previous record Alpocalypse featured videos for every song at the time of release : " Nobody said to Beyoncé , ' Hey , you 're doing a Weird Al , aren 't ya ? ' So for the record , I was first . " 
 Although the music video aspect of Yankovic 's songs had long been a part of his success , RCA Records opted not to fund any video production for Mandatory Fun . Yankovic instead turned to various social media portals including Funny or Die and CollegeHumor which he had worked with in the past ; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any video ad revenue . He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them . This release strategy was considered by The Atlantic as a " web @-@ enabled precision video delivery operation , and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought " as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site . During an interview on Fox Business , Yankovic explained his method of funding to Stuart Varney , who seemed to misunderstand the possible monetization of Yankovic 's videos . 
 The first music video debuted on July 14 , featuring the song " Tacky " . Produced by Nerdist Industries , the one @-@ shot video mimicks Williams ' own style used in his video for " Happy " : It features Aisha Tyler , Margaret Cho , Eric Stonestreet , Kristen Schaal , Jack Black and Yankovic dressed in tacky clothes and dancing poorly on purpose while lip @-@ synching to the song 's lyrics about a person who brags on about his questionable style choices . The video was filmed at Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles , previously featured as Julianne Moore 's apartment in 1998 film The Big Lebowski . Yankovic specified that during each of the six continuous takes , he would have to rush down five flights of stairs while changing his outfit in order to appear in the beginning and end of the video . The video for " Word Crimes " features kinetic typography created by Jarrett Heather , reflecting the song 's theme of proper grammar , spelling , and punctuation . The " Foil " video , produced in conjunction with CollegeHumor , shows Yankovic as the host of a cooking show obsessing on the use of aluminium foil , suddenly descending into conspiracy theories ; it also includes guest appearances by Patton Oswalt , Tom Lennon , and Robert Ben <unk> . 
 " Handy " was released through Yahoo ! Screen 's " Sketchy " channel , and is presented in the style of a late @-@ night infomercial with Yankovic performing as a residential general contractor ; the video also includes Eddie <unk> , Justin Giddings , and Ted Hollis . The video for " Sports Song " plays to the song 's theme , featuring Yankovic along with the Riverside City College Marching Tigers band performing a routine on a football field during the song ; the video was directed by Yankovic with Andrew Bush and Brad Schulz and produced in conjunction with Funny or Die . The video for " First World Problems " was directed by Liam Lynch , and shows Yankovic , posing as a " pretentious jerk " wearing a " <unk> blonde wig " , over @-@ reacting to minor annoyances of a well @-@ off lifestyle . 
 " Lame Claim to Fame " is a stop @-@ motion video directed by animator Tim Thompson , using a <unk> approach to show the protagonist 's passing ties with various celebrities . This video took over a year and a half to complete . Among the cut @-@ outs of celebrities named in the song , the video includes pictures of Dr. Demento , the radio host that helped Yankovic 's rise to popularity . The final video was for " Mission Statement " , which was released via the Wall Street Journal . The video was produced by the business marketing company <unk> , featuring their time @-@ lapse whiteboard drawings which they have done for advertisements for companies like Microsoft and PayPal . It took about 10 months to create , going back and forth with Yankovic to match their drawings to the concept and musical themes of the song .

 The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the album an average score of 77 , based on 11 reviews , which indicates " generally favorable reviews . " The Los Angeles Times gave the album a perfect four star rating and called it a " stone cold masterpiece " , praising how the album 's parody tracks work well from their original material with Yankovic 's take on the lyrics . The A.V. Club considered the album successful with only a few missteps , with " smart meta @-@ commentary on pop music and a collection that never takes itself too seriously " . Rolling Stone reviewed the song " Tacky " stating that " Weird Al is in fine form throughout the track " . 
 ABC News 's Allan Raible described the album as among his best work , writing , " What makes this one sharp is that it really captures the current culture in a bubble in a way that is more pinpointed than on previous records . " Billboard considered the record 's original songs its best material , and " Word Crimes " the best parody . Paste similarly agreed that Yankovic 's original materials were the highlight of the album , and that as a whole , Mandatory Fun is " a good , humorous album that shows that Yankovic is not slowing down in the slightest " . 
 Mandatory Fun won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album at the 57th edition . 
 = = = Commercial performance = = = 
 Mandatory Fun debuted atop the United States Billboard 200 on the week of August 2 , 2014 . This makes it Yankovic 's first number one album on the chart in his more than 30 @-@ year career . Mandatory Fun was the first comedy album to debut at the number one slot . Mandatory Fun is also the first comedy album to reach the number one spot since Allan Sherman 's My Son , the Nut in August 1963 . It achieved the largest sales week for a comedy album since The Beavis and Butt @-@ head Experience in 1994 after selling 104 @,@ 700 copies during the sales week ending July 20 , 2014 . Prior to final figures , Yankovic was slated to sell 70 @,@ 000 – 75 @,@ 000 retail copies by the end of the tracking week , placing him just above Jason Mraz 's Yes ! . The estimated sales figures are almost double that of sales of Alpocalypse during its first week of release in 2011 . The song " Word Crimes " placed # 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the same week , the fourth Top 40 song in Yankovic 's career and making him the third artist , after Michael Jackson and Madonna , to have a Top 40 song in each of the four decades since the 1980s . 
 Businessweek attributed the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign . ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic 's success is in part due to the Internet 's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career . Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases , stating that " I 've been doing the same thing for 30 years and all of a sudden I 'm having the best week of my life " and that he " kind of stumbled on my formula for the future " . He also stated , " A No. 1 album is something I never had in my wildest dreams ever thought would be a reality . " The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album 's release , and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real @-@ Time Trending 140 chart during that week . In contrast , Yankovic 's video for " Perform This Way " , the lead single off Alpocalypse , only received 16 @.@ 8 million views in the three years since its release , while an individual video from Mandatory Fun , like " Tacky " , received 12 @.@ 8 million views within the first week . His exposure on social networks jumped 3 @,@ 391 % between the weeks of July 7 – 13 and July 14 – 20 , giving him more exposures than Beyoncé , Jay @-@ Z , and Justin Timberlake .

 = Action of 18 October 1806 = 
 The Action of 18 October 1806 was a minor naval engagement during the Napoleonic Wars , fought between the British Royal Navy frigate HMS Caroline and a Dutch squadron at the entrance to Batavia harbour on Java in the Dutch East Indies . During the battle the Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen was left unsupported by the remainder of the squadron and , isolated , was forced to surrender . [ Note A ] Captain Peter Rainier , the British commander , was subsequently free to remove his prize from within sight of the Dutch port when the remainder of the Dutch squadron refused to engage Caroline and their crews deliberately grounded the ships to avoid capture . He also returned many prisoners taken previously in a captured brig . 
 The action , and that of with the earlier Action of 26 July 1806 , demonstrated the weakness of the Dutch squadron in the East Indies and convinced Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to lead an operation against Batavia to eliminate the remainder of the Dutch squadron in November 1806 . This second raid was only partially successful , and was followed a year later by a raid on the harbour of Griessie , in which the last Dutch warships in the East were eliminated . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1806 , the French squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Charles Linois departed for the Atlantic Ocean and a British expeditionary force captured the Cape of Good Hope . Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Edward Pellew , commander of the British Royal Navy in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean at Madras in British India in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean was now able to concentrate on a major threat to British shipping in the region ; the Dutch squadron based in the Dutch East Indies , specifically on Java at the port of Batavia . 
 The Dutch squadron , which consisted of a number of old ships of the line , three frigates and a number of smaller warships , was primarily an anti @-@ piracy force . However , their presence so close to the Straits of Malacca , a major British trade route , was of concern to Pellew , particularly following the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804 , when Linois 's squadron intercepted a vital British convoy in the Strait , using Batavia both as a base to launch the operation and repair damage afterwards . Determined to eliminate the Dutch squadron , Pellew despatched frigates to the region in the spring of 1806 , under orders to disrupt trade and reconnoitre the Dutch harbours and bases . In July 1806 , the frigate HMS Greyhound cruised the Molucca Islands , and captured a Dutch frigate and convoy at the Action of 26 July 1806 off Celebes , encouraging further expeditions . In October 1806 , a second frigate , the 36 @-@ gun HMS Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier ( nephew of Admiral Peter Rainier whom Pellew had replaced ) , cruised in the Java Sea . Caroline had a successful start to the operation , discovering that the Dutch ships of the line had left Batavia harbour and sailed eastwards . He had also captured a number of Dutch ships so that by mid @-@ October 57 of Rainier 's crew , more than a fifth , were aboard prizes on the journey back to India , leaving Caroline with just 204 men and a large number of prisoners carried below decks . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On 18 October , Rainier was cruising in the Java Sea when he encountered and captured a small Dutch brig sailing from Bantam . From prisoners removed from this ship , Rainier learned that the Dutch frigate Phoenix was undergoing repairs at the small island of Onrust in the Thousand Islands . Deciding that Phoenix was lying in an exposed position and could be easily attacked , Rainier sailed Caroline towards Onrust , but was spotted in the passage between <unk> and Amsterdam Islands by two small Dutch warships . Rainier attacked the small vessels , seizing the 14 @-@ gun brig Zeerop without a shot fired . The other vessel Zee @-@ Ploeg escaped into shallow coastal waters , where the deeper drafted frigate could not follow . The delay allowed Phoenix to sail to Batavia ahead of Caroline 's pursuit . 
 As Caroline neared Batavia , Phoenix entered the well @-@ defended harbour , making further pursuit impossible . However , Rainier then sighted a second frigate , lying at anchor in Batavia Roads , accompanied only by the 14 @-@ gun corvette William , the elusive brig Zee @-@ Ploeg , and the 18 @-@ gun ship Patriot that belonged to the Dutch East India Company . Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36 @-@ gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager . Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline , and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore , Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate . In his preparations for battle , Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables , giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen . 
 As Caroline approached , Captain Jager ordered his men to open fire on the British frigate at extreme range , also calling on support from the other Dutch vessels anchored nearby . In response , Rainier gave orders for his men to hold fire , enduring the Dutch guns until his frigate was just 40 yards ( 37 m ) away before unleashing a full broadside . Jager responded , but the British fire was too strong and within half an hour the Dutch flag was struck . Taking possession of the Dutch frigate , Lieutenant <unk> discovered that 50 of the 270 men aboard had been killed or wounded and that the ship had suffered moderate damage to its masts and rigging . British casualties in the engagement were three killed outright and eighteen more wounded , six of whom subsequently died . Also killed were four Dutch prisoners who had been sheltering in the hold . 
 While <unk> was boarding Maria Riggersbergen , Rainier had turned his attention to the other ships in the bay . However the sea was shallow and crossed by shoals that prevented further advance without proper charts , which Caroline lacked . Although they had fired a number of shots at long @-@ range , the interference by the smaller Dutch vessels during the battle had been negligible . Following the surrender of Maria Riggersbergen , most of the shipping in the bay including all seven of the merchant vessels , the three small warships and Phoenix , had deliberately beached themselves to avoid capture . Abandoning the idea of further operations off Batavia as too risky , Rainier ordered his ships to sail , placing most of the Dutch prisoners , including the wounded and sick , into the first brig captured that morning and ordering the ship to return to Batavia as a cartel , with the officers placed under parole restrictions . With most of his prisoners removed , Rainier then ordered Maria Riggersbergen and Zeerop to return to Madras . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Ranier 's action against what appeared to be superior power and numbers exposed the poor quality of the Dutch squadron at Batavia . Pellew determined to make a decisive attack on the capital of the Dutch East Indies during 1806 . In November he led a powerful squadron to the harbour , once again forcing the Dutch to their squadron ashore , where it was burnt by boarding parties led by Admiral Pellew 's son , Captain Fleetwood Pellew . The following year , Admiral Pellew returned in search of the missing ships of the line , discovering them at Griessie and causing the Dutch to destroy them too . With the Dutch squadron eliminated , the threat to British trade routes was removed and attention returned to the French bases in the Indian Ocean , the British waiting until 1811 to force the surrender of the remaining Dutch colonies in the East Indies . 
 Maria Riggersbergen was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Java , under Captain George Pigot . In his report after the battle , Rainier described the Dutch frigate as " launched in 1800 and is a fast sailing ship " . The 2 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 600 km ) journey to Madras had revealed that she was in fact much older and very unstable at sea . Java and all hands disappeared six months later in a February 1807 hurricane in the west Indian Ocean while in convoy with the flagship of Sir Thomas Troubridge HMS Blenheim during a hurricane in the western Indian Ocean . Rainier remained in the Pacific for some time , capturing the valuable Spanish ship San Raphael in January 1807 , but ultimately his career stalled on his return to Europe . 
 = Pittston Coal strike = 
 The Pittston Coal strike was a United States labor union action led by the United Mine Workers Union ( UMWA ) against the Pittston Coal Company , nationally headquartered in Pittston , Pennsylvania . The strike , which lasted from April 5 , 1989 to February 20 , 1990 , resulted from Pittston 's termination of health care benefits for approximately 1 @,@ 500 retirees , widows , and disabled miners . The strikers also cited the refusal of the company to contribute to the benefit trust established in 1950 for miners who retired before 1974 and the refusal of the company to bargain in good faith as grounds for their action . The company cited declining coal prices , decreasing demand , and recession as its reason for limiting health care benefits . 
 The strike affected production in mines mostly in Virginia , but a few in West Virginia and Kentucky as well . Mine workers and their families engaged in acts of civil disobedience , work stoppage , protests , and rallies . At its peak in June 1989 , the strike involved approximately 2 @,@ 000 miners daily staying at Camp Solidarity with thousands more sending donations and holding wildcat walkouts that involved around 40 @,@ 000 people . The participation of women in the labor action through the ad hoc formation of the Daughters of Mother Jones — reminiscent of the early days of union organization — proved an essential element of the successful strike . 
 = = Events leading to the strike = = 
 During the 1980s , the real ( inflation @-@ adjusted ) price of coal declined , putting economic pressure on coal companies . Many coal companies began employing non @-@ union workers who would work for less money so that the coal company could maintain a profit . 
 By 1987 Pittston Coal had dropped from being the seventh largest coal operator in the United States to the 15th , and coal production was at an all @-@ time low . The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the <unk> Coal Operators ( <unk> ) , which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers . The Pittston mines continued to lose money , though , and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the <unk> to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA . Through collective bargaining , the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners : one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974 , in the hopes that this would help the company gain a profit . 
 In 1988 , Pittston still felt the strain of providing benefits , with the cost per miner increasing by $ 3 @,@ 746 from the 1979 amount . The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners ' benefits . To avoid losing more money , Pittston doubled health deductibles , lowered the coverage from 100 % to 80 % , and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974 . This change in the health care plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit , so they decided to keep the mines running 24 hours a day and seven days a week , with no overtime for the workers . Pittston also did away with successorship clauses , which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold . Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans , while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed . 
 The UMWA took action against Pittston 's new plan of operation and offered to reach a settlement . The coal company stayed quiet , and when the time came to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers , Pittston refused . The refusal to renew the contract left about 1 @,@ 500 people without health care . These people were not just miners employed by Pittston , but also families , widows , and disabled miners in the Virginia area . 
 = = UMWA declares strike = = 
 In April 1989 , after the miners had worked 14 months without benefits , UMWA president Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company . Around 2 @,@ 000 UMWA members who worked for Pittston walked out of the mines and reported to the picket line . Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers . To ensure that production would continue , Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across the picket line . 
 The UMWA used civil disobedience to attract attention to the needs of the miners . The union stressed that all actions of the strike must remain peaceful . However , many miners still used violent methods during the strike . The strike gained the media 's attention . People came from all across the country to support the UMWA 's cause , and around 50 @,@ 000 people went to southwest Virginia during the course of the strike . 
 During the strike , Pittston 's production was reduced by about one third . Low production could have been a result of the strike taking place in several mines owned by Pittston . The main mine involved was the <unk> Coal Company in Dickenson County , Virginia . Some of the other mines that participated in the strike of 1989 were the Moss 3 Preparation Plant in Russell County , Virginia , McClure mine , and the Westmoreland Coal Complex . Pittston refused to give in to the UMWA 's demands , although operating at a loss , and the strike continued . Unable to meet the financial needs of the strikers , the UMWA started to suffer as well . As the strike progressed , members of the union were paid less than $ 210 a week on average ; less than a third of the average salary of $ 640 a week . 
 Although the union members were getting less pay than promised , they did not lose their faith in the UMWA 's ability to negotiate a settlement . Due to Trumka 's efforts , the miners were able to keep their spirit and morale up during the strike . He knew that giving into the demands of Pittston would only lead to other mine companies revoking health care benefits . On August 20 , 1989 Trumka was questioned by B. Drummond Ayers Jr . , a local reporter from the New York Times , about how long he expected the strike to continue . Trumka responded to the question by saying , " People keep asking how long we can hold out . The answer : one day longer than Pittston . " The strike continued until February 1990 , when a settlement was agreed upon by both parties . The settlement was reached after taking the demands to court several times and after many ratifications were made . The miners of the Pittston Coal Company were able to once again receive health and retirement benefits . 
 = = Strike tactics = = 
 During the Pittston strike , the UMWA wanted to only use nonviolent means of protest against the company . Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found creative ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades . However , many wildcat strikers ignored the request of the UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company . By the time the strike had ended , over 4 @,@ 000 people had been arrested for their actions . 
 = = = Violent actions = = = 
 A majority of the people who carried out violent acts were nonunion members and wildcat strikers . Actions included destruction of the Pittston Company ’ s mining equipment , pelting coal trucks with rocks to break their windows , and stopping the trucks by slashing their tires – usually using Jack rocks . Jack rocks were sharp tools made up of nails welded together with their points facing out designed to puncture the tires . Wildcat strikers also began to organize walkouts which were illegal for UMWA members , but since the wildcats were not affiliated with a union , they continued to organize walkouts throughout Virginia . By June 1989 , nearly 37 @,@ 000 wildcat strikers became involved with the Pittston strike . 
 The strike acts soon spread past Virginia and into other parts of the country and other coal companies . Additional violent acts included the making of car bombs that were placed along roadsides that coal trucks would travel . Shotguns were used to shoot employees at the Hampton Coal Company when they tried to enter the coal mines . Some strikers shot into the windows of cars and houses of the replacement miners and Pittston Coal Company owners . There were many different violent strike tactics carried out and although many people were injured , including one striker shot , there were no deaths associated with this strike . 
 = = = Civil disobedience = = = 
 The UMWA tried to focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers . The union members used many different nonviolent strike tactics . These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel , mass sit down strikes , and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines . This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country . 
 Another method of peaceful protesting was demonstrated in the formation of Camp Solidarity which was located in the center of the protesting , in southern Virginia . Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay . Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter , they could not provide enough beds and food for all the people who came . Union member supporters found a solution to the problem . A local recreational park near <unk> , Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay . A small shelter equipped with bunk beds was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity . Because the location was a recreational park , there was plenty of space for others to bring campers and tents into the area . 
 = = = = Moss 3 = = = = 
 The most important act of civil disobedience during the Pittston strike was Moss 3 . Since the strike had been going on for a few months , with no settlement expected in the near future , union members began to lose hope . Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending . Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up . 
 The plan that the Union officers devised was called Moss 3 , named after the Pittston ’ s Moss 3 Preparation Plant which was its primary coal processing plant at the time . The officials were very secretive about planning this act of nonviolent strike . They wanted Pittston to know nothing about what was about to take place . Officials selected 99 union members out of Virginia , West Virginia , and Kentucky to participate in Moss 3 and the selected miners met in Virginia and were told about the plan . 
 Moss 3 was set up to be an unexpected mass , nonviolent , sit down strike within the preparation plant . The 99 strikers walked into the plant peacefully and sat down inside the plant to halt production . Meanwhile , thousands of other supporters gathered outside the plant to encourage the strikers inside – an estimated 5 @,@ 000 supporters at the height of Moss 3 were gathered outside the production plant . 
 The sit down strike inside Moss 3 lasted from Sunday to Wednesday . After four days , the strikers felt they made their point to Pittston and walked out . Local miners said that Pittston had called in the National Guard and state police to remove the miners if they did not leave within an hour ’ s time . The Pittston owners felt that the miners inside were tipped off to this information and that they left to avoid being arrested . 
 = = Women ’ s involvement = = 
 Although the Pittston strike involved coal miners , many of the supporters of the strike were not miners at all . A majority of the support that the union members received was from women , who were a pivotal aspect of the strike . Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston , but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all . The women would sit down in the middle of roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays . Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time ; " The Daughters of Mother Jones " and " The Freedom Fighters " . At the peak of the strike around 500 women were involved in supporting the miners , most of them housewives . 
 = = = Daughters of Mother Jones = = = 
 One group of women that formed during the strike was the “ Daughters of Mother Jones ” . The group took their name from Mary Harris Jones , also known as " Mother Jones " , a famous mine union activist . The group chose the name because they wanted to support the miners ' benefits and follow the same beliefs as Jones . The Daughters performed many of the same actions as other women supporters during the strike , including organizing places for supporters to stay , preparing food , and raising money for the miners . 
 The action for which the Daughters of Mother Jones are best known is their organization of an ongoing strike at the Pittston Coal State Headquarters in Lebanon , Virginia . The women would meet outside the headquarters and strike , without the instruction or organization of the UMWA . They picketed outside every Monday and Wednesday in the hopes that they could gain more media attention and support for the miners . Despite this , the Daughters did not feel that they were doing enough , so they independently constructed a sit down strike to take place at Pittston Coal headquarters , unorganized by the union . 
 On April 18 , 1989 , a group of 39 women went into the Pittston Coal headquarters and held a 36 ‑ hour sit @-@ down strike . The women stated that they would not leave until a contract was signed . When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names , the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones . The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half . The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause , and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some to be a part of the union . 
 = = = Freedom Fighters = = = 
 Another women 's group that developed during the strike , in Camp Solidarity , was the Freedom Fighters . The main mission of these women was to cook and provide meals for the people staying at Camp Solidarity . The Freedom Fighters set up a phone bank to inform other people of what types of food they could donate and how much food was needed . Because of the Freedom Fighters , many supporters were able to stay at Camp Solidarity for a long period because they were being fed for free . By forming this group , the women of the Freedom Fighters found a way to support the miners and the UMWA . The Freedom Fighters formed during the Pittston Strike , but they did not end there . Today the Freedom Fighters still exist as a group of women who help to support the benefits for miners across the United States . 
 = = Aftermath of the strike = = 
 In February 1990 , the Pittston Coal Company and the UMWA came to a settlement . The current miners of Pittston would receive health and retirement benefits once again . Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $ 10 million for the retirement benefits plan for pre @-@ 1974 miners . In return Pittston was permitted to operate seven days a week as long as they were closed from 8am – 4pm on Sundays . Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 days they would work one week for 4 days , 10 hours each day . 
 Both groups had lost a considerable amount of money , Pittston due to the slowdown of production , and the UMWA for the cost of organizing the strike . At the end of the strike , the UMWA was fined around $ 64 million because of their actions during the strike . Many of these fines were not just because of violence that had erupted , but also for the road blockages and other forms of civil disobedience . Union officials were personally charged $ 13 @,@ 000 a day for the strike and the union was charged $ 200 @,@ 000 for their actions at Moss 3 . Many people opposed the charges that were made against the UMWA and petitioned that they be dropped . Although not all charges were , a vast majority were cleared and in return , union officials had to do 10 @,@ 000 hours of community service to compensate for the removal of the fines . 
 Miners of the Pittston Coal Company were glad that a settlement had been reached and that they would once again be receiving health and retirement funds . However , because they were without benefits for such a long time , many people had gone into financial trouble . During the strike , the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so . As a result , many miners had accumulated debt . Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act . This act was established in 1992 . This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers . 
 At the time of the strike , Pittston was a strong coal company and the area was full of strikers protesting . Since the strike , many of Pittston 's coal plants have been sold to Alpha Natural Resources , which is now in the nation ’ s top three coal companies , in order to pay for the health care for the miners . After the strike ended , Moss 3 was demolished and a new plant was built and named after it , and the recreational park that became Camp Solidarity has been reclaimed by nature and is now an open field . Though the physical aspects of the area have changed since the strike has ended , what has not changed is the feeling that the miners of Pittston accomplished – a win for their own benefits as well as benefits for the UMWA . The union ’ s actions during the strike made it possible for thousands of miners to receive health care and retirement funds for years to come . Even though the miners were able to reach a settlement in early 1990 , the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990 . The fines , over $ 60 million , did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges . However , since the case was now in the court system , many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines . The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years . 
 = Our Friends in the North = 
 Our Friends in the North is a British television drama serial , produced by the BBC and originally broadcast in nine episodes on BBC Two in early 1996 . Written by Peter Flannery , it tells the story of four friends from the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in North East England over 31 years from 1964 to 1995 . The story references many real political and social events , both specific to Newcastle and to Britain as a whole , which occurred during the era portrayed , including general elections , police and local government corruption , the UK miners ' strike ( 1984 – 1985 ) and the Great Storm of 1987 . 
 The serial is commonly regarded as one of the most successful BBC television dramas of the 1990s , described by The Daily Telegraph as " A production where all ... worked to serve a writer 's vision . We are not likely to look upon its like again . " It has been named by the British Film Institute as one of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century , by The Guardian newspaper as the third greatest television drama of all time , and by the Radio Times magazine as one of the 40 greatest television programmes . It was awarded three British Academy Television Awards ( BAFTAs ) , two Royal Television Society Awards , four Broadcasting Press Guild Awards , and a Certificate of Merit from the San Francisco International Film Festival . 
 Our Friends in the North helped to establish the careers of its four lead actors , Daniel Craig , Christopher Eccleston , Gina McKee and Mark Strong ; for Craig in particular , his part in the serial has been referred to as his breakthrough role . It was also a controversial production , as its stories were partly based on real people and events , and several years passed before it was adapted from a play performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company , due in part to the BBC 's fear of litigation . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Each of the nine episodes of the serial takes place in the year for which it is named ; 1964 , 1966 , 1967 , 1970 , 1974 , 1979 , 1984 , 1987 , and 1995 . The episodes follow the four main characters and their changing lives , careers and relationships against the backdrop of the political and social events in the United Kingdom at the time . 
 The four friends are Dominic ' Nicky ' Hutchinson ( played by Christopher Eccleston ) , Mary Soulsby ( Gina McKee ) , George ' Geordie ' Peacock ( Daniel Craig ) and Terry ' Tosker ' Cox ( Mark Strong ) . The series begins in 1964 with Nicky returning from a period working with the civil rights movement in the southern United States to resume his studies at the University of Manchester and reuniting with his girlfriend , Mary , and best friend Geordie . Geordie is hoping to form a pop group with his mate Tosker . 
 Nicky is persuaded to drop out and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue ( Alun Armstrong ) , swayed by Donohue 's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better . This is much to the annoyance of Nicky 's trade unionist father Felix ( Peter Vaughan ) , who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky 's age . Nicky 's relationship with Mary ends when she sleeps with Tosker and gets pregnant , later marrying him , which means she also drops out of university . On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father , Geordie leaves for London , where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett ( Malcolm McDowell ) . 
 Geordie is initially successful while employed by Barrett in his Soho nightclubs and sex shops . He also helps Tosker and Mary , introducing Tosker to Barrett who lends him the money to start his own fruit and vegetable business , his former dreams of musical stardom having gradually faded away . Nicky , meanwhile , realises the extent of Donohue 's corrupt dealings with the building contractor John Edwards ( Geoffrey Hutchings ) and resigns in disgust , eventually becoming involved with left @-@ wing anarchists in London . 
 By the early 1970s , the police have cracked down on Barrett 's business , and their own corruption , but not before Barrett has set Geordie up , sending him to prison in retaliation for an affair Geordie had with Barrett 's lover . Nicky 's anarchist cell is raided and he returns to Newcastle , as eventually does Geordie . By 1979 , Nicky has returned to more mainstream politics and stands for the Labour Party in the general election , but is defeated by the Conservative Party candidate ( Saskia Wickham ) after a smear campaign . Geordie leaves shortly before the election , not to be seen in the series again until 1987 . 
 By 1984 , Nicky is working as a successful photographer , and Mary has divorced Tosker , who has remarried and is rapidly becoming a rich businessman . Nicky and Mary renew their earlier relationship during the turbulent events of the miners ' strike and eventually marry . By 1987 , however their marriage is falling apart , Nicky has an affair with a young student and is also forced to confront his father 's Alzheimer 's disease . He meets Geordie , now a homeless , drunken vagrant , by chance in London , but his old friend disappears before he has a chance to help him . Eventually Geordie is sentenced to life in prison as a danger to the public after setting fire to a mattress in a hostel . Despite her failing marriage to Nicky , Mary 's life is becoming an increasing success , and she is now a councillor . Tosker , meanwhile , has lost his fortune in the stock market crash . 
 The final episode , 1995 , sees Nicky – who has emigrated to Italy – returning to Newcastle to oversee the funeral of his mother . Tosker has managed to rebuild his business and is about to hold the opening night of his new floating nightclub , based on a boat moored on the River Tyne ( filmed on the real club the Tuxedo Princess ) . Mary , now a Labour Member of Parliament sympathetic to New Labour , is also invited to the opening , and Tosker is surprised to find Geordie back in the city as well – he has escaped from prison . Neither Mary nor Geordie make it to the opening night party , but the four friends are reunited the following day , at Nicky 's house after his mother 's funeral . Tosker leaves to be with his grandchildren and Mary also leaves after agreeing to meet Nicky for lunch the next day . However , a desperate Nicky realises that " Tomorrow 's too late " and runs after Mary 's car , eventually attracting her attention and breathlessly asking , " Why not today ? " to which she agrees , smiling . Meanwhile , Geordie walks off , and the series ends with him heading off into the distance across the Tyne Bridge , after looking down at Tosker playing with his grandchildren on the boat below . As Geordie walks away and the credits fade up , the music of " Don 't Look Back in Anger " by Oasis is heard .

 Our Friends in the North was originally written by the playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre , while he was a writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) . The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company 's production of Henry IV , Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon in 1980 ; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic . The original three @-@ hour long theatre version of Our Friends in the North , directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast , was produced by the RSC in 1982 . It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set , Newcastle upon Tyne , and then playing at The Pit , a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London . In its original form , the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher . The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia , chronicling UDI , the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy . This plot strand was dropped from the televised version , although the title Our Friends in the North – a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith – remained . 
 Flannery was heavily influenced not only by his own political viewpoints and life experiences , but by the real @-@ life history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s . Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real @-@ life scandals of T. Dan Smith and John Poulson , who built cheap high @-@ rise housing projects in Newcastle that they knew to be of low quality . Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was going to write a play based on the events of the scandal , to which Smith replied , " There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions . "

 The stage version of Our Friends in the North was seen by BBC television drama producer Michael Wearing in Newcastle in 1982 , and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation . Wearing was at the time based at the BBC English Regions Drama Department at BBC Birmingham , which had a specific remit for making " regional drama " , and had established his reputation by producing Alan Bleasdale 's Boys from the Blackstuff in 1982 . Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four @-@ part television serial for BBC Two , with each episode to be fifty minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons . A change of executives meant that the project did not reach production , however Wearing persisted in trying to get it commissioned , and Flannery extended the serial to six episodes , one for each United Kingdom general election from 1964 to 1979 . However , by this point in the mid @-@ 1980s Michael Grade was Director of Programmes for BBC Television , and he had no interest in the project . 
 By 1989 , however , Wearing had been recalled to the central BBC drama department in London , where he was made Head of Serials . This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause of Our Friends in the North , and Flannery also wrote to the BBC 's then Managing Director of Television , Will Wyatt , " accusing him of cowardice for not approving it . " The BBC were concerned not only with the budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial , but also with potential legal issues , due to the basing of so much of the background story on real @-@ life events and people such as Smith and Poulson and former Home Secretary Reginald Maudling , upon whom another character , Claud Seabrook , was based . According to The Observer newspaper , one senior BBC lawyer , Glen Del Medico , even threatened to resign if the production was made , while others tried to persuade Flannery to reset the piece " in a fictional country called Albion rather than Britain . " Both Smith and Poulson died before the programme aired .

 In 1992 , Wearing was able to persuade the then @-@ controller of BBC Two , Alan Yentob , to commission Peter Flannery to write scripts for a new version of the project . However , Yentob had no great enthusiasm for Our Friends in the North , as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988 , when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that Our Friends in the North was about " post @-@ war social housing policy . " As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce Our Friends in the North personally . George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer , before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC . Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project , Charles Pattinson . 
 When Yentob was succeeded as controller of BBC Two by Michael Jackson , Pattinson was able to persuade Jackson to commission full production on the series . This was in spite of the fact that Jackson and Wearing were not close , and did not get on ; Pattinson took to dealing with Jackson directly . Jackson had agreed to nine one @-@ hour episodes ; however , Flannery protested that each episode should be as long as it needed to be , to which Jackson agreed . The long delay in production did have the advantageous side effect of allowing Flannery to extend the story , and instead of ending in 1979 it now carried on into the 1990s , bringing the four central characters into middle age . Flannery later commented that : " The project has undoubtedly benefited from the delay . I 'm not sure I have . " 
 The series did encounter further legal problems when some references to the fictional businessman Alan Roe were removed because of a perceived similarity to Sir John Hall , a Newcastle businessman who had a number of factors in common . The drama had originally shown Roe as taking advantage of tax breaks to build a large shopping centre .

 The scale of Our Friends in the North required BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote a budget of £ 8 million to the production , which was half of his channel 's drama serials budget for the entire year . Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co @-@ production funding from overseas broadcasters , but none were interested ; Pattinson believed that this was because the story was so much about Britain , and therefore of limited appeal to other countries . BBC Worldwide , the corporation 's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas , offered only £ 20 @,@ 000 of funding towards the production . The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160 ; more than 3000 extras were used , and filming took place across 40 weeks , from November 1994 until September 1995 .
