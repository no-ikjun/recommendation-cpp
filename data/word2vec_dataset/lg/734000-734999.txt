 In terms of various detailed AC @-@ AC converter topologies shown in Tables 2 and 3 below . 
 = = Application considerations = = 
 = = = AC line harmonics = = = 
 Note of clarification : . 
 While harmonics in the PWM output can easily be filtered by carrier @-@ frequency @-@ related filter inductance to supply near @-@ sinusoidal currents to the motor load , the VFD 's diode @-@ bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super @-@ imposing non @-@ linear half @-@ phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion , and hence voltage distortion , of the AC line input . When the VFD loads are relatively small in comparison to the large , stiff power system available from the electric power company , the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits . Furthermore , in low @-@ voltage networks , harmonics caused by single @-@ phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three @-@ phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in <unk> . However , when the proportion of VFD and other non @-@ linear load compared to total load or of non @-@ linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply , or both , is relatively large enough , the load can have a negative impact on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid . 
 When the power company 's voltage becomes distorted due to harmonics , losses in other loads such as normal fixed @-@ speed AC motors are increased . This condition may lead to overheating and shorter operating life . Also , substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively . In particular , capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels . In order to limit the voltage distortion , owners of VFD load may be required to install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits . Alternatively , the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used . In high @-@ power installations , harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi @-@ pulse rectifier @-@ bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase @-@ shifted windings . 
 It is also possible to replace the standard diode @-@ bridge rectifier with a bi @-@ directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor . Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active <unk> converter ( AIC ) , active rectifier , IGBT supply unit ( ISU ) , active front end ( AFE ) , or four @-@ quadrant operation . With PWM control and a suitable input reactor , an AFE 's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal . AFE inherently regenerates energy in four @-@ quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid . Thus , no braking resistor is needed , and the efficiency of the drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor . 
 Two other harmonics mitigation techniques exploit use of passive or active filters connected to a common bus with at least one VFD branch load on the bus . Passive filters involve the design of one or more low @-@ pass LC filter traps , each trap being tuned as required to a harmonic frequency ( 5th , 7th , 11th , 13th , . . . <unk> + / -1 , where k = integer , q = pulse number of converter ) . 
 It is very common practice for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards . For example , IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer 's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic to be no more than 3 % of the fundamental and call for the voltage total harmonic distortion ( <unk> ) to be no more than 5 % for a general AC power supply system . 
 = = Switching frequency = = 
 = = = Switching frequency <unk> = = = 
 One drive uses a default switching frequency setting of 4 kHz . Reducing the drive ’ s switching frequency ( the carrier @-@ frequency ) reduces the heat generated by the <unk> . 
 A carrier frequency of at least ten times the desired output frequency is used to establish the PWM switching intervals . A carrier frequency in the range of 2 @,@ 000 to 16 @,@ 000 Hz is common for LV [ low voltage , under 600 Volts AC ] VFDs . A higher carrier frequency produces a better sine wave approximation but incurs higher switching losses in the IGBT , decreasing the overall power conversion efficiency . 
 = = = Noise <unk> = = = 
 Some drives have a noise smoothing feature that can be turned on to introduce a random variation to the switching frequency . This distributes the acoustic noise over a range of frequencies to lower the peak noise intensity . 
 = = = Long @-@ lead effects = = = 
 The carrier @-@ frequency pulsed output voltage of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses , the transmission line effects of which must be considered . Since the transmission @-@ line impedance of the cable and motor are different , pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable . The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3 @.@ 1 times the rated line voltage for long cable runs , putting high stress on the cable and motor windings , and eventual insulation failure . Note that standards for three @-@ phase motors rated 230 V or less adequately protect against such long @-@ lead overvoltages . On 460 V or 575 V systems and inverters with 3rd @-@ generation 0 @.@ 1 @-@ microsecond @-@ rise @-@ time <unk> , the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50 m or 150 feet . Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance , lowering carrier frequency , installing dV / dt filters , using inverter @-@ duty @-@ rated motors ( that are rated 600 V to withstand pulse trains with rise time less than or equal to 0 @.@ 1 microsecond , of 1 @,@ 600 V peak magnitude ) , and installing LCR low @-@ pass sine wave filters . Regarding lowering of carrier frequency , note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6 kHz and is most noticeable at about 3 kHz . Note also that selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for AC drives involves balancing noise , heat , motor insulation stress , common @-@ mode voltage @-@ induced motor bearing current damage , smooth motor operation , and other factors . Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low @-@ pass sine wave filter or dV / dt filter . 
 = = = Motor bearing currents = = = 
 PWM drives are inherently associated with high @-@ frequency common @-@ mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings . When these high @-@ frequency voltages find a path to earth through a bearing , transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining ( EDM ) sparking occurs between the bearing 's ball and the bearing 's race . Over time , EDM @-@ based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race that can be seen as a fluting pattern . In large motors , the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high @-@ frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends , leading to a circulating type of bearing current . Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft @-@ to @-@ ground bearing currents . Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high @-@ frequency bearing currents . 
 Prevention of high @-@ frequency bearing current damage uses three approaches : good cabling and grounding practices , interruption of bearing currents , and filtering or damping of common @-@ mode currents for example through soft magnetic cores , the so @-@ called inductive absorbers . Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded , symmetrical @-@ geometry power cable to supply the motor , installation of shaft grounding brushes , and conductive bearing grease . Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic @-@ shielded induction motors . Filtering and damping high @-@ frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or motor bearing currents . Another approach is to use instead of standard 2 @-@ level inverter drives , using either 3 @-@ level inverter drives or matrix converters . 
 Since inverter @-@ fed motor cables ' high @-@ frequency current spikes can interfere with other cabling in facilities , such inverter @-@ fed motor cables should not only be of shielded , symmetrical @-@ geometry design but should also be routed at least 50 cm away from signal cables . 
 = = = Dynamic braking = = = 
 Torque generated by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip . If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed , the motor acts as a generator , converting mechanical power back to electrical power . This power is returned to the drive 's DC link element ( capacitor or reactor ) . A DC @-@ link @-@ connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat in a set of resistors . Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating . 
 Dynamic braking wastes braking energy by transforming it to heat . By contrast , regenerative drives recover braking energy by injecting this energy into the AC line . The capital cost of regenerative drives is , however , relatively high . 
 = = = Regenerative drives = = = 
 Regenerative AC drives have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed ( an overhauling load ) and return it to the power system . 
 <unk> , <unk> , matrix , CSI , and LCI drives inherently allow return of energy from the load to the line , while voltage @-@ source inverters require an additional converter to return energy to the supply . 
 Regeneration is useful in VFDs only where the value of the recovered energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system , and if the system requires frequent braking and starting . Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of overhauling loads is required . 
 Some examples : 
 Conveyor belt drives for manufacturing , which stop every few minutes . While stopped , parts are assembled correctly ; once that is done , the belt moves on . 
 A crane , where the hoist motor stops and reverses frequently , and braking is required to slow the load during lowering . 
 Plug @-@ in and hybrid electric vehicles of all types ( see image and Hybrid Synergy Drive ) . 
 = = Historical systems = = 
 Before solid @-@ state devices became available , variable @-@ frequency drives used rotary machines and the General Electric Company obtained several patents for these in the early 20th century . An example is US patent <unk> of 1910 which states : " Such a generator finds a useful application in supplying current to induction motors for driving cars , locomotives , or other mechanism which are to be driven at variable speeds " . 
 = Russian battleship Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya = 
 The Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya ( Russian : Императрица Екатерина Великая , or Empress Catherine the Great ) was the second ship of the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class dreadnoughts of the Imperial Russian Navy . She was begun before World War I , completed in 1915 and saw service with the Black Sea Fleet . She engaged the ex @-@ German battlecruiser Yavuz once , but only inflicted splinter damage while taking no damage herself . She was renamed Svobodnaya Rossiya ( Russian : <unk> Россия , Free Russia ) after the February Revolution , but saw no further combat . She was evacuated from Sevastopol as the Germans approached in May 1918 , but was scuttled in Novorossiysk harbor the following month when the Germans demanded that the Soviets hand her over according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . 
 = = Description = = 
 Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was slightly larger than her half @-@ sisters . She was 167 @.@ 8 meters ( 550 ft 6 in ) long at the waterline and had a beam of 28 @.@ 07 meters ( 92 ft 1 in ) ; 4 feet 10 inches ( 1 @.@ 47 m ) longer and 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) wider than her half sisters . Her exact draft is not known , but she had a draft of 8 @.@ 7 meters ( 28 ft 7 in ) on trials . Her displacement was 24 @,@ 644 long tons ( 25 @,@ 039 t ) at load , over 900 long tons ( 910 t ) more than her designed displacement of 23 @,@ 783 long tons ( 24 @,@ 165 t ) . The first ship of the class , Imperatritsa Mariya , had proved to be very bow heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates . The ammunition for Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya 's forward 12 @-@ inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the forward 130 mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun in an attempt to compensate for her trim . This sufficed as Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya 's longer length meant that she was less affected by the trim problem to begin with . 
 Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was fitted with four Parsons @-@ type steam turbines built by the Associated Factories and Shipyards of Nikolayev ( ONZiV ) with technical assistance from Vickers Limited . They were designed for a total of 27 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 20 @,@ 000 kW ) , but produced 33 @,@ 000 shp ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) on trials . 20 mixed @-@ firing triangular Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers powered the turbines with a working pressure of 17 @.@ 5 atm ( 257 psi ) . Her designed speed was 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . Her maximum coal capacity was 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) plus 630 long tons ( 640 t ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 1 @,@ 680 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 110 km ; 1 @,@ 930 mi ) at full speed and 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at economical speed . All of her electrical power was generated by three main Curtis 360 kilowatt turbo generators and two 200 kilowatt auxiliary units . 
 Her main armament consisted of twelve Obukhovskii 12 @-@ inch Pattern 1907 52 @-@ caliber guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 130 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) B7 Pattern 1913 55 @-@ caliber guns mounted in casemates . They were arranged in two groups , six guns per side from the forward turret to the rear funnel and the remaining four clustered around the rear turret . She was fitted with three 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , one mounted on the roof of the fore turret and two side by side on the aft turret . Four 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were mounted , two tubes on each broadside abaft the forward magazine .

 Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was built by the ONZiV Shipyard at Nikolayev . She was laid down on 30 October 1911 as Ekaterina II , but this was just a ceremonial event as the design had not yet been finalized or the contract signed . ONZiV decided , on advice from Vickers , to increase her dimensions over those of her sisters to prevent her from being overweight . This added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months past her sisters . She suffered from a number of other delays during construction . First the method of fastening the armor to its supports was changed and the armor plates were locked together by a type of mortise and tenon joint to better distribute the shock of an impact . This was based on the full @-@ scale armor trials conducted using the hulk of the old pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Chesma in 1913 and added almost 500 long tons ( 508 t ) of weight to the ship . She was launched on 6 June 1914 , renamed on 27 June 1915 , and completed on 18 October 1915 . She ran her trials during the remainder of the year . 
 She was nearly sunk by the Russian destroyer Bystry on 5 January 1916 when the destroyer fired seven torpedoes at her in a case of mistaken identity ; luckily they all missed . Three days later she encountered the Ottoman battlecruiser Yavuz at long range . The ships opened fire at about 22 @,@ 000 yards ( 20 @,@ 000 m ) and Yavuz only got off five salvoes before she disengaged from the slower Russian dreadnought without damaging her . Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya fired 96 shells from her longer @-@ ranged guns , but inflicted only splinter damage on Yavuz before she pulled out of range . Six months later both Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya and her half @-@ sister Imperatritsa Mariya , alerted by intercepted radio transmissions , sortied from Sevastopol in an attempt to intercept Yavuz as she returned from a bombardment of the Russian port of Tuapse on 4 July . Yavuz dodged north and avoided the Russians by paralleling the Bulgarian coastline back to the Bosphorus . 
 After the February Revolution she was renamed Svobodnaya Rossiya ( Russian : <unk> Россия , " Free Russia " ) on 29 April 1917 . She sailed from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk on 30 April 1918 as German troops approached the city . The ship was scuttled on 19 June 1918 by four torpedoes fired by the destroyer Kerch in Novorossiysk harbor to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans as required by the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . The fourth torpedo caused a massive explosion and she capsized and sank in four minutes . No attempt was made to salvage her during the 1920s , but the 12 @-@ inch shells were salvaged from her wreck . Explosive charges were used to gain access to her magazines until one day in 1930 when a charge set off a torpedo warhead , which caused a nearby powder magazine to explode , throwing a column of water 100 – 120 metres ( 330 – 390 ft ) into the air . No one was injured , but salvage work of this type ceased , although parts of her engines and boilers were later salvaged . 
 = Coccomyces dentatus = 
 Coccomyces dentatus is a species of fungus in the family <unk> . A widespread species , particularly in temperate areas , it colonizes the dead fallen leaves of vascular plants , particularly oak and chestnut . The fungus apothecia , which form in the epidermal layer of the leaf host , resemble dark hexagonal spots scattered on a multi @-@ colored mosaic pattern bounded by thin black lines . When mature , the apothecia open by triangular flaps to release spores . The anamorph form of C. dentatus is Tricladiopsis flagelliformis . <unk> species can be distinguished by the shape of the apothecia , or by microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described scientifically as <unk> <unk> by Johann Karl Schmidt in 1817 . Italian botanist Giuseppe De <unk> moved it to <unk> in 1847 . In 1877 , Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred it to Coccomyces , giving it its current name . The variety C. dentatus var. hexagonus , described by Otto Penzig and Saccardo from West Java , Indonesia in 1901 , is sometimes applied to western US collections with large six @-@ sided apothecia . However , its status is unclear , as the type is no longer in Saccardo 's herbarium at the University of Padua , and Penzig 's collection was destroyed during World War II . C. dentatus f. <unk> was described by Heinrich Rehm in 1901 , for a collection found growing on a species of Lauraceae in Rio Grande do Sul ( southern Brazil ) . According to English botanist Martha Sherwood , who revised the genus Coccomyces in 1980 , it is indistinguishable from the main type and should be considered synonymous . 
 One author regarded C. dentatus as a synonym of Coccomyces coronatus , although later authors have treated them separately . In 1923 , Carlos Luigi Spegazzini tentatively reported the presence of C. dentatus on fallen Nothofagus leaves in Tierra del Fuego ( southern South America ) ; this species was later identified as a distinct species , C. australis . 
 In 1982 , Enrique <unk> described an aquatic <unk> Tricladiopsis flagelliformis growing from submerged leaves found in the shoreline of Windermere ( Cumbria , England ) , which he tentatively assigned as the anamorph state of Coccomyces dentatus . The specific epithet flagelliformis ( from the Latin flagellum " whip " and <unk> " shape " ) refers to the " whip @-@ like " form of the <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The apothecia of Coccomyces dentatus are distributed in bleached spots that are bounded by a black lines inside the outer cell layer of the leaf ( <unk> ) . The black lines — often referred to as zone lines — are the result of an antagonistic interactions between individuals of different genotypes that colonize the leaf surface . <unk> are usually accompanied by <unk> ( asexual fruit bodies ) measuring 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 0 mm in diameter . The apothecia are black , and shiny , with four to six sides . They have a star @-@ shaped pattern of grooves formed by lighter colored cells . When the spores are mature , these open ( <unk> ) by triangular " teeth " to expose the dull yellow hymenium ( spore @-@ bearing surface ) . 
 The layer covering the apothecia is about 30 μm thick , and made of blackened ( carbonized ) cells measuring 5 – 6 μm in diameter . At the base of the apothecia is carbonized supportive tissue about 5 μm thick . The paraphyses ( sterile filamentous hyphal cells ) are unbranched , threadlike ( filiform ) , gradually enlarge to a width of 2 @.@ 0 μm at the tip , and have granular contents . The thin @-@ walled cylindrical to club @-@ shaped asci ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are on a short stalk , and measure 70 – 105 by 8 – 10 μm ; each ascus contains eight ascospores . Ascospores , which measure 45 – 65 by 3 @.@ 0 μm , have a thin but distinct sheath , and lack septa ( cross @-@ walls ) . <unk> ( which appear before the apothecia mature ) are <unk> , lenticular ( having the shape of a double @-@ convex lens ) in cross section , 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 3 mm in diameter , and covered with a dark brown layer of cells . The <unk> are arranged in a basal layer , and borne on short conidiophores . They are slender and <unk> ( tapering to a point ) , lack a <unk> , and measure 5 – 10 by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 μm . The conidia are colorless , rod @-@ shaped , lack septa , and have dimensions of 4 – 5 by 1 @.@ 0 μm . 
 The putative anamorph form of C. dentatus has been described as Tricladiopsis flagelliformis . Grown on 2 % malt agar at standard conditions , it forms black @-@ centered colonies that have a growth rate of 7 cm per week . The conidia produced are thin and curved with a whip @-@ like shape . They have 13 – 20 septa , measure 65 – 135 by 2 – 3 @.@ 5 μm , and usually have a single branch ( typically about 45 μm long ) that appears before cells are released . 
 There are only a few species of <unk> known to have <unk> that do not function as <unk> ( non @-@ motile cells that function as a male gamete ) . Coccomyces dentatus is one of only two species that are known to have both a <unk> and a non @-@ <unk> state ( the other is <unk> rugosa ) . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The species is frequently confused with Coccomyces coronatus , which has inflated paraphyses , longer asci and ascospores , less regularly shaped apothecia , and rarely occurs on leaves of evergreens . It prefers to grow on well @-@ rotted leaves , and is found predominantly in northern Europe and eastern North America . C. <unk> is somewhat similar in appearance , but distinguished in the field by round to ellipsoid apothecia . C. australis has circinate ( rolled up with the tip in the center ) rather than filiform paraphyses , larger asci and somewhat larger ascospores ( 150 – 180 by 14 – 16 @.@ 5 μm and 60 – 75 by 2 @.@ 5 – 3 μm , respectively ) . Another lookalike species that is morphological quite similar to C. dentatus is C. kinabaluensis , found in the Malaysian state of Sabah . However , the latter can be distinguished by the following characters : three- to four @-@ sided <unk> ; ascospores with a single septum ; and longer , wider asci measuring 110 – 135 by 10 – 14 μm . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Coccomyces dentatus is a saprobic species , and grows on dead leaves of a wide variety of angiosperms . It is frequently encountered on members of the heather ( family Ericaceae ) , and the beech family ( Fagaceae ) , such as oak ( red , white , and live oak ) and chestnut , and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile . Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron , Lithocarpus , Berberis , Arbutus , Gaultheria , and Myrica . 
 Widely distributed and common , the fungus occurs predominantly in warm temperate areas . It has been found in Africa ( Tunisia ) , Europe , and the Americas . In the northern part of its range , it occurs in the summer and autumn , but in subtropical areas it can be found year @-@ round . Because of its wide geographical distribution , abundance , and conspicuousness , Coccomyces dentatus is the most often collected species of Coccomyces . 
 = Theramenes = 
 Theramenes ( / <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> ; died 404 BC ) was an Athenian statesman , prominent in the final decade of the Peloponnesian War . He was particularly active during the two periods of oligarchic government at Athens , as well as in the trial of the generals who had commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC . A moderate oligarch , he often found himself caught between the democrats on the one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other . Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC , he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC , and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed . 
 Theramenes was a central figure in four major episodes of Athenian history . He appeared on the scene in 411 BC as one of the leaders of an oligarchic coup , but , as his views and those of the coup 's other leaders diverged , he began to oppose their dictates and took the lead in replacing the narrow oligarchy they had imposed with a more broadly based one . He served as a general for several years after this , but was not reelected to that office in 407 BC . After the Battle of Arginusae , in which he served as a trierarch , he was assigned to rescue Athenian sailors from sinking ships , but was prevented from doing so by a storm . That incident prompted a massive furor at Athens , in which Theramenes had to exonerate himself from responsibility for the failed rescue ; the controversy ended in the execution of six generals who had commanded at that battle . After the Athenian defeat at Aegospotami in 405 BC , Theramenes arranged the terms by which Athens surrendered to Sparta . He then became a member of the narrow oligarchic government , known as the Thirty Tyrants , that Sparta imposed on its defeated rival . As he had in 411 BC , Theramenes soon came into conflict with the more extreme members of that government ; his protests against the reign of terror the Thirty implemented led the leading oligarchs to plot his demise ; he was denounced before the oligarchic assembly , and then , when that body appeared reluctant to punish him , struck him from the roster of citizens and executed him without trial . 
 Theramenes remained a controversial figure after his death ; Lysias vigorously denounced him while prosecuting several of his former political allies , but others defended his actions . Modern historical assessments have shifted over time ; in the 19th century , Theramenes 's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned , but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th @-@ century scholarship supported more positive assessments . Some historians have found in Theramenes a selfish opportunist , others a principled moderate . The details of his actions , his motivations , and his character continue to be debated down to the present day . 
 = = Historical record = = 
 No ancient biographies of Theramenes are known , but his life and actions are relatively well documented , due to the extensive treatment given him in several surviving works . The Attic orator Lysias deals with him at length in several of his speeches , albeit in a very hostile manner . Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories : Thucydides ' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes ' career , and Xenophon , picking up where Thucydides left off , gives a detailed account of several episodes from Theramenes career ; Diodorus Siculus , probably drawing his account from Ephorus at most points , provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon 's at several points . Theramenes also appears in several other sources , which , although they do not provide as many narrative details , have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes ' life and memory . 
 = = Family = = 
 Only the barest outlines of Theramenes ' life outside the public sphere have been preserved in the historical record . His father , <unk> had played a significant role in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes ' appearance on the scene . He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437 – 6 BC , had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War , and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias . <unk> 's career overlapped with his son 's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC . 
 = = Coup of 411 BC = = 
 = = = Overthrow of the democracy = = = 
 Theramenes ' first appearance in the historical record comes with his involvement in the oligarchic coup of 411 BC . In the wake of the Athenian defeat in Sicily , revolts began to break out among Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and the Peace of Nicias fell apart ; the Peloponnesian War resumed in full by 412 BC . In this context , a number of Athenian aristocrats , led by Peisander and with Theramenes prominent among their ranks , began to conspire to overthrow the city 's democratic government . This intrigue was initiated by the exiled nobleman Alcibiades , who was at that time acting as an assistant to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes . Claiming that he had great influence with Tissaphernes , Alcibiades promised to return to Athens , bringing Persian support with him , if the democracy that had exiled him were replaced with an oligarchy . Accordingly , a number of trierarchs and other leaders of the Athenian army at Samos began planning the overthrow of the democracy . They eventually dispatched Peisander to Athens , where , by promising that the return of Alcibiades and an alliance with Persia would follow if the Athenians would replace their democracy with an oligarchy , he persuaded the Athenian ecclesia to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades , authorized to make whatever arrangements were necessary . 
 Alcibiades , however , did not succeed in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians , and , to hide this fact , demanded ( claiming to be speaking for Tissaphernes ) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply . Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy , Peisander and his companions returned to Samos , where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city 's democracy . In Athens , meanwhile , a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation . 
 After making arrangements to their satisfaction at Samos the leaders of the conspiracy set sail for Athens . Among them was Theramenes ; Thucydides refers to him as " one of the leaders of the party that put down the democracy — an able speaker and a man with ideas . " Calling the assembly together , the conspirators proposed a series of measures by which the democracy was formally replaced with a government of 400 chosen men , who were to select and convene a larger body of 5 @,@ 000 as time went on . Shortly afterwards , the conspirators went , under arms , to the council chamber , where they ordered the democratic council to disperse after collecting their pay ; the council did as ordered , and from this point forward the mechanism of government was fully under the control of the oligarchic conspirators ; they quickly changed the laws to reflect the new form of government they had imposed . 
 = = = Conflict within the movement = = = 
 At this point , several conflicts began to develop that threatened the future of the new government at Athens . First , the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them . When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens , which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government , they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government . At Athens , meanwhile , a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs , with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of <unk> as the leader of the moderate faction . The extremist faction , led by Phrynicus , containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon , and dominant within the 400 , opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy , and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms . The moderates , on the other hand , although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens ' power , were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet , and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5 @,@ 000 , presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher . 
 Shortly after taking power , the extremist leaders of the revolution had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia , a dominant point in the entrance to the harbor of Piraeus , ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos . With internal dissent increasing , they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea , which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city 's corn supply . Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification , arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out , but to be handed over to the Spartans ; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance , as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action . Initially cautious ( as enemies of the regime had been executed before ) , Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events . First , a Peloponnesian fleet , ostensibly dispatched to assist anti @-@ Athenian forces on Euboea , was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese ; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia , in collaboration with the extremists . Second , an Athenian militiaman , apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government , assassinated Phrynichus , the leader of the extremist faction . He escaped , but his accomplice , an Argive , was captured ; the prisoner , under torture , refused to state the name of his employer . With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case , and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina ( a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus ) , Theramenes and his party decided to act . 
 Aristocrates , who was commanding a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus , arrested the extremist general Alexicles ; enraged , the extremist leaders of the 400 demanded action , and made a number of threats against Theramenes and his party . To their surprise , Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles ; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced , and Theramenes set out to Piraeus , sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist , Aristarchus . When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus , Aristarchus , in a rage , exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles . Theramenes feigned rage as well , but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea , he responded that if they wanted to pull it down , he thought that would be good . Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5 @,@ 000 to govern instead of the 400 , the hoplites set to work . Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes ' party , who wanted the 5 @,@ 000 to govern ; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy . Several days later , the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus , but , finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended , they sailed on to Euboea . Several days later , the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5 @,@ 000 ; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city . 
 = = In command = = 
 Under the government of the 5 @,@ 000 and under the democracy that replaced it in 410 BC , Theramenes served as a general for several years , commanding fleets in the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont . Shortly after the rise of the government of the 5 @,@ 000 , Theramenes set sail to the Hellespont to join Thrasybulus and the generals elected by the army at Samos . After the Athenian victory at Abydos , he took thirty triremes to attack the rebels on Euboea , who were building a causeway to Boeotia to provide land access to their island . Unable to stop the construction , he plundered the territory of several rebellious cities , then travelled around the Aegean suppressing oligarchies and raising funds from various cities of the Athenian Empire . He then took his fleet to Macedon , where he assisted the Macedonian king Archelaus in his siege of Pydna , but , with that siege dragging on , he sailed on to join Thrasybulus in Thrace . The fleet soon moved on from there to challenge Mindarus ' fleet , which had seized the city of Cyzicus . Theramenes commanded one wing of the Athenian fleet in the resulting Battle of Cyzicus , a decisive Athenian victory . In that battle , Alcibiades ( who had been recalled from exile by the fleet at Samos shortly after the coup ) led a decoy force that drew the Spartan fleet out into open water , while Thrasybulus and Theramenes , each commanding an independent squadron , cut off the Spartans ' retreat . Mindarus was forced to flee to a nearby beach , and vicious fighting ensued on land as the Athenians attempted to drag off the Spartan ships . Thrasybulus and Alcibiades kept the Spartans occupied while Theramenes joined up with the nearby Athenian land forces and then hurried to the rescue ; his arrival precipitated a total Athenian victory , in which all the Spartan ships were captured . In the wake of this victory , the Athenians captured Cyzicus and constructed a fort at Chrysopolis , from which they extracted a customs duty of one tenth on all ships passing through the Bosporus . Theramenes and another general remained at this fort with a garrison of thirty ships to oversee the collection of the duty . At Athens , meanwhile , the government of the 5 @,@ 000 was replaced by a restored democracy within a few months of this battle ; Donald Kagan has suggested that the absence of Theramenes , " the best spokesman for the moderates " , paved the way for this restoration . 
 According to Diodorus and Plutarch , Theramenes participated under the command of Alcibiades to the siege of Byzantium ( 408 BC ) , winning the battle against the <unk> army that was appointed to defend that city : Alcibiades was in command of the right wing , while Theramenes was in charge of the left one . 
 = = Arginusae = = 
 Theramenes remained a general through 407 BC , but , in that year , when the Athenian defeat at Notium led to the downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies , Theramenes was not reelected . In the next year , however , he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon , who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by <unk> . That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae , but in the wake of that battle Theramenes found himself in the middle of a massive controversy . At the end of the battle , the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps . Several pressing concerns presented themselves ; 50 Peloponnesian ships under <unk> remained at Mytilene , blockading Conon , and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well , but , at the same time , ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle . Accordingly , all eight generals , with the larger part of the fleet , set out for Mytilene , while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes , both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns , remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial . At this point , however , a severe storm blew up , and both of these forces were driven back to shore . <unk> escaped , and a great number of Athenian sailors — estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1 @,@ 000 to as many as 5 @,@ 000 — drowned . 
 Soon after the news of this public tragedy reached Athens , a massive controversy erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue . The public was furious over the loss of so many sailors , and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial , and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes , who had already returned to Athens , might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them , and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue . Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior ; in their defense , Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap ; the trierarchs were exonerated , and public anger now turned against the generals . All eight were deposed from office , and summoned back to Athens to stand trial . Two fled , but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them . 
 Diodorus notes that the generals committed a critical error by attempting to shift the blame onto Theramenes . " For , " he states , " although they could have had the help of Theramenes and his associates in the trial , men who both were able orators and had many friends and , most important of all , had been participants in the events relative to the battle , they had them , on the contrary , as adversaries and bitter accusers . " When the trial came , Theramenes ' numerous political allies were among the leaders of the faction seeking the generals ' conviction . A bitter series of debates and legal maneuvers ensued as the assembly fought over what to do with the generals . At first , it appeared that they might be treated leniently , but in the end , public displays of bereavement by the families of the deceased and aggressive prosecution by a politician named <unk> swung the opinion of the assembly ; the six generals were tried as a group and executed . The Athenian public , as the grief and anger prompted by the disaster cooled , came to regret their action , and for thousands of years historians and commentators have pointed to the incident as perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice the city 's government ever perpetrated . 
 = = Negotiating a peace = = 
 In 405 BC , the Athenian navy was defeated and destroyed by the Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander at the Battle of Aegospotami in the Hellespont . Without sufficient funds to build another fleet , the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city . <unk> by land and sea , with their food supplies running low , the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis , whose army was camped outside their walls , offering to join the Spartan alliance if they were allowed to keep their walls and port ; Agis , claiming that he had no power to negotiate , sent the ambassadors on to Sparta , but there they were told that , if they really wanted peace , they should bring the Spartans better proposals . The Athenians were initially intransigent , going so far as to imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted , but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises . In this situation , Theramenes , in a speech to the assembly , requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander ( who was at this time besieging Samos ) to determine the Spartans ' intentions towards Athens ; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians ' situation , although he declined to share it with the citizenry . His request was granted , and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander ; from there , he was sent to Sparta , perhaps stopping at Athens on the way . At Sparta , with representatives of all of Sparta 's allies present , Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War ; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down , the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited , and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta ; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use " the constitution of their ancestors " . Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly ; although some still favored holding out , the majority voted to accept the terms ; the Peloponnesian War , after 28 years , was at an end . 
 = = Thirty Tyrants = = 
 In the wake of Athens ' surrender , the long walls were torn down and the troops besieging the city returned to their various homes ; a Spartan garrison probably remained in Athens to supervise the dismantling of the walls ; Lysander sailed off to Samos to complete the siege of that city . Another clause of the treaty that had ended the war had allowed all exiles to return to Athens , and these men , many of them oligarchic agitators who had been cast out by the democracy , were hard at work in the months after the treaty . Five " overseers " were appointed by the members of the oligarchic social clubs to plan the transition to an oligarchy . In July 404 BC , they summoned Lysander back to Athens , where he supervised the change of government ; an oligarchic politician , <unk> , proposed in the council to place the government in the hands of thirty chosen men ; Theramenes supported this motion , and , with Lysander threatening to punish the Athenians for failing to dismantle the walls quickly enough unless they assented , it passed the assembly . Thirty men were selected : ten appointed by the " overseers " , ten chosen by Theramenes ( including himself ) , and ten picked by Lysander . 
 This government , which soon came to be known as the " Thirty Tyrants " for its excesses and atrocities , rapidly set about establishing its control over the city . The oligarchs , led by Critias , one of the " overseers " and a former exile , summoned a Spartan garrison to ensure their safety and then initiated a reign of terror , executing any men who they thought might possess sufficient initiative or a large enough following to effectively challenge them . It was this campaign that first drove a wedge between Theramenes and the leaders of the Thirty ; initially a supporter of Critias , Theramenes now argued that it was unnecessary to execute men who had shown no sign of wishing the oligarchy harm just because they had been popular under the democracy . This protest , however , failed to slow the pace of the executions , so Theramenes next argued that , if the oligarchy was to govern by force , it must at least expand its base ; fearful that Theramenes might lead a popular movement against them , Critias and the leaders of the Thirty issued a list of 3 @,@ 000 men who would be associates in the new government . When Theramenes again objected that this number was still too small , the leaders arranged for a military review to be staged after which the citizens were ordered to pile their arms ; with the help of the Spartan garrison , the oligarchs then confiscated all arms except those belonging to the 3 @,@ 000 . This , in turn , marked the beginning of even greater excesses ; to pay the Spartan garrison 's wages , Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic , or resident alien , and confiscate his property . Theramenes , protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy , refused to follow the order . 
 Critias and his compatriots , in the light of these events , decided that Theramenes had become an intolerable threat to their rule ; accordingly , speaking before the assembly of the 3 @,@ 000 , Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor , always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment . Famously , he branded him with the nickname " <unk> " , the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot ; Theramenes , he proclaimed , was ready to serve either the democratic or oligarchic cause , seeking only to further his own personal interest . In an impassioned response , Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent . He had always , he insisted , favored a moderate policy , neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy , and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher , who would be able to effectively serve the state . This speech had a substantial effect on the audience , and Critias saw that , if the case were brought to a vote , Theramenes would be acquitted . Accordingly , after conferring with the Thirty , Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes ' name from the roster of the 3 @,@ 000 , denying him his right to a trial . Theramenes , springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary , admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder , but to no avail ; the Eleven , keepers of the prison , entered , dragged him away , and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock . Theramenes , imitating a popular drinking game in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup , downed the poison and then flung the dregs to the floor , exclaiming " Here 's to the health of my beloved Critias ! " 
 = = Historiography = = 
 Theramenes lived a controversial life , and his death did not end the struggle over how to interpret his actions . In the years after his death , his reputation became an item of contention as former associates of his defended themselves against prosecutors under the restored democracy . ( The regime of the Thirty lasted only until 403 BC . ) It would appear that , as they defended themselves before democratic @-@ sympathizing Athenian jurymen , Theramenes ' former comrades in the oligarchy attempted to exculpate themselves by associating their actions with those of Theramenes and portraying him as a steadfast defender of the Athenian democracy ; examples of such accounts can be found in the Histories of Diodorus Siculus and in the " Theramenes papyrus " , a fragmentary work discovered in the 1960s . An example of the sort of attack this portrayal was intended to defend against can be found in two orations of Lysias , Against Eratosthenes and Against <unk> ; there , Theramenes is portrayed as treasonous and self @-@ interested , doing tremendous harm to the Athenian cause through his machinations . Xenophon adopts a similarly hostile attitude in the early parts of his work , but apparently had a change of heart during the chronological break in composition that divides the second book of the Hellenica ; his portrayal of Theramenes during the reign of the Thirty Tyrants is altogether more favorable than that of his earlier years . A final portrayal is offered by Aristotle , who , in his Constitution of the Athenians , portrays Theramenes as a moderate and a model citizen ; historians have disputed the origin of this account , with some treating it as a product of 4th @-@ century BC propaganda by a moderate " <unk> " party , while others , such as Phillip Harding , see no evidence for such a tradition and argue that Aristotle 's treatment of Theramenes is entirely a product of his own reassessment of the man . Diodorus Siculus , a historian active in the time of Caesar , presents a generally favorable account of Theramenes , which appears to be drawn from the noted historian Ephorus , who studied in Athens under Isocrates who was taught by Theramenes . 
 Theramenes ' reputation has undergone a dramatic shift since the 19th century , when Xenophon 's and Lysias ' unfavorable accounts were widely accepted , and Theramenes was <unk> as a turncoat and blamed for instigating the execution of the generals after Arginusae . The discovery of Aristotle 's Constitution of the Athenians in 1890 reversed this trend for the broad assessment of Theramenes ' character , and Diodorus ' account of the Arginusae trial has been preferred by scholars since Antony Andrewes undermined Xenophon 's account in the 1970s ; Diodorus ' more melodramatic passages , such as his elaborate presentation of Theramenes ' last moments , are still discounted , but he is now preferred on a number of issues , and on the Arginusae trial in particular . Aristophanes , in The Frogs , pokes fun at Theramenes ' ability to extricate himself from tight spots , but delivers none of the scathing rebukes one would expect for a politician whose role in the shocking events after Arginusae had been regarded as particularly blameworthy , and modern scholars have seen in this a more accurate depiction of how Theramenes was perceived in his time ; Lysias , meanwhile , who mercilessly attacks Theramenes on many counts , has nothing negative to say about the aftermath of Arginusae . 
 Recent works have generally accepted the image of Theramenes as a moderate , committed to the ideal of a hoplite @-@ based broad oligarchy . Donald Kagan has said of him that " ... his entire career reveals him to be a patriot and a true moderate , sincerely committed to a constitution granting power to the hoplite class , whether in the form of a limited democracy or a broadly based oligarchy " , while John Fine has noted that " like many a person following a middle course , he was hated by both political extremes . " The constitution of the 5 @,@ 000 is recognized as his political masterpiece ; his attempt to bring about a similar shift towards <unk> in 404 led directly to his death . That death , meanwhile , has become famous for its drama , and the story of Theramenes ' final moments has been repeated over and over throughout classical historiography . " Because he met his death defying a tyrant , " John Fine notes , " it is easy to idealize Theramenes . " In the millennia since his death , Theramenes has been both idealized and reviled ; his brief seven @-@ year career in the spotlight , touching as it did on all the major points of controversy in the last years of the Peloponnesian War , has been subject to myriad different interpretations . From the polemical contemporary works which describe his career have emerged the outlines of a complex figure , charting a dangerous course through the chaos of the late 5th @-@ century Athenian political scene ; although historians from ancient times to the present have offered far more specific portraits , of one form or another , it may be that nothing more than that outline will ever be known with certainty .

 = SMS Ostfriesland = 
 SMS Ostfriesland was the second vessel of the Helgoland class of battleships of the Imperial German Navy . Named for the region of East Frisia , Ostfriesland 's keel was laid in October 1908 at the Kaiserliche Werft dockyard in Wilhelmshaven . She was launched on 30 September 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 August 1911 . The ship was equipped with twelve 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns in six twin turrets , and had a top speed of 21 @.@ 2 knots ( 39 @.@ 3 km / h ; 24 @.@ 4 mph ) . Ostfriesland was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career , including World War I. 
 Along with her three sister ships , Helgoland , Thüringen , and Oldenburg , Ostfriesland participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the North Sea against the British Grand Fleet . This included the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , the largest naval battle of the war . The ship also saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy . She was present during the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . 
 After the German collapse in November 1918 , most of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations . The four Helgoland @-@ class ships were allowed to remain in Germany , however , and were therefore spared the destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow . Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations ; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy . She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Ostfriesland was ordered by the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) under the provisional name Ersatz Oldenburg , as a replacement for the old coastal defense ship Oldenburg . The contract for the ship was awarded to the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Dockyard ) in Wilhelmshaven under construction number 31 . Work began on 19 October 1908 with the laying of her keel , and the ship was launched less than a year later , on 30 September 1909 . She was christened by the Princess of <unk> and Knyphausen , a representative of the oldest East Frisian nobility . Fitting @-@ out , including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament , lasted until August 1911 . Ostfriesland , named for the north @-@ western coastal area of Germany , was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 August 1911 , just under three years from when work commenced , at a cost of 43 @.@ 579 million gold marks . 
 The ship was 167 @.@ 2 m ( 548 ft 7 in ) long , had a beam of 28 @.@ 5 m ( 93 ft 6 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 94 m ( 29 ft 4 in ) , and displaced 24 @,@ 700 metric tons ( 24 @,@ 310 long tons ) at full load . She was powered by three 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines with 15 boilers ; each engine drove a four @-@ bladed screw . The ship 's engines were rated at 28 @,@ 000 PS ( 28 @,@ 000 ihp ; 21 @,@ 000 kW ) and produced a top speed of 21 @.@ 2 knots ( 39 @.@ 3 km / h ; 24 @.@ 4 mph ) . Ostfriesland stored up to 3 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 100 long tons ) of coal , which allowed her to steam for 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . After 1915 the boilers were modified to spray oil on the coal ; the ship could carry up to 197 metric tons ( 194 long tons ) of fuel oil . She had a crew of 42 officers and 1 @,@ 071 enlisted men . 
 Ostfriesland was armed with a main battery of twelve 30 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 50 guns in six twin gun turrets , with one turret fore , one aft , and two on each flank of the ship . The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 45 guns and fourteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 45 guns . After 1914 , two of the 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were removed and replaced by 8 @.@ 8 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns . Ostfriesland was also armed with six 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) submerged torpedo tubes . Her main armored belt was 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick in the central portion , and was composed of Krupp cemented armor ( KCA ) . Her main battery gun turrets were protected by the same thickness of KCA armor on the sides and faces , as well as the barbettes that supported the turrets . Ostfriesland 's deck was 63 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 50 in ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After commissioning , Ostfriesland conducted sea trials , which were completed by 15 September . Kapitän zur See ( KzS ) Walter Engelhardt served as the ship 's first commanding officer . On the 22nd , the ship was formally assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . She then conducted individual ship training exercises , which were followed by I Squadron , and then fleet maneuvers in November . Ostfriesland became the new squadron flagship on 24 April 1912 , replacing Westfalen . The annual summer cruise in July – August , which typically went to Norway , was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis . As a result , the cruise only went into the Baltic . Ostfriesland and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship , squadron , and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peacetime . Ostfriesland won the 1912 / 1913 <unk> — the Kaiser 's artillery shooting prize — for I Squadron . Kapitänleutnant Friedrich <unk> was the ship 's gunnery officer at the time and , as such , was responsible for the accuracy of the ship 's shooting . 
 On 14 July 1914 , the annual summer cruise to Norway began . During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy , the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July . The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany , as a result of Austria @-@ Hungary 's ultimatum to Serbia . On the 27th , the entire fleet assembled off Cape <unk> before returning to port , where it remained at a heightened state of readiness . War between Austria @-@ Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th , and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict . By 29 July Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron was back in Wilhelmshaven . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 The first major naval action in the North Sea , the Battle of Helgoland Bight , took place on 28 August 1914 . At 04 : 30 , Helgoland , which was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge , received the order to join Ostfriesland and sail out of the harbor . At 05 : 00 , the two battleships met the battered cruisers Frauenlob and Stettin . By 07 : 30 , the ships had returned to port for the night . On the afternoon of 7 September , Ostfriesland and the rest of the High Seas Fleet conducted a training cruise to the island of Heligoland . In October , Ostfriesland was equipped with a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm flak guns for anti @-@ air defense . 
 Ostfriesland was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea , which took place on 2 – 3 November 1914 . No British forces were encountered during the operation . A second operation followed on 15 – 16 December . This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , the commander of the High Seas Fleet . Admiral von Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Konteradmiral ( Rear Admiral ) Franz von Hipper 's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet . Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby . That evening , the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts — including Ostfriesland and her three sisters — and eight pre @-@ dreadnoughts came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . However , skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet . Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily , von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany . 
 The Battle of Dogger Bank , in which Vice Admiral David Beatty 's 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons ambushed the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group , occurred on 24 January 1915 . Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers ; I Squadron left port at 12 : 33 CET , along with the pre @-@ dreadnoughts of II Squadron . They were too late , however , and failed to locate any British forces . By 19 : 05 , the fleet had returned to the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven . In the meantime , the armored cruiser Blücher had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk , while the battlecruiser Seydlitz was severely damaged by a fire in one of the ammunition magazines . As a result , Kaiser Wilhelm II removed von Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral Hugo von Pohl on 2 February . 
 The eight I Squadron ships went into the Baltic on 22 February 1915 for unit training , which lasted until 13 March . Following their return to the North Sea , the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29 – 30 March , 17 – 18 April , 21 – 22 April , 17 – 18 May , and 29 – 30 May . Ostfriesland and the rest of the fleet remained in port until 4 August , when I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers . That month , KzS Ernst @-@ <unk> von Natzmer replaced Engelhardt as the ship 's commanding officer . From the Baltic , the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces in August 1915 . The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships , the battlecruisers Von der Tann , Moltke , and Seydlitz , several light cruisers , 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers . The plan called for channels in Russian minefields to be swept so that the Russian naval presence , which included the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Slava , could be eliminated . The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf . Ostfriesland and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of the operation . The dreadnoughts Nassau and Posen were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy Slava , though they failed to sink the old battleship . After three days , the Russian minefields had been cleared , and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August , but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day . By 26 August , I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven . 
 On 23 – 24 October , the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of Admiral von Pohl , though it ended without contact with British forces . By January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened von Pohl to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties , and he was replaced by Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Reinhard Scheer in January . Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet ; he received approval from the Kaiser in February . Scheer 's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5 – 7 March , followed by two more on 21 – 22 March and 25 – 26 March . During Scheer 's next operation , Ostfriesland supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force . The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10 : 55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13 : 40 . The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target , and had to withdraw . The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed but , during the approach to Yarmouth , encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force . A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew . Reports of British submarines in the area prompted I Scouting Group to retreat . At this point , Scheer , who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow , also withdrew to safer German waters . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 Ostfriesland was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland , which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916 . The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate . During the operation , Ostfriesland was the lead ship in I Squadron 's I Division and the ninth ship in the line , directly astern of the fleet flagship Friedrich der Grosse and ahead of her sister Thüringen . I Squadron was the center of the German line , behind the eight König- and Kaiser @-@ class battleships of III Squadron . The six elderly pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions — II Battle Squadron — formed the rear of the formation . Ostfriesland flew the flag of Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Erhardt Schmidt , the squadron commander during the battle and Scheer 's deputy commander . 
 Shortly before 16 : 00 , the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty . The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of Indefatigable , shortly after 17 : 00 , and Queen Mary , less than half an hour later . By this time , the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet . At 17 : 30 , the crew of the leading German battleship , König , spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching . The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard , while the British ships steamed to port . At 17 : 45 , Scheer ordered a two @-@ point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers and , a minute later , the order to open fire was given . 
 While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron , Ostfriesland and ten other battleships fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron . Ostfriesland , Kaiser , and Nassau engaged the cruiser Southampton , though only Nassau scored a hit . After about 15 minutes , Ostfriesland shifted fire to Birmingham and Nottingham , though again failed to hit her targets . Shortly after 19 : 15 , the British dreadnought Warspite came into range ; Ostfriesland opened fire at 19 : 25 with her main battery guns , at ranges of 10 @,@ 800 to 15 @,@ 000 yd ( 9 @,@ 900 to 13 @,@ 700 m ) . Ostfriesland claimed hits from her third and fourth salvos . Warspite was hit by a total of thirteen heavy shells during this period . 
 By 20 : 15 , the German battle line had faced the entire deployed Grand Fleet a second time . Scheer ordered a 180 @-@ degree turn at 20 : 17 , which was covered by a charge by the battlecruiser squadron and a torpedo @-@ boat attack . In order to hasten the maneuver , Schmidt ordered Ostfriesland to turn immediately without waiting for Thüringen behind him . This move caused some difficulty for the III Squadron ships ahead , though the ships quickly returned to their stations . At around 23 : 30 , the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation . Ostfriesland was the eighth ship , stationed toward the front of the 24 @-@ ship line . An hour later , the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued . Sometime around 01 : 10 , the armored cruiser Black Prince stumbled into the German line . Thüringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30 @.@ 5 cm rounds into the ship . Ostfriesland fired with her 15 cm guns and Kaiser fired both 30 @.@ 5 cm and 15 cm guns . In the span of less than a minute , two massive explosions tore the cruiser apart and killed the entire 857 @-@ man crew . 
 Despite the ferocity of the night fighting , the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4 : 00 on 1 June . At 06 : 20 , however , Ostfriesland struck a mine , previously laid by the destroyer HMS Abdiel on 4 May , on her starboard side . The ship hauled out of line , as the explosion was initially thought to have been a torpedo fired by a submarine . Ostfriesland fell behind the fleet and steamed at slow speed , screened by the destroyers V3 , V5 , and briefly by G11 . By 10 : 40 , the battleship had increased speed to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Her anti @-@ submarine escort was eventually reinforced by a floatplane , which spotted what it believed to be a British submarine at 12 : 20 . Ostfriesland turned away , which caused the torpedo bulkhead , damaged slightly by the mine explosion , to tear open . More water entered the ship and caused a 4 @.@ 75 degree list to starboard , forcing Ostfriesland to reduce speed again . The ship requested assistance from a pumping ship at 14 : 20 , but by 14 : 45 the flooding was under control and the ship passed the Outer Jade Lightship . She was able to increase speed gradually to 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , and at 18 : 15 she reached port in Wilhelmshaven . The mine tore a hole that measured 40 ft × 16 ft ( 12 @.@ 2 m × 4 @.@ 9 m ) and allowed 500 t ( 490 long tons ) of water into the ship . Further flooding occurred after the torpedo bulkhead damage at 12 : 20 , though the full damage report has not survived . Ostfriesland was drydocked in Wilhelmshaven for repairs , which lasted until 26 July . In the course of the battle , Ostfriesland fired 111 rounds from her main battery , 101 shells from her 15 cm guns , and a single 8 @.@ 8 cm shell . The only damage sustained was the mine that was struck on the morning of 1 June , which killed one man and wounded ten . 
 = = = = Later operations = = = = 
 On 18 August 1916 , Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation . The two serviceable German battlecruisers , Moltke and Von der Tann , supported by three dreadnoughts , were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty 's battlecruisers . The rest of the fleet , including Ostfriesland , would trail behind and provide cover . On the approach to the English coast , Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area . As a result , the bombardment was not carried out , and by 14 : 35 , Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet 's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports . 
 On 25 – 26 September , Ostfriesland and the rest of I Squadron provided support for a sweep out to the Terschelling Bank conducted by the II Führer der Torpedoboote ( Leader of Torpedo Boats ) . Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18 – 20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank . For the majority of 1917 , Ostfriesland was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight . During Operation Albion , the amphibious assault on the Russian @-@ held islands in the Gulf of Riga , Ostfriesland and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene . On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek , and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th . On 2 November the operation was completed and Ostfriesland and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea . In March 1918 , Natzmer was replaced as the ship 's commander by KzS Hans Herr . A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23 – 24 April 1918 . Ostfriesland , Thüringen , and Nassau were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein , a planned occupation of St. Petersburg . The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August , but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled . The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 Ostfriesland and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918 , days before the Armistice was to take effect . The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet ; Scheer — by now the Großadmiral ( Grand Admiral ) of the fleet — intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to improve Germany 's bargaining position , despite the expected casualties . But many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of the 29th , sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . Informed of the situation , the Kaiser stated " I no longer have a navy " . On 16 December , Ostfriesland was decommissioned and used as a barracks ship . 
 Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918 , most of the High Seas Fleet , under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow . Only the most modern ships were sent for internment ; the four Helgoland @-@ class ships were left in Germany . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships . In the span of a few hours , ten battleships and five battlecruisers sank in the shallow waters of Scapa Flow . KzS Karl <unk> served as Ostfriesland 's final commander , until she was stricken from the navy list on 5 November 1919 . She was then surrendered to the Allies as " H " as a replacement for the ships that had been scuttled . The ship remained in Germany until 7 April 1920 , when a German crew took her to Rosyth . She was ceded to the United States as war reparations , and on 9 April an American crew arrived to bring her to the US . 
 In July 1921 , the Army Air Service and the US Navy conducted a series of bombing tests off Cape Hatteras , led by General Billy Mitchell . The targets included demobilized American and former German warships , including the old battleship Iowa , the cruiser Frankfurt , and finally Ostfriesland on 20 July . At 13 : 30 ET , the first attack wave , armed with 230 lb ( 100 kg ) bombs , struck the stationary ship . Eight of thirty @-@ three bombs found their mark , after which the ship was inspected . The second wave was also armed with 230 lb bombs , and the third and fourth carried 600 lb ( 270 kg ) bombs . Five 600 lb bombs found their mark , but little damage was done to the ship 's topside . The bombs that nearly missed the ship , however , had done significant underwater damage to the hull , which allowed some flooding and created a list of five degrees to port and three additional feet of draft at the stern . The bombing schedule was interrupted by a storm in the late afternoon . 
 Early on the morning of 21 July , the fifth wave of bombers began their attack . At 08 : 52 , the first Army bomber dropped a 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) bomb that hit the ship ; four more bombers followed and scored two further hits . Inspectors again went aboard Ostfriesland following the fifth attack and noted that the hits had not seriously damaged the ship , though one had created a large hole on her starboard side that allowed further flooding . By noon , she was down five feet at the stern and one foot at the bow . At 12 : 19 , the next attack wave , equipped with 2 @,@ 000 lb ( 910 kg ) bombs , struck . Six bombs were dropped , none of which hit , though three detonated very close to the hull . At 12 : 30 , Ostfriesland began to sink rapidly by the stern and the list to port increased dramatically . At 12 : 40 , the ship rolled over and sank . The results of the tests were widely publicized and Mitchell became both a national hero and the " infallible prophet of aviation " . 
 The leadership of the US Navy , however , was outraged by Mitchell 's handling of the tests ; the 2 @,@ 000 lb bombs had not been sanctioned by the Navy , which had set the rules for the engagement . Mitchell 's bombers had also not allowed inspectors aboard the ship between bombing runs as stipulated by the Navy . The joint Army – Navy report on the tests , issued a month later and signed by General John Pershing , stated that " the battleship is still the backbone of the fleet . " Mitchell wrote his own , contradictory account of the tests , which was then leaked to the press . The sinking of the battleship sparked great controversy in the American public sphere ; Mitchell 's supporters exaggerated the significance of the tests by falsely claiming Ostfriesland to be an unsinkable " super @-@ battleship " and that " old sea dogs ... wept aloud . " Senator William Borah argued that the tests had rendered battleships obsolete . Mitchell was widely supported in the press , though his increasingly combative tactics eventually resulted in a court @-@ martial for insubordination that forced him to retire from the military . 
 = Parliament House ( Malta ) = 
 The Parliament House ( Maltese : Il @-@ Parlament il @-@ <unk> , meaning " The New Parliament " ) is the meeting place of the Parliament of Malta located in Valletta , Malta . The building was constructed between 2011 and 2015 to designs by Renzo Piano as part of the City Gate Project , which also included building a new City Gate and converting the ruins of the Royal Opera House into an open @-@ air theatre . Construction of the Parliament House generated considerable controversy , mainly due to the modern design of the building and the cost of construction , which amounted to around € 90 million . 
 From 1921 to 1976 , the meeting place of the Parliament of Malta had been the Tapestry Chamber of the Grandmaster 's Palace , also in Valletta . In 1976 , the former armoury of the same palace was converted into a new parliament , and meetings were held there until the opening of the purpose @-@ built Parliament House on 4 May 2015 . 
 = = Site = = 
 Parliament House is located in Republic Street near City Gate , the entrance to Valletta . The building is located adjacent to Saint James Cavalier and the ruins of the Royal Opera House , and opposite the City Gate Shopping Arcade and Palazzo <unk> . 
 The site presently occupied by the Parliament House was originally built up with houses , and later the Valletta Station of the Malta Railway . The area was bombarded during World War II , and the station and surrounding buildings were demolished in the 1960s as part of a project to redevelop the entrance to Valletta . The area was converted into an open space known as Freedom Square ( Maltese : <unk> il @-@ <unk> ) , which was surrounded by a shopping arcade . The square was rather plain , and was commonly used as a car park .

 The building of the Parliament House was a part of the City Gate Project , which was meant to redevelop the entrance of Valletta . The project consisted of the demolition of the fourth City Gate and the Freedom Square Arcade and the construction of the fifth City Gate and the Parliament House . In addition , the ruins of the Royal Opera House were converted into an open @-@ air theatre known as <unk> <unk> <unk> . The City Gate project was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano , and the plans were revealed on 27 June 2009 . The Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation paid Piano € 6 @.@ 6 million for his work on the project . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The building of the Parliament House , along with the rest of the City Gate project , was controversial . Critics considered it an unnecessary project , proposing to restore Fort Saint Elmo or one of the large dilapidated palaces in the city and converting it into a parliament building , for a fraction of the cost of constructing a new building . Some argued that the square should not have been built up as it was one of the few open spaces in Valletta . Others attacked the modern design of the structure itself , including the Labour MP Carmelo Abela , who called the Parliament House " an ugly building built on stilts " . The building 's design , precisely the system of cladding , was compared to a dovecote ( Maltese : <unk> tal @-@ <unk> ) and to a cheese grater by the general public . The ultramodern design that contrasts much with the rest of Valletta has went as far as the UNESCO questioning the city 's title as a World Heritage Site . In 2015 the building caught the attention of The Telegraph , among few other buildings and structures , and featured as potentially the best or worst building of that year . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The demolition of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010 . Excavation works for the foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete . In early 2011 , the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase , the extension of one of the blocks , and changes in the design of the louvers on the facade . Construction started later that year , and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012 . At this point , it began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo , and cut into specific shapes in Italy , before being sent back to Malta . Between 120 and 150 workers were on the construction site every day , and it cost more than € 90 million to build . 
 The completion date of the project was originally given as November 2012 or early 2013 . The estimated completion date was extended to September 2013 , and later to September 2014 . Contractors failed to meet deadlines , and the building was still not complete by the end of 2014 . It was eventually completed in 2015 . 
 = = = Inauguration = = = 
 The Parliament House was officially inaugurated by President Marie Louise <unk> <unk> on 4 May 2015 . Members of Parliament and other guests gathered at the old chamber at the Grandmaster 's Palace , and walked to the new building accompanied by the police force band . <unk> <unk> called the inauguration of the Parliament House " a milestone in Malta 's parliamentary history " , since this is the first purpose @-@ built parliament building in Malta . The first sitting was held later the same day . 
 Most of the building is closed off for security reasons , but a permanent exhibition on the ground floor is open to the public . 
 On 1 August 2015 , Piano visited the Parliament House for the first time since its inauguration . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Parliament House consists of two blocks connected together with bridges , one of which houses the chamber of parliament . The two blocks are separate so as not to obscure views of Saint James Cavalier from Republic Street . Each block has three floors . The structure consists of a steel frame clad in <unk> limestone . The stone slabs are carved in such a way that they seem to have been eroded by nature . 
 Parliament House is a zero emission building since heat energy is recovered from or given off to the mass of rock below . This is used to heat and cool the building , avoiding any cooling towers or boilers . 
 = Stellar rotation = 
 Stellar rotation is the angular motion of a star about its axis . The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star , or by timing the movements of active features on the surface . 
 The rotation of a star produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force . As stars are not solid bodies , they can also undergo differential rotation . Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes . These differences in the rate of rotation within a star may have a significant role in the generation of a stellar magnetic field . 
 The magnetic field of a star interacts with the stellar wind . As the wind moves away from the star its rate of angular velocity slows . The magnetic field of the star interacts with the wind , which applies a drag to the stellar rotation . As a result , angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind , and over time this gradually slows the star 's rate of rotation . 
 = = Measurement = = 
 Unless a star is being observed from the direction of its pole , sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer . The component of movement that is in the direction of the observer is called the radial velocity . For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer , the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift . Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency . When the absorption lines of a star are observed , this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden . However , this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width . 
 The component of the radial velocity observed through line broadening depends on the inclination of the star 's pole to the line of sight . The derived value is given as <formula> , where ve is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination . However , i is not always known , so the result gives a minimum value for the star 's rotational velocity . That is , if i is not a right angle , then the actual velocity is greater than <formula> . This is sometimes referred to as the projected rotational velocity . 
 For giant stars , the atmospheric <unk> can result in line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational , effectively drowning out the signal . However , an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events . These occur when a massive object passes in front of the more distant star and functions like a lens , briefly magnifying the image . The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of <unk> to be distinguished from rotation . 
 If a star displays magnetic surface activity such as starspots , then these features can be tracked to estimate the rotation rate . However , such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes over the course of their life span , so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements . Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation , so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars . Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star , as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star . 
 = = Physical effects = = 
 = = = Equatorial bulge = = = 
 Gravity tends to contract celestial bodies into a perfect sphere , the shape where all the mass is as close to the center of gravity as possible . But a rotating star is not spherical in shape , it has an equatorial bulge . 
 As a rotating proto @-@ stellar disk contracts to form a star its shape becomes more and more spherical , but the contraction doesn 't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere . At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction , but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force . The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape , in the sense that the effective gravity in the equatorial region ( being diminished ) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape . The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator , as described by the von Zeipel theorem . 
 An extreme example of an equatorial bulge is found on the star Regulus A ( α Leonis A ) . The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317 ± 3 km / s . This corresponds to a rotation period of 15 @.@ 9 hours , which is 86 % of the velocity at which the star would break apart . The equatorial radius of this star is 32 % larger than polar radius . Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae , Pleione , Vega and Achernar . 
 The break @-@ up velocity of a star is an expression that is used to describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force . For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value . 
 = = = Differential rotation = = = 
 Surface differential rotation is observed on stars such as the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude . Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude . However the reverse has also been observed , such as on the star designated HD <unk> . The first such star , other than the Sun , to have its differential rotation mapped in detail is AB Doradus . 
 The underlying mechanism that causes differential rotation is turbulent convection inside a star . Convective motion carries energy toward the surface through the mass movement of plasma . This mass of plasma carries a portion of the angular velocity of the star . When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation , the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow . 
 The interfaces between regions with sharp differences in rotation are believed to be efficient sites for the dynamo processes that generate the stellar magnetic field . There is also a complex interaction between a star 's rotation distribution and its magnetic field , with the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy modifying the velocity distribution . 
 = = Rotation braking = = 
 = = = During formation = = = 
 Stars are believed to form as the result of a collapse of a low @-@ temperature cloud of gas and dust . As the cloud collapses , conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase , forcing the material into a rotating disk . At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms , which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse . 
 As the collapse continues , the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator . Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100 @,@ 000 years to avoid this scenario . One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar 's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking . The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar . 
 Most main @-@ sequence stars with a spectral class between <unk> and F5 have been found to rotate rapidly . For stars in this range , the measured rotation velocity increases with mass . This increase in rotation peaks among young , massive B @-@ class stars . As the expected life span of a star decreases with increasing mass , this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age . 
 = = = After formation = = = 
 For main @-@ sequence stars , the decline in rotation can be approximated by a mathematical relation : 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the angular velocity at the equator and t is the star 's age . This relation is named <unk> 's law after Andrew P. <unk> who discovered it in 1972 . <unk> is the determination of a star 's age based on the rotation rate , calibrated using the Sun . 
 Stars slowly lose mass by the emission of a stellar wind from the photosphere . The star 's magnetic field exerts a torque on the ejected matter , resulting in a steady transfer of angular momentum away from the star . Stars with a rate of rotation greater than 15 km / s also exhibit more rapid mass loss , and consequently a faster rate of rotation decay . Thus as the rotation of a star is slowed because of braking , there is a decrease in rate of loss of angular momentum . Under these conditions , stars gradually approach , but never quite reach , a condition of zero rotation . 
 = = Close binary systems = = 
 A close binary star system occurs when two stars orbit each other with an average separation that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters . At these distances , more complex interactions can occur , such as tidal effects , transfer of mass and even collisions . Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters . The total angular momentum of the system is conserved , but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates . 
 Each of the members of a close binary system raises tides on the other through gravitational interaction . However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction . Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge , resulting in the transfer of angular momentum ( tidal acceleration ) . This causes the system to steadily evolve , although it can approach a stable equilibrium . The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane . 
 For contact or semi @-@ detached binaries , the transfer of mass from a star to its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum . The accreting companion can spin up to the point where it reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator . 
 = = Degenerate stars = = 
 After a star has finished generating energy through thermonuclear fusion , it evolves into a more compact , degenerate state . During this process the dimensions of the star are significantly reduced , which can result in a corresponding increase in angular velocity . 
 = = = White dwarf = = = 
 A white dwarf is a star that consists of material that is the by @-@ product of thermonuclear fusion during the earlier part of its life , but lacks the mass to burn those more massive elements . It is a compact body that is supported by a quantum mechanical effect known as electron degeneracy pressure that will not allow the star to collapse any further . Generally most white dwarfs have a low rate of rotation , most likely as the result of rotational braking or by shedding angular momentum when the progenitor star lost its outer envelope . ( See planetary nebula . ) 
 A slow @-@ rotating white dwarf star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1 @.@ 44 solar masses without collapsing to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova . Once the white dwarf reaches this mass , such as by accretion or collision , the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons . If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly , however , the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region , thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit . Such rapid rotation can occur , for example , as a result of mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum . 
 = = = Neutron star = = = 
 A neutron star is a highly dense remnant of a star that is primarily composed of neutrons — a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge . The mass of a neutron star is in the range of 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 1 times the mass of the Sun . As a result of the collapse , a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation ; on the order of a hundred rotations per second . 
 Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that have a magnetic field . A narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars . If the beam sweeps past the direction of the Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that can be detected from the Earth . The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate , so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse . 
 = = = Black hole = = = 
 A black hole is an object with a gravitational field that is sufficiently powerful that it can prevent light from escaping . When they are formed from the collapse of a rotating mass , they retain all of the angular momentum that is not shed in the form of ejected gas . This rotation causes the space within an oblate spheroid @-@ shaped volume , called the " ergosphere " , to be dragged around with the black hole . Mass falling into this volume gains energy by this process and some portion of the mass can then be ejected without falling into the black hole . When the mass is ejected , the black hole loses angular momentum ( the " Penrose process " ) . The rotation rate of a black hole has been measured as high as 98 @.@ 7 % of the speed of light . 
 = Gilbert de Lacy = 
 Gilbert de Lacy ( died after 1163 ) was a medieval Anglo @-@ Norman baron in England , the grandson of Walter de Lacy who died in 1085 . Gilbert 's father forfeited his English lands in 1096 , and Gilbert initially only inherited the lands in Normandy . The younger de Lacy spent much of his life trying to recover his father 's English lands , and eventually succeeded . Around 1158 , de Lacy became a Templar and went to the Holy Land , where he was one of the commanders against Nur ad @-@ Din in the early 1160s . He died after 1163 .

 Gilbert de Lacy was the son of Roger de Lacy , who in turn was the son of Walter de Lacy who died in 1085 . Roger de Lacy was banished from England in 1096 , and his estates were confiscated . These lands , which included substantial holdings along the border with Wales , were given to Pain fitzJohn , Josce de Dinan and Miles of Gloucester . Roger de Lacy 's lands in Normandy , however , were not confiscated , as they were held of the Bishop of Bayeux in feudal tenure . 
 = = Stephen 's reign = = 
 Gilbert de Lacy had inherited his father 's lands in Normandy by 1133 , and by 1136 was in England with King Stephen of England . Although de Lacy recovered some of his father 's lands , the border lands near Wales were not recovered . Among the lands Gilbert recovered were lands about Weobley . He also was granted some lands in Yorkshire that had been in dispute . 
 Although de Lacy had spent time at Stephen 's court , during the civil war that occurred during Stephen 's reign , he switched sides and served Stephen 's rival , Matilda the Empress . In 1138 , he was besieged by the king at Weobley along with his cousin Geoffrey Talbot , but both men escaped when the king took the castle in June . De Lacy also led an army in an attack against Bath in the service of the Empress , along with Geoffrey Talbot , which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war . 
 De Lacy witnessed charters of the Empress in 1141 . During the later 1140s , de Lacy was able to recover many of his father 's Welsh marcher lands , and one of his efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn . He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands , and during Stephen 's reign were generally on opposite sides of the succession dispute . In June 1153 , de Lacy was in the company of Matilda 's son , Henry fitzEmpress , who became King Henry II of England in 1154 . 
 De Lacy gave land to the cathedral chapter of Hereford Cathedral . He also gave a manor at Guiting to the Knights Templar and two churches , at Weobley and <unk> to Llanthony Priory , which was a monastery founded by his family . 
 = = Later years and death = = 
 Around 1158 de Lacy surrendered his lands to his eldest son Robert when the elder de Lacy became a member of the Knights Templar . He then travelled through France to Jerusalem , where de Lacy became precentor of the Templars in the County of Tripoli . In 1163 , de Lacy was one of the crusader army commanders fighting against Nur ad @-@ Din . His year of death is unknown , but he was commemorated on 20 November at Hereford Cathedral . Robert died without children sometime before 1162 , when Gilbert 's younger son Hugh de Lacy inherited the lands . 
 The Gesta Stephani called de Lacy " a man of judgement and shrewd and painstaking in every operation of war " . 
 = Interstate 155 ( Illinois ) = 
 Interstate 155 ( I @-@ 155 ) is a north – south spur of Interstate 55 that provides an interstate connection for the Illinois cities of Peoria and Lincoln . The northern terminus for the interstate is just east of Peoria , at Interstate 74 exit 101 in Morton . The southern terminus , which is northwest of Lincoln , is located on I @-@ 55 at exit 127 . The interstate is 32 @.@ 13 miles ( 51 @.@ 71 km ) long . 
 I @-@ 155 was created to replace Illinois Route 121 ( abbreviated IL 121 ) . Prompted by safety concerns at a major intersection near Morton , state transportation officials replaced the entire route with a limited @-@ access freeway . The interstate was built in several segments from 1970 to 1992 , a period that included a ten @-@ year delay due to a lawsuit over right @-@ of @-@ way . I @-@ 155 fully opened to traffic on October 29 , 1992 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Interstate 155 runs north from Interstate 55 just northwest of Lincoln , intersecting U.S. Route 136 east of Emden . 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of U.S. 136 , eastbound Illinois Route 122 joins I @-@ 155 traveling north , directly east of Delavan . The two highways run concurrent for 4 miles ( 6 km ) before Illinois 122 runs east to Hopedale . Further north , the highway crosses the Mackinaw River beside a steel truss bridge serving old Illinois Route 121 . 
 East of Tremont , I @-@ 155 intersects Illinois Route 9 . 4 miles ( 6 km ) later is Main Street , the first of three northbound exits to Morton . ( There are only two southbound exits , at Queenwood Road and Illinois Route 98 – Birchwood Street ) . The highway passes to the west of Morton before intersecting Interstate 74 at a trumpet interchange about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of downtown Peoria . 
 Surrounded mostly by prime land used for farming soybeans and corn , Interstate 155 is a four @-@ lane freeway through rural central Illinois . In addition to Morton , Peoria , and Lincoln , I @-@ 155 also serves a number of small farm towns located between Peoria and Lincoln . The largest city directly served by I @-@ 155 is Tremont ; however , the highway mainly carries traffic traveling to and from Peoria and Springfield . 
 = = History = = 
 I @-@ 155 was built on the right @-@ of @-@ way of former IL 121 . In the early 1960s , the department of transportation opened IL 98 , an east – west two @-@ lane highway running west from downtown Morton to Pekin . Within a few years , the intersection of IL 98 and IL 121 would be known as the " Killer Corner , " as traffic volumes increased between Springfield and Peoria on IL 121 . Between when IL 98 was opened and when the corner was closed in 1989 for construction of a full interchange , 15 people were killed as a result of automobile accidents at the corner . Led by key supporters — U.S. Representative Robert Michel , former Illinois Department of Transportation ( IDOT ) transportation engineer Jack Harland , and pro @-@ freeway organization " Route 121 by ' 91 " chairman Jim <unk> — IDOT initiated plans to upgrade IL 121 to a four @-@ lane freeway . Near Hopedale , a short portion of IL 121 was reconstructed in the early 1970s to replace a bridge over the Mackinaw River . The interchange with I @-@ 55 was built , but barricaded to traffic . 
 In 1976 , an injunction won by Peoria attorney Timothy Swain Sr. halted further construction on the highway for ten years . The lawsuit was filed by Swain regarding the amount of right @-@ of @-@ way the freeway would consume on his 440 acre ( 178 hectare ) farm near Delavan . A U.S. District Court judge sided with IDOT on building the road , but the U.S. Seventh District Court of Appeals overturned the decision , forcing IDOT to rewrite its environmental impact statement regarding the Swain farm . In 1986 IDOT struck a deal with Swain , agreeing to reroute the road and take only 40 acres ( 16 hectares ) of land , ending the lawsuit and resuming construction activities . A portion of the road from I @-@ 55 to Hartsburg opened on December 15 , 1989 , about 7 miles ( 11 km ) in length . The freeway was opened in full on October 29 , 1992 , at a ceremony attended by Governor Jim Edgar . The total cost of construction for I @-@ 155 was US $ 130 million . Of this , $ 10 million was provided by federal funding . 
 Illinois initially applied for the new freeway to be designated Interstate 37 , but on December 7 , 1990 , the request was deferred by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) , pending approval by the Federal Highway Administration to add the freeway into the Interstate System . In addition , AASHTO suggested using a 3 @-@ digit number when the application was resubmitted . Later , the state submitted another application to AASHTO for the freeway to be named Interstate 155 . On June 9 , 1991 , the AASHTO application was approved and granted when Interstate 155 was completed .

 = Regency Square , Brighton = 
 Regency Square is a large early 19th @-@ century residential development on the seafront in Brighton , part of the British city of Brighton and Hove . Conceived by speculative developer Joshua Hanson as Brighton underwent its rapid transformation from fishing village to fashionable resort , the three @-@ sided " set piece " of around 70 houses and associated structures was designed and built over a ten @-@ year period by Brighton 's most important Regency @-@ era architects : the partnership of Charles Busby , Amon Wilds and his son Amon Henry Wilds . The site was originally Belle Vue Field — used at various times as a military camp ( mentioned in Pride and Prejudice ) , a showground and the location of a windmill . 
 The square was a prestigious , high @-@ class development , attracting the social elite . The square gradually lost its prestige status after the First World War as hotels started to move in . The square 's central garden , originally private , has been council @-@ owned since 1884 and is publicly accessible , and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969 . 
 Most of the buildings in and around the square have been designated Listed buildings : six blocks of houses are each listed at Grade II * , the second @-@ highest designation , while five other residential buildings , a war memorial , a nearby inn and a set of bollards outside it have each been given the lower Grade II status . The house at the southwest corner is now numbered as part of King 's Road but was built as part of Regency Square , and is also Grade II * -listed . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Belle Vue Field = = = 
 Regency Square was built on one of the fields surrounding the fishing village of Brighthelmstone , the predecessor of modern @-@ day Brighton . The field was named Belle Vue Field — probably in connection with the long vanished Belle Vue House , and lay to the west of the village . The field ran down to the seafront , and was a popular site for travelling shows , fairs , military parades and other gatherings . The field contained a windmill known as West Mill . A windmill was owned by Matthew Bourne in 1744 , but was not marked on Ogilby 's 1762 map . A windmill is shown on Lambert 's View of Brighthelmstone which is dated 1765 . The windmill stood in the field until 28 March 1797 , when 86 oxen dragged it 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) uphill on a sled to the nearby village of Preston . It was re @-@ erected there and renamed Preston Mill . After several more renamings , it was demolished in 1881 . Its machinery was cannibalised by the owners of nearby <unk> Mill . A watercolour painting , now displayed at Preston Manor , shows crowds of people watching the mill 's removal to Preston . 
 By the late 18th century , Brighton ( as it was now known ) had begun to develop into a popular and fashionable seaside resort . Belle Vue Field became more important to the growing town in 1793 , when in response to the increased military threat from France , a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ man military encampment ( Brighton 's first ) was established there . The camp quickly gained a reputation as a place for women to find partners , and Jane Austen used it as a setting in her novel Pride and Prejudice ( written in 1796 and published in 1813 ) . The heroine Elizabeth Bennet 's sister is invited to Brighton and elopes with , and later marries , army officer George Wickham . The camp moved to another site in 1794 ; after returning to its former use as a fairground and showground , Belle Vue Field gradually lost popularity and was abandoned in 1807 , when such entertainments moved to The Level , a large expanse of grass inland north of Old Steine . 
 = = = Hanson builds the square = = = 
 A few years later , the field ( which had no common ownership ) was acquired by Joshua <unk> Hanson , a businessman . By this time , Brighton 's popularity was such that speculators were commissioning architects and builders to design and lay out large @-@ scale sea @-@ facing residential developments to attract wealthy long @-@ term visitors or permanent residents . Royal Crescent was already thriving ; Clarence Square , Russell Square , Marine Parade and New Steine were being developed , and work had started on Bedford Square . Hanson decided to follow the trend but take it in a new direction : he divided Belle Vue Field into 70 plots , leased them individually and put strict covenants in place , demanding that each house be built in a specific style in order to ensure architectural harmony . In return , the leaseholders ( mostly private builders ) would have the right to buy , and would end up with houses much larger than average for the town , with excellent sea views and with exclusive access to the large central garden . Most leaseholders bought the houses as soon as they could , which was to Hanson 's advantage as he made money and had no ongoing responsibility for the buildings . Restrictions in the covenants included the requirement to erect a façade with an iron balcony , to clad the area below the balcony in stucco , to paint the façade at least every three years , to repair any damage , and to pay towards maintenance of the central garden . No stucco was to be applied above the balcony line . 
 Although there is no documentary evidence confirming the architects , all sources attribute most of Regency Square 's buildings to the father @-@ and @-@ son partnership of Amon and Amon Henry Wilds , who moved to Brighton from nearby Lewes in 1815 and became two of Brighton 's most important architects ; they were extremely prolific , and were responsible for defining and developing the town 's distinctive Regency style . Although they worked extensively with fellow architect Charles Busby during the 1820s , historians agree that he was not involved in the overall design of Regency Square , at least not in its early stages : the buildings " appear to lack his distinctive flair " and are not as impressive as those at the Kemp Town estate to the east of Brighton , which all three men were involved with . Some of the later houses may have been the work of Wilds senior and Busby , however . 
 Building work started in 1818 and continued until 1830 , although most of the square ( except numbers 1 and 47 – 49 ) were complete by 1828 . The long construction period affected the uniformity of design hoped for by Hanson , as did the fact that building plots were sold individually and at different times : even a strict covenant could not force the owners into designing identical houses . A passageway ( Regency Colonnade ) was built at the northeast corner to connect the square to the neighbouring development of Russell Square , which was built at the same time ; the contemporary Regency Inn ( now known as the Regency Tavern ) faced both the passageway and Regency Square . St Margaret 's Church , an Anglican chapel of ease designed in the Greek Revival / Neoclassical style in 1824 by Busby , was the local place of worship . 
 Bands often played in the square 's central garden or on King 's Road at the southern end of the square . Meanwhile , residents were upset in 1866 when the West Pier , designed by Eugenius Birch , was built opposite the square 's central garden : its entrance booths affected their sea views . Otherwise , there was little for residents to worry about until the 1880s , by which time Hanson 's covenants were about to expire . Unusually , he had set a 71 @-@ year time limit on the covenants rather than granting them in perpetuity , and on 25 December 1889 they would expire . Residents would then lose their rights to use the gardens , among other things . Five residents , led by solicitor Somers Clarke ( unrelated to the Brighton @-@ born architect of that name ) , attempted unsuccessfully to purchase the gardens and extend the covenants by an Act of Parliament ; two years later , though , the passing of the Brighton Improvement Act 1884 achieved the same aims . Brighton Corporation took ownership of the gardens , and householders signed new deeds confirming they wished for the covenants relating to their houses to be extended indefinitely . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 From the beginning , Regency Square was a prestigious , high @-@ class development , and it is still considered to be " one of Brighton 's best sea @-@ facing squares " . By the mid @-@ 20th century , most of the houses had become hotels , and in early 1969 a surface @-@ level car park was planned for the Brighton Corporation owned central garden ; this was changed to a 520 @-@ space underground car park which was created using the cut and cover method in which the garden was dug up , the car park with roof constructed , and the lawns and flowerbeds restored . Richard Seifert 's 334 @-@ foot ( 102 m ) , Modernist 24 @-@ storey residential block , Sussex Heights , was built in 1968 on land immediately to the east of the square , and was criticised for affecting the character of the square because of its contrasting style and height . During the early 1970s the hotels sought permission from Brighton Corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves ; after negotiation with the Regency Society , a Brighton @-@ wide conservation group formed in 1945 , the Corporation made the square and the surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973 . Conservation area status gives the council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture , especially in respect of their effect on " the character and appearance of the area " . The original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of 80 acres ( 32 ha ) .

 Almost all buildings in and around the square have been designated Listed building : six blocks of houses are each listed at Grade II * , while the other buildings , including a set of bollards , have each been given the lower Grade II status . The house at the south west corner is now numbered as part of King 's Road but was built as part of Regency Square , and is also Grade II * -listed . 
 The six Grade II * parts of the square , plus the former St Albans House , were listed on 13 October 1952 . The west side was listed in two parts : the three houses at numbers 2 – 4 , and the sixteen houses from number 5 to number 20 . The northern side 's central section , numbers 26 – 37 , forms another listing . On the east side , numbers 51 – 56 , 57 – 59 and 60 – 66 are each listed at Grade II * . Apart from St Albans House , all of these listings include iron railings attached to the exterior . Numbers 38 – 46 Regency Square were listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971 , while the rest of the square 's houses were listed at the same grade on 26 August 1999 in four separate listings : numbers 22 – 25 , 46a , 46b and 47 – 49 . All listings except numbers 46a and 46b include attached railings , and the listing for numbers 38 – 46 also includes a carriage arch . 
 A small block of flats , Abbotts , stands at the southeast corner of the square . Built by architecture firm Fitzroy Robinson & Partners in 1961 – 62 to replace a hotel of the same name , it was considered " quite good " by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner .

 2 – 4 Regency Square 
 These three four @-@ storey houses ( now the Beach Hotel ) have double bow fronts , and were considered by Nikolaus Pevsner to be more austere in their detailing than most Brighton houses of their era . Number 2 , a former home of social reformer William King ( whose two @-@ year stay is commemorated by a blue plaque ) , is built of brick which has been painted over ; the others are stuccoed . Each house also has a basement and a dormer window . The ground floors are rusticated and have arched doorways set into Classical @-@ style porches with both Ionic and Doric columns — the latter in the form of antae . The tripartite bay windows are neither full @-@ height nor continuous : only the first three storeys have them , and they are offset to the right on the first and second floors . The first @-@ floor windows sit between a curved cast @-@ iron balcony and a verandah @-@ style canopy supported on decorative brackets . On each house , the third floor has three small flat @-@ arched sash windows ; the centre window sits below a small cornice supported on corbels . 
 5 – 20 Regency Square 
 These sixteen houses form the greater part of the square 's west side . Although there are differences in height and detail between individual houses , they were designed at the same time and maintain " the longstanding tradition of the terraced townhouse " which had been developed " by Henry Holland [ ... ] in his own speculative enterprises at Hans Town and Sloane Street , London " . Numbers 7 , 8 , 11 and 15 are entirely stuccoed ; number 18 retains its original unpainted yellow @-@ brick upper façade ; and all other houses have painted brick to their upper storeys and stuccoed ground floors with rustication . The roofs are mansard @-@ style and laid with slate . Each house has dormer windows ; numbers 5 – 13 inclusive rise to four storeys , while the other seven houses are one storey shorter . All houses except number 12 have a single bay window , mostly in tripartite form . Number 12 has three windows to each floor . The entrance porches , reached via staircases , are either Doric or Ionic in form , with columns and entablatures . They have arch @-@ headed doorways set into them . Small cast @-@ iron balconies run across the terrace at first @-@ floor level ( although number 5 's has been lost ) , and some houses have canopy @-@ style verandahs as well . A nearly continuous cornice ( absent on numbers 13 and 19 ) spans the terrace ; some houses also have a second cornice above this . Several houses have fanlights with coloured glass , and other non @-@ standard details include decorative stucco panelling at number 5 ; paterae ( circular motifs ) , triglyph @-@ decorated friezes and other Classical @-@ style ornamentation in some of the porch entablatures ; original window @-@ guards of iron ; a blocked doorway flanked by pilasters at number 20 ; and many original sash windows . 
 26 – 37 Regency Square 
 These 12 houses , arranged along the sea @-@ facing north side in the form of two wings flanking a four @-@ house centrepiece , are the focal point of the square , forming " a kind of palace front " topped with a pediment displaying Regency Square in prominent black lettering . Pevsner described this feature as " not [ being ] enough of an accent to pull the square together " . The terrace is a five @-@ part composition : the end " wings " ( formed by numbers 26 – 27 and 36 – 37 ) are of four storeys , stuccoed and with tall parapets pinched upwards to form small pediments ; the central section ( numbers 30 – 33 ) , also of four storeys and built in yellow brick , and topped with the inscribed pediment ; and numbers 28 – 29 and 34 – 35 , rising to three storeys and forming a link between the central and outer sections . Numbers 30 – 33 have a two @-@ window range , rather than the single window on each of the other houses , and have four pilasters running the full height of the façade and terminating at the parapet in circular antefixae . The entrance porches are of the Ionic order . Each house has a canopied cast @-@ iron balcony at first @-@ floor level . There is rusticated decoration at ground @-@ floor level . 
 51 – 56 Regency Square 
 The east side of Regency Square is architecturally less consistent than the west side . Numbers 51 – 56 were designed as a symmetrical composition : the two houses at the centre stand forward slightly and have a more prominent pediment . Each house has four storeys and a single bay window on the ground and first floors ; other common features include rustication on the ground floor and Ionic @-@ style porches with recessed flat @-@ arched doorways and arched fanlights . There are cast @-@ iron balconies at first @-@ floor level ; number 52 's has a canopy above it . Some windows are sashes , and numbers 52 , 53 , 54 and 56 have dormer windows in their slate roofs . 
 57 – 59 Regency Square 
 These three houses may also have been designed as a single composition , but this effect has been lost . Numbers 58 and 59 are of five storeys ; number 57 has four storeys and dormer windows . The parapet rises into an intricately decorated pediment above number 58 , with palmette scrollwork and semicircular antefixae . Each house has an Ionic @-@ columned porch with a straight @-@ headed door and semicircular fanlight . Numbers 57 and 59 have canopies and first @-@ floor balconies ; number 58 has only a balcony . The three houses are the only ones on the east side to have full @-@ height bows , and number 57 is unique on that side in retaining its original unpainted yellow @-@ brick façade . 
 60 – 66 Regency Square 
 These seven houses are also a symmetrical composition : the three in the middle are set forward and have a tall parapet topped by a very shallow pediment . Like the rest of the east side , the houses have Ionic porches with flat @-@ arched doors and round @-@ headed fanlights . The ground and first floors have three @-@ part bay windows topped with cornices . Except on number 63 , a narrow canopy sits between the first @-@ floor window and the cornice . Another cornice spans the full width of the terrace above third @-@ floor level . The slightly recessed houses on each end ( numbers 60 – 61 and 65 – 66 ) have pairs of dormer windows . 
 131 King 's Road 
 The former St Albans House was designed in 1828 by Amon Henry Wilds alone and was fitted out by William Izard . A shopfront was fitted in the early 20th century , and the ground floor has housed a restaurant since 1930 . Contemporary with the shopfront was the round @-@ headed entrance on the King 's Road elevation , with an archway supported on fluted columns , a dentil @-@ patterned cornice and ornamentation including scrollwork and a panel inscribed St Albans . The building has five storeys , three windows facing King 's Road and the sea , and a five @-@ window range to Regency Square . It is stuccoed and slate @-@ roofed . The shopfront is topped by a thin cast @-@ iron balcony . The right @-@ hand ( east ) side of the King 's Road façade has a full @-@ height tripartite segmental bay window with architraves to each window . The Regency Square elevation also has a three @-@ light full @-@ height bay window ; all other windows are blocked .

 22 – 25 Regency Square 
 Numbers 22 – 25 Regency Square — at the northwest corner of the square on a short road leading to Preston Street — include the building ( number 67 ) on the corner of that street , which absorbed the house built as number 21 Regency Square . Attributed to Amon and Amon Henry Wilds , these bow @-@ fronted terraced houses were built in about 1818 . Number 67 Preston Street is of three storeys and has a shopfront facing west into that street ; alongside that is a porch with rusticated decoration and an arched doorway . The Regency Square ( south ) façade has blocked windows at first- and second @-@ floor level . The four houses facing Regency Square are of three storeys , except number 25 which also has an attic storey . They are of brick faced with painted stucco . Each house has a chimney on its slate roof . Each has an entrance staircase with iron railings , a rusticated ground floor , a single bay window to each storey , an iron balcony at first @-@ floor level , a cornice and a parapet in front of the roof . At numbers 22 to 24 , dormer windows cut through the parapet . 
 38 – 46 Regency Square 
 Numbers 38 – 46 Regency Square run alongside the northeast side , and are contemporary with the houses at the northwest corner . The <unk> are believed to have designed them . A carriage arch runs between numbers 42 and 43 . Together with numbers 22 – 25 and the Grade II * -listed centrepiece of numbers 26 – 37 , the houses form an approximately symmetrical three @-@ part arrangement when viewed from the south . Each house is of stucco @-@ clad brick , and all but number 40 have slate @-@ covered roofs . All houses rise to three storeys and have dormer windows ; number 43 has two bay windows on each floor ( except the ground floor , where the space is taken up by the carriage arch ) , but the other houses have only one . Each house also has a balcony , a cornice and a parapet ( topped with a balustrade in some cases ) . 
 46a Regency Square 
 Number 46a Regency Square stands partly in the square and partly in the passageway opposite the Regency Tavern . It is a two @-@ storey stucco @-@ faced cottage with three windows on the first floor and a fourth in a recessed wing on the east side . The flat roof sits behind a parapet . The ground floor has a broad single window flanked by decorative panels . A cornice runs between the two storeys , and projects forward over the right @-@ aligned entrance . 
 46b Regency Square 
 Number 46b Regency Square is squeezed into a narrow corner between numbers 47 – 49 and the Regency Tavern . It has three storeys , a single @-@ window range and much ornamentation . The ground floor , with its wide arched window and prominent cornice , may be a 20th @-@ century alteration . Above it , pilasters with banded rustication rise to the level of the parapet . They are broken at second @-@ floor level by a small balcony with balustrades . The window above this has a round arch , a moulded archivolt , a keystone with acanthus decoration and thin pilasters topped with capitals in the form of leaves . 
 47 – 49 Regency Square 
 Numbers 47 – 49 Regency Square are believed to be the last buildings completed ; Charles Busby was probably involved in their design , as they are noticeably different from the rest of the square . All three have a single canted bay window to each of three storeys , topped with an architrave supported on pilasters with capitals . Each house also has a cornice and parapet . Number 47 's doorway is straight @-@ headed , but the other two houses have round @-@ arched entrances . 
 War memorial 
 A memorial commemorating 152 members of the Royal Sussex Regiment who died in the Second Boer War stands at the south end of Regency Square 's garden , facing King 's Road and the sea . It was erected in 1904 , and takes the form of a square pedestal topped by an entablature and pediment . Originally of Portland stone with some bronze and stucco , the bronze parts have now been obscured . A bronze trumpeter stands on top of the entablature . Local architect Sir John Simpson designed the memorial and Charles Hartwell sculpted it . The memorial 's unveiling ceremony , conducted by William Nevill , 1st Marquess of Abergavenny , was on 29 October 1904 . 
 Regency Tavern 
 The Regency Tavern 's main façade faces north into the passageway leading to Russell Square , and has a six @-@ window range . The side wall , facing into Regency Square , has two windows to each of the three storeys . The frontage is mostly original but has been augmented by modern iron columns . All but one of the windows are original sashes ; those on the first floor of the Regency Square elevation have architraves which join the sill of the second @-@ floor window directly above . There are stuccoed panels between these windows as well , and some of the north @-@ facing windows also have panelling in their spandrels . A tall parapet rises above the cornice . 
 <unk> 
 Two cast @-@ iron bollards in the passageway outside the Regency Tavern are also listed at Grade II . They were erected in the mid @-@ 19th century , and are fluted along their length . One has the name of its local founder at the bottom . On 31 December 2012 , one was broken and was replaced with a smaller plain bollard instead of a facsimile , causing controversy locally . 
 = = Social aspects = = 
 Regency Square was a prestigious , high @-@ class development , attracting the social elite . The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels started to move in , and by the mid @-@ 20th century , most of the houses had become hotels . During World War II air @-@ raid shelters were built on the square , and an underground car park was built beneath it in 1969 . 
 Number 1 Regency Square , later known as St Albans House and now numbered 131 King 's Road , is " historically the most interesting house in the square " . Amon Henry Wilds designed it for the Duke and Duchess of St Albans , and William Izard laid out the interior in 1829 . The house was one of the most important social venues in Brighton between 1830 and the Duchess 's death in 1837 . She was born Harriet Mellon in 1777 , became an actress , married banker Thomas Coutts in 1815 , and inherited his fortune when he died in 1822 — thereby becoming England 's richest woman . After being courted by many men , she met and married William Beauclerk , the 9th Duke of St Albans , and they became regular visitors to Brighton . In 1830 , they moved permanently to 1 Regency Square and renamed it St Albans House . For the next seven years , it was the venue for lavish balls with hundreds of upper @-@ class guests , extensive feasts and falconry displays by the Duke , who was the Grand Falconer of England . St Albans House had an adjacent riding school which supposedly had the second largest unsupported interior space and the second largest dome in England , behind Westminster Abbey and St Paul 's Cathedral respectively . ( Part of the Bedford Hotel now occupies the site . ) Two other famous characters paid an unintentional visit to Regency Square at the end of the 19th century : Oscar Wilde and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas crashed their horse and carriage into the railings of the gardens . Local newspapers reported the story with interest , but Wilde dismissed it as " an accident of no importance " — possibly a punning allusion to one of his best @-@ known plays . 
 Since the 1930s , many of Regency Square 's dwellings have been converted into hotels and guest houses , either individually or across more than one house . The Beach Hotel occupies numbers 2 – 4 , the three dwellings north of St Albans House . Hotel <unk> occupies numbers 9 and 10 ; the Royal Pavilion Townhouse Hotel is at number 12 ; and the West Pier Hotel ( at numbers 14 – 15 ) and Topps Hotel ( numbers 16 – 18 ) also occupy the west side of the square . There are four hotels on the north side : the Regency at number 28 , the Prince Regent at number 29 , Artist Residence at number 33 and the George IV Guest House at number 34 . The east side has Adelaide House ( number 51 ) , Brighton House ( number 52 ) , Hotel Una ( numbers 55 – 56 ) , and the Queensbury Hotel ( number 58 ) . Since c . 2000 the former <unk> 's Hotel at number 57 has been the West Pier Project homeless hostel , operated by Brighton and Hove City Council and accommodating about 40 people ; it will close in late 2015 and will become a hostel for former servicemen .

 The game takes place on the tropical Isle Delfino , where Mario , Toadsworth , Princess Peach , and five Toads are taking a vacation . A villain resembling Mario , known as Shadow Mario , vandalizes the island with graffiti and Mario gets blamed for the mess . Mario is ordered to clean up Isle Delfino , using a device called FLUDD ( Flash <unk> Ultra Dousing Device ) , while saving Princess Peach from Shadow Mario .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor , Super Mario 64 , whilst introducing various new gameplay features . Players control Mario as he tries to obtain 120 Shine Sprites in order to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr . ( disguised as Mario ) steals the Shine Sprites and covers the island in toxic slime . Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses . Similar to collecting Stars in Super Mario 64 , players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage , with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one . There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained . Throughout the game , players may also find Blue Coins , which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites in the boathouse in Delfino Plaza . 
 In this game , Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD ( Flash <unk> Ultra Dousing Device ) , which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places . Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD , Squirt and Hover , which he can quickly switch between . The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge , attack enemies , and activate certain mechanisms . The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time , allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him . As the game progresses , Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle : the Rocket nozzle , which shoots Mario high up into the air ; and the Turbo nozzle , which moves Mario at high speeds , allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas . Each of FLUDD 's nozzles use water from its reserves , which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains . There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario , forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities . At certain points in the game , Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for . Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice , which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot . Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color , depending on the type of fruit . Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water . Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game takes place on the tropical resort of Isle Delfino , which is shaped like a dolphin and comprises ten primary locations . The island is mainly inhabited by the races of the <unk> and <unk> . All the levels either have <unk> , <unk> or both . Delfino Plaza is Isle Delfino 's largest city and the game 's main hub . 
 Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach , and her long @-@ time steward Toadsworth . Upon a rough plane landing at the island 's airstrip , they find that the once @-@ pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti . As a result of this pollution , sun @-@ shaped objects called " Shine Sprites " , the island 's sources of power , have disappeared , and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow . The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario , who is named " Shadow Mario " . To help with cleaning the airstrip , Mario finds FLUDD , a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd . After Mario defeats a giant slime covered Piranha Plant and restores the airstrip , he is promptly arrested by two Pianta police officers who accuse him of vandalizing Isle Delfino with graffiti , despite the fact that he has only just arrived . He is put on trial , however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites , in spite of Princess Peach 's objection to the ruling . He is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so . The next day , after spending the night in a cell , Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal , while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino . 
 After defeating another slime @-@ covered Piranha Plant and a sunken statue rises from the ground , they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time . He jumps off the statue , grabs Peach , and runs off with her . Mario chases him and takes him down by spraying him with water from FLUDD . Shadow Mario immediately creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it . Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills , one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime @-@ covered Piranha Plant and a hill , some trees and a section of wall rise up from the ground . After defeating two more slime @-@ covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino 's other locations , Mario follows Shadow Mario , who has kidnapped Princess Peach once again , towards Pinna Island , home of Isle Delfino 's theme park . There , Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario ( titled Mecha Bowser ) by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster , while also shooting down the Bullet Bills that Mecha <unk> <unk> is then revealed that Shadow Mario 's real identity is Bowser Jr . , the youngest son of Bowser who wields a magic brush that creates graffiti which , like FLUDD , was also created by E. Gadd . Bowser Jr. turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach , having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother . When learning the truth , Peach is visually upset for a second . He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain , a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own . After Mario beats Bowser Jr. in all nine areas ( not including the Delfino airstrip ) , a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza , opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into . While most levels are restricted by this flood , the flood disappears after the player has entered Corona Mountain . Mario enters the volcano , and after getting through the volcano 's inner cave , defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in using the Rocket <unk> and super ground pound , rescuing the princess . Mario and the princess fall from the sky while Bowser and Bowser Jr. are falling onto platforms in the ocean . While the others are plummeting down , Princess Peach puts her skirt back on . Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet , but on the same island , Mario gets his head stuck in the sand , but gets out . However , FLUDD becomes damaged during the landing , supposedly beyond repair . The Shine Gate 's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario , Princess Peach and the others resume their vacation , while Bowser admits to his son that Princess Peach was not really his mother . After the credits , if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites , a picture shows Il <unk> , a sprinter that Mario raced during the game , finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino . However , if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites , a picture of the entire cast with the words " Have a relaxing vacation " is displayed instead . 
 = = Development = = 
 A sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years ; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario 128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel . Super Mario Sunshine was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2001 . The game was later shown again at E3 2002 . 
 In an interview about the development of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui , it was mentioned that the game 's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump . However , at first the developers thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario . Therefore , they tried using a man @-@ type character , but thought this was too odd and that " if there was a man next to Mario , there is a sense of incongruity . " There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles , and FLUDD was chosen because of fitting in the game 's setting , despite it not being one of the favorites . They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted , such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him . 
 Koji Kondo and Shinobu Tanaka composed the score to Super Mario Sunshine . The soundtrack features various arrangements of classic Mario tunes , including the underground music and the main stage music from the original Super Mario Bros. 
 = = = Voice cast = = = 
 Super Mario Sunshine features many of the usual voice actors for the various Nintendo characters . This is the only 3D Mario game which features full English voice acting in cutscenes ( excluding the Japanese voice actors or in other countries ) .

 Super Mario Sunshine was commercially successful , having sold 5 @.@ 5 million copies as of June 2006 . In 2002 , Super Mario Sunshine was the tenth best @-@ selling game in the United States according to the NPD Group . It was re @-@ released in 2003 as part of the Player 's Choice line , a selection of games with high sales sold for a reduced price . 
 Super Mario Sunshine received critical acclaim by game reviewers . IGN praised the addition of the water backpack for improving the gameplay , and GameSpy commented on the " wide variety of moves and the beautifully constructed environments " . The game received a perfect score from Nintendo Power , who commended the " superb graphics , excellent music , clever layouts , funny cinema scenes and ingenious puzzles " . 
 GamePro also gave Super Mario Sunshine a perfect score , stating that the game was " a masterpiece of superior game design , infinite gameplay variety , creativity , and life . " The American @-@ based publication Game Informer said that the game is arguably " the best Mario game to date . " Computer and Video Games also mentioned the game is " better than Super Mario 64 . " The game placed 46th in Official Nintendo Magazine 's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time . Allgame gave a lower review , stating that " During the six @-@ year span between Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine , platform games have become more epic , more interactive , and prettier . Yet the core element of collecting items in a world divided into sub @-@ sections has been left unchanged . So it comes with a modicum of disappointment that Super Mario Sunshine doesn 't shake up the genre with a number of new and fresh ideas other than the usual enhancements expected from a sequel . " 
 Some reviewers were critical towards certain aspects of the game . GameSpot 's Jeff Gerstmann criticized the various additions , including FLUDD ( the water backpack ) and Yoshi , calling them " mere gimmicks . " He also complained about the camera system . Gerstmann felt that the game seemed somewhat unpolished and rushed , a sentiment shared by Matt Wales of Computer and Video Games .

 Super Mario Sunshine has introduced several elements which were carried over to subsequent Mario titles . Many of the characters introduced in this game have been staples in the series ever since : Petey Piranha , <unk> and most notably Bowser Jr. who has been one of Mario 's arch rivals ever since this initial encounter . Many of the bosses from this game and Luigi 's Mansion appeared in multiple Mario spin @-@ offs that were to follow on the GameCube , such as the unlockable Petey Piranha and King Boo in Mario Kart : Double Dash ‼ and the four unlockable characters in Mario Golf : Toadstool Tour . 
 This was the first game in the Mario series to introduce the Shine Sprites , which have appeared in later Mario titles such as Mario Kart DS and Paper Mario : The Thousand @-@ Year Door .

 This game was the first Mario platformer game to be released for the GameCube . It was also the first 3D Mario platformer which included the ability to ride Yoshi and to have him change colors . This feature reappeared in Super Mario Galaxy 2 where the <unk> Trials Galaxy in World S is another recurring theme from Super Mario Sunshine , based off one of the missions " The Secret of Ricco Tower " . 
 In Super Smash Bros. Brawl , Mario uses FLUDD as a new special move , it does no damage and instead pushes opponents away . Brawl also has the fighting stage Delfino Plaza , a replica of Isle Delfino 's capital city , with a platform carrying the fighters to any location of the stage on occasion . The original background music of Delfino Plaza occasionally plays on the stage , as well as the BGM for Ricco Harbor . The game also features several stickers based on artwork from Super Mario Sunshine . Most of these features were retained in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U and the Delfino Plaza was retained in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Bowser Jr. himself debuted as a new playable fighter in the game , and utilizes his Magic Paintbrush and Shadow Mario form from Super Mario Sunshine in his Final Smash .

 In publications focused on manga and anime reviews , Mukuro 's concept has received praise and acclaim . Leroy Douresseaux of <unk> views him as " murderous and supernaturally powerful , " as well as being a " slippery and formidable villain " by the way he attacks Tsuna and his friends . Sam Kusek of Manga Recon likes Mukuro as the enigmatic villain , though believes him to be a " big creep " . He also praises Akira Amano for the originality of Mukuro 's techniques , viewing it as " one of the most interesting ideas I 've seen , " and making him , along with Tsuna , the " real winners overall " of volume 9 . However , David Rasmussen from <unk> commented that the fight against Mukuro in the manga is a " long , long , <unk> @-@ Z @-@ sized struggle " . As such , he mentioned that the fight is very likable for readers who enjoy " super @-@ powerful people " and long fights .

 Not to be confused with go ! , the Hawaiian airline . 
 GoAir is a low @-@ cost carrier based in Mumbai , India . It is owned by the Indian business conglomerate Wadia Group . As of February 2016 , it is the fifth largest airline in India with an 8 % passenger market share . It commenced operations in November 2005 and operates a fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft in all economy configuration . As of July 2016 , the airline operates over 140 daily flights to 22 cities from its hubs at Mumbai and Delhi . 
 = = History = = 
 GoAir was founded in 2005 by Jehangir Wadia , son of Indian industrialist <unk> Wadia . The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wadia Group . GoAir commenced its operations using an Airbus A320 aircraft and operated its inaugural flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 4 November 2005 . The airline initially operated with a single aircraft to four destinations including Goa and Coimbatore with plans to induct 36 aircraft by 2008 . In March 2008 , the airline announced revised plans to operate 11 aircraft and service new destinations in North East and South India by the end of the year . But increasing fuel prices forced GoAir to cut down the existing number of flights in June 2008 . 
 In January 2009 , British Airways was interested in buying a stake in the airline . In November 2009 , GoAir entered into talks with Indian airline SpiceJet over a possible merger which ended in a no deal . In April 2012 , GoAir became the fifth largest airline in India in terms of market share following the demise of Kingfisher Airlines . In 2013 , the airline appointed investment bank JP Morgan to scout for potential investors . 
 The airline 's growth has been slow compared to other airlines established at the same time such as IndiGo and SpiceJet , which have larger market share , fleet size and destinations served as of 2016 . According to the airline , it is a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India and to focus on maintaining profitability rather than on capturing market share and increasing the destinations and fleet size . As of February 2016 , it remains the fifth largest carrier in the country with an 8 % market share . The airline is planning for an Initial Public Offering ( IPO ) in 2016 . The airline took delivery of its 20th aircraft in June 2016 , making it eligible to operate international flights .

 = Tom Vilsack presidential campaign , 2008 = 
 After being considered as a potential Vice Presidential candidate for Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election , former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack began a campaign for the Democratic Party 's 2008 nomination for President of the United States . 
 On November 30 , 2006 , he became the second Democratic candidate to officially announce a presidential run . His short @-@ lived campaign was focused on his home state of Iowa but suffered low standing in national polls and a lack of name recognition . During the campaign , he emphasized the War in Iraq and his plan for ending it . 
 His run concluded on February 23 , 2007 , before any debates or primaries , due to funding shortfalls . He endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton after his exit , but shifted to Barack Obama after her withdrawal . 
 = = Early stages = = 
 Near the end of his eight years as Governor of Iowa , Vilsack , as head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , campaigned for Democratic gubernatorial candidates across the nation . While on the campaign trail he gauged support for a possible presidential run . Vilsack was inspired by the results of the 2006 mid @-@ term elections , and proclaimed that " Americans sent a clear message " that " they want leaders who share their values , understand their needs and respect their intelligence " and that that is what he would " intend to do as president " . On November 9 , Vilsack filed with the FEC and announced that he had been " put [ ting ] together the building blocks needed to run a successful national presidential campaign . " He made his formal announcement on November 30 . 
 = = Campaign developments = = 
 Vilsack made his announcement in Mount Pleasant , Iowa . He listed the themes of his campaign as energy independence , national security , and the economy . The candidate promised change in government by means of reduced partisanship and decried the Bush Administration as one " whose first impulse is to divide and to conquer . " Vilsack acknowledged his underdog status , given his low profile outside Iowa , which hampered fundraising . 
 In December , Vilsack embarked on a campaign tour beginning in his hometown of Pittsburgh . While there , he addressed a local Democratic Committee , reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism . He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War , advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government : " It 's their country , it 's their future and they should be willing to fight for it and they certainly should be willing to die for it . " He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week . 
 In mid @-@ December 2006 Vilsack was interviewed by two major magazines . In U.S. News and World Report , he explained why he decided against forming an exploratory committee like many of his Democratic rivals , on the principle that he had " to get to work . " He linked the issue of energy security to global warming and national security . He advocated moving American troops from southern and central Iraq to the north , and further commented that political reconciliation must be refocused on " building local governance " rather than spending " all the time on the national government . " In an interview with Rolling Stone , he made a distinction between " experience and judgment " and emphasized the importance of the latter . Vilsack attacked Republican candidate John McCain 's planned Iraq troop surge as " making a big mistake bigger " , and denied that the military had the resources to execute it . In discounting the importance of name recognition , he said " people don ’ t have to remember my name , they only have to remember the first letter which is V. It stands for vision , it stands for victory , it stands for Vilsack . " He also expressed his satisfaction with frontrunner Hillary Clinton , calling himself " a big fan . " 
 In January , Vilsack toured New Hampshire , site of the first primary . There he met with middle school students , with whom he discussed his plans for rebuilding Iraq . Dismissing his Democratic opponents ' calls for caps on American troops in the nation , Vilsack advocated a troop withdrawal . He also talked about Iraq with employees of the Granite State Independent Living Group , blaming the costs of rebuilding for the lack of public funds available for domestic projects . In Iowa later in the month , Vilsack reiterated his opposition to troop caps , likening them to " staying the course " . He stated that troop capping " reflects the continuation of a failed policy " and that America " ought to be ... aggressively redeploying troops out of Iraq . " 
 On February 15 , before an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , Vilsack visited the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco where he gave a speech about energy . He explained that his campaign remained carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon credits . On The Tonight Show , Vilsack joked about his relative obscurity . He remarked that he was okay with Leno making jokes about him , because " when you are just below the margin of error in polls , anything anybody says about you is important . " 
 Vilsack officially withdrew from the race on February 23 , stating that the crowded field of Democratic candidates made it impossible for him to raise enough money to continue his campaign . In explaining his withdrawal , he stated that he " came up against something for the first time in [ his ] life that hard work and effort couldn ’ t overcome . " <unk> an electoral process that he saw as dominated by fundraising , he left the race proclaiming " it is money and only money that is the reason we are leaving today . " Vilsack raised $ 1 @.@ 1 million during his run and left the race with $ 396 @,@ 000 on hand . 
 = = Polling = = 
 In the race for the Democratic nomination , Gallup polls placed Vilsack at 1 % support in November and December 2006 . This fell to 0 % on January 7 , where it remained until his withdrawal in February . 
 A Rasmussen report published December 18 , 2006 that polled voters on their preferences in a variety of hypothetical presidential matchups showed that Vilsack was preferred to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee by a margin of 37 % to 29 % , but trailed former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 56 % to 28 % . " A similar poll , published in February 2007 before Vilsack 's withdrawal , found that he trailed Republican Senator John McCain 50 % to 22 % . In a separate poll by Rasmussen , Vilsack was viewed favorably by 21 % of the electorate and unfavorably by 21 % . 58 % of voters did not have enough information about Vilsack to have an opinion . 19 % of respondents considered Vilsack a moderate , 9 % considered him a liberal and 7 % considered him a conservative . 65 % could not describe his political stands . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After withdrawing from the race , Vilsack endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for the presidency on March 25 , 2007 . He hoped to build momentum for her in Iowa . The former Governor identified Clinton as the candidate with " the best ideas , the most energy , and the values and vision to lead our country . " Shortly after the endorsement , Clinton named Vilsack 's wife Christie as the co @-@ chairman of her campaign in Iowa . The Clinton campaign announced they would help Vilsack pay off his campaign 's $ 400 @,@ 000 debt . Vilsack campaigned for Clinton nationwide as national campaign co @-@ chairman , and focused on helping her win the Iowa caucuses . Despite his efforts , Clinton finished third in the caucuses behind Barack Obama and John Edwards Following Clinton 's withdrawal , Vilsack endorsed Obama for the presidency on July 15 , 2008 . He labeled Obama as the " only candidate " for voters " against partisanship " to change " the tone in Washington " 
 Vilsack was later nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Secretary of Agriculture in his administration . He was confirmed for the post by the Senate on Inauguration Day . 
 = Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix = 
 The metropolitan area of Phoenix in the U.S. state of Arizona contains one of the nation 's largest and fastest @-@ growing freeway systems , boasting over 1 @,@ 405 lane miles as of 2005 . 
 Due to the lack of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008 , the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has remained a very automobile @-@ dependent city , with its first freeway opening in 1958 — a year preceding most cities ' first freeway openings . Coupled with the explosive growth of the region and adequate funding , the result is one of the nation 's most expansive freeway networks . 
 The backbone of Phoenix 's freeway system is composed of three major freeways — Interstate 10 , Interstate 17 , and U.S. Route 60 . Interstate 10 , being a transcontinental route between California and Florida , is the most heavily traveled freeway in the Valley of the Sun . Interstate 17 runs down the center of Arizona , connecting Phoenix with Sedona , Prescott , Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon . U.S. Route 60 spans most of the country , but is only a controlled @-@ access highway ( i.e. freeway ) for a few short stints , one of them being in the East Valley . West of Phoenix , it shuttles travelers to cities such as Wickenburg , Kingman and Las Vegas ( by way of a connection in Wickenburg with U.S. Route 93 ) . In addition to these three freeways , three <unk> , Routes 101 , 202 , and 303 loop around Phoenix , the East Valley , and the West Valley , respectively . State Route 51 connects Downtown with the northern reaches of the city , and Arizona State Route 143 is a distributor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport . 
 Phoenix freeways are funded primarily by local sales tax dollars rather than federal money , so newer freeways were , and are , given state route designation as opposed to Interstate designation . Primarily due to this , Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways and no three @-@ digit Interstates .

 This is Arizona 's widest and most congested freeway , entering the metropolitan area on its western edge in the city of Buckeye as the Papago Freeway . It continues eastward through the cities of Goodyear , Avondale , and Tolleson ; where it has an interchange with northbound Loop 101 . Following Tolleson , I @-@ 10 reaches Phoenix 's western city limits , and as it approaches downtown , there is a four @-@ level symmetrical stack interchange with Interstate 17 known by locals as The Stack . 
 There are numerous construction projects along the Papago Freeway spanning both east and westbound from around Dysart Road in Avondale , to <unk> Way in Buckeye . The projects are expected to convert the current 4 lane divided freeway into a 6 to 10 lane divided freeway . The main project is complete . Along with the anticipation of the completion of State Route 801 , traffic coming in and out of Phoenix is anticipated to be less congested , and easier to manage .

 Beyond The Stack , Interstate 10 proceeds eastward through a tunnel underneath Downtown . The tunnel is locally called the Deck Park tunnel , as Margaret T. Hance Park is located above . Following the tunnel , it reaches the Mini Stack interchange with Loop 202 and SR 51 . Turning southward at this interchange , I @-@ 10 runs adjacent to Sky Harbor International Airport before an interchange with the southern terminus of I @-@ 17 .

There , an interchange with US 60 is located . The freeway enters its final city in the Valley of the Sun , Chandler , where Loop 202 intersects I @-@ 10 at another four @-@ level symmetrical stack interchange before the Interstate enters the Gila River Indian Community and continues on through the undeveloped stretch of desert between Phoenix and the fast @-@ growing town of Casa Grande before making its way towards the Tucson metropolitan area .

 SR 24 , the Williams Gateway Freeway , is located in southeast Mesa near the Phoenix @-@ Mesa Gateway Airport ( after which the freeway was named ) . Although the plan is to connect the entire freeway to either US 60 or another highway alignment in western Pinal County , only a small portion of the freeway between Loop 202 and Ellsworth Road has been constructed and was opened in May 2014 . The rest of the freeway is to be constructed as plans are finalized and funding becomes available . 
 The Williams Gateway Freeway ( formerly SR 802 ) is currently under study in Pinal County ; a public hearing on the draft environmental assessment was held in Fall 2010 .

 The Piestewa Freeway begins at the Mini Stack interchange with I @-@ 10 and Loop 202 , and proceeds north through Phoenix towards Piestewa Peak ( formerly known as Squaw Peak ) . After passing near Paradise Valley , Route 51 reaches its northern terminus at Loop 101 . 
 This freeway was formerly known as the Squaw Peak Parkway , but since " Squaw " is regarded as a derogatory term for Native American women , the Arizona Board of Geographic and Historic Names rechristened the route " Piestewa " Freeway after Lori Piestewa , a Native American woman who died in the conflict with Iraq . The name change was controversial , with most residents still referring to both the freeway and the landmark peak as Squaw Peak .

 Originally signed as Business I @-@ 10 , the Hohokam Expressway is a relatively short north – south freeway that runs east of Sky Harbor International Airport , between Loop 202 and Interstate 10 .

 A recently completed project added two new directional ramps for traffic directed to the airport and to southbound SR 143 destined for I @-@ 10 and reconstructed an existing loop ramp from northbound SR 143 to westbound Sky Harbor Boulevard . There are no additional plans to upgrade or reconstruct any portions of the nearly four @-@ mile expressway .

 The Red Mountain Freeway begins at the Mini Stack junction with Route 51 and Interstate 10 before heading east into Tempe .

The final segment of the Red Mountain Freeway from Power Road to University Drive is open as of July 21 , 2008 . The freeway then continues due southward towards US 60 , until it bisects it at the SuperRedTan Interchange . Loop 202 then becomes the Santan Freeway . 
 During the early years of planning , the segment east of the Mini Stack was designated as the " East Papago Freeway " and extended to a proposed alignment that routed the freeway through the Papago Buttes and on into south Scottsdale along McDowell Road . However , after later revisions moved the ( current ) alignment to angle southeasterly along 52nd St and then skirt the north bank of the Salt River , the freeway was renamed the Red Mountain Freeway , avoiding confusion with the I @-@ 10 Papago Freeway and helping to more consistently identify with future extension to Mesa .

 The Bob Stump Memorial Parkway is a relatively new freeway in the far northwestern area of the Valley , serving cities such as Surprise , Peoria , Glendale , and northern Phoenix . Currently , there are two segments of freeway . The first one , begins at an at grade interchange with I @-@ 17 ( a stack interchange is to be constructed ) . This freeway status continues , with occasional interchanges at Lake Pleasant Parkway , Lone Mountain Parkway , and Happy Valley Parkway ( many others are planned ) , until El Mirage Road . 
 The second segment of freeway begins at the temporary US 60 ( Grand Avenue ) connector road . The freeway opens up to a total of 6 lanes at the Bell Road interchange . The freeway continues all the way to the newly completed stack interchange with I @-@ 10 . Along the way , there is an interchange with every arterial road ( 1 mile intervals ) with the exception of Olive Avenue , which does not have one due to the Northern Parkway interchange . 
 Construction of a parclo interchange with US 60 was to start in late 2014 . Construction of the El Mirage interchange is to start 2016 . The entire segment will be upgraded to a 6 lane freeway and completed by 2016 . The remaining segment which ends at the newly completed stack interchange with I @-@ 10 has already been upgraded to freeway standards . 
 Construction of the freeway south of its junction with Interstate 10 to Van Buren Street is to start in 2016 . Eventually it will connect to proposed Route 30 and possibly Interstate 11 .

( The Estrella Freeway was re @-@ added to the system when Proposition 400 was passed ten years later in 2004 . ) Route 50 will not be re @-@ added to the system , because in February 1996 the ADOT auctioned off all the right @-@ of @-@ way it had purchased for the freeway , which was to be located between Loop 101 and Route 51 in the Central Valley .

The former expressway then ended at University Avenue with no further planned extension to Interstate 10 . 
 Route 153 was deleted from the Regional Transportation Plan starting in May 2007 , and much of the western half of the original alignment was re @-@ used as right @-@ of @-@ way for the Sky Train people mover at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport . It is now an extension of 44th St.

However , the current Regional Transportation Plan does not include funding for these improvements . 
 Beginning in 2002 , work began on a phased implementation plan to upgrade Route 85 from a two @-@ lane rural highway to a four @-@ lane divided highway from its junction with Interstate 10 to just north of the town of Gila Bend . The construction plan , which included a controlled @-@ access intersection with Patterson Road and improvements to the junction with Route 238 in Gila Bend , was completed in 2010 .

 Interstate 11 , the Hassayampa Freeway , is a proposed Interstate Highway in the United States to run from Casa Grande , Arizona Northwest to Las Vegas , Nevada by way of Kingman , Arizona . The highway will parallel existing U.S. 93 north of Wickenburg , Arizona ; south of Wickenburg , it will follow a new freeway near the Hassayampa River , turning Southeast near Southern Goodyear , through Casa Grande and Interstate 10 , and to its terminus with intersection of the proposed Pinal North @-@ South Freeway near Coolidge , AZ . Interstate 11 is part of a long @-@ range vision for the Valley 's future transportation needs , as defined by the Maricopa Association of Governments and ADOT . Interstate 11 was approved June 30 , 2012 as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act . In June 2013 , a joint draft study commissioned by the respective DOTs of Arizona and Nevada concluded that the freeway was justified , citing benefits in travel , tourism , trade , and economic growth . The conclusion of the study further clears the way for Interstate 11 's funding and implementation . 
 = = = Arizona State Route 30 = = = 
 The I @-@ 10 Reliever , a proposed east – west freeway , has been proposed in an effort to move some West Valley motorists off of I @-@ 10 in an attempt to decrease traffic along the frequently congested Interstate . Its western beginning would be at Route 85 , and it would run east to encounter proposed Loop 303 , and continue through to end at Loop 202 's proposed South Mountain Freeway segment . Construction of the proposed Route 30 ( former SR 801 ) , would , if the freeway is approved , begin sometime in the early 2020s , based on funding and planning by the Maricopa Association of Governments . Following the approval of Interstate 11 in the 2012 Surface Transportation Act , a study for a Westward extension of <unk> to I @-@ 11 will be conducted by MAG .

 = = = Loop 202 ( South Mountain Freeway ) = = = 
 The South Mountain Freeway is a planned southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix which will cut through South Mountain Park and the southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix . It will begin at the already complete traffic interchange of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10 . Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee , the freeway will straddle the border with the Gila River Indian Reservation . Turning northwest and eventually north , the South Mountain Freeway will follow the 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix . 
 This freeway has long been considered to be the missing link by the region 's planners , who hope to better move regional traffic and provide a better option for vehicles to avoid metro Phoenix . 
 In March 2015 , the Federal Highway Administration issued a Record of Decision selecting a build alternative . Freeway construction will begin in early 2016 , with the Chandler Boulevard extension project to facilitate local access beginning in summer 2015 . The freeway is planned to be open to traffic in late 2019 or early 2020 . 
 Community opposition does exist , mainly from residents of Ahwatukee . While the Maricopa Association of Governments had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway 's proposed route , the eight @-@ lane freeway concept ultimately was pushed by the region 's planners to meet the traffic needs at close to the same cost . For most of 2010 , the Gila River Indian Community , Maricopa Association of Governments , City of Phoenix , ADOT and others discussed movement of the alignment to tribal land , but no agreements were reached .

 ADOT is currently in the study phase of identifying a corridor for the planned Pinal North @-@ South Freeway to serve expected growth in the Pinal County region of the Phoenix Metro area . This future freeway would connect I @-@ 10 around Eloy with the Superstition Freeway ( US 60 ) in Apache Junction , passing through Coolidge and Florence and intersecting with planned future alignments of the Hassayampa Freeway ( I @-@ 11 ) and the Williams Gateway Freeway ( SR 24 ) .

 The table below lists commonly used colloquialisms and nicknames for several interchanges and portions within the freeway system . 
 = = Funding = = 
 Phoenix has been expanding its highway system since 1985 , when voters passed Proposition 300 , which established a half @-@ cent general sales tax to fund new urban freeways that were currently in the Regional Transportation Plan . At the time , this included the unbuilt or partially unbuilt : Sky Harbor Expressway , I @-@ 10 , Route 51 , Route 143 , Loop 101 , and Loop 202 . Most of these were completed by 2005 , with Loop 202 being in the final stage of construction . 
 In 1994 , voters in Maricopa County voted against Proposition 400 , which would have extended the half @-@ cent sales tax extension from 2006 through 2016 had it been passed . Half of this additional funding would have been used for improvements in mass transit as well as new freeways . But because of the defeat , there was no funding beyond fiscal year 2006 , regardless of if the Regional Transportation Plan was completed or not . 
 In 1996 , the Maricopa Association of Governments Regional Council passed a series of bills provided funding for a Long Range Plan between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 . The Red Mountain Freeway , Santan Freeway , and Sky Harbor Expressway segments , all of which were previously unfunded , became prioritized with construction commencing almost immediately . 
 In 1999 , even more funding was given to accelerate construction of the Regional Transportation Plan by the State Legislature , which passed a bill called the " 2007 Acceleration Plan " . This bill forced the State Infrastructure Bank to assist in funds , which assisted in pushing the completion of Regional Transportation Plan forward to the end of 2007 . 
 With the transportation tax set to expire in 2006 , a revived Proposition 400 was put before the voters of Maricopa County in 2004 , ten years after the original vote ended in failure . Proposing an identical half @-@ cent extension of the sales tax , the new proposition would extend the tax a full twenty years as opposed to the original ten . Unlike its predecessor , the proposition passed by a wide 58 @-@ 42 % margin and established funding for several future projects including highways and mass transit . A similar but much more wide @-@ reaching proposal to enact a full one @-@ cent sales tax increase over a thirty @-@ year period on a statewide level , much of which would have gone to funding Phoenix area projects , failed to qualify for the 2008 general election ballot due to issues with the petition . 
 However , the 1985 plan was not fully completed by 2007 due to the lingering unfinished segment of Loop 202 between University Avenue and Power Road in Mesa , where work wrapped up on July 21 , 2008 . 
 = = Ramp metering = = 
 The Phoenix freeway system heavily utilizes ramp meters , with several currently installed in the metropolitan area located on I @-@ 10 , I @-@ 17 , Loop 101 , Loop 202 ( on the Red Mountain Freeway from I @-@ 10 to Gilbert Road , as well as at Dobson and the <unk> Freeway ) , SR 51 , and US 60 . Since their implementation in the 1980s , the goal of these has remained to " break up platoons " of cars by limiting the number that can enter a freeway at a time . The Arizona Department of Transportation ( ADOT ) states that this has been " tremendously successful " . 
 = = Travel times program = = 
 On January 22 , 2008 , a test program was begun by ADOT which involved the placement of travel times to popular commuter destinations on variable message signs along inbound freeway routes during the morning peak hours and outbound routes in the evening . Initially , these signs were only activated on weekdays during peak travel hours ( 6am to 9am and 3pm to 7pm ) and did not appear if there is a more urgent message to display ; such as an Amber Alert or other emergency . In late July 2015 , the hours when travel times were displayed were extended . Travel times are now displayed from 5am to 11pm on weekdays , and 7am to 9pm on weekends . 
 = = Logo signing program = = 
 Beginning in late 2013 , several Phoenix area freeways began to receive logo signs at select exits , advertising food , lodging , gas , and attractions businesses . This program was previously restricted only to rural highways within the state until the restriction was lifted in 2013 , allowing the installation of these signs on most Phoenix area freeways and allowing increased revenue to the state . Eventually most Phoenix area freeway segments are planned to have logo signs installed at most exits , with <unk> expected to be complete in May 2016 except on Loop 303 , which is planned for 2018 . 
 Note that I @-@ 10 from Dysart Road westward , I @-@ 17 north of the Loop 303 interchange , and US 60 east of the SuperRedTan interchange has had logo signs installed for many years , but have always been considered part of the state 's rural logo sign program . These freeway segments are planned to be transitioned to the urban program in terms of sign pricing . 
 = M @-@ 72 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 72 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan , running from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan across the northern part of the Lower Peninsula . The highway connects M @-@ 22 in Empire with US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) in Harrisville . It is one of only three Michigan state trunklines that cross the Lower Peninsula , shore to shore . In between , M @-@ 72 runs across Northern Michigan woodland , agricultural areas of the Leelanau Peninsula near Traverse City , and the Au Sable River watershed . The trunkline also provides access to Camp Grayling , a National Guard training facility near the city of the same name . Traffic levels along the highway vary from approximately 800 vehicles a day on the east end to over 32 @,@ 000 vehicles near Traverse City . 
 M @-@ 72 was first designated as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route . It was extended southward in the mid @-@ 1920s and westward in the 1940s . One section of the modern highway added to M @-@ 72 in 1940 previously existed as M @-@ 208 in the 1930s east of Grayling . Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected from the rest of M @-@ 72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade . All of M @-@ 72 was completely paved by the early 1960s . The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s , and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 72 starts its trans @-@ peninsular journey at M @-@ 22 in the community of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore . From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula . As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City , the roadway runs downhill and weaves back and forth across the Leelanau – Grand Traverse county line . M @-@ 72 merges with M @-@ 22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County . The two highways run along Grandview Parkway , a four @-@ lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay . At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street , M @-@ 22 ends . US 31 / M @-@ 37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M @-@ 72 . These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay , bypassing downtown . They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown . At Garfield , M @-@ 37 turns north to run up the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay . US 31 / M @-@ 72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme . M @-@ 72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek . 
 The highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and continues eastward to Kalkaska . There , M @-@ 72 meets US 131 / M @-@ 66 ( Cedar Street ) on the north side of downtown , and M @-@ 72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown . South of town , the highway crosses the Boardman River again , and M @-@ 72 turns east again headed toward the city of Grayling . M @-@ 66 follows M @-@ 72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City . M @-@ 72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska – Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp Grayling military reservation . North of the camp gate , M @-@ 72 joins M @-@ 93 into downtown Grayling . Together they meet James Street , which carries Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) . M @-@ 93 turns north to follow BL I @-@ 75 out of town , and M @-@ 72 turns south to follow it through downtown . At South Down River Road , M @-@ 72 turns east again to leave Grayling , crossing I @-@ 75 in the process . There is no direct access to I @-@ 75 from M @-@ 72 . Instead traffic is directed to follow BL I @-@ 75 in either direction to get to the freeway . 
 In eastern Crawford County , M @-@ 72 runs through the Au Sable State Forest and crosses the South Branch of the Au Sable River on the Wakeley Bridge . East of the river crossing , the trunkline intersects the northern terminus of M @-@ 18 before crossing into Oscoda County . M @-@ 72 continues east through Luzerne to Mio . M @-@ 72 merges with M @-@ 33 and turns north to cross the Au Sable River a second time in Mio . The highways pick up a concurrency with F @-@ 32 north of the river . The three roadways run together until F @-@ 32 turns west while M @-@ 33 / M @-@ 72 continues east to Fairview . Fairview marks the northern and eastern end of the concurrency as M @-@ 33 turns north towards Atlanta , and M @-@ 72 continues easterly into Alcona County . North of Curran , M @-@ 72 merges southward with M @-@ 65 for approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) before heading due east through the Barton City and Lincoln areas to Harrisville . M @-@ 72 ends at an intersection with US 23 in Harrisville , on the shores of Lake Huron . 
 M @-@ 72 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system . As a part of its maintenance duties , the department tracks the traffic volumes along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This figure is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the MDOT surveys found that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 72 were the 33 @,@ 720 vehicles per day in Traverse City . The lowest AADT was 807 vehicles near Hubbard Lake Road in Alcona County near Lincoln . Commercial traffic varied between the 555 trucks a day in <unk> and the 72 trucks daily west of Harrisville . M @-@ 72 has been listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) between the intersection of Division Street and Grandview Parkway in Traverse City and the southern junction with BL I @-@ 75 in Grayling . The NHS is a network of roads important to the country 's defense , mobility and economy . In addition to the NHS listing , M @-@ 72 has been included on the Lake Michigan Circle Tour along its segments concurrent with M @-@ 22 and US 31 in the Traverse City area . 
 = = History = = 
 M @-@ 72 was first designated by July 1 , 1919 , and it ran from the middle of Alcona County near Barton City east to Harrisville and then south along Lake Huron shore to Greenbush . Around 1927 , the route was extended south to Oscoda and west through Luzerne to just east of Roscommon . The section of M @-@ 72 along the shoreline between Oscoda and Harrisville became part of US 23 @.@ in 1936 . M @-@ 72 was extended westward on an earthen highway and then over the former M @-@ 208 to Grayling in 1940 . From there M @-@ 72 was extended further to just south of Kalkaska along a section of highway previously designated M @-@ 76 . A seven @-@ mile ( 11 km ) long discontinuous segment of highway some 45 miles ( 72 km ) west of Kalkaska near Empire was also redesignated as part of M @-@ 72 . The section of highway south to Roscommon became M @-@ 144 . By 1945 , the western segment was extended east into Traverse City . The two segments were joined when M @-@ 72 was routed along US 31 through Traverse City to Acme by early 1948 . From there , M @-@ 72 was routed along existing roads through Williamsburg to US 131 / M @-@ 66 north of Kalkaska where it followed the latter highways through downtown to bridge the gap . With this addition to the routing , the road extended " shore to shore " from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M @-@ 33 / M @-@ 72 near Fairview in late 1951 or early 1952 , turning the former route back to local control . In the middle of 1953 , the section of M @-@ 65 / M @-@ 72 in Alcona County was straightened and paved . All but the western three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of the earthen highway section opened in 1940 were paved in 1957 . By the middle of 1961 , the highway would be paved in its entirety . A new section of highway was opened in 1973 , rerouting M @-@ 66 and M @-@ 72 due west from their junction to US 131 , bypassing a former routing north into Kalkaska .

 = Society of the Song dynasty = 
 Chinese society during the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) was marked by political and legal reforms , a philosophical revival of Confucianism , and the development of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade , industry , and maritime commerce . The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers , although some were also hunters , fishers , or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes . Conversely , shopkeepers , artisans , city guards , entertainers , laborers , and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the Chinese gentry — a small , elite community of educated scholars and scholar @-@ officials . 
 As landholders and drafted government officials , the gentry considered themselves the leading members of society ; gaining their cooperation and employment was essential for the county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties . In many ways , scholar @-@ officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar @-@ officials of the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) . Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased . Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife and the rise of political factions . This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite , which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service . 
 Confucian or Legalist scholars in ancient China — perhaps as far back as the late Zhou dynasty ( c . 1046 – 256 BC ) — categorized all socio @-@ economic groups into four broad and hierarchical occupations ( in descending order ) : the shi ( scholars , or gentry ) , the <unk> ( peasant farmers ) , the gong ( artisans and craftsmen ) , and the shang ( merchants ) . Wealthy landholders and officials possessed the resources to better prepare their sons for the civil service examinations , yet they were often rivaled in their power and wealth by merchants of the Song period . Merchants frequently colluded commercially and politically with officials , despite the fact that scholar @-@ officials looked down on mercantile vocations as less respectable pursuits than farming or craftsmanship . The military also provided a means for advancement in Song society for those who became officers , even though soldiers were not highly respected members of society . Although certain domestic and familial duties were expected of women in Song society , they nonetheless enjoyed a wide range of social and legal rights in an otherwise patriarchal society . Women 's improved rights to property came gradually with the increasing value of dowries offered by brides ' families . 
 Daoism and Buddhism were the dominant religions of China in the Song era , the latter deeply impacting many beliefs and principles of Neo @-@ Confucianism throughout the dynasty . Ironically , Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time . Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology , folk religion , and ancestor worship also played a large part in people 's daily lives , as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm . 
 The Song justice system was maintained by policing sheriffs , investigators , official coroners , and exam @-@ drafted officials who became county magistrates . Song magistrates were encouraged to apply both their practical knowledge as well as the written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality . Advancements in early forensic science , a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence , and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals .

 = = = Urban growth and management = = = 
 Chinese cities of the Song period became some of the largest in the world , owing to technological advances and an agricultural revolution . Kaifeng , which served as the capital and seat of government during the Northern Song ( 960 – 1127 ) , had some half a million residents in 1021 , with another half @-@ million living in the city 's nine designated suburbs . By 1100 , the civilian population within the city walls was 1 @,@ 050 @,@ 000 ; the army stationed there brought the total to 1 @.@ 4 million . Hangzhou , the capital during the Southern Song ( 1127 – 1279 ) , had more than 400 @,@ 000 inhabitants during the late 12th century , primarily due to its trading position at the southern terminus of the Grand Canal , known as the lower Yangzi 's " grain basket . " During the 13th century , the city 's population soared to approximately a million people , with the 1270 census counting 186 @,@ 330 registered families living in the city . Although not as agriculturally rich as areas like western Sichuan , the region of Fujian also underwent a massive population growth ; government records indicate a 1500 % increase in the number of registered households from the years 742 to 1208 . With a thriving shipbuilding industry and new mining facilities , Fujian became the economic powerhouse of China during the Song period . The great seaport of China , Quanzhou , was located in Fujian , and by 1120 its governor claimed that the city 's population had reached some 500 @,@ 000 . The inland <unk> city of Jiankang was also very large at this time , with a population of about 200 @,@ 000 . Robert Hartwell states that from 742 to 1200 the population growth of North China increased by only 54 % percent in comparison to the Southeast which grew by 695 % , the middle Yangzi Valley by 483 % , the Lingnan region by 150 % , and the upper Yangzi Valley by 135 % . From the 8th to 11th centuries the lower Yangzi Valley experienced modest population growth in comparison to other regions of South China . The shift of the capital to Hangzhou did not create an immediate dramatic change in population growth until the period from 1170 to 1225 , when new polders allowed land reclamation for nearly all the arable land between Lake Tai and the East China Sea as well as the mouth of the Yangzi to the northern Zhejiang coast . 
 China 's newly commercialized society was evident in the differences between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang 'an . A center of great wealth , Chang 'an 's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt ; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period . On the other hand , Kaifeng 's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role . After the curfew was abolished in 1063 , marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day , whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang 'an starting at dusk ; this curfew limited its commercial potential . Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn . Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way , breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses . Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day , while noodle shops remained open all day and night . People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods . Kaifeng 's wealthy , multi @-@ story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city , rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital . 
 The municipal government of Hangzhou enacted policies and programs that aided in the maintenance of the city and ensured the well @-@ being of its inhabitants . In order to maintain order in such a large city , four or five guards were quartered in the city at intervals of about 300 yards ( 270 m ) . Their main duties were to prevent brawls and thievery , patrol the streets at night , and quickly warn the public when fires broke out . The government assigned 2 @,@ 000 soldiers to 14 fire stations built to combat the spread of fire within the city , and stationed 1 @,@ 200 soldiers in fire stations outside the city 's ramparts . These stations were placed 500 yards ( 460 m ) apart , with watchtowers that were permanently manned by 100 men each . Like earlier cities , the Song capitals featured wide , open avenues to create fire breaks . However , widespread fires remained a constant threat . When a fire broke out in 1137 , the government suspended the requirement of rent payments , alms of 108 @,@ 840 kg ( 120 tons ) of rice were distributed to the poor , and items such as bamboo , planks , and rush @-@ matting were exempt from government taxation . Fires were not the only problem facing the residents of Hangzhou and other crowded cities . Far more than in the rural countryside , poverty was widespread and became a major topic of debate at the central court and in local governments . To mitigate its effects , the Song government enacted many initiatives , including the distribution of alms to the poor ; the establishment of public clinics , pharmacies , and retirement homes ; and the creation of paupers ' graveyards . In fact , each administrative prefecture had public hospitals managed by the state , where the poor , aged , sick , and incurable could be cared for , free of charge . 
 In order to maintain swift communication from one town or city to another , the Song laid out many miles of roadways and hundreds of bridges throughout rural China . They also maintained an efficient postal service nicknamed the hot @-@ foot relay , which featured thousands of postal officers managed by the central government . Postal clerks kept records of dispatches , and postal stations maintained a staff of cantonal officers who guarded mail delivery routes . After the Song period , the Yuan dynasty transformed the postal system into a more militarized organization , with couriers managed under controllers . This system persisted from the 14th century until the 19th century , when the telegraph and modern road @-@ building were introduced to China from the West . 
 = = = Amusements and pastimes = = = 
 A wide variety of social clubs for affluent Chinese became popular during the Song period . A text dated 1235 mentions that in Hangzhou City alone there was the West Lake Poetry Club , the Buddhist Tea Society , the Physical Fitness Club , the Anglers ' Club , the Occult Club , the Young Girls ' Chorus , the Exotic Foods Club , the Plants and Fruits Club , the Antique Collectors ' Club , the Horse @-@ Lovers ' Club , and the Refined Music Society . No formal event or festival was complete without banquets , which necessitated catering companies . 
 The entertainment quarters of Kaifeng , Hangzhou , and other cities featured amusements including snake charmers , sword <unk> , fortunetellers , acrobats , puppeteers , actors , storytellers , tea houses and restaurants , and brokers offering young women who could serve as hired maids , concubines , singing girls , or prostitutes . These entertainment quarters , covered bazaars known as pleasure grounds , were places where strict social morals and formalities could be largely ignored . The pleasure grounds were located within the city , outside the ramparts near the gates , and in the suburbs ; each was regulated by a state @-@ appointed official . Games and entertainments were an all @-@ day affair , while the taverns and singing girl houses were open until two o 'clock in the morning . While being served by waiters and ladies who heated up wine for parties , drinking playboys in winehouses would often be approached by common folk called " idlers " ( <unk> ) who offered to run errands , fetch and send money , and summon singing girls . 
 Dramatic performances , often accompanied by music , were popular in the markets . The actors were distinguished in rank by type and color of clothing , honing their acting skills at drama schools . Satirical sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular . Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese ; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the subsequent Yuan dynasty . Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language , acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest social groups in society : prostitutes . Of the fifty some theatres located in the pleasure grounds of Kaifeng , four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each , drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon . 
 There were also many vibrant public festivities held in cities and rural communities . Martial arts were a source of public entertainment ; the Chinese held fighting matches on lei tai , a raised platform without rails . With the rise in popularity of distinctive urban and domestic activities during the Song dynasty , there was a decline in traditional outdoor Chinese pastimes such as hunting , horseback riding , and polo . In terms of domestic leisure , the Chinese enjoyed a host of different activities , including board games such as xiangqi and go . There were lavish garden spaces designated for those wishing to stroll , and people often took their boats out on the lake to entertain guests or to stage boat races . 
 = = Rural life = = 
 In many ways , life for peasants in the countryside during the Song dynasty was similar to those living in previous dynasties . The people spent their days ploughing and planting in the fields , tending to their families , selling crops and goods at local markets , visiting local temples , and arranging ceremonies such as marriages . Cases of banditry , which local officials were forced to combat , occurred constantly in the countryside . 
 There were varying types of land ownership and tenure depending on the topography and climate of one 's locality . In hilly , peripheral areas far from trade routes , most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields . In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan , owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands . The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields ; these regions had long fostered wet @-@ rice cultivation , which did not require centralized management of farming . Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions , while independent small farming families also owned their own lots . 
 The Song government provided tax incentives to farmers who tilled lands along the edges of lakes , marshes , seas , and terraced mountain slopes . Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes . The 10th century introduction of early @-@ ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China , which experienced rapid development . The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques . An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings , sufficient weeding , maintenance of water levels , and draining of fields for harvest . Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work , since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet . For other crops , water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields , while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread .

 One of the fundamental changes in Chinese society from the Tang to the Song dynasty was the transformation of the scholarly elite , which included the scholar @-@ officials and all those who held examination degrees or were candidates of the civil service examinations . The Song scholar @-@ officials and examination candidates were better educated , less aristocratic in their habits , and more numerous than in the Tang period . Following the logic of the Confucian philosophical classics , Song scholar @-@ officials viewed themselves as highly moralistic figures whose responsibility was to keep greedy merchants and power @-@ hungry military men in their place . Even if a degree @-@ holding scholar was never appointed to an official government post , he nonetheless felt himself responsible for upholding morality in society , and became an elite member of his community . 
 Arguably the most influential factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations . Although not all scholar @-@ officials came from the landholding class , sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education , and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service . Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural , circuit @-@ level , or palace exams in the Song period was the most important prerequisite in being considered for appointment , especially to higher posts ; this was a departure from the Tang period , when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale . A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government . Not only did this ensure a higher salary , but also greater social prestige , visibly distinguished by dress . This institutionalized distinction of scholar @-@ officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes , hats , and girdles , demarcating that scholar @-@ official 's level of administrative authority . This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty , although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials . 
 Scholar @-@ officials and gentry also distinguished themselves through their intellectual pursuits . While some such as Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) and Su Song ( 1020 – 1101 ) dabbled in every known field of science , study , and statecraft , Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry , art collecting and antiquarianism . Yet even this pursuit could turn into a scholarly one . It was the official , historian , poet , and essayist Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 – 1072 ) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology . Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study , in order to aid his work in astronomy , mathematics , and recording ancient musical measures . The scholar @-@ official and historian Zeng Gong ( 1019 – 1083 ) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce , proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version . The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits for the good of the community , such as writing local histories or gazetteers . In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song , their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal . 
 Along with intellectual pursuits , the gentry exhibited habits and cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement . The erudite term of enjoying the company of the ' nine guests ' ( <unk> , <unk> ) — an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar — was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither , playing Chinese chess , Zen Buddhist meditation , ink ( calligraphy and painting ) , tea drinking , alchemy , chanting poetry , conversation , and drinking wine . The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song , due to underlying political , demographic , and social circumstance . Northern Song gentry and officials , who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs , preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a larger context . During the Southern Song , political , familial , and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests ; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings , where small , intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized . 
 The wealthy families living on the estates of these scholar @-@ officials – as well as rich merchants , princes , and nobles — often maintained a massive entourage of employed servants , technical staffs , and personal favorites . They hired personal artisans such as jewellers , sculptors , and embroiderers , while servants cleaned house , shopped for goods , attended to kitchen duties , and prepared furnishings for banquets , weddings , and funerals . Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries , copyists , and hired tutors to educate their sons . They were also the patrons of musicians , painters , poets , chess players , and storytellers . 
 The historian Jacques Gernet stresses that these servants and favorites hosted by rich families represented the more fortunate members of the lower class . Other laborers and workers such as water @-@ carriers , navvies , peddlers , <unk> , and soothsayers " lived for the most part from hand to mouth . " The entertainment business in the covered bazaars in the marketplace and at the entrances of bridges also provided a lowly means of occupation for storytellers , puppeteers , jugglers , acrobats , tightrope walkers , exhibitors of wild animals , and old soldiers who flaunted their strength by lifting heavy beams , iron weights , and stones for show . These people found the best and most competitive work during annual festivals . In contrast , the rural poor consisted mostly of peasant farmers . However , some in rural areas chose vocations centered chiefly around hunting , fishing , forestry , and state @-@ offered occupations such as mining or working in the salt marshes . 
 According to their Confucian ethics , elite and cultured scholar @-@ officials viewed themselves as the pinnacle members of society ( second only to the imperial family ) . Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society ; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant , no matter how rich and powerful . The Confucian @-@ taught scholar @-@ official elite who ran China 's vast bureaucracy viewed their society 's growing interest in commercialism as a sign of moral decay . Nonetheless , Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers , shippers , storage keepers , brokers , traveling salesmen , retail shopkeepers , peddlers , and many other lowly commercial @-@ based vocations . 
 Despite the scholar @-@ officials ' suspicion and disdain for powerful merchants , the latter often colluded with the scholarly elite . The scholar @-@ officials themselves often became involved in mercantile affairs , blurring the lines of who did and did not belong to the merchant class . Even rural farmers engaged in the small @-@ scale production of wine , charcoal , paper , textiles , and other goods . Theoretically it was forbidden for an official to partake in private affairs of gaining capital while serving and receiving a salary from the state . In order to avoid ruining one 's reputation as a moral Confucian , scholar @-@ officials had to work through business intermediaries ; as early as 955 a written decree revealed the use of intermediary agents for private business transactions with foreign countries . Since the Song government took over several key industries and imposed strict state monopolies , the government itself acted as a large commercial enterprise run by scholar @-@ officials . The state also had to contend with the merchant and artisan guilds ; whenever the state requisitioned goods and assessed taxes it dealt with guild heads , who ensured fair prices and fair wages via official intermediaries . Yet joining a guild was an immediate means to neither empowerment nor independence ; historian Jacques Gernet states : " [ the guilds ] were too numerous and too varied to allow their influence to be felt . " 
 From the scholar @-@ official 's view , the artisans and craftsmen were essential workers in society on a tier just below the farming peasants , and different from the merchants and traders who were considered parasitic . It was craftsmen and artisans who fashioned and manufactured all of the goods needed in Song society , such as standard @-@ sized waterwheels and chain pumps made by skilled <unk> . Although architects and carpenter builders were not as highly venerated as the scholar @-@ officials , there were some architectural engineers and authors who gained wide acclaim at court and in the public sphere for their achievements . This included the official Li Jie ( 1065 – 1110 ) , a scholar who was eventually promoted to high positions in government agencies of building and engineering . His written manual on building codes and procedures was sponsored by Emperor Huizong ( r . 1100 – 1126 ) for these government agencies to employ and was widely printed for the benefit of literate craftsmen and artisans nationwide . The technical written work of the earlier 10th @-@ century architect Yu Hao was also given a great amount of praise by the polymath scholar @-@ official Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088 . 
 Due to previous episodes of court eunuchs amassing power , they were looked upon with suspicion by scholar @-@ officials and Confucian literati . Still , their association with inner palace life and their frequent appointments to high levels of military command provided them with significant prestige . Although military officers with successful careers could gain a considerable amount of prestige , the soldier in Song society was looked upon with a bit of disdain by scholar @-@ officials and cultured people . This is best reflected in a Chinese proverb : " Good iron isn 't used for nails ; good men aren 't used as soldiers . " This attitude had several roots . Many people who enrolled themselves as soldiers in the armed forces were rural peasants in debt , many of them former workers of the salt trade who could not pay back their loans and had been reduced to flight . However , the prevailing attitude of gentry towards military servicemen stemmed largely from the knowledge of historical precedent , as military leaders in the late Tang dynasty and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms ( 907 – 960 ) period amassed more power than the civil officials , in some respects replacing them and the civilian government altogether . Song emperors expanded the civil service examination system and government school system in order to avoid the earlier scenario of domination by military strongmen over the civil order . 
 = = Education and civil service = = 
 = = = Government schools versus private academies = = = 
 The first nationwide government @-@ funded school system in China was established in the year 3 AD under Emperor Ping of Han ( 9 BC – 5 AD ) . During the Northern Song dynasty , the government gradually reestablished an official school system after it was heavily damaged during the preceding Five Dynasties period . Government @-@ established schools soon eclipsed the role of private academies by the mid @-@ 11th century . At the apex of higher education in the school system were the central schools located in the capital city , the <unk> , the <unk> , and several vocational schools . The first major reform effort to rebuild prefectural and county schools was initiated by Chancellor Fan Zhongyan ( 989 – 1052 ) in the 1040s . Before this time , the bulk of funds allotted for the establishment of prefectural and county schools was left up to private financing and minimal amount of government funding ; Fan 's reform effort started the trend of greater government financing , at least for prefectural schools . Major expansion of educational facilities was initiated by Emperor Huizong , who used funds originally allotted for disaster relief and food @-@ price stabilizing to fund new prefectural and county schools and demoted officials who neglected to repair , rebuild , and maintain these government schools . The historian John W. <unk> states that by the early 12th century the state school system had 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 100 km2 ) of land that could provide for some 200 @,@ 000 student residents living in dormitories . After the widespread destruction of schools during the Jurchen invasions from the 1120s to 1140s , Emperor Gaozong of Song ( r . 1127 – 1162 ) issued an edict to restore prefectural schools in 1142 and county schools in 1148 , although the county schools by and large were reconstructed by the efforts of local county officials ' private fundraising . 
 By the late 12th century , many critics of the examination system and government @-@ run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies . During the course of the Southern Song , the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system . Even those that were semi @-@ private or state @-@ sponsored were still seen as independent of the state 's influence and their teachers uninterested in larger , nationwide issues . One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the <unk> Academy , founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu ( r . 960 – 976 ) . The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy , established during the Tang dynasty . The Neo @-@ Confucian Donglin Academy , established in 1111 , was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school . This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist , prose stylist , and poet Han Yu ( 768 – 824 ) , who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values . Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang ( 937 – 976 ) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song , the Neo @-@ Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi ( 1130 – 1200 ) reinvigorated it . 
 Zhu Xi was one of many critics who argued that government schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation of the self and molded students into officials who cared only for profit and salary . Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as the root of the problem ( but merely as a method of recruitment and selection ) , emphasizing instead the gentry 's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite . Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the Four Books , a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students , yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries . After his death , his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar @-@ officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of Emperor Lizong ( r . 1224 – 1264 ) . 
 = = = Examinations and elite families = = = 
 The number of applicants for the Imperial examinations far outmatched the actual number of jinshi , or " presented scholars " who were given official appointments in the Song dynasty . Five times more jinshi were accepted in the Song period than during the Tang , yet the larger number of degree holders did not lower the prestige of the degree . Rather , it encouraged more to enter and compete in the exams , which were held every three years . Roughly 30 @,@ 000 men took the prefectural exams in the early 11th century , increasing to nearly 80 @,@ 000 around 1100 , and finally to an astonishing 400 @,@ 000 exam takers by the 13th century . With these odds , the chances of an applicant passing the examination and becoming a graduate was 1 in 333 . Once a degree was obtained , however , this did not ensure an immediate path to office . The total number of scholar @-@ officials in the Tang was about 18 @,@ 000 , while the total number in the Song had only increased to about 20 @,@ 000 . With China 's growing population and an almost stagnant number of officials accepted into government , the degree holders who were not appointed to office fulfilled an important role on the grassroots level of society . They became the local elite of their communities , while scholar @-@ officials relied upon them for maintaining order and fulfilling various duties under their jurisdiction . 
 An atmosphere of intellectual competition existed between aspiring Confucian scholars . Wealthy families were eager to gather stacks of published books for their personal libraries , collecting books that covered the Confucian classics as well as philosophical works , mathematical treatises , pharmaceutical documents , Buddhist sutras , and other literature aimed at the gentry class . The advancement of widespread book manufacturing through woodblock printing and then movable type printing by the 11th century aided in the expansion of the number of educated candidates for the civil service exams . These developments also reduced the overall cost of books so that they became more accessible to those of lesser means . 
 Song scholar @-@ officials were granted ranks , honors , and career appointments on the basis of merit , the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty . The anonymity of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and / or signature calligraphy ; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of <unk> all the candidates ' papers before grading . After passing the prefectural , provincial , and then palace exam ( the most prestigious ) , scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office , but the more prestigious the degree , the more certain one 's career in higher administrative posts would be . The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials . The case for removal was always carefully examined , since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official , stored in the capital for later review . 
 Ebrey states that meritocracy and a greater sense of social mobility were also prevalent in the civil service examination system , as the government held a list of all examination graduates , showing that only roughly half of those who passed had a father , or grandfather , or great @-@ grandfather who served as a government official . However , Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes state that this fact , first presented by Edward A. <unk> in 1947 and supported by Sudō Yoshiyuki and Ho Ping @-@ ti , emphasizes the role of the nuclear family and only demonstrates three paternal <unk> of the candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China , the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons , and the role of the extended family . Male children with fathers who were incumbents in office had the advantage of early education and experience , as they were often appointed by their father to low @-@ level staff positions . Yet with the so @-@ called ' protection ' ( yin or yin @-@ bu <unk> / <unk> ) privilege this arrangement was extended to close relatives , as an elder brother , uncle , father @-@ in @-@ law , and even father @-@ in @-@ law to one 's uncle could help one secure a future in office . The Song era poet Su Shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) wrote a poem called On the Birth of My Son , poking fun at the situation of children from affluent and politically connected backgrounds having the upper edge over bright children of lower status : 
 Robert Hartwell notes that in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who dominated the civil service : a founding elite and a professional elite . The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century , their associates , personal staffs , and bureaucrats who had served in the capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties . The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals , claimed prestigious clan ancestry , had intermarried with other prominent families , had members in higher offices over generations , and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century . The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors , the highest official post . From 960 to 986 , the founding military elite from Shanxi , Shaanxi , and Hebei represented 46 % of fiscal offices , people from districts in <unk> — the military governorship of the founding emperor — represented 22 % of fiscal offices , and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13 % of fiscal posts . In the same period , the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90 % of policy @-@ making positions . However , after 983 , when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire , a semi @-@ hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite . After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either policy @-@ making or financial positions . Between 998 and 1085 , the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5 % of the families that had members in policy @-@ making offices , yet they disproportionately held 23 % of these positions . By the late 11th century the professional elite began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service . They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers . Hartwell states that this shift of power was the result of the professional elite 's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century . 
 Before the 1080s , the majority of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background ; afterwards , <unk> patterns of drafting officials became more common . Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song , the shift of power from central to regional administrations , the localized interests of the new gentry , the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations , and the uncertainties of a successful political career in the <unk> split capital led many civil servants to choose positions that would allow them to remain in specific regions . Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long @-@ distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song , as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects . It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong ( r . 1068 – 1085 ) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing a quantity of officials in policy @-@ making posts that were proportionate to their share of China 's total population . From 1125 to 1205 , about 80 % of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low @-@ grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui , southern Jiangsu , Zhejiang , and Fujian provinces . Almost 100 % of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 = = = Administrative units = = = 
 Within the largest political divisions of the Song known as circuits ( lu ) there were a number of prefectures ( zhou ) , which in turn were divided into the smallest political units of counties ( xian ) ; there were about 1 @,@ 230 counties during the Song period . The prefect during the early Northern Song was the prime official of local government authority , who was the lowest regional official allowed to memorialize the throne , was primary tax collector , and head magistrate over several magistrates within his jurisdiction that dealt with civil disputes and maintaining order . By the late Northern Song , the growth in the number of counties with different proportions in population under a prefect 's jurisdiction decreased the importance of the latter office , as it became more difficult for the prefect to manage the counties . This was part of a larger continuum of administrative trends from the Tang to Ming dynasties , with the gradual decline of importance of intermediate administrative units — the prefectures — alongside a shift of power from central government to large regional administrations ; the latter experienced progressively less influence of central government in their routine affairs . In the Southern Song , four semi @-@ autonomous regional command systems were established based on territorial and military units ; this influenced the model of detached service secretariats which became the provincial administrations ( sheng ) of the Yuan ( 1279 – 1368 ) , Ming ( 1368 – 1644 ) , and Qing ( 1644 – 1912 ) dynasties . The administrative control of the Southern Song central government over the empire became increasingly limited to the circuits located in closer proximity to the capital at Hangzhou , while those farther away practiced greater autonomy . 
 = = = Official careers = = = 
 After the tumultuous An Lushan Rebellion ( 755 – 763 ) , the early Tang career path of officials rising in a hierarchy of six ministries — with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest — was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within one of the six ministries . The commissions of Salt and Iron , Funds , and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan 's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies . The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries : Personnel , Revenue , Rites , War , Justice , or Works . As China 's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently . As a result of this , in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries , each with different levels of prestige . 
 In observing a multitude of biographies and funerary inscriptions , Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests , as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs for the benefit of their local prefecture or county . This trend was reversed in the Southern Song . Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui , Jiangsu , Zhejiang , and Fujian , Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies . 
 Lower @-@ grade officials on the county and prefectural levels performed the necessary duties of administration such as collecting taxes , overseeing criminal cases , implementing efforts to fight famine and natural calamity , and occasionally supervising market affairs or public works . Since the growth of China 's population far outmatched the total number of officials accepted as administrators in the Song government , educated gentry who had not been appointed to an official post were entrusted as supervisors of affairs in rural communities . It was the " upper gentry " of high @-@ grade officials in the capital — comprising mostly those who passed the palace exams — who were in a position to influence and reform society . 
 = = = Political partisanship and reform = = = 
 The high echelons of the political scene during the Song dynasty left a notorious legacy of partisanship and strife among factions of state ministers . The careers of low @-@ grade and middle @-@ grade officials were largely secure ; in the high ranks of the central administration , " reverses of fortune were to be feared , " as Sinologist historian Jacques Gernet put it . The Chancellor Fan Zhongyan ( 989 – 1052 ) introduced a series of reforms between 1043 and 1045 that received heated backlash from the conservative element at court . Fan set out to erase corruption from the recruitment system by providing higher salaries for minor officials , in order to persuade them not to become corrupt and take bribes . He also established sponsorship programs that would ensure officials were drafted on their merits , administrative skills , and moral character more than their etiquette and cultured appearance . However , the conservatives at court did not want their career paths and comfortable positions jeopardized by new standards , so they rallied to successfully halt the reforms . 
 Inspired by Fan , the later Chancellor Wang Anshi ( 1021 – 1086 ) implemented a series of reforms in 1069 upon his ascendance to office . Wang promulgated a community @-@ based law enforcement and civil order known as the <unk> system . Wang Anshi attempted to diminish the importance of landholding and private wealth in favor of mutual @-@ responsibility social groups that shared similar values and could be easily controlled by the government . Just as scholar @-@ officials owed their social prestige to their government degrees , Wang wanted to structure all of society as a mass of dependents loyal to the central government . He used various means , including the prohibition of landlords offering loans to tenants ; this role was assumed by the government . Wang established local militias that could aid the official standing army and lessen the constrained state budget expenses for the military . He set up low @-@ cost loans for the benefit of rural farmers , whom he viewed as the backbone of the Song economy . Since the land tax exacted from rural farmers filled the state treasury 's coffers , Wang implemented a reform to update the land @-@ survey system so that more accurate assessments could be gathered . Wang removed the mandatory poetry requirement in the civil service exams , on the grounds that many otherwise skilled and knowledgeable Confucian students were being denied entry into the administration . Wang also established government monopolies for tea , salt , and wine production . All of these programs received heavy criticism from conservative ministerial peers , who believed his reforms damaged local family wealth which provided the basis for the production of examination candidates , managers , merchants , landlords , and other essential members of society . Historian Paul J. Smith writes that Wang 's reforms — the New Policies — represented the professional bureaucratic elite 's final attempt to bring the thriving economy under state control to remedy the lack of state resources in combating powerful enemies to the north — the Liao and Western Xia . 
 Winston W. Lo argues that Wang 's obstinate behavior and inability to consider revision or annulment of his reforms stemmed from his conviction that he was a latter @-@ day sage . Confucian scholars of the Song believed that the ' way ' ( dao ) embodied in the Five Classics was known by the ancient sages and was transmitted from one sage to another in an almost telepathic manner , but after it reached Mencius ( c . 372 – c . 289 BC ) there was no one worthy of accepting the transference of the dao . Some believed that the long dormant dao could be revived if one were truly a sage ; Lo writes of Song Neo @-@ Confucianists , " it is this self @-@ image which explained their militant stand in relation to conventional ethics and scholarship . " Wang defined his life mission as restoring the unity of dao , as he believed it had not departed from the world but had become fragmented by schools of Confucian thought , each one propagating only half @-@ truths . Lo asserts that Wang , believing that he was in possession of the dao , followed Yi Zhi and the Duke of Zhou 's classic examples in resisting the wishes of selfish or foolish men by ignoring criticism and public opinion . If unflinching certitude in his <unk> and faultless reforms was not enough , Wang sought potential allies and formed a coalition that became known as the New Policies Group , which in turn emboldened his known political rivals to band together in opposition to him . Yet factional power struggles were not steeped in ideological discourse alone ; cliques had formed naturally with shifting alliances of professional elite lineages and efforts to obtain a greater share of available offices for one 's immediate and extended kinship over vying competitors . People such as Su Shi also opposed Wang 's faction on practical grounds ; for example , Su 's critical poem hinting that Wang 's salt monopoly hindered effective salt distribution . 
 Wang resigned in 1076 and his leaderless faction faced uncertainty with the death of its patron emperor in 1085 . The political faction led by the historian and official Sima Guang ( 1019 – 1086 ) then took control of the central government , allied with the dowager empress who acted as regent over the young Emperor Zhezong of Song ( r . 1085 – 1100 ) . Wang 's new policies were completely reversed , including popular reforms like the tax substitution for corvée labor service . When Emperor Zhezong came of age and replaced his grandmother as the state power , he favored Wang 's policies and once again instituted the reforms in 1093 . The reform party was favored during the reign of Huizong ( r . 1100 – 1125 ) while conservatives were persecuted — especially during the chancellery of Cai Jing ( 1047 – 1126 ) . As each political faction gained advantage over the other , ministers of the opposing side were labeled " obstructionist " and were sent out of the capital to govern remote frontier regions of the empire . This form of political exile was not only politically damaging , but could also be physically threatening . Those who fell from favor could be sent to govern areas of the deep south where the deadly disease malaria was prevalent .

 The Chinese philosophy of Confucius ( 551 – 479 BC ) and the hierarchical social order his disciples adhered to had become embedded into mainstream Chinese culture since the reign of Emperor Wu of Han ( r . 141 – 87 BC ) . During the Song dynasty , the entire Chinese society was theoretically modelled upon this familial social order of superiors and inferiors . Confucian dogma dictated what was proper moral behavior , and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one 's family . This is exemplified in the Tang law code , which was largely retained in the Song period . Gernet writes : " The family relationships supposed to exist in the ideal family were the foundation of the entire moral outlook , and even the law , in its total structure and its scale of penalties , was nothing but a codified expression of them . " 
 Under the Tang law code compiled in the 7th century , severe punishments were outlined for those who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders . Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death , those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor , and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning . A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death , while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state . Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse ; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one 's parents into abstract , otherworldly figures . Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles , but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior . 
 <unk> the family cult with many descendants was coupled with the notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection , reinforcing its power in the community . More children meant better odds of extending a family 's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families , as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government . Hymes notes that " elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth , prospects for office , length of pedigree , scholarly renown , and local reputation in choosing both sons @-@ in @-@ law and daughters @-@ in @-@ law . " Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior , a family that acquired a significant amount of sons @-@ in @-@ law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members . Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity , and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes . No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family , as it was common for upper @-@ class families to have several generations living in the same household . However , one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community . This could be done by accepting any number of artificial blood brothers in a ceremony assuring mutual obligations and shared loyalty . 
 In Song society , governed by the largely unaltered Tang era legal code , the act of primogeniture was not practiced in Chinese inheritance of property , and in fact was illegal . When the head of a family died , his offspring equally divided the property . This law was implemented in the Tang dynasty in order to challenge the powerful aristocratic clans of the northwest , and to prevent the rise of a society domineered by landed nobility . If an official family did not produce another official within a few generations , the future prospects of that family remaining wealthy and influential became uncertain . Thus , the legal issues of familial inheritance had profound effects upon the rest of society . 
 When a member of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members , each one behaving differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased . There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning , and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities . This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors , which in turn raised the prestige of the family . Funerals were often expensive . A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead , caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet , and there was always the purchase of the coffin , which was burned along with paper images of horses , carriages , and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life . Due to the high cost of burial , most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation . This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult . They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972 ; despite this , cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted . By the 12th century , the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family 's deceased could be buried on state owned property . 
 = = = Women : legality and lifestyles = = = 
 Historians note that women during the Tang dynasty were brazen , assertive , active , and relatively more socially liberated than Song women . Women of the Song period are typically seen as well educated and interested in expressing themselves through poetry , yet more reserved , respectful , " slender , petite and dainty , " according to Gernet . Evidence of foot binding as a new trend in the Southern Song period certainly reinforces this notion . However , the greater number of documents due to more widespread printing reveal a much more complex and rich reality about family life and Song women . Through written stories , legal cases , and other documents , many different sources show that Song women held considerable clout in family decision @-@ making , and some were quite economically savvy . Men dominated the public sphere , while affluent wives spent most of their time indoors enjoying leisure activities and managing the household . However , women of the lower and middle classes were not solely bound to the domestic sphere . It was common for women to manage town inns , some to manage restaurants , farmers ' daughters to weave mats and sell them on their own behalf , midwives to deliver babies , Buddhist nuns to study religious texts and sutras , female nurses to assist physicians , and women to keep a close eye on their own financial affairs . In the case of the latter , legal case documents describe childless widows who accused their nephews of stealing their property . There are also numerous mentions of women drawing upon their dowries to help their husband 's sisters marry into other prominent families . 
 The economic prosperity of the Song period prompted many families to provide their daughters with larger dowries in order to attract the wealthiest sons @-@ in @-@ law to provide a stable life of economic security for their daughters . With large amounts of property allotted to a daughter 's dowry , her family naturally sought benefits ; as a result women 's legal claims to property were greatly improved . Under certain circumstances , an unmarried daughter without brothers or a surviving mother without sons could inherit one @-@ half of her father 's share of undivided family property Under the Song law code , if an heirless man left no clear successor to his property and household , it was his widowed wife 's right to designate her own heir in a process called <unk> ( " adopting an heir " ) . If an heir was appointed by the parents ' relatives after their deaths , the " appointed " heir did not have the same rights as a biological son to inherit the estate ; instead he shared <unk> ( " extinct household " ) property with the parents ' daughter ( s ) , if there were any . 
 Divorcing a spouse was permissible if there was mutual consent , while remarriage after the death of a spouse was common during the Song period . However , widows under post @-@ Song dynasties did not often remarry , following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi ( 1033 – 1107 ) , who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying . Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1912 ) , yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior . 
 Despite advances in relative social freedoms and legal rights , women were still expected to attend to the duties of the home . Along with child @-@ rearing , women were responsible for spinning yarn , weaving cloth , sewing clothing , and cooking meals . Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy , since their duties included <unk> the silkworms , feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves , and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons . In the family pecking order , the dominant female of the household was the mother @-@ in @-@ law , who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons . Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons , since these men often stayed at home . If a mother @-@ in @-@ law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters @-@ in @-@ law , there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants . There were also many professional courtesans ( and concubines brought into the house ) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment , relations , and romantic affairs . It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home . Yet two could play at this game . The ideal of the chaste , modest , and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou , where there were greedy and flirtatious women , as one author put it . This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them , and so took on as many as five ' complementary husbands ' ; if they lived close to a monastery , even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers . 
 Although boys were taught at Confucian academies for the ultimate goal of government service , girls were often taught by their brothers how to read and write . By Song times , more women of the upper and educated classes were able to read due to advances in widespread printing , leaving behind a treasury of letters , poems , and other documents penned by women . Some women were educated enough to teach their sons before they were sent to an official school . For example , the mother of the statesman and scientist Shen Kuo taught him basic education and even military strategy that she had learned from her elder brother . Hu Wenrou , a granddaughter of a famous Song official Hu Su , was regarded by Shen Kuo as a remarkable female mathematician , as Shen would occasionally relay questions to Hu Wenrou through her husband in order for her to review and investigate possible errors in his mathematical work . Li Qingzhao ( 1084 – 1151 ) , whose father was a friend of Su Shi , wrote many poems throughout her often turbulent life ( only about 100 of these survive ) and became a renowned poet during her lifetime . After the death of her husband , she wrote poems profusely about poring over his paintings , calligraphy , and ancient bronze vessels , as well as poems with deep emotional longing : 
 = = Religion and philosophy = = 
 Ancient Chinese Daoism , ancestor worship , and foreign @-@ originated Buddhism were the most prominent religious practices in the Song period . Daoism developed largely from the teachings of the Daodejing , attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ( " Old Master " ) , considered one of the Three Pure Ones ( the prime deities of Daoism ) . Buddhism in China , introduced by Yuezhi , Persian , and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries , gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism . 
 Many followed the teachings of Buddha and prominent monks such as <unk> <unk> ( 1089 – 1163 ) and Wuzhun Shifan ( 1178 – 1249 ) . However , there were also many critics of Buddhism 's religious and philosophical tenets . This included the ardent nativist , scholar , and statesman Ouyang Xiu , who called Buddhism a " curse " upon China , an alien tradition that infiltrated the native beliefs of his country while at its weakest during the Southern and Northern Dynasties ( 420 – 581 ) . The contention over Buddhism was at times a divisive issue within the gentry class and even within families . For example , the historian Zeng Gong lamented over the success of Buddhism , viewing it as a competing ideology with ' the Way of the Sages ' of Confucianism , yet on his death in 1083 was buried in a Buddhist temple that his grandfather had helped build and that his brother Zeng Bu was able to declare as a private Merit Cloister for the family . Although conservative proponents of native Confucianism were highly skeptical of the teachings of Buddhism and often sought to distance themselves from it , others used Buddhist teachings to bolster their own Confucian philosophy . The Neo @-@ Confucian philosophers and brothers Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi of the 11th century sought philosophical explanations for the workings of principle ( li ) and vital energy ( qi ) in nature , responding to the notions of highly complex metaphysics in popular Buddhist thought . Neo @-@ Confucian scholars also sought to borrow the Mahayana Buddhist ideal of self @-@ sacrifice , welfare , and charity embodied in the bodhisattva . Seeking to replace the Buddhist monastery 's once prominent role in societal welfare and charity , supporters of Neo @-@ Confucianism converted this ideal into practical measures of state @-@ sponsored support for the poor under a secular mission of ethical universalism . 
 Buddhism never fully recovered after several major persecutions in China from the 5th through the 10th centuries , although Daoism continued to thrive in Song China . In northern China under the Jin dynasty after 1127 , the Daoist philosopher Wang <unk> ( 1113 – 1170 ) established the Quanzhen School . Wang 's seven disciples , known as the Seven Immortals , gained great fame throughout China . They included the prominent Daoist priestess Sun Bu 'er ( c . 1119 – 1182 ) , who became a female role model in Daoism . There was also Qiu <unk> ( 1148 – 1227 ) , who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen ( " Dragon Gate " ) . In the Southern Song , cult centers of Daoism became popular at mountain sites that were reputed to be the earthly sojourns of Daoist deities ; elite families had shrines erected in these mountain retreats in honor of the local deity thought to reside therein . Much more so than for Buddhist clergy , Daoist priests and holy men were sought when one prayed for having a son , when one was physically ill , or when there was need for change after a long spell of bad weather and poor harvest . 
 Chinese folk religion continued as a tradition in China , drawing upon aspects of both ancient Chinese mythology and ancestor worship . Many people believed that spirits and deities of the spirit realm regularly interacted with the realm of the living . This subject was popular in Song literature . Hong Mai ( 1123 – 1202 ) , a prominent member of an official family from Jiangxi , wrote a popular book called The Record of the Listener , which had many anecdotes dealing with the spirit realm and people 's supposed interactions with it . People in Song China believed that many of their daily misfortunes and blessings were caused by an array of different deities and spirits who interfered with their daily lives . These deities included the nationally accepted deities of Buddhism and Daoism , as well as the local deities and demons from specific geographic locations . If one displeased a long @-@ dead relative , the dissatisfied ancestor would allegedly inflict natural ailments and illnesses . People also believed in mischievous demons and malevolent spirits who had the capability to extort sacrificial offerings meant for ancestors – in essence these were bullies of the spiritual realm . The Chinese believed that spirits and deities had the same emotions and drives as the living did . In some cases the chief deity of a local town or city was believed to act as a municipal official who could receive and dispatch orders on how to punish or reward spirits . Residents of cities offered many sacrifices to their divinities in hopes that their city would be spared from disasters such as fire . However , not only common people felt the need to appease local deities . Magistrates and officials sent from the capital to various places of the empire often had to ensure the locals that his authority was supported by the local deity . 
 = = Justice and law = = 
 One of the duties of scholar @-@ officials was hearing judicial cases in court . However , the county <unk> prefects of the Song period were expected to know more than just the written laws . They were expected to promote morality in society , to punish the wicked , and carefully recognize in their sentences which party in a court case was truly at fault . It was often the most serious cases that came before the court ; most people desired to settle legal quarrels privately , since court preparations were expensive . In ancient China , the accused in court were not viewed as fully innocent until proven otherwise , while even the accuser was viewed with suspicion by the judge . The accused were immediately put in filthy jails and nourished only by the efforts of friends and relatives . Yet the accuser also had to pay a price : in order to have their case heard , Gernet states that they had to provide an offering to the judge as " a matter of decorum . " 
 Gernet points out that disputes requiring arrest were mostly avoided or settled privately . Yet historian Patricia Ebrey states that legal cases in the Song period portrayed the courts as being overwhelmed with cases of neighbors and relatives suing each other over property rights . The Song author and official Yuan Cai ( 1140 – 1190 ) repeatedly warned against this , and like other officials of his time also cautioned his readers about the rise of banditry in Southern Song society and a need to physically protect self and property . 
 = = = Vengeance and vigilantism = = = 
 Chancellor Wang Anshi , also a renowned prose stylist , wrote a work on matters of state justice in the 11th century . Wang wrote that private interests , especially of those seeking vigilante justice , should in almost all circumstances never trump or interfere with public justice . In the ancient Classic of Rites , Rites of Zhou , and " Gongyang " commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals , seeking vengeance for a violent crime against one 's family is viewed as a moral and filial obligation , although in the Rites of Zhou state intervention between the instigating and avenging parties was emphasized . Wang believed that the state of Song China was far more stable than those in ancient times and abler to dispense fair justice . Although Wang praised the classic avenger Wu Zixu ( 526 – 484 BC ) , Michael Dalby writes that Wang " would have been filled with horror if Wu 's deeds , so outdated in their political implications , had been repeated in Song times . " For Wang , a victim exacting personal revenge against one who committed an egregious criminal act should only be considered acceptable when the government and its legal system became dysfunctional , chaotic , or ceased to exist . In his view , the hallmark of a properly functioning government was one where an innocent man was never executed . If this were to occur , his or her grieving relatives , friends , and associates should voice complaints to officials of ever increasing hierarchic status until grievances were properly addressed . If such a case reached the emperor — the last and final judge — and he decided that previous officials who heard the case had erred in their decisions , he would accordingly punish those officials and the original guilty party . If even the emperor for some reason made a fault in pardoning a party which was truly guilty , then Wang reasoned that the only explanation for a lack of justice was the will of heaven and its judgment which was beyond the control of mortal men . Wang insisted that submitting to the will of heaven in this regard was the right thing to do , while a murdered father or mother could still be honored through ritual sacrifices . 
 = = = Court cases = = = 
 Many Song court cases serve as examples for the promotion of morality in society . Using his knowledge and understanding of townsmen and farmers , one Song judge made this ruling in the case of two brawling fishermen , who were labeled as Pan 52 and Li 7 by the court : 
 Competition in Selling Fish <unk> in Assaults 
 A proclamation : In the markets of the city the profits from commerce are monopolized by itinerant <unk> , while the little people from the rural villages are not allowed to sell their wares . There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics . The men plow and the women weave . Their toil is extremely wearisome , yet what they gain from it is negligible , while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers . This sort , in tens and hundreds , come together to form gangs . When the villagers come to sell things in the market place , before the goods have even left their hands , this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them , assaulting them as a group . These idlers call this " the boxing of the community family . " They are not at all afraid to act outrageously . I have myself seen that it is like this . Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear ? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces ? Or is it produced by the rural farmers ? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages , how can they look at them in anger ? How can they bully and insult them ? Now , Pan Fifty @-@ two and Li Seven are both fishmongers , but Pan lives in the city and <unk> is his source of livelihood . Li Seven is a farmer , who does <unk> between busy times . Pan Fifty @-@ two at the end of the year has his profit , without having had the labor of raising the fish , but simply earning it from the selling of the fish . He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market . His lack of humanity is extreme ! Li Seven is a village rustic . How could he fight with the itinerant armed <unk> who hang around the marketplace ? Although no injuries resulted from the fight , we still must mete out some slight punishments . Pan Fifty @-@ two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod . In addition , Li Seven , although he is a village farmer , was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing . He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character . He must have done something to provoke this dispute . Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows , to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations . 
 = = = Early forensic science = = = 
 In the Song dynasty , sheriffs were employed to investigate and apprehend suspected criminals , determining from the crime scene and evidence found on the body if the cause of death was disease , old age , an accident , or foul play . If murder was considered the cause , an official from the prefecture was sent to investigate and draw up a formal inquest , to be signed by witnesses and used in court . The documents of this inquest also included sketches of human bodies with details of where and what injuries were inflicted . 
 Song Ci ( 1186 – 1249 ) was a Chinese physician and judge during the Southern Song dynasty . His famous work Collected Cases of Injustice <unk> was a basis for early forensic science in China . Song 's predecessor Shen Kuo offered critical analysis of human anatomy , dispelling the old Chinese belief that the human throat had three valves instead of two . A Chinese autopsy in the early 12th century confirmed Shen 's hypothesis of two throat valves : the esophagus and larynx . However , dissection and examination of human bodies for solving criminal cases was of interest to Song Ci . His work was compiled on the basis of other Chinese works dealing with justice and forensics . His book provided a list of types of death ( strangulation , drowning , poison , blows , etc . ) and a means of physical examination in order to distinguish between murder , suicide , or accident . Besides instructions on proper ways to examine corpses , Song Ci also provided instructions on providing first aid for victims close to death from hanging , drowning , sunstroke , freezing to death , and undernourishment . For the specific case of drowning , Song Ci advised using the first aid technique of artificial respiration . He wrote of examinations of victims ' bodies performed in the open amongst official clerks and attendants , a coroner 's assistant ( or midwife in the case of women ) , actual accused suspect of the crime and relatives of the deceased , with the results of the autopsy called out loud to the group and noted in the inquest report . Song Ci wrote : 
 In all doubtful and difficult inquests , as well as when influential families are involved in the dispute , [ the deputed official ] must select reliable and experienced coroner ’ s assistants and Recorders of good character who are circumspect and self @-@ possessed to accompany him . [ . . . ] Call a brief halt and wait for the involved parties to arrive . Otherwise , there will be requests for private favors . Supposing an examination is held to get the facts , the clerks will sometimes accept bribes to alter the reports of the affair . If the officials and clerks suffer for their crimes , that is a minor matter . But , if the facts are altered , the judicial abuse may cost someone his life . Factual accuracy is supremely important . 
 Song Ci also shared his opinion that having the accused suspect of the murder present at the autopsy of his victim , in close proximity to the grieving relatives of the deceased , was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions . In the earliest known case of forensic entomology , a villager was hacked to death with a sickle , which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim 's blood ; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon , the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot . 
 Although interests in human anatomy had a long tradition in the Western world , a forensic book such as Song Ci 's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro 's book in the 17th century . There have been several modern books published about Song Ci 's writing and translations of it into English . This includes W.A. Harland 's Records of Washing away of Injuries ( 1855 ) , Herbert Giles ' The Hsi Yuan Lu , or Instructions to Coroners ( 1924 ) , and Dr. Brian E. McKnight 's The Washing Away of Wrongs : Forensic Medicine in Thirteenth @-@ Century China ( 1981 ) .

 During the Song dynasty , for those without formal education , the quickest way to power and the upper echelons of society was to join the military . If a man had a successful career in the military and could boast of victorious battles , he had a sure path to success in politics . Exam @-@ drafted scholar @-@ officials came mostly from prominent families and could rely on their clan status to advance their careers and place in society . Many Song military officers did not have this advantage , and owed their status in society to the advantage that military power granted them . Many court eunuchs such as Tong Guan ( 1054 – 1126 ) were eager to enlist as officers in the central army since this was a means to elevate their position at court . 
 Ordinary soldiers were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers , while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military . Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars as belonging to one of the Four Occupations ; the scholar @-@ officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu ( violence ) . Even though the military examinations , rankings , and posts were parallel to those of the civil order , scholar @-@ officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated . Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground , scholar @-@ officials often commanded troops and wielded military power . Yet scholar @-@ officials were not at the apex of the military or even civilian order ; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor . The emperor 's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes , who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China 's superior wen ( culture and civilization ) . 
 = = = Catastrophe and reforms = = = 
 In the year 960 the Song military had 378 @,@ 000 enlisted soldiers . Around the turn of the 11th century its size had grown to 900 @,@ 000 soldiers , increasing to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 by the year 1022 , and well over 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 by 1041 . The overall expenses of upholding a military of this size consumed three @-@ quarters of the state 's entire annual revenue . To lessen the expense , in 1069 the Chancellor Wang Anshi created the institution of local militias as supporting units . In 1073 , Wang Anshi created a new bureau of the central government called the Directorate of Weapons , which supervised the manufacture of armaments and ensured quality control . 
 Despite the size of the army and these beneficial reforms , the high ranks of Song military command were heavily corrupt . At the beginning of the 12th century , Song generals collected funds based on the number of troops they recorded ; instead of using the funds to benefit troops , they used this money to bolster their own salaries . Troops of the standing army , meanwhile , were given very small salaries while assigned tasks of menial labor . The scholar @-@ officials running the government often paid little attention to the plight of soldiers and even to the demands of officers , since they were seen as being on a lower tier in society . Fairbank writes that the " civilian domination of the military was part of the ruling elite 's control of the state , but it left the state military weak . " 
 The corruption of the high command and ineffectiveness of military strength was soon revealed once the Song made a joint effort with the Jurchen people to conquer the Khitan Liao dynasty ( 916 – 1125 ) . After the successful rebellion of the Jurchens against their Khitan masters , the Jurchen observed the weakness of the Song army and broke their pact , then attacked the Song as well . By 1127 , the capital at Kaifeng was captured and northern China overrun , while the remnants of the Song court fled south to Hangzhou and established the Southern Song . This was a crucial blow to the Song military elites , as they had been closely tied to the political structure until 1127 ; afterwards they became alienated from the emperor and the Song court . Although they had lost northern China to the new Jurchen Jin dynasty ( 1115 – 1234 ) , this loss prompted the Song to make drastic and lasting military reforms . Emperor Gaozong , desperate to refill the decimated ranks of the central army , drafted men from all over the country . This had been done before , but not on the same scale . Only the most skilled soldiers became imperial guardsmen , while under Gaozong entire central army units were composed of soldiers from every region and background . The Southern Song eventually recovered their strength and commanded the loyalty of vaunted commanders such as Yue Fei ( 1103 – 1142 ) , who successfully defended the border at the Huai River . The Jurchens and Song eventually signed a peace treaty in 1141 . 
 In 1131 , the Chinese writer Zhang Yi noted the importance of employing a navy to fight the Jin , writing that China had to regard the sea and the river as her Great Wall , and use warships as its greatest watchtowers . Although navies had been used in China since the ancient Spring and Autumn period ( 722 – 481 BC ) , China 's first permanent standing navy was established by the Southern Song in 1132 . The Jurchen launched an invasion against the Southern Song along the length of the Yangtze River , which resulted in two crucial Song victories at the Battle of Caishi and Battle of Tangdao in 1161 . The Jin navy was defeated by the Song 's standing navy , which employed trebuchets on their ships ' top deckhouses to launch gunpowder bombs . 
 = = = Organization , equipment and techniques = = = 
 In the Song dynasty , infantry units were organized 50 men to a platoon , two platoons to a company , and those into battalions of 500 men each . During the Northern Song , half of the entire army of 1 million was stationed in and around Kaifeng . The remaining troops were posted in scattered forces along borders and near large municipalities , and in peacetime were used as means to maintain local security . Although the Song military was rife with corruption and largely ignored by civil officials , it did provide some valuable strengths to the empire . During the Song era , military drills and training were studied as a science , while elite soldiers were allocated different responsibilities based on examinations of their skills in weaponry and athletic ability . In their training , soldiers and officers were prepared for battle by following signal standards for troop movement , advancing when a flag or banner was raised , halting when the blaring sound of bells and drums rang out . 
 Song crossbowmen comprised their own separate units apart from the infantry , and according to the Chinese Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044 , the crossbow used in mass was the most effective weapon used against northern nomadic cavalry charges . Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long @-@ range snipers ; such was the case when the Liao general Xiao <unk> was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of <unk> in 1004 . Crossbows were mass @-@ produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on , such as the use of a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces . Song cavalry used an array of different weapons , including halberds , swords , bows , and fire lances that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel . In preparation for war , government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities , with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year , along with armor components by the tens of thousands . There were sixteen known varieties of catapults in the Song period , designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men . 
 Unlike many other Chinese dynasties throughout history , the Song dynasty did not model its military infrastructure and organization on the precedent of northern nomadic armies , such as the earlier Xianbei and later Mongols . Only twice in the Song era were non @-@ Chinese people employed in Song cavalry units : in the beginning of the dynasty with the campaigns of Emperor Taizu , and later 13th century Mongol defectors who came over to fight for the Song . With the Khitan and Tangut kingdoms possessing much of the pasture and grazing lands in the north , the Song military had a shortage of horses for cavalry . To make up for this shortage , statesmen like Wang Anshi advocated greater ties with Tibet , as the tea @-@ horse trade with Tibet was continued by the Ming dynasty . Still , the Song established considerably large navies : in the 10th century , in the war to reunite China , and then a standing navy in the 12th century . Many of the warships in the Song dynasty 's navy were paddle @-@ wheel driven crafts and some Song naval ships could carry up to 1 @,@ 000 soldiers . It was also during the Song period that naval ships were first armed with gunpowder weapons . The use of enormous pontoon bridges in the Song era on at least one occasion was essential to victory . The Song built a large floating bridge across the Yangtze River in 974 ; while troops were under attack , the pontoon bridge was used as a means of transport for troops and supplies to the other bank during the early Song conquest of the Southern Tang state . 
 = = Ethnic , foreign and religious minorities = = 
 Much like the multicultural and metropolitan atmosphere of the earlier Tang capital at Chang 'an , the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling foreigners and ethnic minorities . There was a great amount of contact with the outside world . Trade and tribute embassies from Egypt , Yemen , India , Korea , the Kara @-@ Khanid Khanate of Central Asia and elsewhere came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations , while the Chinese sent embassies abroad to encourage foreign trade . Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan , Champa in southern Vietnam , Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia , Bengal and South India , and the coasts of East Africa . 
 During the 9th century , the Tang seaport at Guangzhou had a large Muslim population . During the Song dynasty the importance of the latter seaport declined as the ports of Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian province eclipsed it . This was followed by a decline of Middle Eastern sea merchants in China and an increasing amount of Chinese ship owners engaging in maritime trade . However , Middle Eastern merchants and other foreigners were not entirely absent , and some even gained administrative posts . For example , the Muslim Pu Shougeng — of either Persian or Arab descent — served as the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between the years 1250 and 1275 . There was also the Arab astronomer Ma <unk> ( 910 – 1005 ) , who became the chief astronomer of the Song court under Taizu . Aside from these elites , Chinese seaports were filled with resident Arabs , Persians , and Koreans who had special enclaves designated for each of them . 
 Muslims represented the largest religious minority within Song China , although there were many others . There was a community of Kaifeng Jews who followed the exodus of the Song court to Hangzhou once the Jurchens invaded the north in 1126 . Manichaeism from Persia was introduced during the Tang ; during the Song , the Manichaean sects were most prominent in Fujian and Zhejiang . Nestorian Christianity in China had for the most part died out after the Tang dynasty ; however , it was revived during the Mongol invasions in the 13th century . Followers of Zoroastrianism still had temples in China as well . Prospects of studying Chinese Chan Buddhism attracted foreign Buddhists to China , such as <unk> Ben 'en ( <unk> ; 1201 – 1280 ) of Japan who studied under the eminent Chinese monk Wuzhun Shifan ( 1178 – 1249 ) before establishing <unk> @-@ ji in Kyoto . Tansen Sen states that Buddhist monks traveling from India to China and vice versa during the Song surpassed that of the Tang dynasty , while " Indian texts translated under the Song dynasty outnumbered those completed under the preceding dynasties . " 
 There were many native ethnic groups within Song China that did not belong to the Han Chinese majority . This included the Yao people , who staged tribal uprisings against the Song in Guangdong in 1035 and Hunan in 1043 , during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song ( r . 1023 – 1064 ) . Song authorities employed Zhuang people as local officials in what is now Guangxi and Guangdong , where the Song placed them in charge of distributing land to the Yao and other tribal groups . The Yao peoples and others on the empire 's frontier were incorporated into a feudal system , or <unk> <unk> , which Ralph A. <unk> says bypassed any possible native development of a primitive slave society , or <unk> <unk> , since the Yao and others lacked a sedentary tradition . Although mainland Chinese states made efforts to settle parts of Hainan Island since the 3rd century BC , it was not until the Song that a concerted effort was made to assimilate the Li people of its highlands , who at times had fought against and repelled Han Chinese settlers . During the 11th century , the Man people of Hainan wreaked havoc by joining bandit gangs of ten to several hundred men . The statesman Ouyang Xiu estimated in 1043 that there were at least several thousand Man bandits residing in a dozen or so prefectures of mainland China . 
 To counter powerful neighbors such as the Kingdom of Dali ( 934 – 1253 ) , the Song made alliances with tribal groups in southwest China which served as a protective buffer between their borders and Dali 's .

During the 1050s , the Song put down local tribal insurrections along their borders with the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt , while their relations with Tai peoples and alliances with local clan leaders in the southern frontier led to a border war with Lý from 1075 to 1077 .
